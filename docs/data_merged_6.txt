                                              Labrador Retriever, a breed of domestic dog

The dog is a canine mammal of the Order Carnivora. Dogs were first domesticated from wolves at least
12,000 years ago[1] but perhaps as long as 150,000 years ago based on recent genetic fossil evidence
                   [2]
and DNA evidence . In this time, the dog has developed into hundreds of breeds with a great degree of
variation. For example, heights at the withers range from just a few inches (such as the Chihuahua) to
roughly three feet (such as the Irish Wolfhound), and colors range from white to black, with reds, grays
(usually called blue), and browns occurring in a tremendous variation of patterns. Dogs, like humans, are
highly social animals and pack hunters; this similarity in their overall behavioral design accounts for
their trainability, playfulness, and ability to fit into human households and social situations. Dogs fill a
variety of roles in human society and are often trained as working dogs. For dogs that do not have
traditional jobs, a wide range of dog sports provide the opportunity to exhibit their natural skills. In
many countries, the most common and perhaps most important role of dogs is as companions. Dogs
have lived with and worked with humans in so many roles that their loyalty has earned them the
sobriquet "man's best friend." Conversely, some cultures consider dogs to be unclean. In other cultures,
some dogs are used as food.

Terminology
                                  Puppies engage in teething on almost anything.

Dog, in common usage, refers to the domestic dog, Canis lupus familiaris (originally classified as Canis
familiaris by Linnaeus in 1758, but reclassified as a subspecies of the wolf, Canis lupus, by the
Smithsonian Institution and the American Society of Mammalogists in 1993). The word is sometimes
used to refer collectively to any mammal belonging to the family Canidae (as in "the dog family"), such
as wolves, foxes and coyotes.

     ●   Dog is also a term used by breeders to specifically denote a male domestic dog.
     ●   Bitch is a female dog.
     ●   Pack is used to denote a group of dogs.
     ●   Puppy is a juvenile dog.
     ●   Pooch, Poochie, Dogay, Pup, Pupsie, Doggy, Doggie or Doglet are all informal and affectionate
         terms for a dog often used by children.
     ●   Canine in common usage is a synonym for dog or an adjective meaning dog; for example, in the
         common expression "canine companion".

Many additional terms are used for dogs that are not purebred; see Terms for mixed-breed dogs.


Physical characteristics
         Main articles: Dog anatomy

Although selective breeding has changed the appearance of many breeds, all dogs retain the basic
ingredients from their distant ancestors. Like most other predatory mammals, the dog has powerful
muscles, a cardiovascular system that supports both sprinting and endurance, and teeth for catching,
holding, and tearing. Its skeleton provides the ability to run and leap. They have small, tight feet, and
walk on their toes.

Intelligence
Among dog lovers, dogs are generally valued for their intelligence. Anecdotal evidence suggests that
dogs have a reasonably high intelligence. For a detailed discussion on what dog intelligence is, see dog
intelligence.
Diet

       See also: Dog health

Presently, there is academic discussion as to whether domestic dogs are omnivores or carnivores. The
classification in the Order Carnivora does not necessarily mean that a dog's diet must be restricted to
meat. Unlike an obligate carnivore, such as a cat, a dog is not dependent on meat protein in order to
fulfill its dietary requirements. Dogs are able to healthily digest a variety of foods including vegetables
and grains, and in fact can consume a large proportion of these in its diet. Wild canines not only eat
available plants to obtain key amino acids, but may also obtain nutrients from vegetable matter from the
stomach contents of their herbivorous prey. Domestic dogs can survive healthily on a reasonable and
carefully designed vegetarian diet, particularly if eggs and milk products are included. Some sources
suggest that a dog fed on a stict vegetarian diet may develop dilated cardiomyopathy since it lacks L-
         [3]
carnitine.

In the wild these diets are typically pursued in the absence of available meat. It has also been noted that
extremely stressful conditions, such as the Iditarod race and scientific studies of similar conditions,
suggest that high-protein diets including meat help prevent damage to muscle tissue. This research is
also true of other mammals.

Dogs sometimes eat grass, a harmless activity. Explanations abound, but rationales such as that it
neutralizes acid are just guesses. Eating grass might make the dog vomit, so one explanation is that dogs
eat grass to remove unwanted content from their stomachs.

Treats

Many dogs consider anything given to them directly by hand to be a treat, even the food they are
accustomed to at meal time. Such dogs might consider anything dropped by humans, including small but
indigestible objects (such as marbles, coins, rings, etc.), to be treats as well, which could be dangerous to
the dogs when ingested.

For a discussion on one use of treats in training, see clicker training.
Dangerous substances

Some foods commonly enjoyed by humans are dangerous to dogs, including chocolate (Theobromine
poisoning), onions, grapes and raisins, Macadamia nuts, and hops. Some human medications, such as
acetaminophen/paracetamol (Tylenol), are highly toxic to dogs.

Dogs also may find some poisons attractive, including antifreeze and snail bait.

Reproduction
Among professional breeders, dogs are only allowed to mate for a specific purpose. Sometimes dogs are
bred to create puppies to sell, or sometimes to carry on an award-winning purebred line. Breeders who
do this are usually experienced in this process. Dog breeders have access to records which allow them to
accurately guess which characteristics will "breed true" in a particular dog. Dog breeders also have
accurate information on the complexities of the reproductive process for the breed of dog that they are
accustomed to handling. Dog owners may accidentally allow their pets to breed without regard to
bloodlines.

Fertility

As with most domesticated species, one of the first and strongest effects seen from selective breeding is
selection for cooperation with the breeding process as directed by humans. In domestic dogs, one of the
behaviours that is noted is the abolition of the pair bond seen in wild canines. The ability of female
domestic dog to come into estrus at any time of the year and usually twice a year is also valued. The
amount of time between cycles varies greatly among different dogs, but a particular dog's cycle tends to
be consistent through her life. This is also called in season or in heat. Conversely, undomesticated
canine species experience estrus once a year, typically in late winter.

Menarche

Most bitches come into season for the first time between 6 and 12 months, although some larger breeds
delay until as late as 2 years. Like most mammals, the age that a bitch first comes into season is mostly a
function of her current body weight as a proportion of her body weight when fully mature. The different
rates of maturation are responsible for the menarche, not the chronological age.

Pregnancy and litters

A general rule of thumb is that a mammal will produce half as many offspring as the number of teats on
the mother. This rule is altered in domesticated animals since larger litters are often favoured for
economic reasons. Dogs bear their litters roughly 9 weeks after fertilization. An average litter consists of
about six puppies, though this number may vary widely based on the breed of dog. Since a mother can
only provide nutrients and care to a limited number of offspring, humans must assist in the care and
feeding when the litter exceeds approximately eight puppies. Some breeds have been developed to
emphasize certain physical traits beyond the point at which they can safely bear litters on their own. For
example, the Bulldog often requires artificial insemination and almost always requires cesarean section
for giving birth.

Spaying and neutering
Spaying or neutering refers to the removal of the male testicles or the female ovaries and uterus, in order
to remove the capability to procreate, and to kill the libido.

Dog experts advise that dogs not intended for further breeding should be spayed or neutered so that they
do not have undesired puppies. Unwanted puppies are abandoned, eaten, or sometimes disposed of in an
inhumane fashion. It is also common for adult stray dogs who are placed in animal shelters to be
euthanized due to lack of space and resources.

Spaying and neutering can also help prevent hormone-driven diseases such as breast cancer and prostate
cancer, as well as undesired hormone-driven behaviors. The hormonal changes involved are sure to
change the animal's personality somewhat, and some object to this angle as the sterilization in itself
could be carried out without the excision of organs.

Contrary to myth, it is not required for a female dog to either experience a heat cycle or have puppies
before spaying, and likewise, a male dog does not need the experience of mating before neutering; these
myths are responsible for numerous unnecessary health problems and unwanted puppies. A female dog
can become pregnant on her first heat cycle (which can take place as early as six months), and should be
kept away from intact male dogs, including littermates, over the age of 4 months. Many veterinarians
recommend that owners neuter/spay their pets around the age of 5 months.
Attributes
Modern dog breeds show more variation in size, appearance, and behavior than any other domestic
animal. Within the range of extremes, dogs generally share attributes with their wild ancestors, the
wolves. Dogs are predators and scavengers, possessing sharp teeth and strong jaws for attacking,
holding, and tearing their food.

Sight

                                                                                 1 2
Dogs were thought to be dichromats and thus, by human standards, color blind. , New research is now
being explored that suggests that dogs may actually see some colour, but not to the extent that humans
do. It has also been suggested that dogs see in varieties of purple/violet and yellow shades. Because the
lenses of dogs' eyes are flatter than humans', they cannot see as much detail; on the other hand, their
eyes are more sensitive to light and motion than humans' eyes. Some breeds, particularly the best
sighthounds, have a field of vision up to 270° (compared to 100° to 120° for humans), although broad-
                                                                                                  1, 2
headed breeds with their eyes set forward have a much narrower field of vision, as low as 180°.

Hearing

Dogs detect sounds as low as the 16 to 20 Hz frequency range (compared to 20 to 70 Hz for humans)
                                                                           2
and as high as 70,000 to 100,000 Hz (compared to 20,000 Hz for humans) , and in addition have a
degree of ear mobility that helps them to rapidly pinpoint the exact location of a sound. They can
identify a sound's location much faster than a human can, and they can hear sounds up to four times the
distance that humans can.

Scenting




                                 Dogs are predators suited to chasing after, leaping at, and killing prey.
(pictured: Weimaraner)

Dogs have nearly 220 million smell-sensitive cells over an area about the size of a pocket handkerchief
(compared to 5 million over an area the size of a postage stamp for humans). Some breeds have been
selectively bred for excellence in detecting scents, even compared to their canine brethren. Other than
the oversimplified obvious, i.e. chemical compounds that affect chemical sensors in the nose, what a dog
actually detects when he is scenting is not really understood; although once a matter of debate, it now
seems to be well established that dogs can distinguish two different types of scents when trailing, an air
scent from some person or thing that has recently passed by, as well as a ground scent that remains
detectable for a much longer period. The characteristics and behavior of these two types of scent trail
would seem, after some thought, to be quite different, the air scent being intermittent but perhaps less
obscured by competing scents, whereas the ground scent would be relatively permanent with respect to
careful and repetitive search by the dog, but would seem to be much more contaminated with other
scents. In any event, it is established by those who train tracking dogs that it is impossible to teach the
dog how to track any better than it does naturally; the object instead is to motivate it properly, and teach
it to maintain focus on a single track and ignore any others that might otherwise seem of greater interest
to an untrained dog. An intensive search for a scent, for instance searching a ship for contraband, can
actually be very fatiguing for a dog, and the dog must be motivated to continue this hard work for a long
period of time.

Direction and spatial sense

It has been observed that a lost dog can often find its way home, sometimes traveling over long distances.

Weather detection

Dogs also have the ability to sense inclement weather (mainly thunderstorms) many miles away. This is
due to their keen ability to detect fluctuations in barometric pressure and can explain a dog's anxiety
before and during a storm. The evolutionary ability of sensing weather can be traced back to when
wolves used it to move the pack into proper shelter before a dangerous storm.

Dog health
       Main articles: Dog health

Dogs are susceptible to various diseases, ailments, and poisons, some of which affect humans in the
same way, others of which are unique to dogs.

Diseases

Diseases commonly associated with dogs include rabies (hydrophobia), canine parvovirus, and canine
distemper, and pulmonic stenosis, although there are many others.

Parasites
Common external parasites are various species of fleas, ticks, and mites. Internal parasites include
hookworms, tapeworms, roundworms, and heartworms.

Common physical disorders

Some breeds of dogs are also prone to certain genetic ailments, such as hip dysplasia, luxating patellas,
cleft palate, blindness, or deafness. Dogs are also susceptible to the same ailments that humans are,
including diabetes, epilepsy, cancer, and arthritis. Gastric torsion and bloat is a dangerous problem in
some large-chested breeds.

Behavior




                                              Some dogs can be trained to retrieve

All dogs have a tremendous capacity to learn complex social behavior and to interpret varied body
language and sounds, and, like many predators, can react to and learn from novel situations. The
requirements of coordinating complex social behavior requires that canines have the ability to sense and
deliver a wide variety of cues via body language, more so than for even humans, who can use language
for the same purpose. Physiologically, this correlates with such features as a large number of nerves
innervating the facial muscles of dogs, allowing subtle control of a wide variety of facial expressions; in
contrast to cats, for instance, who have many fewer nerves governing their facial muscles, resulting in a
smaller repertoire or "vocabulary" of expressions. This ability to read and deliver nonverbal cues makes
dogs expert at reading human beings, as well, often even more so than other humans are, who rely on
language. Most dog owners have a large collection of stories about their dogs recognizing individuals by
their footsteps outside the door, and so on.

Interactions between Dogs and Humans

       Main articles: Dog society

The relationship between dogs and humans is rooted in history and dogs coexist with humans in a
variety of ways. Dogs thrive in small social groups or packs which, from their viewpoint, can include
humans. Dog society can be thought of as dog packs characterized by a companionate hierarchy, in
which each individual has a rank, and in which there is intense loyalty within the group. Dogs thrive in
human society because their relationships with humans mimic their natural social patterns. The dog is
always aware of its rank relative to other individuals in the group. An assertive dog may consider itself
the alpha animal, considering its human master to be subordinate.

Dogs as working partners

Many breeds of dogs, but not least German Shepherd, Labrador Retriever, and Border Collie are
commonly used as working dogs. There are service dogs, guard dogs, hunting dogs, and herding dogs.
Dogs have served as guides for the blind, as commandos, and have flown into outer space. Most modern
working dogs are put in positions which capitalize on their sensory or strength and endurance
advantages over normal humans. Dogs are also used for searching for or rescuing people and animals,
such as in avalanches, at disaster sites, and for missing people or pets.

Dogs as hunting and sporting partners

Many people compete with their dogs in a variety of dog sports, including agility, flyball, and many
others. This often strengthens the bond between human and dog, since they must trust one another in a
variety of environments and must learn how the other works and thinks.

Setters in particular have a long history as upland gun dogs. They have a native ability to discover and
"hold" upland game birds; to freeze them momentarily on the ground with their silent, elongated
pointing stance. Once the hunter approaches, at his command they will flush the birds to fly and for the
hunter to shoot at.

As water dogs, the retrievers are unsurpassed. They can spend long hours in a duck blind and, after the
hunter has fired at multiple ducks or geese, they can visually spot and remember the location of downed
birds. At command, they dive into the icy water, swim out and retrieve the birds one by one. They can
follow hand, verbal, and whistle commands at great distance as the hunter directs them to the downed
bird. They typically have large, gentle muzzles to mitigate any potential damage to the game.

When trained, beagles are particularly adept at chasing through thick briars and brush after rabbits.
Many hound breeds are excellent at treeing raccoons during hunting season.

Hunters with dogs report the satisfaction that the dogs seem to exhibit. Excitement is evident as they see
the hunters load weapons, take to the field, and begin the hunt.

Dogs as pets
                                     A 9 year old English Collie cross. Some say mongrels make the best
pets

Relationships between humans and dogs are often characterized by strong emotional bonds.
Consequently, dogs are popular as pets and companions, independent of any utilitarian considerations.
Many dog owners consider having unconditional acceptance from a friend who is always happy to see
them to be quite utilitarian, particularly if the dog also leads them to regular exercise. Empirically, dogs
are quite dependent on human companionship and may suffer poor health in its absence. Many dogs are
reported to have separation anxiety if their owner is away for an extended period of time.

Some research demonstrates that dogs are able to convey a depth of emotion not seen to the same extent
in any other animal; this is purportedly due to their closely-knit development with modern man, and the
survival-benefits of such communication as dogs became more dependent on humans for sustenance.

Nevertheless, it is often unwise to anthropomorphize the responses of dogs. Despite understandably
positive interpretations by dog owners, it is questionable whether these animals are truly capable of
feeling emotions on a human level. More research is needed to determine the intelligence level of dogs,
and the motivations behind their responses to their masters.

Attacks on humans and livestock

       Main articles: Dog attack

Humans have a tendency to anthropomorphize animals, particularly pets such as dogs, which are
generally portrayed as being "man's best friend". Animals are often given attributes such as "loyal",
"cute", and "guardian", but these all have the potential to lure people into a false sense of security.

After thousands of years of domestication and selective breeding for dogs whose aggression towards
humans goes no further than a ferocious bark that strongly indicates dislike of a human behavior, most
dogs are unlikely to attack people. However, their sharp teeth and claws can inflict injury in an attack; a
large dog can knock a human down. Provocation can range from something as seemingly innocuous as a
toddler pulling a dog's tail, in which case the dog might nip to discourage the behavior, to something
completely transparent to humans, such as an odor or a movement that sets a dog off, to blatant human
aggression or violence towards a dog, causing it to defend itself. There are hundreds of shades of
provocation that may or may not lead to an attack upon a human. Canine aggression upon humans is
ordinarily not tolerated, but any human aggression against an animal having formidable means of self-
defense is foolhardy in the extreme.

With formidable skills and weapons as hunters as well as large and unfussy appetites, dogs often menace
livestock and wildlife. In most jurisdictions, dogs are destroyed for killing other creatures, so dogs
should be prevented from any encounter with livestock or wildlife that might lead to a predatory
response. The same creatures that wolves, coyotes, and foxes attack as prey, especially sheep and
poultry, are similarly attractive prey to dogs.

Abandoned dogs

Wild dogs are shot by farmers in an effort to protect livestock. Bodies are sometimes tied to fences as
warning to other dogs, especially in rural United States and Canada. Abandoned domestic dogs who
become feral are particularly dangerous; they lack the survival skills of wild canines, as well as the
genetic and learned fear of the humans' world. Feral dogs often form predatory packs that attack
livestock and occasionally also prove dangerous to humans.

In the UK, it is illegal to kill dogs, even if they are on your private land; you are required to contact your
local Police Force, DogsTrust, or the local branch of the RSPCA, who will arrange its collection.

Ancestry and history of domestication




                                  This ancient mosaic, likely Roman, shows a large dog with a collar
hunting a lion.
Molecular systematics indicate that the domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris) descends from one or
more populations of wild wolves (Canis lupus). As reflected in the nomenclature, dogs are a subspecies
of wolf and are thus still able to interbreed.

The relationship between man and canine has deep roots. Wolf remains have been found in association
with hominid remains dating from 400,000 years ago. Converging archaeological and genetic evidence
indicate a time of domestication in the late Upper Paleolithic close to the Pleistocene/Holocene
boundary, between 17,000 and 14,000 years ago. Fossil bone morphologies and genetic analysis of
current and ancient dog and wolf populations have not yet been able to conclusively determine whether
all dogs descend from a single domestication event, or whether dogs were domesticated independently in
more than one location. Domesticated dogs may have interbred with local populations of wild wolves on
several occasions (so-called introgression).

The earliest dog fossils, two crania from Russia and a mandible from Germany, date from 13,000 to
17,000 years ago. Their likely ancestor is the large northern Holarctic wolf, Canis lupus lupus. Remains
of smaller dogs from Mesolithic (Natufian) cave deposits in the Middle East, dated to around 12,000
years ago, have been interpreted as descendants of a lighter Southwest Asian wolf, Canis lupus arabs.
Rock art and skeletal remains indicate that by 14,000 years ago, dogs were present from North Africa
across Eurasia to North America. Dog burials at the Mesolithic cemetery of Svaerdborg in Denmark
suggest that in ancient Europe dogs were valued companions.

Genetic analyses have so far yielded divergent results. Vilà, Savolainen, and colleagues (1997)
concluded that dogs split off from wolves between 75,000 and 135,000 years ago, while a subsequent
analysis by Savolainen et al. (2002) indicated a "common origin from a single gene pool for all dog
populations" between 40,000 and 15,000 years ago in East Asia. Verginelli et al. (2005), however,
suggest both sets of dates must be reevaluated in light of recent findings showing that poorly calibrated
molecular clocks have systematically overestimated the age of geologically recent events. On balance,
and in agreement with the archaeological evidence, 15,000 years ago is the most likely time for the wolf-
dog divergence.

Verginelli examined ancient DNA evidence from five prehistoric Italian canids carbon-dated to between
15,000 and 3,000 years old, 341 wolves from several populations worldwide, and 547 purebred dogs.
Their results indicate multiple independent origins of dogs and/or of frequent interbreeding between
early proto-dogs and wolves throughout a vast geographic range. The detailed history remains
unexplored and until further evidence is available, the following section on wolf ancestors must be
considered purely speculative.

Wolf ancestors

Although all wolves belong to the species Canis lupus, there are (or were) many subspecies that had
developed a distinctive appearance, social structure, and other traits. For example, the Japanese wolf and
the Eastern Timber Wolf posses different distinctive colouration, hunting and social structures.
The Indian Wolf is thought to have contributed to the development of more breeds of dogs than other
subspecies. Many of today's wild dogs, such as the dingo, the dhole and pariah dogs, are descended from
this wolf.

The Indian wolf is also thought to have bred with descendants of the European wolf to create the
Mastiffs and eventually leading to the development of such diverse breeds as the Pug, the Saint Bernard,
and the Bloodhound. The Tibetan Mastiff is an example of an ancient breed.

The European wolf, in turn, may have contributed many of its attributes to the Spitz dog types, most
terriers, and many of today's sheepdogs. The Chinese wolf is probably ancestor to the Pekingese and toy
spaniels, although it is also probable that descendants of the Chinese and European wolves encountered
each other over the millennia, contributing to many of the oriental toy breeds.

The Eastern Timber Wolf is a direct ancestor to most, if not all, of the North American northern sled dog
types. This interbreeding still occurs with dogs living in the Arctic region, where the attributes of the
wolf that enable survival in a hostile environment are valued by humans. Additionally, unintentional
crossbreeding occurs simply because dogs and wolves live in the same environment. The general
reproductive isolation which is required to define dogs and wolves as separate species is purely a result
of lack of opportunity, stemming from a general mutual unfamiliarity, suspicion, mistrust, and fear.

The phenotypic characteristic that distinguish a wolf from a dog are tenuous. Wolves typically have a
"brush tail" and erect ears. While some dog breeds possess one of these characteristics, they rarely
possess both.

Speed of domestication

Current research indicates that domestication, or the attributes of a domesticated animal, can occur much
more quickly than previously believed. Domestication of a wild dog may occur within one or two human
generations with deliberate selective breeding. It is also now generally believed that initial domestication
was not attained solely by human desire intervention but through mutual desire. Wild canines who
scavenged around human habitations received more food than their more skittish or fearful counterparts.
Canines who attacked people or their children were likely killed or driven away, while those more
friendly animals survived. Canines would have been beneficial by chasing away other vermin or
scavengers. With their sharp senses, they would also be valuable as an alarm against marauding
predators. The relationship is theorized to have developed in this way.

Dog breeds
There are numerous dog breeds, over 800 being recognized by various kennel clubs worldwide. As all
dog breeds have been derived from mixed-breed dog populations, the term "purebred" has meaning only
with respect to a certain number of generations. Many dogs, especially outside the United States and
Western Europe, belong to no recognized breed.

A few basic breed types have evolved gradually during the domesticated dog's relationship with man
over the last 10,000 or more years, but most modern breeds are of relatively recent derivation. Many of
these are the product of a deliberate process of artificial selection. Because of this, some breeds are
highly specialized, and there is extraordinary morphological diversity across different breeds. Despite
these differences, dogs are able to distinguish dogs from other kinds of animal.

The definition of a dog breed is a matter of some controversy. Some groups use a definition that
ultimately requires extreme inbreeding to qualify due to the low gene pool. Dogs that are bred in this
manner often end up with severe health or behavioural problems. Other organizations define a breed
more loosely, such that an individual may be considered of one breed as long as 75% of its parentage is
of that breed. These considerations come into play among breeders who enter their dogs in dog shows.
Even prize-winning purebred dogs sometimes possess crippling genetic defects due to inbreeding. These
problems are not limited to purebred dogs and can affect mixed-breed populations. The behavior and
appearance of a dog of a particular breed can be predicted fairly accurately, while mixed-breed dogs
show a broader range of innovative appearance and behavior.

In February 2004, the Canine Studies Institute in Aurora, Ohio, arranged recognized breeds of dogs into
ten categories.

Mixed-breed dogs or Mongrels are dogs that do not belong to specific breeds, being mixtures of two or
more in variant percentages. Mixed breeds, or dogs with no purebred ancestry, are not inherently
"better" or "worse" than purebred dogs as companions, pets, working dogs, or competitors in dog sports.
Sometimes mixed-breed dogs are deliberately bred, for example, the Cockapoo, a mixture of Cocker
Spaniel and Miniature Poodle. Such deliberate crosses may display hybrid vigor and other desirable
traits, but can also lack one or more of the desired traits of their parents, such as temperament or a
particular color or coat. However, without genetic testing of the parents, the crosses can sometimes end
up inheriting genetic defects that occur in both parental breeds. Deliberately crossing two or more breeds
is also a manner of establishing new breeds.

Neoteny in the rapid evolution of diverse dog breeds

This rapid evolution of dogs from wolves is an example of neoteny or paedomorphism. As with many
species, the young wolves are more social and less dominant than adults; therefore, the selection for
these characteristics, whether deliberate or inadvertent, is more likely to result in a simple retention of
juvenile characteristics into adulthood than to generate a complex of independent new changes in
behavior. This is true of many domesticated animals, including human beings themselves, who have
many characteristics similar to young bonobo. This paedomorphic selection naturally results in a
retention of juvenile physical characteristics as well. Compared to wolves, many adult dog breeds retain
such juvenile characteristics as soft fuzzy fur, round torsos, large heads and eyes, ears that hang down
rather than stand erect, etc.; characteristics which are shared by most juvenile mammals, and therefore
generally elicit some degree of protective and nurturing behavior cross-species from most adult
mammals, including humans, who term such characteristics "cute" or "appealing".

The example of canine neoteny goes even further, in that the various breeds are differently neotenized
according to the type of behavior that was selected.

    ●   Livestock guardian dogs retain the most juvenile characteristics: they stay close to home with
        their foster "litter" (which might include a flock of sheep), rather than going out hunting, they
        have almost no predatory behavior (which would be disastrous in the vicinity of such a natural
        prey stimulus as sheep), they respond to perceived threats with a lot of vocalization and attempts
        to alert and engage the dominant individuals in their "pack" (i.e. humans) whenever possible,
        engaging in actual combat only as a last resort. In addition, they retain very juvenile physical
        characteristics such as round bodies and heads, soft coats, ears that hang down, and so on, which
        do not elicit fear responses from the sheep in the way that an appearance similar to that of an
        adult wolf would. (Compare to the physical appearance of the border collie, a sheep herding dog,
        whose physical configuration is closer to that of an adult wild canine and who therefore has a
        greater capacity to frighten sheep into a desired pattern of movement, along with the more adult
        aggressive temperament to do so).
    ●   Gun dog breeds used in hunting—that is, pointers, setters, spaniels, and retrievers—have an
        intermediate degree of paedomorphism; they are at the point where they share in the pack's
        hunting behavior, but are still in a junior role, not participating in the actual attack. They identify
        potential prey and freeze into immobility, for instance, but refrain from then stalking the prey as
        an adult predator would do next; this results in the "pointing" behavior for which such dogs are
        bred. Similarly, they seize dead or wounded prey and bring it back to the "pack", even though
        they did not attack it themselves, that is, "retrieving" behavior. Their physical characteristics are
        closer to that of the mature wild canine than the sheepdog breeds, but they typically do not have
        erect ears, etc.
    ●   Scenthounds maintain an intermediate body type and behavior pattern that causes them to
        actually pursue prey by tracking their scent, but tend to refrain from actual individual attacks in
        favor of vocally summoning the pack leaders (in this case, humans) to do the job. This contrasts
        with sighthounds, who pursue and attack perceived prey on sight, and who maintain the mature
        canine body type with erect ears, lean bodies, and adult coats.
    ●   Terriers similarly have adult aggressive behavior, famously coupled with a lack of juvenile
        submission, and display correspondingly adult physical features such as erect ears, although
        many breeds have also been selected for size and sometimes dwarfed legs to enable them to
        pursue prey in their burrows.
    ●   The least paedomorphic behavior pattern may be that of the basenji, bred in Africa to hunt
        alongside humans almost on a peer basis; this breed is often described as highly independent,
        neither needing nor appreciating a great deal of human attention or nurturing, often described as
        "catlike" in its behavior. It too has the body plan of an adult canine predator.

Of course, dogs in general possess a significant ability to modify their behavior according to experience,
including adapting to the behavior of their "pack leaders"—again, humans. This allows them to be
trained to behave in a way that is not specifically the most natural to their breed; nevertheless, the
accumulated experience of thousands of years shows that some combinations of nature and nurture are
quite daunting, for instance, training whippets to guard flocks of sheep.

The anatomy of dogs varies tremendously from breed to breed, more than in any other animal species,
wild or domesticated. And yet there are basic physical characteristics that are identical among all dogs,
from the tiny Chihuahua to the giant Irish Wolfhound.


Physical characteristics
Like most predatory mammals, the dog has powerful muscles, a cardiovascular system that supports
both sprinting and endurance, and teeth for catching, holding, and tearing.

The dog's ancestral skeleton provided the ability to run and leap. Their legs are designed to propel them
forward rapidly, leaping as necessary, to chase and overcome prey. Consequently, they have small, tight
feet, walking on their toes; their rear legs are fairly rigid and sturdy; the front legs are loose and flexible,
with only muscle attaching them to the torso.

Although selective breeding has changed the appearance of many breeds, all dogs retain the basic
ingredients from their distant ancestors. Dogs have disconnected shoulder bones (lacking the collar bone
of the human skeleton) that allow a greater stride length for running and leaping. They walk on four
toes, front and back, and have vestigial dewclaws (dog thumbs) on their front and rear legs just like
monkeys' thumbs. In some cases these claws are missing due to surgery, the rear dewclaws sometimes
being removed to prevent the possibility of them being ripped off, or catching on something and
breaking, especially in dogs with loose dewclaws. This practice is illegal in some countries.

The dog's ancestor was about the size of a Dingo, and its skeleton took about 10 months to mature.
Today's toy breeds have skeletons that mature in only a few months, while giant breeds such as the
Mastiffs take 16 to 18 months for the skeleton to mature. Dwarfism has affected the proportions of some
breeds' skeletons, as in the Basset Hound.


Dog coats
               Coat colors range from pure white to solid black and many other variations.

               For a complete detailed list of dog colors and patterns, see Coat (dog).

Dogs exhibit a diverse array of coat textures, colors, and markings, and a specialized vocabulary has
evolved to describe them.

Originally, dogs all had dense fur with an undercoat and long muzzles and heads, although both of these
features have been altered in some of the more extremely modified breeds, such as the Mexican Hairless
Dog and the English Bulldog.

Color

One often refers to a specific dog first by coat color rather than by breed; for example, "a blue merle
Aussie" or "a chocolate Lab". Coat colors include:

    ●   Black: Usually pure black but sometimes grizzled.
    ●   Brown: From mahogany through very dark brown.
    ●   Red: Reminiscent of reddish woods such as cherry or mahogany; also tawny, chestnut, orange,
        rusty, liver, and red-gold.
    ●   Yellow: From pale cream to a deep yellowish-gold tan.
    ●   Gold: From pale apricot to rich reddish-yellow.
    ●   Gray: Pale to dark gray, including silver; can be mixed with other colors or various shades to
        create sandy pepper, pepper, grizzle, blue-black gray, or silver-fawn.
    ●   Blue: A dark metallic gray, often as a blue merle or speckled (with black).
    ●   Sable: Black-tipped hairs; the background color can be gold, silver, gray, or tan.
    ●   White: Distinct from albino dogs.

Pattern
                                 The Dalmatian's coat is one of the more widely recognized markings.

Coat patterns include:

    ●   Two-color coats, such as Black and tan, red and white. The coat has both colors but in clearly
        defined and separated areas; usually the top and sides are darker and lower legs and underside are
        the lighter color.
    ●   Tricolor: Consisting of three colors, usually black, tan, and white or liver, tan, and white.
    ●   Brindle: A mixture of black with brown, tan, or gold, usually in a "tiger stripe" pattern.
    ●   Harlequin: "Torn" patches of black on white.
    ●   Merle: Marbled coat with darker patches and spots of the specified color.
    ●   Particolor: Two-colored coat with the colors appearing in patches in roughly equal quantities.

Texture

Coat textures vary tremendously. Some coats make the dogs more cuddly and others make them
impervious to cold water. Densely furred breeds such as most sled dogs and Spitz types can have up to
600 hairs per inch, while fine-haired breeds such as the Yorkshire Terrier can have as few as 100, and
the "hairless" breeds such as the Mexican Hairless have none on parts of their bodies. The texture of the
coat often depends on the distribution and the length of the two parts of a dog's coat, its thick, warm
undercoat (or down) and its rougher, somewhat weather-resistant outer coat (topcoat, also referred to as
guard hairs). Breeds with soft coats often have more or longer undercoat hairs than guard hairs; rough-
textured coats often have more or longer guard hairs. Textures include:
                                 The German Wirehaired Pointer's coat demonstrates a rough texture.

    ●   Double-coated: Having a thick, warm, short undercoat (or down) that is usually dense enough to
        resist penetration by water and a stronger, rougher weather-resistant outer coat (topcoat), also
        referred to as guard hairs. Most other coat types are also double-coated.
    ●   Single-coated: Lacking an undercoat.
    ●   Smooth-coated: "Smooth" to the eye and touch.
    ●   Wire-haired: Also called broken-coated. The harsh outer guard hairs are prominent, providing
        excellent weather protection for hunting dogs such as the Border Terrier or Wirehaired Pointing
        Griffon.
    ●   Long-haired: Hair longer than an inch or so.
    ●   Short-haired: Hair around an inch or so long.
    ●   Corded coat: for example, see Puli


Parts of the body
A special vocabulary has been developed to describe the shapes of various body parts including the ears
and tail.

Ears
                                 The Basset Hound's ears are extremely long drop ears.

Dogs' ears come in a variety of sizes, shapes, lengths, positions on the head, and amounts and types of
droop. Every variation has a term, including:

    ●   Bat ear: Erect, broad next to the head and rounded at the tip.
    ●   Button ear: A smaller ear where the tip folds forward nearly to the skull, forming a V, as in the
        Jack Russell Terrier.
    ●   Cropped ear: Shaped by cutting; see docking.
    ●   Drop ear: An ear that folds and droops close to the head, such as most scent hounds'. Also called
        a pendant ear.
    ●   Natural: Like a wolf's.
    ●   Prick ear: Erect and pointed; also called pricked or erect.
    ●   Rose ear: A very small drop ear that folds back; typical of many sight hounds and the English
        Bulldog.
    ●   Semiprick ear: A prick ear where the tip just begins to fold forward, as in the Rough Collie.

Tails
                                 The Basenji's tail is tightly curled.

Like ears, tails come in a tremendous variety of shapes, lengths, amounts of fur, and tailsets (positions).
Among them:

    ●   Corkscrew: Short and twisted, such as a Pug's
    ●   Docked: Shortened by surgery or other method, usually two or three days after birth; see docking
    ●   Odd: Twisted, but not short. Uncommon. Tibetan Terriers have odd tails.
    ●   Saber: Carried in a slight curve like a saber
    ●   Sickle: Carried out and up in a semicircle like a sickle
    ●   Squirrel: Carried high and towards the head, often with the tip curving even further towards the
        head.
    ●   Wheel: Carried up and over the back in a broad curve, resembling a wheel.

Puppy Characteristics
Puppies often have characteristics that do not last beyond early puppyhood. Eye color often changes
from blue to its adult color as the puppy matures. The coat color may change: Kerry Blue Terrier
puppies have black coats at birth and change to blue with maturity, and Dalmatians are white and gain
their spots with age. The ear shape will also often change, especially with erect-eared breeds such as the
German Shepherd Dog which have soft ears at birth, but the cartilage strengthens with age.

It is not uncommon for puppies to have their ears cropped or straightened, tails docked, or in the case of
the Chow Chow, to have their eyefolds stitched back so that they can see. Many of these are done in
accordance with breed standards for many Kennel Clubs. Some countries like Italy have banned this
practice as an act of animal cruelty.

Temperature Regulation
A common misconception is that dogs do not sweat. Primarily, dogs regulate their body temperature in a
completely different way, through their tongue. That is why after a dog has been running or on a hot
day, its mouth will be seen wide open with the tongue hanging out. This form of cooling maximizes heat
lost while conserving moisture, because it carries heat from the hottest part of the body, the interior core
of the thorax, unlike sweating, which cools the already coolest part of the body, the skin—or in less
intuitive, more scientific terms, this higher efficiency of thermal loss relative to moisture conservation
arises because heat flow is proportional to temperature gradient. In addition, dogs effectively sweat
through the pads of their feet, since they are not furred. On a warm day and after exercise, a dog's
naturally wet footprints might be visible on a smooth floor.

Dogs possess a rete mirabile in the carotid sinus at the base of their neck, a complex of intermingled
small arteries and veins which acts as a heat exchanger to thermally isolate the head, containing the
brain, the most temperature-sensitive organ, from the body, containing the muscles, where most of the
heat is generated. The result is that dogs can sustain intense physical exertion over a prolonged time in a
hot environment, compared to animals which lack this apparatus; thus, a dog chasing a jackrabbit
through the desert may not be able to outrun the rabbit, but it can continue the chase until the rabbit
literally drops dead from overheating.

Dog breeding is the vocation of mating carefully selected specimens of the same breed to reproduce
specific, consistently replicable qualities and characteristics.




                                 Litters of puppies and their mothers should have clean, comfortable
bedding.

At its best, breeding is a blend of science and art. The skilled breeder has at least general knowledge of
genetics and health, and in-depth knowledge of the breed standard and conformation points of his
chosen breed. Most breeders are fiercely loyal to their dogs, and are concerned about each individual
animal.

At worst, breeding can be a slipshod enterprise in which the major concern is profit, with little regard to
the health and welfare of the dogs involved. These often take the form of so-called ‘backyard
breeders’ (the term for random or ignorant breeding conducted on a small scale), and ‘puppy mills’ or
‘puppy farms’ (larger businesses). It must be pointed out, however, that many excellent breeders run
small-scale programs in their homes, barns, or back yards, and there are profitable large-scale operations
run with knowledgeable staff and superlative veterinary care, so size and motive alone are not indicative
of the quality of the breeding program.

The birth of a litter of purebred puppies is recorded on a breed registry maintained by an all-breed
kennel club or a breed club. Such registries are not the exclusive province of show dogs, as is sometimes
thought; the clubs of working dogs also maintain records of their dogs’ lineage.
                                 A responsible breeder checks each puppy for health and conformation.

Requirements for the breeding of registered purebreds vary from club to club. Most breed clubs allow
for any registered puppy to be bred from once it reaches a suitable age. Some clubs maintain an adjunct
or limited register, for puppies of purebred parents not deemed to have the qualities for showing or
breeding, or who exhibit a fault. A few clubs, such as the Swiss breed club of the Greater Swiss
Mountain Dog, the Jack Russell Terrier Club of America and the Mini Foxie Club of Australia, Inc.
have additional, strict requirements for the certification of adult dogs before breeding.

Future of Breeding
Snuppy, the first cloned dog, shows that it is possible to produce a dog that is the genetic twin of another
dog, although it is still difficult and expensive to do so. It is possible that, in the future, it might be
possible, and some people might choose, to create a twin of their favorite pet or of an admired champion
dog rather than to adopt a dog or to wait for the outcome of a mating between two preferred parents. If
taken to an extreme, this would mean that people would be able to review photos of breed champions,
read their descriptions, and choose one to duplicate, which would be cloned on demand.

                                 This Chihuahua mix and Great Dane show the wide range of dog breed
sizes.

Dogs have been selectively bred for thousands of years. Initially the selections would have centred on
domestication and useful qualities such as hunting ability. Later, dogs were also selected to give
attractive and distinctive forms resulting in a vast variety of types. The point at which a new variety
becomes a breed can be difficult to decide. National kennel clubs often differ in their recognition of
breeds and rare breeds might not be recognised outside their home country. Usually, only dogs
recognized by a kennel club are eligible to compete in the club's dog shows and dog sports, although
many dog sports allow any healthy dog to compete regardless of the breed.

Many traditional dog breeds recognised by the main registries are said to be "purebred". Only
individuals whose parentage consists only of other purebred examples of the breed are regarded as part
of that breed. This concept has caused controversy both because of the difficulty of regulation and
because of the possible genetic consequences of a limited population. Recent work has been done to
genetically classify the various breeds, with some surprising results regarding the estimated age and
interrelations of the breeds.

Generally, before a type of dog is recognized as a breed, it must be shown that mating a pair of that type
always produces dogs that have the same characteristics as the parents, usually both in appearance and in
behavior. This is known as breeding true. There are many issues concerning what is considered breeding
true. For example, Flat-Coated Retrievers must always be black; however, yellow coats occur
occasionally in some litters. Kennel clubs do not recognize the yellow dogs as legitimate members of the
breed; some breeders will euthanize the puppies rather than risk having the dog grow up, breed, and
produce more of the undesired yellow color; more often, today, such dogs are neutered and placed in
homes as pets. As another example, a breeding pair of Belgian Shepherds of the Groenendael variety can
produce puppies of the Tervueren (brown) variety; the AKC considers the varieties to be different breeds
and, therefore, the brown puppies are invalid and undesirable dogs, whereas the CKC considers them
simply to be different varieties.

See selective breeding for a detailed discussion on open versus closed studbooks and some of the issues
concerning purebreds.

The domestic dog's health is possibly one of the best-studied areas in veterinary medicine, since the dog
has had such a long and close relationship with humans.

Diseases and ailments
Some diseases, ailments, and poisons are common to both humans and dogs; others are different.

Transferable diseases

Most diseases that affect dogs or humans are not transferable between the two species. There are some
exceptions of zoonoses:

    ●   Rabies, or Hydrophobia, is a usually fatal disease which can be transmitted to dogs or humans
        by the bite of an infected mammal, possibly a dog's, cat's, raccoon's, or bat's. Although rodents
        and similar small mammals can be infected with the disease artificially, they are generally not
        found infected in the wild; the current hypothesis is that they are not likely to survive any attack
        that would infect them. Animals with rabies suffer deterioration of the brain and tend to behave
        bizarrely and often aggressively, increasing the chances that they will bite another animal or a
        person and transmit the disease. Areas that are rabies-free, (usually islands) such as Britain,
        Ireland, Australia, and the American state of Hawaii have strict quarantine laws to keep their
        territories rabies-free. These require long periods of isolation and observation of imported
        animals, which makes them unattractive places to move with a pet unless the pet is quite young.
        Areas that are not rabies-free usually require that dogs (and often cats) be vaccinated against
        rabies. A person or dog bitten by an unknown dog (or other animal) should always be treated
        without waiting for symptoms, given the potentially fatal consequences of a rabid biter: there has
        been only one case of someone surviving rabies when treatment was not begun until after
        symptoms appeared. The biter should be apprehended if possible, as only autopsy of the brain
        can determine if it was rabid. This should be a great incentive to dog-owners to vaccinate their
        dogs even if they feel the risk of their dog contracting rabies is low, since vaccination will
        eliminate the need for their dog to be euthanized and examined in this fashion should it bite
        anyone or be suspected of biting anyone. This applies to dogs that are showing neurological signs
        at the time of the bite. Unvaccinated healthy dogs need to be confined for ten days from the time
        of the bite (at home or at a veterinarian depending on state law). If the dog is not showing signs
        of rabies at the end of ten days, then the bitten person could not have been exposed to rabies.
        Dogs and cats do not have the rabies virus in their saliva until a few days prior to showing
        symptoms. Ten day confinement does not apply to other species. A dog or cat bitten by a wild
        animal in an area known to have rabies should be confined for six months, because it can take
        that long for symptoms to start.
    ●   Parasites, particularly intestinal worms such as hookworms, tapeworms and roundworms, can be
        transmitted in a dog's feces. Some tapeworms have fleas as intermediate hosts: the worm egg
        must be consumed by a flea to hatch, then the infected flea must be ingested (usually by the dog
        while grooming itself, but occasionally by a human through various means) for the adult worm to
        establish itself in the intestines. The worm's eggs then pass through the intestines and adhere to
        the nether regions of the dog, and the cycle begins again.
    ●   Fleas and ticks of various species can be acquired and brought home by a dog, where they can
        multiply and attack humans (and vice versa). This is particularly important, now that tick-borne
        Lyme Disease has become endemic throughout a large area, in addition to other similar diseases
        such as Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever. Although dogs do not seem to be as susceptible to such
        diseases as humans, similar rickettsial diseases have been spread by dogs to humans through such
        mechanisms as a dog killing an infected rabbit, then shaking itself off in the house near enough to
        its owners to fatally infect most of the family.
    ●   Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease that affects humans and animals. It is caused by bacteria of the
        genus Leptospira. Humans and dogs become infected through contact with water, food, or soil
        containing urine from infected animals. This may happen by swallowing contaminated food or
        water or through skin contact, especially with mucosal surfaces, such as the eyes or nose, or with
        broken skin.

Genetic ailments

Genetic conditions are a problem in some dogs, particularly purebreeds:

    ●   Hip dysplasia primarily affects larger breeds.
    ●   Luxating patellas can be a problem for smaller breeds.
    ●   Genes for blindness or deafness seem to be carried by some breeds.
    ●   In some dogs, such as collies, the blue merle or harlequin coloring is actually the heterozygote of
        a partially recessive gene preventing proper development of the nervous system; therefore, if two
        such dogs are mated, on the average one quarter of the puppies will have severe genetic defects in
        their nervous systems and sensory organs ranging from deafness to fatal flaws.

Parasites
Several types of parasites are commonly associated with dogs:

    ●   Intestinal worms cause varying degrees of discomfort.
    ●   Heartworm is a dog parasitoid. It is hard to eliminate and can be fatal; prevention, however, is
        easily achieved using medication.
                As the name suggests, an infected mosquito injects a larva into the dog's skin, where it
                migrates to the circulatory system and takes up residence in the pulmonary arteries and
                heart, growing and reproducing to an alarming degree. The effects on the dog are quite
                predictable, cardiac failure over a year or two, leading to death. Treatment of an infected
                dog is difficult, involving an attempt to poison the healthy worm with arsenic compounds
                without killing the weakened dog, and frequently does not succeed. Prevention is much
                the better course, via heartworm pills which are fed to the dog and contain a compound
                which kills the larvae immediately upon infection without harming the dog. Often they are
                available combined with other parasite preventives.

    ●   Fleas and ticks are common parasites for which there are many effective preventive measures.
    ●   Various mites cause skin problems such as mange.

Poisons

Dangerous foods

Some foods commonly enjoyed by humans are dangerous to dogs:

    ●   Dogs love the flavor of chocolate, but chocolate in sufficient doses is lethally toxic to dogs (and
        horses and possibly cats). Chocolate contains theobromine, a chemical stimulant that, together
        with caffeine and theophylline, belongs to the group of methylxanthine alkaloids. Dogs are
        unable to metabolize theobromine effectively. If they eat chocolate, the theobromine can remain
        in their bloodstreams for up to 20 hours, and these animals may experience fast heart rate,
        hallucinations, severe diarrhea, epileptic seizures, heart attacks, internal bleeding, and eventually
        death. A chocolate candy bar can be sufficient to make a small dog extremely ill or even kill it.
        Approximately thirty grams of baking chocolate per kilogram (1/2 ounce per pound) of body
        weight is enough to be poisonous. In case of accidental intake of chocolate by especially a
        smaller dog, contact a veterinarian or animal poison control immediately; it is commonly
        recommended to induce vomiting within two hours of ingestion. Large breeds are less susceptible
        to chocolate poisoning, but still are far less tolerant of the substance than humans are.

               Note:Carob treats are often available as dog treats; these are unrelated to chocolate and are
               safe.

    ●   It has recently been confirmed that grapes and raisins can cause acute renal failure in dogs. The
        exact mechanism is not known, nor any means to determine the susceptibility of an individual
        dog. While as little as one raisin can be fatal to a susceptible ten pound dog, many other dogs
        have eaten as much as a pound of grapes or raisins at a time without ill effects. The dog usually
        vomits a few hours after consumption and begins showing signs of renal failure three to five days
        later.
    ●   Onions and to a significantly lesser extent garlic contain thiosulfate which causes hemolytic
        anemia in dogs (and cats). Thiosulfate levels are not affected by cooking or processing. Small
        puppies have died of hemolytic anemia after being fed baby food containing onion powder.
        Occasional exposure to small amounts is usually not a problem, but continuous exposure to even
        small amounts can be a serious threat.
    ●   Macadamia nuts can cause stiffness, tremors, hyperthermia, and abdominal pain. The exact
        mechanism is not known. Most dogs recover with supportive care when the source of exposure is
        removed.
    ●   Alcoholic beverages pose much the same temptation and hazard to dogs as to humans. A drunk
        dog displays behavior pretty much analogous to that of an intoxicated person. (However, beer
        presents another problem; see below.)
    ●   Hops, the plant used to make common beer, can cause malignant hyperthermia in dogs, usually
        with fatal results. Certain breeds, such as Greyhounds, seem particularly sensitive to hop toxicity,
        but hops should be kept away from all dogs. Even small amounts of hops can trigger a potentially
        deadly reaction, even if the hops are "spent" after use in brewing.
    ●   Some dogs have food allergies much as humans do; this is particular to the dog and not
        characteristic of the species as a whole. An example is a dog vomiting whenever he eats salmon;
        many humans likewise have seafood allergies.

Contact your veterinarian or the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center in case of possible exposure.

Coprophagia




                                             A treat of ice cream could make this dog sick.

Many dogs have a fondness for eating feces. Some consume their own or other dogs' feces; others seem
to prefer cat feces (which, due to the feline digestive system, are high in protein and consumed by many
animals in the wild), and will raid a kitty litter box for "treats." This can be unsafe for the dog's health if
the animal producing the feces has any diseases or parasites or has recently ingested drugs that might be
poisonous. For more information, see coprophagia.


Feeding habits and obesity
Feeding table scraps to a dog is generally not recommended, at least in excess. Dogs get ample correct
nutrition from prepared dogfood. Otherwise, just as in humans, their diet must consist of the appropriate
mix of vegetables, carbohydrates, and proteins, with the appropriate mix to provide all of the minerals
and vitamins that they need. A human diet is not ideal for a dog; in addition, the scraps often consist of
fat rather than meat protein, which is no better for dogs than it is for humans. Lastly, many people
overfeed their dogs by giving them all the table scraps that the dogs will eat—which is usually all the
table scraps they are fed, which is often too much food.




                                    This Australian Cattle Dog's obesity poses a health risk for the dog.

The result of too much food is obesity, an increasingly common problem in dogs, which can cause
numerous health problems just as it can in humans, although dogs are much less susceptible to the
common cardiac and arterial consequences of obesity than humans are.

Additionally, the feeding of table scraps directly from the table (as opposed to taking scraps after the
meal, and giving them in the dog's food dish as a treat) can lead to trained begging behavior on the part
of the dog, or even encourage the dog to reach up and take food directly from the table. These are
normally seen as undesirable behavioral traits in a dog.

Common household chemicals

Some common household chemicals are particularly dangerous to dogs:

     ●   Antifreeze, due to its sweet taste, poses an extreme danger of poisoning to a dog (or cat) that
         either drinks from a spill or licks it off its fur. The antifreeze itself is not toxic, but is metabolized
         in the liver to a compound which causes kidney failure, and eventual seizures, and death. By the
         time symptoms are observed, the kidneys are usually too damaged for the dog to survive so
         acting quickly is important. Immediate treatment is to administer apomorphine or peroxide
       solution in an effort to get the animal to vomit up as much of the antifreeze as possible. Next, it is
       critical to immediately getting the animal to a veterinarian. Fomepizole (Antizol Vet® by Orphan
       Medical) is considered the preferred treatment for treating ethylene glycol toxicoses in dogs.
       Ethanol can also be used in cats and dogs, however it does have several unfavorable side effects.
       Ethanol occupies the enzymes in the dog's liver, long enough for the unmetabolized antifreeze to
       be passed out harmlessly through the kidneys. Dogs should not be allowed access to any place in
       which an antifreeze leak or spill has happened until the spill is completely cleaned out. Even a
       very small amount such as a tablespoon can easily prove fatal. Some brands of antifreeze that
       contain propylene glycol instead of ethylene glycol are marketed as being less harmful or less
       attractive to animals.

Additional health information
Dogs are susceptible to various diseases; similarly to humans, they can have diabetes, epilepsy, cancer,
or arthritis. Other diseases are more specific to canines.

Bloat and gastric torsion

Breeds with deep chests and narrow waists, such as the Bouvier des Flandres or Doberman Pinscher, for
instance, are susceptible to a syndrome of gastric torsion and bloat, where the stomach twists on its
supporting ligaments, sealing off the exits, and the contents begin to generate gas pressure which is not
only terribly painful (as can be imagined by anyone who has experienced even mild gas pains), but kills
large areas of stomach tissue fairly quickly, resulting in a painful death within a very few hours. A
similar disease is seen in cattle and horses; and a similar home remedy has sometimes been effective
when a veterinarian is not at hand, i.e. puncturing the stomach from outside with a sharp object to relieve
the pressure. Obviously, such a remedy must only be attempted as a last resort. Dogs who have
experienced such an attack are very susceptible to another which is usually more severe, and this is one
case where the most medical intervention usually proves the best choice, normally involving abdominal
surgery to tack the dog's stomach down in several places to prevent recurrence.

Vertigo

Elderly dogs are susceptible to an unusual form of intense vertigo, the cause of which is unknown; the
affected dog is unable to stand up and remains sprawled on the floor, the eyes displaying intense
nystagmus, for typically a few days. While terrifying in appearance, owners often fearing that the dog
has had a fatal stroke (which is actually uncommon in dogs), the vertigo passes within a few days and by
the end of a week the dog is staggering around upright, and within another week there is no evidence
that anything at all had happened. The only risk of the disease is that the dog is unable to eat or drink in
that condition, and must receive supportive therapy of intravenous fluids and nutrition; a light sedative is
usually also administered, as the dog naturally seems terrified during the experience.

In a dog show, judges familiar with specific dog breeds evaluate individual dogs for how well they
conform to published breed standards, hence the more accurate term is conformation show (or,
sometimes, breed show).

"Dog show" is often used by the general public to refer to any event involving dogs, such as dog sports,
but in the dog world it more specifically refers to conformation competitions.




                                 Handlers set up their dogs for judging so that their stance is perfect
when the judge views them.

Judging and winning at dog shows
       For winning in working dog trials and dog sports, see the individual articles, a listing of which
       can be found at List of dog sports.

Judging

Dog-show judges attempt to identify dogs who epitomize the published standards for each breed. This
can be challenging, because some judgements must necessarily be subjective. For example, what exactly
entails a "full coat" or a "cheerful attitude", which are descriptions that could be found in the breed
specifications.
Strictly speaking, a dog show is not exactly a comparison of one dog to another, it is a comparison of
each dog to a judge's concept of the ideal specimen as dictated by the breed standard, containing the
attributes of a given breed and a list of conformation points. Based on this, one dog is placed ahead of
another. All-breed judges must therefore have a vast amount of knowledge, and the ability (or inability)
of humans to retain all these details mentally for hundreds of breeds (and to maintain their objectivity
despite their personal preferences) is the subject of intense debate, particularly from the fanciers of
working dogs. Politics in the purebred dog world can be as vicious as in any other arena; there have been
charges of favoritism, nepotism, bribery and even drugging of competitors' animals.

The judge is supposed to remain free from bias on several counts. A canine judge must, for example,
disregard personal or public notions about what a cute or good-looking dog is, and judge strictly to the
standard. Judges must also assess specimens of all breeds objective, regardless of personal favourites. In
some breeds, the males and females of the breed have decidedly different appearances, and it is often the
males who have the quintessential look of the breed. The judge must set personal preference asided and
decide objectively whether the bitch is a better example of the female of the breed than the dog is an
example of the male.

Winning

Winning at dog shows differs in many countries. Dogs shown in the United States, for example, have
different championship requirements than those in other countries.

Dogs compete at dog shows to earn points towards the title of Champion. Each time a dog wins at some
level of a show, it earns points towards the championship. The number of points varies depending on
what level within a show the win occurs, how many dogs are competing, and whether the show is a
major (larger shows) or minor (smaller shows).

Dogs compete in a hierarchical fashion at each show, where winners at lower levels are gradually
combined to narrow the winners until the final round, where Best in Show is chosen.

At the lowest level, dogs are divided by breed. Each breed is divided into classes based on sex and age.
Dogs (males) are judged first, in their age classes. Within one breed, there are puppies (dogs under a
certain age), mature male dogs (subdivided by age into junior, limit (or intermediate) and open); bitches
(female dogs) have corresponding classes.

The winners of all classes in each sex (called Puppy Dog, Limit Dog etc.) compete for Challenge (best)
Dog and Challenge Bitch; the individuals who will challenge each other for the accolade Best of Breed.
The remaining class winners are joined by the runner-up from the class from which the challenge winner
was selected and there are competitions for second place in each gender, called Reserve Challenge Dog
and Reserve Challenge Bitch. This is for fairness, as one class may contain a stronger field of specimens
of the breed. If the judge believes that this is the case, the Challenge Dog and Reserve Challenge Dog,
for example, may both be from the same class.

From the two finalists (Challenge Dog and Challenge Bitch) is selected Best of Breed. The runner-up is
deemed Best of Opposite Sex (or Runner-up to Best of Breed). There is then a run-off in which the
second best individual in the gender of the winner (the Reserve Challenge) is brought back to stand
against the Best of Opposite Sex (the Challenge who did not win) for the title of Reserve Best of Breed.
So, if the Best of Breed is the Challenge Bitch, the Reserve Best of Breed may be the Challenge Dog or
the Reserve Challenge Bitch.

In multi-breed and all-breed shows, the winners of all breeds within the kennel club's breed groupings
then compete. So, for example, all the Terrier Group breed winners compete to determine Best Terrier
(sometimes called Best in Group). These are known as the General Specials.

The audience at a dog show is expected to be participatory and vocal, and often applaud the silkiest,
fluffiest or more popular breeds while ignorant of the breed requirements. Those who are owners and
breeders may cheer for a popular handler or a sympathetic favourite from a particular breeding kennel;
the judge is supposed to ignore all attempts to influence the decision.

Finally, the winners from each group compete for Best in Show.

Note: This describes the Australian model; there may be differences in other countries.

Dog shows in the UK
There are several types of show in the UK. The smallest are the Companion Shows, where there are
usually a few conformation classes for pedigree dogs, and several "novelty" classes, such as waggiest
tail and handsomest dog, which are open to any dog including crossbreeds. These shows are usually held
to support a charity or other good cause.

Then there are Open shows, which are open only to dogs registered with the Kennel Club. There are
many Open Shows that are held all around the country. Here the dog & handler can gain experience and
the dog can gain points towards a Junior Warrant award or a Show Certificate of Merit.

There are also Limited shows, which are open only to members of the Society or Club running the show,
and Challenge Certificate winners (see below) cannot enter.

Finally, there are the huge Championship shows, where dogs can gain points towards a Junior Warrant
and compete for the highly coveted Challenge Certificate (CC). If the breed is sufficiently numerous, the
Kennel Club awards a Challenge Certificate for the Best Dog and Best Bitch. A dog needs three CCs
from three different judges to be awarded the title of Champion one of which must be awarded when the
dog is over 12 month old. The most prestigious Championship show is Crufts, and each dog entered at
Crufts has had to qualify by certain wins at Championship or Open show level.

Championship titles and registered names
A dog who has earned the Championship title is entitled to use the designation "Champion" (or "Ch") in
front of his name, for example, Ch. Emerald's Brightest Sparkle.

Show dogs have a registered name, that is, the name under which they are registered as a purebred with
the appropriate kennel club, and a call name, which is how their owners talk to them.

The registered name often refers directly or indirectly to the kennel where the dog was bred; kennel
clubs often require that the breeder's kennel prefix form the first part of the dog's registered name. See
registered name for a discussion of dogs' names.


Prestigious dog shows
Dog shows take place all year in various locations. Some are small, local shows, while others draw
competitors from all around the country or the world. Some shows are so large that they limit entries
only to dogs who have already earned their Championships. Therefore, winning Best in Breed or Best in
Show can elevate a dog's, a breeder's, or a kennel's reputation to the top of the list overnight. This greatly
increases the value of puppies bred from this dog or at the dog's kennel of origin.

Probably the two best-known, largest, and most prestigious annual dog shows are the Westminster
Kennel Club Dog Show and Crufts.

History of dog showing
The control of points awarded to dogs in most countries is maintained by a national pedigree registry in
that country. The Kennel Club of Great Britain is generally recognized as one of the first organizations,
if not the first, to register purebred dogs. A second historic registry is the American Kennel Club.
France, Italy, and other countries began to maintain important kennel club registries in the 19th century.

Establishing and maintaining a separate breed of dog and, therefore, separate breeding stock and
separate registries, from the 14th to 21st century, was not always only a matter of looks or fashion. Dogs
have been man's partner for thousands of years. Centuries ago, owners required certain skills and
behaviors of some dogs, and many breeds that are recognized today reflect the different jobs that owners
historically required dogs to do. A man living in the desert might have needed a dog that could run in
sand and last a few days without water or food--that would probably mean a dog with large paws, like a
camel, and a very sparse coat to deal with the heat. A man living in polar regions might need a dog that
could swim icy waters, run in ice and snow, and survive that region, which would likely mean a lot of
coat and a sturdier frame to survive swimming and plodding through snow.

Today, there are dogs who will search the ruins of a bombed building or an avalanche in an effort to find
survivors; others assist the blind or the disabled; still others serve as a first defense line to sniff out
bombs or drugs. These dogs can do these jobs because they preserve traits historically required of dogs
for performing their jobs. A dog standard is a blueprint that describes the physical attributes that a dog
breed must have to do its job.

Dog sports are activities that involve dogs.




                                  Training a retrieve in Schutzhund, a dog sport.

There is much discussion about what exactly defines a sport for dogs. Some issues:

     ●   If a human companion isn't actively involved, is it actually a sport? Take greyhound racing, for
         example, or hunting from, say, a duck blind, from which the dog retrieves the game.
     ●   Is any activity a sport? For example, a conformation show, where the handler and dog walk or
         trot around a ring for a judge to evaluate the dog's appearance and structure.

This list is intended only to represent anything that anyone is likely to refer to as a dog sport, not to
argue its validity as sport. Clearly, there are more sports to add to this list:

     ●   Agility
     ●   Bikejoring
     ●   Canicross
     ●   Carting
     ●   Dog packing
     ●   Earthdog trials (or go to ground trials; see American Working Terrier Association and List of
         earth dog links)
    ●   Field trials
    ●   Flyball
    ●   Frisbee dog
    ●   Musical freestyle
    ●   Mushing
    ●   Obedience training
    ●   Protection sports (including Schutzhund and Ring sports)
    ●   Pulka
    ●   Scootering
    ●   Sled dog racing
    ●   Skijoring
    ●   Sheepdog trials
    ●   Sighthound racing, including Greyhound racing, coursing, and lure coursing

Dog training is the process of teaching a dog to exhibit certain desired behaviors in specific
circumstances. Some examples are:

    ●   Teaching a dog basic obedience commands (part of obedience training)
    ●   Teaching a dog to perform tricks casually or for circus acts
    ●   Teaching a guide dog to lead the blind
    ●   Teaching a rescue dog to find victims of a disaster
    ●   Helping a hunting dog learn to perform its instinctive behaviors at appropriate times

The specific behaviors taught in each case are different, but the underlying principles are similar.

In the wild as pack animals, canines have natural instincts that favor training. These instincts are
manifested when the dog lives with humans as a desire to please a handler, as a dog would please senior
members in a pack in the wild. The handler is simply whoever is working with a dog at the time.

Basic training
Most dogs, no matter their advanced training or intended purpose, live with people and therefore must
behave in a way that makes them pleasant to have around and for their own safety and that of other
people and pets. For the happiness of both the dog and the owner, basic obedience is enforced through
the training procedure.

Age for early training

Dog training begins virtually at birth. Dogs that are handled and petted by humans regularly during the
first eight weeks of life are generally much more amenable to being trained and living in human
households. Ideally, puppies should be placed in their permanent homes between about 8 and 10 weeks
of age. In some places it is against the law to take puppies away from their mothers before the age of 8
weeks. Before this age, puppies are still learning tremendous amounts of socialization skills from their
mother. Puppies are innately more fearful of new things during the period from 10 to 12 weeks, which
makes it harder for them to adapt to a new home.

Puppies can begin learning tricks and commands as early as 8 to 12 weeks of age; the only limitations
are the pup's stamina, concentration, and physical coordination. It is much easier to live with young dogs
that have already learned basic commands such as sit. Waiting until the puppy is much older and larger
and has already learned bad habits makes the training much more difficult.

Basic training classes

Professional "dog trainers" usually do not train the dogs, but actually train the owners how to train their
own dogs. It is crucial for the owner and the dog to attend class together, to learn more about each other
and how to work together. Training is most effective if everyone who handles the dog takes part in the
training to ensure consistent commands, methods, and enforcement.

Formal training in classes is not always available until the puppy has completed all its vaccinations at
around 4 months; however, some trainers might offer puppy socialization classes in which puppies can
enroll immediately after being placed in their permanent homes as long as disease risk is minimal and
puppies have receieved initial vaccinations. In most cases, basic training classes accept only puppies
who are at least 3 to 6 months old.

Communicating with the dog
Fundamentally, dog training is about communication. The handler is communicating to the dog what
behaviors are correct in what circumstances. A successful handler must also understand the
communication that the dog sends to the handler. The dog can signal that he is unsure, confused,
nervous, happy, excited, and so on. The emotional state of the dog is an important consideration in
directing the training.

There are a four important messages that the handler can send the dog:

Reward marker
       Correct behavior. You have earned a reward. This can be signaled with treats, toys, praise, or
       simply a release command such as "Free" or "OK".
Bridge
       Correct behavior. Continue and you will earn a reward. "Good"
No reward marker
       Incorrect behavior. Try something else. "Uh-uh" or "Try again"
Punishment marker
       Incorrect behavior. You have earned punishment. Punishments vary, and range from a simple
       "No" to some kind of physical correction.
These messages do not have to be communicated with words. Dogs are not born understanding these
messages. They must be taught. Other signals can be used. In particular, clickers are frequently used for
the reward marker. It is critical that the signals or words used for these messages are used with absolute
consistency. If the handler sometimes says "good" as a reward marker and sometimes as a bridge, it is
difficult for the dog to know when he has earned a reward. The handler must always reward the dog in
some manner after using the reward marker, treat, play, praise, etc. Failure to reward after the reward
marker diminishes the value of the reward marker and makes training more difficult.

For example, consider one method of teaching a dog to down on command. The handler puts some food
in his hand and puts his closed hand on the ground in front of the dog. When the dog lies down, the
handler says "free" and opens his hand rewarding the dog. Once the dog has this concept the handler
puts a command with the behavior. The handler says "down", waits a beat, then puts his closed hand on
the floor. If after a bit the dog does not lie down, the handler says "uh-uh" waits for the dog to offer the
correct behavior. When the dog does lie down, the handler says "free" and rewards the dog. Later the
handler will want to prolong the down before rewarding the dog. The handler says "down" and the dog
lies down. Then the handler says "good", encouraging the dog to continue the behavior. After a moment
the handler says "free" and rewards the dog. Suppose the handler says "down" and the dog jumps up on
the handler and starts biting at the treat bag. The handler says "no" and punishes the dog in an
appropriate manner. Frequently use of the word "no" is sufficient punishment. Note that the reward
marker and punishment marker end the behavior. Once the handler gives either of those messages, the
dog is no longer expected to perform the requested behavior.

Reward and punishment
Most training revolves around giving the dog a reward, such as treats (food or favorite toys), attention,
or praise when it obeys, and withholding rewards when it does not.

Punishment is also useful in training, although "punishment" does not mean beating the dog. A sharp No
works for many dogs, but even some dogs show signs of fear or anxiety with harsh verbal corrections.
Punishments are administered only as appropriate for the dog's personality, age, and experience.
Trainers generally advice keeping hand contact with the dog to positive interactions; if hands are used to
threaten or hurt, some dogs may begin to behave defensively when stroked or handled.

Keeping a puppy on a leash in challenging situations or in his crate or pen when not closely supervised
prevents the puppy from getting into situations that might otherwise invite an owner's harsh reaction
(such as chewing up a favorite pair of shoes).

The command voice
When giving commands to a dog, a calm, firm, authoritative voice is most effective. Dogs do not
respond well to hesitant, pleading voices, nor to yelling, which might sound to the dog like threatening
barking or scolding. It is also important that the word used for the command and the pitch of the voice
be consistent each time the command is delivered so that the dog can more easily learn what the owner
means (siiiiiiiiiiiit does not sound the same as sit, for example).

Using the puppy's name before a command ensures that the dog knows that a command is coming, that it
is for him (rather than for other dogs, children, or people), and that he should pay attention. This is
important because dogs hear a lot of human speech that has no relevance for them at all, and it is easy
for them to disregard commands amongst the babble.

To reinforce the command, the dog always gets some kind of reward or reinforcement (praise and
usually a treat or toy) when it performs the action correctly. This helps the dog to understand that he has
done a good thing.

Note that not all dogs are trained to voice command. Many working breeds of dog are not trained to a
voice command at all; they are taught to obey a combination of whistles and hand signals. Deaf dogs are
perfectly capable of learning to obey visual signals alone. Many obedience classes teach hand signals for
common commands in addition to voice signals; these signals can be useful in quiet situations, at a
distance, and in advance obedience competitions.

The specific command words are not important, although common words in English include sit, down,
come, and stay. Short, clear words that are easily understood by other humans are generally
recommended; that way, people will understand what a handler is telling his dog to do and other
handlers have a good chance of controlling someone else's dog if necessary. In fact, dogs can learn
commands in any language or other communications medium, including whistles, mouth sounds, hand
gestures, and so forth.

Training tricks
Many dog owners teach their dogs tricks. This serves several purposes: Develops a stronger relationship
between the dog and human; provides entertainment; and engages the dog's mind, which can help to
alleviate problems caused by boredom. For example, the shake hands trick involves the dog raising its
paw and placing it into an outstretched hand. An example of a useful trick is teaching a dog to ring a bell
to go outside. This helps prevent the stress placed on an owner when trying to recognize whether the dog
needs to relieve itself. For more information, see clicker training.


Teething
At anywhere from three to six months of age, a puppy begins to get its adult set of teeth. This period can
be quite painful and many owners do not recognize the natural need to chew. By providing specific
chew toys designed to ease the pain of teething (such as a frozen nylon bone), attention can be diverted
from table legs and other furniture.

Specialized training
Dogs are also trained for specific purposes, including:

    ●   Detection dogs
    ●   Service dogs, incluidng guide dogs
    ●   Herding dogs, livestock guardian dogs, and sheep dogs
    ●   Hunting dogs
    ●   Police dogs
    ●   Rescue dogs
    ●   Schutzhund German training method/sport

Guard animals

Regarding dogs, due to their natural social structure which is terrirtorial protective of companions, even
companion animals will exhibit some form of alert behaviors toward intruders. However true guard dogs
and police dogs are dedicated animals in the sense that they are not simultaneously intended to be
companion animals.

There are several methods regarding the training of guard animals, western (e.g. Koehler Method) and
eastern, and certain breeds are typically used in this capacity. The Schutzhund method also contains a
portion relating to protection, and generally means the animal will bite on command, and will not release
until commanded.

Positive punishment can include electric shocks related to attempting to eat food other than in the
designated food receptacle, for example so a guard dog is not tempted by food given to to it by an
intruder.

Service animals

Service dogs, such as guide dogs, are carefully trained to utilize both their sensory skills and the
protective instincts of dogs (as pack animals) to bond with a human and help that person to offset a
disability in daily life. The use of service dogs is an every-growing field, with wide range of special
adaptations.

                                                 This working dog is a border collie mix.

A working dog refers to a canine working animal, i.e. a dog that is not merely a pet but learns and
performs tasks to assist and/or entertain its human companions, or a breed of such origin.

Arguably the variety of -often exclusive- canine jobs is a better justification for the dog's honorary title
"man's best friend" than the more accidental popularity as pet number one in western cultures.

Definition
Within this general description, however, there are several ways in which the phrase is used.

     ●   To identify any dog that performs any task on a regular basis to assist people. In this context, a
         dog who helps a rancher manage cattle or who performs tricks for a trainer who receives pay for
         its acts is a working dog, as is an assistance dog. This might be in comparison to a companion
         dog, whose purpose is primarily as a pet.

     ●   To distinguish between show dogs that are bred primarily for their appearance in an attempt to
         match a breed club's detailed description of what such a breed should look like, and working
        dogs that are bred primarily for their ability to perform a task. For example, a Border Collie that
        is a champion show dog is not necessarily good at herding sheep; a Border Collie that is a
        champion at sheepdog trials might be laughed out of the show ring for its nonstandard
        appearance. It is possible that a specimen may excel in both appearance and performance, but it is
        very unlikely.

        For some breeds, there are separate registries for tracking the ancestry of working dogs and that
        of show dogs. For example, in Australia, there are separate registries for working and show
        Australian Kelpies; the working registry encourages the breeding of any Kelpies with a strong
        instinct to herd, no matter their appearance or coat color; the show registry encourages breeding
        only among Kelpies whose ancestors were registered as show dogs and who have only solid-
        colored coats.

    ●   As a catch-all for dog breeds whose original purpose was to perform tasks that do not fit into a
        more specific category of work. For example, the American Kennel Club uses Working Dogs to
        describe breeds who were originally bred for jobs other than herding or hunting. Such jobs might
        include pulling carts, guarding, and so on. See Working Dog Group.

Jobs performed by dogs




                                  A detection dog at work

Although most modern dogs are kept as pets, there are still a tremendous number of ways in which dogs
can and do assist humans, and more uses are found for them every year. The following list provides an
idea of the versatility of dogs:

    ●   Service dogs assist people who are physically unable to do everything that they need to do. This
        includes guide dogs for the blind, hearing dogs for the deaf, and others.
    ●   Therapy dogs visit people who are incapacitated or prevented in some way from having freedom
        of movement; these dogs provide cheer and entertainment for the elderly in retirement facilities,
        the ill and injured in hospitals, and so on. The very act of training dogs can also act as a therapy
        for human handlers, as in a prisoner rehabilitation project.
    ●   Hunting dogs assist hunters in finding, tracking, and retrieving game, or in routing vermin.
    ●   Tracking dogs help find lost people and animals or track down possible criminals.
    ●   Cadaver dogs use their scenting ability to discover bodies at the scenes of disasters or crimes.
    ●   Rescue dogs assist people who are in difficult situations, such as in the water after a boat disaster,
        lost in the mountains, covered in snow avalanches and so on.
    ●   Detection dogs of a wide variety help to detect termites in homes, illegal substances in luggage,
        bombs, chemicals, and many other substances.
    ●   Military Working Dogs or K9 Corps are used by armed forces in many of the same roles as
        civilian working dogs, but in a miliary context. In addition, specialized military tasks such as
        mine detection or wire laying have been assigned to dogs.
    ●   Police dogs, also sometimes called K9 Units, are usually trained to track or immobilize possible
        criminals while assisting officers in making arrests or investigating the scene of a crime. Some
        are even specially trained for anti-terrorist units, as in Austria.
    ●   Herding dogs are still invaluable to shepherds and cattle herders around the world for managing
        their flocks; different breeds are used for the different jobs involved in herding, and for guarding
        the flocks and herds. Modern herding dogs help to control wild geese in parks or goats used for
        weed control. A good dog can adapt to control any sort of domestic and many wild animals.
    ●   Guard dogs and watch dogs help to protect private or public property, either inliving or used for
        patrols, as in the military and with security firms.
    ●   Fighting dogs are used (or abused) to generate income in dog fighting or as dogs of war.
    ●   Sled dogs, although today primarily used in sporting events, still can assist in transporting people
        and supplies in rugged, snowy terrain.
    ●   Performing dogs such as Circus dogs and dog actors are trained to perform acts that are not
        intrinsically useful, but instead provide entertainment to their audience or enable human artistic
        performances.
    ●   Canine mascots, who accompany their teams or organizations for support and publicity

New Advancements in Water Rescue

Several cities in Italy are experimenting with working dogs as rescue swimmers. In this situation, a
strong and well-trained dog is equipped with flotation devices and dropped in the water near a
floundering swimmer. The swimmer then grabs onto the dog, and the animal tows the swimmer to shore.
The Newfoundland has long been used for water rescue, not only on shore, but from fishing boats as
well.

Rescue and Disaster Dogs

Dogs are commonly used as search and rescue workers in cases of lost persons and disasters. The St.
Bernard was historically used in Europe in the case of avalanches and lost travelers. Rescue dogs in the
US are used in thousands of lost person searches each year saving countless human lives. In the
aftermath of the 9-11 attacks in New York, rescue dogs searched the rubble pile for survivors. When
searching such large disaster sites some dogs become so disturbed at being unable to find any survivors
that people are "planted" for the dogs to find so that the dogs retain their enthusiasm and work ethic.

Working dogs as pets
The breeding of working dogs has resulted in highly intelligent, hardy, alert dogs that are often attractive
and extremely loyal. As a result, many working breeds are sought after as family pets. Unfortunately,
many owners fail to consider that such dogs are rarely passive, so the abandonment rate is very high.

Working dogs make excellent pets as long as potential owners realize that these dogs must be given
'work' to do. Dogs that are not to be used for their original purpose must be trained from a young age and
are best suited to active persons and families. Obedience training, dog sports such as flyball, dancing and
agility, informal or novelty shows, and trial work are all excellent channels for these breeds' energy. At
the very least they must have daily walks or other exercise at an appropriate level for the breed, given
toys, played with, and provided with human company.

Working dogs who are chained, left alone, or ignored become bored, vocal, and even neurotic; they may
exhibit malaise, lethargy, or destructive behaviour or become escape artists. Working dogs
inappropriately chosen as pets are far too often surrendered to shelters when their inventiveness and
determination to find something to do exceeds their owner's tolerance for destruction. Working dogs
were bred to work all day every day. It is a tragedy for both the dog and the owner when the owner
underestimates the amount of attention and time a working dog requires.

In the animal breeding, to breed true means that specimens of an animal breed will breed true-to-type
when mated like-to like; that is, that the progeny of any two individuals in the same breed will show
consistent, replicable and predictable characteristics. A puppy from two purebred dogs of the same
breed, for example, will exhibit the traits of its parents, and not the traits of all breeds in the subject
breed's ancestry.

                                             Canid Hybrid
                                                                                    Back | Home | Up | Next


Canid hybrids are the result of interbreeding between two different members of the canine family
(Canidae).

Canid interfertility
Many members of the dog family can interbreed to produce fertile offspring.

Molecular analysis indicates 4 divisions of canids:

    1.   Wolf-like canids including the domestic dog, gray wolves, coyotes, and jackals
    2.   The South American canids
    3.   Old and New World red-foxlike canids, for example, red foxes and kit foxes
    4.   Monotypic species, for example, bat-eared fox and raccoon dog

The wolf, coyote, jackal, and domestic dog (including the dingo) all have 78 chromosomes arranged in
39 pairs. This allows them to hybridise freely (barring size or behavioural constraints) and produce
fertile offspring. The wolf, coyote, and golden jackal diverged around 3 to 4 million years ago. Other
members of the dog family diverged 7 to 10 million years ago and are less closely related and connot
hybridise with the wolf-like canids: the yellow Jackal has 74 chromosomes, the red fox has 38
chromosomes, the raccoon dog has 42 chromosomes, and the Fennec fox has 64 chromosomes.
Although the African Wild Dog has 78 chromosomes, it is considered distinct enough to be placed in its
own genus.

(Note: It may be that foxes cannot hybridize with dogs but, as crosses between horses and zebras
demonstrate, differences in chromosome number are not the reason. Viable hybrids between species are
possible regardless of chromosome number differences provided the gene combination in the hybrid
allows for embryonic development to birth. Large differences in chromosome number, however, would
make hybrid bitches so poorly fertile as to be essentially sterile. Male hybrids would be sterile due to a
phenomenon called Haldane's Rule.)

In The Variation Of Animals And Plants Under Domestication, Charles Darwin wrote:

         "Buffon got four successive generations from the wolf and dog, and the mongrels were perfectly
         fertile together. [...] M. Flourens states positively as the result of his numerous experiments that
         hybrids from the wolf and dog, crossed inter se, become sterile at the third generation, and those
       from the jackal and dog at the fourth generation. (De la Longevite Humaine par M. Flourens 1855
       page 143. Mr. Blyth says (Indian Sporting Review volume 2 page 137) that he has seen in India
       several hybrids from the pariah-dog and jackal; and between one of these hybrids and a terrier.
       The experiments of Hunter on the jackal are well-known. See also Isid. Geoffroy St.-Hilaire,
       Hist. Nat. Gen. tome 3 page 217, who speaks of the hybrid offspring of the jackal as perfectly
       fertile for three generations.) [...] Mr. Philip P. King, after ample opportunities of observation,
       informs me that the Dingo and European dogs often cross in Australia]]. ... Several years ago I
       saw confined in the Zoological Gardens of London a female hybrid from an English dog and
       jackal, which even in this the first generation was so sterile that, as I was assured by her keeper,
       she did not fully exhibit her proper periods; but this case was certainly exceptional, as numerous
       instances have occurred of fertile hybrids from these two animals. ... We have already seen how
       often savages cross their dogs with wild native species; and Pennant gives a curious account
       (History of Quadrupeds 1793 volume 1 page 238.) of the manner in which Fochabers, in
       Scotland, was stocked "with a multitude of curs of a most wolfish aspect" from a single hybrid-
       wolf brought into that district. [...] the jackal is prepotent over the dog, as is stated by Flourens,
       who made many crosses between these animals; and this was likewise the case with a hybrid
       which I once saw between a jackal and a terrier.

In Darwinism An Exposition Of The Theory Of Natural Selection With Some Of Its Applications (1889),
Alfred Russel Wallace commented:

       "Dogs have been frequently crossed with wolves and with jackals, and their hybrid offspring
       have been found to be fertile _inter se_ to the third or fourth generation, and then usually to show
       some signs of sterility or of deterioration."

(Note: this deterioration was probably the result of inbreeding among the hybrid offspring)

Dog hybrids kept as pets are prohibited in many jurisdictions or are classed as wild animals and must be
housed in the same way as purebred wolves. For example, hybrids of the domestic dog with the wolf,
coyote, dingo, jackal, fox, dhole, African Wild Dog, or Raccoon dog are prohibited in the State of
Hawaii (this legislation does not take into account the impossibility of some of the hybrids listed).

Wolf-dogs
People wanting to improve domestic dogs have sometimes bred them back to wolves. This compensates
for inbred genetic problems in domestic dogs, but wolf-dog hybrids are dominant in adulthood and less
domesticable. Grey wolves have been crossed with wolf-like dogs such as German Shepherd Dogs and
Alaskan Malamutes. Many problems occur because the owner expects them to behave like a domestic
dog and is unaccustomed to wolf-type behaviour. In parts of Europe, the declining wolf population
naturally hybridises with stray and feral domestic dogs, resulting in mongrel populations and further
endangering the natural wolf.
There are a number of wolf-dog hybrid breeds in development, for example, the Saarlooswolfhond breed
is possibly derived from wolf-dog hybrids. The initial hybrid offspring are generally back-crossed to
domestic dogs to maintain a domestic temperament and consistent conformation. First-cross wolf-dog
hybrids are popular in the USA, but retain many wolf-like traits.

Dox
Contrary to popular myth, dogs cannot successfully interbreed with red foxes. Dogs have 78
chromosomes, but red foxes have only 38 chromosomes. This severe mismatch is a barrier to
hybridisation.

An unconfirmed female terrier/fox hybrid was reported (and later euthanized) in the UK. British
gamekeeper folklore claims that Terrier bitches can produce offspring with dog Foxes. The supposed
hybrids (known as a dox) are natural variation in the domestic dog. There has been a reported cross
between a domestic dog and a South American fox, but the latter was a fox-like wolf and not a true fox.

In Saskatchewan, Canada there was another reported dox, this time a female miniature sheltie with a
wild fox. There was a litter of three, but only one survived. The surviving (a female) was sterile, and
looked like an almost pure fox, with slight variations.

In Origin of Species (1859), Charles Darwin wrote:

       The German Spitz dog unites more easily than other dogs with foxes [...] certain South American
       indigenous domestic dogs do not readily cross with European dogs ...

Coy-dog
Coy-dogs (male coyote/female dog) can occur naturally as female coyotes are more likely to meet male
dogs than meet male coyotes. Coydogs were once believed to be present in large numbers in
Pennsylvania due to a declining Coyote population and a burgeoning domestic dog population. Most
supposed hybrids were naturally occurring red or blond color variations of the Coyote or were feral
dogs. The breeding cycles of dogs and coyotes are not synchronized and this makes interbreeding
uncommon. If interbreeding had been common, each successive generation of the Coyote population
would have acquired more and more dog-like traits.

Coyotes are solitary by nature and this trait is carried across to coyote-dog hybrids. This can result in
problematical and unsociable behaviour which makes them generally unsuited as pets. As a result, they
may be abandoned or allowed to stray and be absorbed into the feral dog or coyote population.

Coy-Dingo
Coyotes have also been crossed with Australian dingoes in zoological gardens.

Dingo hybrids
The Australian Dingo (a feral, rather than wild, species) hybridises freely with domestic dogs. This is
now so widespread that many dingoes are now mongrels. Some dingo hybrids have been deliberately
bred as pets, but are turned loose due to behavioural problems. These hybrids are accepted back into the
wild dingo population where they breed with pure dingoes. In some parts of Australia, up to 80% of
dingoes are hybrids. Dingoes are distinguishable from domestic dogs through DNA and through having
longer teeth and longer muzzles.

The Australian Kelpie sheepdog is widely believed to be a hybrid of dingo and Border Collie, but this is
not upheld by breed documentation.

Dogote
The mating of a male dog and a female coyote results in a Dogote. There has been one report of a
Dogote which arose from a male German Shepherd/female coyote mating in the wild. Hybrid pups were
found after a female coyote was shot. The adult Dogotes resembled a German Shepherd in color.

Coyotes are solitary by nature and this trait is carried across to dog-coyote hybrids resulting in
problematical or unsociable behaviour.

Coy-wolf
Coy-wolves (Coyote/Wolf) have occurred in captivity or, rarely, in the wild where the choice of same-
species mates has been limited. Coyote/Red Wolf hybrids have been found. Some consider that the
American Red Wolf is not a true species because it can hybridize with both the Grey Wolf and the
Coyote; however, it is now known that hybridization between species (in general) happens more often
than previously thought. Some consider it a Grey Wolf/Coyote hybrid and use this argument to prevent
conservation of the Red Wolf. Some hybridization occurred when pure Red Wolves were in decline and
interbred with the more numerous Coyotes. The species boundary is often preserved by geographic or
behavioural separation, not by genetic separation.

Jackal hybrids
The Wolf and Jackal can interbreed and produce fertile hybrid offspring. Coyote/Jackal Hybrids have
also been bred as pets by Wolf-dog enthusiasts. Dogs have been crossed with golden jackals; however,
they cannot produce fertile offspring with yellow jackals as the latter have only 74 chromosomes
compared to 78 in the dog. It is also thought that Pharoanic Egyptians crossbred domestic dogs with
jackals, producing a jackal--dog that resembled the god Anubis.

(Note: Wild horses have 66 chromosomes. Domestic horses have 64. Wild horses and domestic horses
can interbreed and produce fertile hybrids. The reason golden jackals differ in chromosome number is
most likely because golden jackals have 2 pairs of chromosomes that are twice as long but contain
similar gene content as 4 pairs of dog chromosomes. This might reduce fertility but it would not likely
completely sterilize golden jackal-dog hybrids.)

In The Variation Of Animals And Plants Under Domestication Charles Darwin wrote:

        Several years ago I saw confined in the Zoological Gardens of London a female hybrid from an
        English dog and jackal, which even in this the first generation was so sterile that, as I was assured
        by her keeper, she did not fully exhibit her proper periods; but this case was certainly
        exceptional, as numerous instances have occurred of fertile hybrids from these two animals.

In Russia, Dog/Jackal hybrids were bred as sniffer dogs because Jackals have a superior sense of smell
and Huskies are good cold climate dogs. As well as a superior sense of smell, important at low
temperatures where substances are less volatile and therefore less pungent, Sulimov Dogs are small
sized and can work in confined spaces. When tired, their normally curled tails droop, making it clear to
the handler that the dog needs to be rested.

The jackal hybrids were bred by senior researcher Klim Sulimov at the D.S. Likhachev Scientific
Research Institute for Cultural Heritage and Environmental Protection in Russia.

Male Jackal pups had to be fostered on a Husky bitch in order to imprint the Jackals on dogs. Female
Jackals accepted male Huskies more easily. The half-bred Jackal-Dogs were hard to train and were bred
back to Huskies to produce quarter-bred hybrids (quadroons). These hybrids were small, agile, trainable
and had excellent noses. They are called Sulimov Dogs after their creator and may one day be registered
as a working breed of dog. Twenty-five jackal-dog hybrids are used by Aeroflot at Sheremetevo Airport
in Moscow.

Canine influenza or dog flu refers to varieties of influenzavirus A that affect dogs. The highly
contagious equine influenza virus H3N8 was found to infect and kill greyhound race dogs that had died
from a respiratory illness at a Florida racetrack in January 2004. The exposure and transfer apparently
occurred at horse racing tracks, where dog racing also occurs. H3N8 is responsible for a major dog flu
outbreak in New York state in all breeds of dogs. From January to May 2005, outbreaks occurred at 20
racetracks in 10 states (Florida, Texas, Arkansas, Arizona, West Virginia, Kansas, Iowa, Colorado,
Rhode Island and Massachusetts). There is no evidence that the virus could infect people.

A coydog, or dogote as they are sometimes called, is the hybrid offspring of a coyote (Canis latrans)
and a dog (Canis lupus familiaris). Together they are genetically capable of producing fertile young.

The result of a male dog and a female coyote is a dogote, while the result of a male coyote and a female
dog is a coydog. There IS a difference where the cross-breeding of animals is concerned. The male of
the species tends to give the first part of the offspring's name.

Coydogs are fairly rare in the wild, in part because female coyotes are fertile for only about 60 days out
of the year. Nevertheless, they are born sometimes. Wild coydogs can cause major problems for humans,
as they typically have all the infamous cunning of coyotes but lack coyotes' natural fear of humans. A
German Shepherd/female coyote dogote litter was found after a female coyote was shot. The adult
Dogotes resembled German Shepherds in colour.

Coydogs were once believed to be present in large numbers in Pennsylvania due to Coyotes being in
decline and domestic dogs being available as mates. Most were probably naturally occurring red or
blonde Coyotes or were feral dogs. If interbreeding between the species really were common, the Coyote
population would acquire more dog-like traits with each successive generation. Coyotes have also been
crossed with Australian dingos.

Coyotes also breed with wolves, resulting in Coy-Wolves. Coyote/Red Wolf hybrids have also been
found. Some zoologists do not consider the American Red Wolf to be a true species since it can
hybridize with both the Grey Wolf and the Coyote. The argument that it is a Grey Wolf/Coyote hybrid
prevents conservation efforts.

Cynology is the study of dogs. The word appears to have been taken into specialised English language
usage (i.e., within the community of the canine fancy) from the French (cynophilie, dog amateurism;
cynologique, of dog studies, probably popularised by the title of the Fédération Cynologique
Internationale). The word is not yet found in major English dictionaries. Both the French and English
words derive from the Greek roots κυν (kyn) for dog and λογος (logos) for word.

Cynologists (students of cynology) concern themselves with canine evolution, breed development and
differentiation, canine behaviour and training, and canine history. The discipline was virtually non-
existent prior to the last quarter of the nineteenth century, when purebred canine registries began to be
organised, starting in 1873 with the founding of The Kennel Club in the United Kingdom.

The word kennel has several meanings in relation to dogs:

    ●   The small shed in which a dog is kept; a doghouse.
    ●   A collection of buildings or a property in which many dogs are housed, maintained, and bred,
        often used in the plural "the kennels".
    ●   A breeding kennel, a breeding establishment for the propagation of purebred dogs, whether or not
        the animals are actually housed in a separate shed, the garage, a state-of the-art facility, or the
        family dwelling.
    ●   A boarding kennel, in which dogs are housed temporarily for a fee.

In a breeding kennel, there is always a Kennel Name or Kennel Prefix, which forms the first part of a
pedigreed dog's registered name. Breeding kennels are heavily regulated and must follow rules laid
down by the breed club, the kennel council, and the local or state legislation.

Landrace refers to a race of animals or plants ideally suited for the land (environment) in which they
live and, in some cases, work; they often develop naturally with minimal assistance or guidance from
humans (or from humans using traditional rather than modern breeding methods), hence are usually
older, less modern races.

Landrace dogs
For example, landrace dogs are very different depending on their origins and purpose; Border Collies
were a landrace breed in Scotland, where their primary characteristics had to do with how they herded
sheep in the borderlands, and Salukis were a landrace breed in the Middle East where they chased game
across open tracts of land. A landrace does not imply so much a breed as a type; for example, Border
Collies traditionally have had a variation in appearance, from upright prick ears to nearly drop ears,
different fullnesses of coat, and so on, although the general appearance was such that they could still be
recognized as Border Collies and their performance around sheep most accurately represented their
membership in that race.

Often, when people move to create a highly consistent breed, such as dogs for the show ring, focus is
placed more on consistency of appearance rather than on consistency of behavior or adaptability to the
environment, and much of what made the animals a landrace is lost. For example, show Border Collies
might not be particularly good at herding sheep and might not have a coat that is appropriate for the
Scottish borderlands; show Salukis might not be able to chase or catch hares in the desert.

                                                                                   Back | Home | Up | Next


A pack of canines—most notably wolves, the domestic dog, and some other wild canines—is a group of
animals that is organised according to a strict social hierarchy. In the wild, the pack is led by an alpha
male and an alpha female. This social structure was originally thought to allow the wolf, a social
predator, to take prey many times its size; new theories are emerging, however, that suggest the pack
strategy instead maximizes reproductive success and has less to do with hunting.

The size of the pack may change over time and is controlled by factors including habitat type, individual
personalities, and food supply. Generally packs contain between two and six animals, although packs
with more than 20 have been recorded. The hierarchy or rank order of the pack is relatively strict, with
the alphas (one male, one female) on top and the omega at the bottom. The hierarchy affects all activity
in the pack, from which wolf eats first to which is allowed to breed (generally only the alpha pair).




                                 In a household pack of domestic dogs, the animals may sleep, eat, play,
run, and attack according to pack rules.

With the domestic dog, households having more than one resident dog quickly establish their own
hierarchy along similar lines, and the dogs may roam and run as a small pack.

Alpha animals
The alpha pair have the most social freedom of all the animals in a pack, but they are not "leaders" in the
sense humans usually think of the term. They do not give the other wolves orders. The alphas simply
have the most freedom to choose where they would like to go and what they would like to do, and the
rest of the pack usually follows along.

While most alpha pairs are monogamous with each other, there are exceptions. An alpha animal may
preferentially mate with a lower ranking animal, especially if the other alpha is closely related (a brother
or sister, for example). Wolves also do not "mate for life". The death of one alpha does not affect the
status of the other alpha, who will usually just take another mate.

Usually, only the alpha pair are able to successfully rear a litter of pups. (Other wolves in a pack may
breed, and may even produce pups, but usually they lack the freedom or the resources to raise the pups
to maturity.) All the wolves in the pack assist in raising wolf pups. Some pups may choose to stay in the
original pack to reinforce it and help rear more pups while others disperse.

Establishing rank
Rank order is established and maintained through a series of ritualized fights and posturings best
described as ritual bluffing. Wolves prefer psychological warfare to actual fighting and high ranking
status is based more on personality or attitude than on size or strength. Rank, who holds it, and how it is
enforced varies widely between packs and between individual animals. In large packs full of easygoing
animals, or in a group of juvenile animals, rank order may shift almost constantly, or even be circular
(animal A dominates animal B who dominates animal C who dominates animal A).

Loss of rank can happen gradually or suddenly. An older wolf may simply choose to give way when an
ambitious challenger presents itself, and rank will shift without bloodshed. Or the older animal may
choose to fight back, with varying degrees of intensity. While an extremely high percentage of wolf
aggression is non-damaging and ritualized, a high-stakes fight can result in injury. The loser of such a
damaging fight is frequently chased away from the pack, or, rarely, may be killed as other, aggressively
aroused wolves attempt to join in. This kind of dominance fight is more common in the winter months,
when mating occurs.

Creating new packs
New packs are formed when a wolf leaves its birth pack and claims a territory. Wolves searching for
other wolves with which to form packs can travel very long distances in search of suitable territories.
Dispersing individuals must avoid the territories of other wolves because intruders on "owned"
territories are chased away or killed. This probably explains wolf "predation" of dogs. Most dogs, except
perhaps large, specially-bred attack dogs, do not have much of a chance against a wolf protecting its
territory from the unwanted intrusion.

                                 These standard poodles are playing at a dog park. Note the watering
hydrant.

A dog park is a facility set aside for dogs and their owners to exercise and play off-leash in a controlled
environment. Parks vary in accoutrements, but a typical dog park is fenced; has separate, double-gated
entry and exit points; a pond for swimming; hydrants for watering dogs; and tools to pick up and dispose
of animal waste.

Problems with off-leash dog parks
Like all recreation activities, certain safeguards need to be put in place before an off-leash dog park
should be established. The first objective is to ensure that the location of the off-leash park is
appropriate. The park should not be placed in environmentally sensitive areas, and it must be free of
poisonous plants and dangerous topography such as steep cliffs. The second objective is to ensure that
the park itself is safe for dogs, people, and wildlife. This generally will require the park to be a safe
distance away from traffic, and always requires the park to have some sort of fence or barrier to ensure
that dogs do not end up in precarious situations. A third objective is to make sure the size of the dog
park is appropriate. Generally dog parks that are too big result in opportunities for dogs to learn and
demonstrate anti-social, dominant behavior without swift intervention by their guardians.

Allowing dogs off-leash can be harmful to a dog’s socialization process. Many dogs are too shy, bold, or
aggressive to roam off-leash, and many more dogs learn to react aggressively on-leash after roaming off-
leash. Too few dog owners understand what good dog interactions look like, and even fewer feel
empowered to intervene when poor interactions occur, leading to anti-social dog behavior outside of off-
leash areas but caused by roaming off-leash. A particularly disconcerting problem is known as
"predatory drift." Even highly socialized dogs can "drift" into a predatory attack mode, particularly when
smaller dogs appear injured or yelp during off-leash exercises. When a dog enters a "predatory drift"
episode, it attempts to kill the smaller dog that triggers the event. The problem is so severe that many
adoption agencies such as the San Francisco SPCA refuse to place dogs into homes with existing dogs if
the dogs differ substantially in size.

Dog owners must watch their dogs carefully and stay within a reasonable distance of their dogs so that
they can intervene if the dog acts violently or anti-socially. Generally a smaller dog park makes it easier
for dog owners to protect their dogs.

Benefits of off-leash dog parks
Pet ownership in the United States increased by over 1 million households between 1990 and 1992, up
to 54 million, or 58% of all U.S. households. Of the pet-owning households, 38% included dogs. The
number of dogs per dog-household was 1.5, totally 53.3 million dogs. (1) This trend is expected to
continue into the new millennium.

While suburban and rural zones have traditionally been areas containing most of the pet-owning
population, the urban environment has been undergoing an increase in pet population since the 1970s.
This, combined with the fact that over the past 15 years urbanization has been taking over what was
formerly considered to be suburban and rural areas, has resulted in a phenomenon called
"urbananimalization." This, first of all, encompasses the recognition that animals are and will continue
to be a "quality of life" aspect of urban society. Secondly, it recognizes that development must
specifically provide for the inclusion of domestic animals in its growth plans.

As the dog companion population increases along with development, regulations need to be in place to
promote responsible pet ownership, and facilities need to be provided to allow pet owners and their
canine companions to exercise and play together. The provision of ample quality space for the human/
dog companion recreation promotes the physical and mental well being of both dog and human.

Off-leash dog areas provide a social setting in which people can gather and interact in friendship. Off-
leash dog areas are places where dog owners and nondog owners can delight in the entertaining and
interesting interaction of dogs at play. Scientific studies have shown that people somehow find it easier
to talk to each other with dogs as the initial focus, breaking down the usual social barriers that make
people in our society perceive others as "strangers." Research has also shown that companion dogs
improve people's health and increase resistance to disease by providing companionship, by giving
people something to care for, by providing pleasurable activity, by providing a source of constancy in
our changing lives, by stimulating people to exercise, by providing comfort with touch, and being a
pleasure to watch. (2) The unconditional love of a companion animal is very beneficial.

The benefits to dogs is also well documented. Dogs that are highly socialized and exercised are healthier
and happier. They make better neighbors because they bark and dig out of their enclosure less often. If
they do escape, they are far less likely to be aggressive.

The withers is the highest point on an animal's back, on the ridge between its shoulder blades. The
height of an animal is measured from the ground to the withers because that is a fairly stable and
predictable height when the animal is standing still. Unlike humans, whose heads are in a fairly fixed
position when standing upright and looking forward, many animals can move their heads easily into a
wide range of positions when standing still, which makes a poor location for measuring the animal's
height.

This term is used primarily for four-legged domestic animals, such as dogs and horses.

The Chihuahua is the smallest breed of dog and is named for the Chihuahua region in Mexico.


Appearance
The standard recognized by the AKC (American Kennel Club) is only known as "Chihuahua", but they
come in two varieties, the longcoat and the smoothcoat. According to AKC standards, Chihuahua should
not weigh more than six pounds, although they often weigh more. They come in many colors, and are
known for their large erect ears. Chihuahua puppies are often mistaken for hamsters because of their
scrunched faces, extremely small size, and light coats.




                   Chihuahuas come in a wide variety of colors and sizes.

Temperament
Although they are prized for their personality and loyalty, chihuahuas are not well-suited as small
children's pets because of their size and physical fragility. However, their alertness, intelligence and size
make them easily adaptable to a variety of environments, including the city and small apartments, and
make for usually long lifetimes of 15 years or more of loving companionship. Negatively, they can be
prone to being barky and high-strung. Many chihuahuas tend to focus their love and devotion on one
person, becoming overly jealous of that person's human relationships. Male chihuahuas can be extremely
difficult to house break.


History
They are thought to be descendants of an ancient, similar, but slightly larger breed associated with
royalty in Aztec civilizations known as the Techichi. They are the oldest canine breed in North America.

Health
This breed requires expert veterinary attention in areas such as birthing and dental care. They are also
prone to some genetic anomalies, often neurological ones, such as seizure disorders and patella luxation.
They are also known for their moleras and sensivity to eye infections.

"Teacup" and "Deer-faced" Chihuahuas

In recent years there has been an increase in the use of the terms "teacup" (or tea cup) and "deer" (or
deer-faced) to describe Chihuahuas.

Along with "mini" and "tiny toy", "teacup" is sometimes used to describe Chihuahuas and other dogs
that are very small. These and other terms are not officially used by any kennel club or reputable
breeder. Chihuahuas naturally vary in size, and very small Chihuahuas are often runts, unhealthy, or
undernourished, or, if otherwise healthy, may have shortened life spans and other health problems due to
extreme dwarfing. They are not normally suitable for breeding, and may require special care.

"Deer" or "deer-faced" are terms that are sometimes used to describe Chihuahuas that do not have the
breed-standard apple-domed appearance. These terms are also unofficial and have no real meaning.

                             Notes
The Irish Wolfhound is a breed of hound (a sighthound), bred to hunt. The name originates from its
purpose rather than from its appearance: To hunt wolves.

Appearance
These dogs are the tallest breed, with a swift pace and good sight. They have a rough coat (gray, brindle,
red, black, pure white, or fawn), a large arrow-shaped head, and a long, muscular neck.

The Irish Wolfhound is usually known as the tallest dog in the world, averaging up to 86 cm (34 inches)
at the withers, a fact that sometimes is its biggest disadvantage when attracting owners who have no
concern for its special needs. As with all breeds, the ideal and accepted measurements vary somewhat
from one standard to another, and there will always be individuals whose size falls outside these
standards. However, generally breeders aim for a height averaging 32 to 34 inches (81 cm to 86 cm) in
male dogs, two to four inches (5 to 10 cm) less for bitches. Acceptable weight minimums range from
105 lb (48 kg) for bitches to 120 lb (54 kg) for males.

Temperament
In temperament, they are considered gentle and friendly, very calm in the house, enjoying long sleeps
but energetic when taken for walks. Despite their great size and sometimes intimidating appearance,
wolfhounds are sensitive and should be corrected firmly but without anger. They should be socialized
from a young age so that they have a chance to gather experience. While historically Wolfhounds should
show a strong guarding instinct, most modern Irish Wolfhounds are not temperamentally suited to be a
guard dog.

Health
Wolfhounds should not receive additional supplements when a good dog chow is used. It is generally
accepted that they should be fed a large breed puppy food until 18 months of age and then change to a
large breed adult food.

By the age of 8 months, the dogs appear adult, and many owners start stressing them too much.
Outstretched limbs and irreparable damage are the result. Wolfhounds need at least 18 months to be
ready for lure coursing, running as a sport, and other strenuous activities.

Heart disease and bone cancer are the leading cause of death and like all deep-chested dogs, gastric
torsion (bloat) is always a possibility. Otherwise they are generally a healthy dog with few if any breed
specific illnesses. The average lifespan is around 6 to 7 years, though breeders are doing their best to
increase this, with some animals now reaching 10 years or more.

History
The breed is very old, possibly from the 1st century BC or earlier, bred as war dogs by the ancient Celts,
who called them Cú Faoil. The Irish continued to breed them for this purpose, as well as to guard their
homes and protect their stock. Regular references of Irish Wolfhounds being used in dog fights are
found in many historical sagas - Cuchulain's favourite, Luath was slain by a southern chief's hound,
Phorp.

While many modern texts state Irish wolfhounds were used for coursing deer, contemporary pre-revival
accounts such as Animated Nature (1796) by Oliver Goldsmith are explicit that the original animal was
a very poor coursing dog. Their astonishing size, speed, and intelligence made them ideal hunting
animals for both wild boar and wolves, and many were exported for this purpose. They were perhaps too
ideal, as the wolf is now extinct in Ireland. The Irish Wolfhound has been recorded as being exhibited in
Ancient Rome to some excitement, and mention is made that they so amazed and terrified the Romans
that it was seen fit to only transport them in cages. There exists stories that in the arena, the original
Wolfhound was the equal of a lion.

During times of conflict with England, it was not uncommon for Wolfhounds to be trained to take
armored knights off of their horses. Thus allowing an infantry man to move in and finish the kill if the
Wolfhound has not done so already.

Due to a massive export into various countries as a gift for royalty and a ban that allowed only royalty to
own such a dog, the breed almost vanished in the middle of the 19th century. Captain Graham rebred the
Irish Wolfhound with the Deerhound, Great Dane, Borzoi and other breeds; this saved the breed, but had
the inevitable effect of altering its appearance.

The ancient breed (often referred to as the Irish Wolfdogge in contemporary accounts) was available in
both a smooth and rough coated variety. Descriptions of its appearance and demeanor, as well as the
method of its use place it closer to the flock guardians in appearance than the modern breed. The
historical variety was famed for its loyalty, discernment, grave nature and aggression. In terms of
temperament the modern breed has been greatly mellowed.

Miscellaneous
An Irish Wolfhound serves as the regimental mascot to the Irish Guards in England and accompanies the
regiment in all of its parades.

The skulls of several Irish Wolfhounds were recovered in excavations of the ruins of Emain Macha.
These skulls are now in the possession of the Royal Irish Academy. No reconstruction appears to have
been done to establish the appearance of these progenitors of the breed.

                                                                               Back | Home | Up | Next




                                    This small dog of unknown parentage may be part Chihuahua or
Miniature Pinscher.

A mixed-breed dog (also called a mutt, crossbreed, mongrel, tyke, cur, or random-bred dog, see
Terms for mixed-breed dogs, below) is a dog that is a mixture of two or more breeds, or a descendant of
feral or pariah dog populatons. Since, except for extreme variations in size, dogs interbreed freely,
mixed-breed dogs vary in size, shape, and color, making them hard to classify physically. Historically,
all purebred dogs have been selected from a mixed-breed population. See Golden Retriever for an
example.

Terms for mixed-breed dogs
                                 Short-haired brown, black, yellow, or brown-and-black coats like this
are common in mixed breeds.

There is a profusion of words and phrases used for non-purebred dogs. The words cur, tyke, and mongrel
are generally viewed as derogatory in America, whereas in the United Kingdom mongrel is the unique
technical word for a mixed-breed dog, and is not a term of disparagement when referring to a dog.
Therefore, many American owners prefer mixed-breed. Mutt is also used (in the U.S.A and Canada),
sometimes in an affectionate manner. In Hawaii, mixed breed dogs are referred to as poi dog. Some
American registries and dog clubs that accept mixed-breed dogs use the breed name All American,
referring to the United States' reputation as a melting pot of different nationalities. In South Africa, the
tongue-in cheek expression pavement special is sometimes used as a description for a mixed-breed dog.
Random-bred dog, mutt, and mongrel are often used for dogs who result from breeding without the
supervision or planning of humans, especially after several generations, whereas mixed breed and
crossbreed often imply mixes of known breeds, sometimes deliberately mated.

In Brazil, the name for mixed-breed dogs is vira-lata (vira: to turn, to bring down; lata: tin can, trash
can) because there are dogs without owners that feed on urban garbage on the streets, and often knock
over trash cans to reach the food.

Slang terms are also common. Heinz 57 is often used for dogs of uncertain ancestry, in a playful
reference to the "57 Varieties" slogan of the H. J. Heinz Company. In some countries, bitsa is common,
meaning "bits o' this, bits o' that". A fice or feist is a small mixed-breed dog.

To complicate matters, many owners of crossbred dogs identify them—often facetiously—by an
invented breed name constructed from parts of their parents' breed names. For example, a cross between
a Pekingese and a Poodle is called a Peekapoo, possibly a play on peek-a-boo. As another example, one
of the UK's Queen Elizabeth's famous Corgis mated with her sister's Dachshund, and the resulting
offspring are referred to as Dorgis. Many dogs in New York City which might previously have been
described as Shepherd mixes are now referred to colloquially as Brooklyn Shepherds.

Appearance




                                    This "yellow" mix between a German Shepherd and a Golden
Retriever does not closely resemble either parent but has traits of both.




                                    Typical example of a mongrel dog with unknown ancestry from a
sicilian population.

All possible body shapes, ear types, and tail styles can appear in mixed breeds. Extremes in appearance,
however, such as the flattened face of the English Bulldog or the extremely curled tail of the Pug,
seldom survive even the first crossbreeding. Mixed breeds also tend to have a size between that of their
parents, thus tending eventually toward the norm.

Mixed-breed dogs can be any size, weight, or color, but some colors are more common than others. No
matter their parents' colors, mixed breeds are often a light-to-medium brown or black, frequently with a
white chest and other white markings. The light-brown coat is sometimes called yellow, as personified
by the fictional dog Old Yeller. A brown coat with black across the top and sides is also quite common.

Predicting the adult appearance of a mixed-breed puppy is difficult. Even purebred puppies do not look
much like the adult dogs they will become, and with mixed-breed puppies it is nearly impossible. If one
knows the breeds of the parents, some characteristics can be ruled out; for example, a cross between two
small purebreds will not result in a dog the size of a Great Dane. Some breeds tend to pass on their
physical traits to mixes more than others. Border Collies and some Spaniels, for example, often produce
offspring with similar coats and ears. The crossbred offspring of German Shepherds usually have
Shepherd faces and other characteristics.




                                This mixed-breed might have a terrier ancestor or a long-haired breed
such as a Bearded Collie—but it is impossible to know without having seen the parents.

With each generation of indiscriminate mixing, the offspring move closer to the genetic norm. Dogs that
are descended from many generations of mixes are typically light brown or black and weigh about 18 kg
(40 lb). They typically stand between 38 and 57 cm (15 and 23 inches) tall at the withers.

Guessing a mixed-breed's unknown ancestry is difficult for even knowledgeable dog observers, because
mixed breeds have much more genetic variation than among purebreds. For example, two white mixed-
breed dogs might have recessive genes that produce a black coat and, therefore, produce offspring
looking unlike their parents.

Health
                                     A healthy 13-year-old mixed-breed dog shows hybrid vigor.

The theory of hybrid vigor suggests that dogs of mixed ancestry will be healthier than their purebred
counterparts. In some cases this might be true, because inbreeding among purebreds has made some
breeds prone to various genetic health problems. Mixed-breed dogs are less likely to have certain genetic
disorders, as their parents come from a more diverse genetic pool so that detrimental recessive genes are
less likely to occur in both parents. For example, large dogs such as German Shepherd Dogs often suffer
from hip dysplasia. Mating a German Shepherd carrier of the faulty gene with a dog from a breed not
known to suffer genetic hip problems reduces the likelihood of producing offspring with the problem.
On the other hand, breeding the Shepherd with another Shepherd whose ancestors do not have the
genetic problem also has this effect.

Some purebred dog breeds have difficulties associated simply with the exaggerated physical traits of the
breed. For example, the French Bulldog has such small hips and such a large head that artificial
insemination and Cesarian section are usually required to produce puppies. Crossing such a dog with
another breed will likely produce dogs without these reproductive difficulties, although most authorities
on dog populations discourage reproduction among crossbreeds and mixed breeds because there are
already so many purebreds available for adoption in addition to mixed breeds.

There is no guarantee of good genetic health of any dog, purebred or otherwise, as not all damaging
genes are recessive. Also, of course, purebred and mixed-breed dogs are equally susceptible to
nongenetic ailments, such as rabies, distemper, injury, and infestation by parasites.


Types of mixed breeding
It's important to note that all dog breeds are man-made creations: dogs were traditionally bred for
specific functions. All existing dog breeds began as mixed breeds, either by random occurrence or by
deliberate crosses of existing breeds. Encouraging desirable traits and discouraging others, breeders
sought to create their ideal appearance or behavior, or both, for dogs, and, additionally, to ensure that the
dogs could consistently produce offspring with the same appearance or behavior. Some consider mixed
breeds undesirable, but mixing breeds can lead to desirable results, especially in the hands of an expert
breeder. On the other hand, inexperienced crossbreeders can produce disastrous results. For example, the
offspring of an obsessive Border Collie and an energetic, destructive Terrier could be dogs whose
behavior is so erratic as to make the dogs a liability.




                                 The Cockapoo results from deliberate crossbreeding.

Mixed-breed dogs can be divided roughly into three types:

    ●   Crossbred dogs, which are mixtures of two known breeds. Some crossbreeds have traits that
        make them popular enough to be frequently bred deliberately, such as the Cockapoo—a cross
        between a Poodle and a Cocker Spaniel—and the Labradoodle, which mixes a Labrador
        Retriever with a Poodle. Other crossbreeds occur when breeders are hoping to create new breeds
        or to add or reinforce characteristics from one breed into another breed. Most crossbreedings,
        however, occur accidentally.

    ●   Mixes among more than two breeds, such as when a crossbred dog mates with a purebred dog or
        with another crossbreed. The term mongrel is sometimes used to distinguish these dogs from
        crossbreeds.

    ●   The generic canis familiaris, seen in feral or pariah dog populations, where mixed breeding has
        occurred over many generations. These dogs tend to be light brown and of medium height and
        weight. This "genetic average" might also represent the appearance of the modern dog's ancestor.

There is no scientific justification for the belief that a purebred bitch is in any way tainted after mating
with a dog of another breed. Future matings with dogs of the same breed will produce purebred puppies.

Mixed breeds in dog sports
                                 A mixed-breed dog demonstrates dog agility.

Both purebred and mixed-breed dogs can excel at dog sports, such as obedience, dog agility, flyball, and
frisbee. Often, highly energetic mixed-breeds are left with shelters or rescue groups, where they are
sought by owners with the caring, patience, and drive to train them for dog sports, turning unwanted
dogs into healthy, mentally and physically stimulated award winners.

Historically, dog shows and dog sports excluded mixed-breed dogs from competition. While this
tradition is changing, some sports still remain open only to one breed of dog, such as greyhound racing,
or to one type of dog, such as sheepdog trials open only to dogs of known herding ancestry. In the latter
case, herding organizations now sometimes accept mixed-breed dogs who have evident herding-dog
ancestry, such as Corgi mixes or Border Collie crosses.

Until the early 1980s, mixed-breed dogs were also generally excluded from obedience competitions.
However, starting with the American Mixed Breed Obedience Registry (AMBOR) and the Mixed Breed
Dog Club of America (MBDCA), which created obedience venues in which mixed-breed dogs could
compete, more opportunities have opened up for all dogs in all dog sports. Most dog agility and flyball
organizations have always allowed mixed-breed dogs to compete. Today, mixed breeds have proved
their worth in many performance sports.

Some kennel clubs, whose purpose is to promote purebred dogs, still exclude mixed breeds from their
performance events. The AKC and the FCI are two prominent hold-outs. However, the AKC does allow
mixed breeds to earn their Canine Good Citizen award.

In dog shows, where dogs' conformation is evaluated, mixed-breed dogs normally cannot compete. For
purebred dogs, their physical characteristics are judged against a single breed standard. Mixed-breed
dogs, however, are difficult to classify except according to height; there is tremendous variation in
physical traits such as coat, skeletal structure, gait, ear set, eye shape and color, and so on. When
conformation standards are applied to mixed-breed dogs, such as in events run by the MBDCA, the
standards are usually general traits of health, soundness, symmetry, and personality.

Advantages and drawbacks
The mature appearance and behavior of purebred puppies is more predictable than that of mixed breeds,
including cross-breeds. With purebred dogs, the genetic variations are well documented and a breeder
has a fair estimation of what type of offspring a given pair will produce. Even still, there is variation
within breeds; for example, two champion sheep-herding Border Collies might produce offspring with
no interest in sheep herding.

Mixed breed dogs are, on average, no more intelligent than purebred dogs, and both sets feature both
slow learners and dogs with high learning capacity. For example, Benji, the hero in a series of films
named for him, was a mixed-breed terrier. However, it is more difficult to predict the trainability of
mixed-breed dogs when they are very young. Most Golden Retrievers are eager to please, but a mix of a
Golden with the independent Siberian Husky could inherit either dog's trainability—or you could get a
dog with the endurance and athleticism of the Siberian and the trainability of the Golden.




                              This small black mixed breed's parents could have been a Labrador
Retriever and a Pomeranian—or almost anything else.

Many people enjoy owning mixed breeds, valuing their unique appearance and characteristics; while
dogs of some breeds, such as the Tervueren, exhibit little variability of appearance, mixed-breed dogs
exhibit often unique appearances. Although some dog owners have a specific breed of dog they wish to
acquire, and will never accept a mixed breed, many others enjoy mixed-breed dogs that exhibit
characteristics similar to their favorite breeds; in fact, with a mixed breed, they can enjoy some aspects
of appearance and personality of two favorite breeds with a single dog.

There is usually an abundant supply of mixed-breed dogs wanting owners, available at negligible prices,
while pedigreed dogs can cost hundreds or thousands of dollars and reputable breeders can be hard to
find.

Some owners value a dog's pedigree as a status symbol and, therefore, have no use for mixed-breed
dogs, whose market value is effectively zero; others particularly appreciate the physical or behavioral
traits of certain breeds; still others ignore pedigree and, instead, value a dog's personality and health. In
short, most dog owners believe that their dog's breed—and specifically his or her own dog—is the best
sort of dog there is.

Finally, one of the best sources for both purebred and mixed breed dogs are your local animal shelters.
The cost is low and many of the animals are housebroken.

                                              Dogs can easily be trained to retrieve

Dog intelligence is the ability of a dog to learn, to think, and to solve problems. Dog trainers, owners,
and researchers have as much (or more) difficulty agreeing on a method for testing canine intelligence as
they do for human intelligence.

Certain breeds, such as Border Collies and Golden Retrievers, are generally easier to train than others,
such as some hounds and sled dogs. It is worth noting that these descriptions are relative to other dogs,
not relative to the world at large. The ability to learn and obey commands, however, is not the only
possible measurement of intelligence.

Dogs are pack animals, which means that by nature they understand social structure and obligations and
are capable of quickly learning how to behave around other members of the pack, whether dog or
human. Adult canines train their young by correcting them when they behave in an unacceptable manner
(biting too hard, eating out of turn, and so on) and reward them for acceptable behavior (by playing with
them, feeding them, cleaning them, and so on).

They are also den animals, so that by nature they can easily learn behavior related to keeping the den
clean (such as housebreaking), relaxing in an enclosed area (such as a crate during travel or for training),
and so on.

Some breeds have been selectively bred for hundreds or thousands of years for the quality of learning
quickly; in other breeds, that quality has been downplayed in favor of other characteristics, such as the
ability to track or hunt game or to fight other animals. However, the capacity to learn basic obedience -
and even complicated behaviour - is inherent in all dogs. Owners must simply be more patient with
some breeds than with others.
Some people feel that the ability to learn quickly is a sign of intelligence; others feel that it is a sign of
blind subservience and that the truly intelligent dogs are breeds such as Siberian Huskies, who are not
particularly interested in pleasing their owners but who are fascinated with the myriad possibilities for
escaping from yards or catching and killing small animals - often figuring out on their own numerous
inventive and ingenious ways of doing both.

For example, some might say that guide dogs, which are required to be obedient at all times, are not
intelligent dogs because they do not spend a lot of time figuring out new things to do. However, they
must learn a tremendous number of commands, understand how to act in a large variety of situations,
and recognize threats or dangers to their human companion, some of which they might never before
have encountered.

Some tests for intelligence involve the dog's ability to recognize and respond to a large vocabulary; other
tests involve their desire or ability to respond to different situations. If you put a towel over a dog's head,
is the intelligent dog the one who pulls it off or is the intelligent dog the one who sits and waits, figuring
that humans do strange things from time to time and if they put the towel on the dog's head there must
be a reason for it? Just as with humans, there is a wide variety of interpretations as to what makes a dog
"intelligent".

Research
Various studies have attempted to confirm the intelligence of dogs in a rigorous manner. A recent
example is animal psychologist Juliane Kaminski's paper in Science that demonstrated that Rico, a
Border Collie, could learn over 200 words. Rico could remember items' names for four weeks after last
exposure (Kaminski eliminated the Clever Hans effect using strict protocols).

Rico was also able to interpret phrases such as "fetch the sock" in terms of its component words (rather
than considering the utterance to be a single word): he could give the sock to a specified person.

Psychologist Kathy Coon ranked dog breeds by intelligence in her book The Dog Intelligence Test based
on a standardized intelligence test for dogs.

Stanley Coren ranked dog breeds by intelligence in his book The Intelligence of Dogs based on surveys
of dog trainers.

                            Notes



The English Springer Spaniel is a gun dog traditionally used for flushing and retrieving game.


Appearance




                                Solid liver and white coat color.

Like many breeds including the closely related English Cocker Spaniel, these dogs have been developed
for specific work, in modern times the show dog lines have diverged from working dog lines, depending
on which aspect of the dog the breeders have chosen to focus on.

Males in the show dog line average approximately 18 to 20 inches (45 to 50 cm) at the withers and
weigh on average between 50 and 55 pounds (23 to 25 kg). Females are generally smaller, averaging
closer to 40 pounds (18 kg). Dogs in the working dog line tend to be smaller and lighter boned.

The working lines, often refered to as "Field-Bred", tend to have shorter, coarser coats than the show-
bred dogs. Their ears are less pendulous. Show-bred dogs tend to have a longer, more silky coat and are
often predominatly dark colored.

The coat comes in three different color combinations. Black-and-white, liver-and-white and either of
these combinations with tan markings (usually on the cheeks and above the eyes). Dogs bred for show
are generally more colour than white, whereas sporting dogs tend to have more white in their coats for
ease of the hunter to see them in long grass.

Temperament
                                 This Springer is enjoying a bone.

The Springer is an affectionate and easy-going family dog, and its alertness and attentiveness make it the
ideal hunting companion. An intelligent dog, and eager to please, a Springer is easily incorporated into a
family setting. Although good with children, it tends to have a moderate to high energy level. Its long-
legged build makes it among the fastest of the spaniels. It has unlimited stamina and needs plenty of
activity to focus its mind and to provide substantial exercise.

English Springer Spaniels are playful animals; many owners find humor in their play. As with many
playful dogs or hunting dogs bred as retrievers, these dogs will play with things as simple as empty
plastic bottles, socks, or towels. These spaniels easily remember where such things are kept and are good
at getting them out.

Some people say that English Springer Spaniels are like Velcro, because they want to be in the
immediate vicinity of their owner. If the owner walks to the other side of a room, so does the English
Springer Spaniel. Some may become agitated and whine if they cannot get near people that they know
are nearby.

Health

                                 Spot Fetcher, U.S. President George W. Bush's dog (now deceased).

As in many breeds there are health issues for which the breeder should be careful. People acquiring new
puppies can avoid some issues by asking the breeder for health clearances of the father and mother of
the litter, in particular, Canine Eye Research Foundation (CERF) and Orthopedic Foundation (OFA)
certifications for the father and mother. However, health issues can still show up. Hip dysplasia and
Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA), are two such diseases for which veterinarians are working on
genetic markers to determine carriers.

English Springer Spaniels are very prone to having ear infections. Susceptible individuals should have
their ear canals cleaned weekly with a solution that will leave the ear in an acidic state to retard the
growth of yeast and bacteria.

Other health issues include autoimmune diseases, which include allergies and other sensitivities to the
environment. These are extreme, but are found in the breed.

Temperament issues can include dog and people aggression, which appears to be genetic, and in many
cases does not manifest until the dog is an adult. Choosing dogs with parents that do not display this
kind of behavior will reduce, but not eliminate, its occurrence. Another cause of aberrant behavior can
be epilepsy.

History
This spaniel is an older breed, appearing in paintings as early as the 1600s. It is possibly the ancestor of
most modern spaniels; springer spaniels and cocker spaniels were not recognized as separate breeds until
the 1800s.

                                              Most dogs love it when the clicker comes out.

Clicker training is the process of training an animal using a conditioned reinforcer, such as a clicker, to
mark a desired behavior, thereby indicating to the animal being trained that it has done something
correct. It was originally used in training animals for which traditional methods of obedience training
weren't useful, such as dolphins in wild-animal shows or carrier pigeons used for specific military
purposes. The animal is first presented with a sound and immediately given the reward, which can be a
special treat, or a toy. The animal learns to associate the noise with the reward. Once the noise is
conditioned, it is then used to reinforce positive behaviors that the trainer wishes the animal to repeat.

One of the challenges in training an animal is in letting it know when it has done the behavior that the
trainer is attempting to reinforce. As a simple example, when teaching a dog to shake hands, the first
step would be to encourage the dog simply to lift one paw. At the instant that the dog raises the paw, the
trainer must let the dog know that it has done the correct thing. However, the traditional "good dog!"
takes so long to say that the dog might already have lowered the paw again before realizing that it is
being praised. In addition, people's voices, pronunciation, tone, loudness, and emphasis, and how long it
takes to say the words can change, even at different minutes of the same training session, so that the
animal has to learn to interpret through all of the nuances to understand what the trainer is attempting to
convey.

A clicker solves these problems. It produces a very short sound that can be initiated and completed at the
instant the behavior occurs. The sound is always identical - same volume, same tone, same length. While
operant conditioning is the formal terminology for clicker training, it is known colloquially as clicker
training because of the use of the clicker/cricket. Note though, that it is not necessary to use a clicker to
train a dog or other animal with operant conditioning techniques. Any device that can make a uniform
sound and can be activated quickly (such as the click of a pen cap or the blow of a whistle) will work.

The first step in clicker training is to teach the animal that the clicker sound means that they will get a
reward. To do this, the trainer does what is called "loading the clicker." Over a few sessions, the trainer
clicks the clicker and immediately thereafter gives the animal a reward (usually a treat to start with;
later, favorite toys can be substituted), clicks again and rewards again, and so on for about 20 repetitions
each session. Dogs, for example, learn the association very quickly.

After that, the trainer can use the clicker to begin marking desired behaviors; each time that the animal
performs the behavior, the trainer clicks and, quickly thereafter, rewards. The primary key to clicker
training is the trainer's timing; clicking slightly too early or too late can quickly establish an incorrect
association in the animal's mind.

Karen Pryor, a scientist with an international reputation in the fields of marine mammal biology and
behavioral psychology, is widely heralded as a founder of clicker training.

Examples
Many desired behaviors start with the nose-touch, where the dog learns to touch an identified target,
such as a small piece of plastic, with its nose; that behavior can then be transported to perform useful
tasks or interesting tricks such as flipping a lightswitch or ringing a bell to go outside.

Training the nose touch begins with getting the dog to touch a target with its nose; trainers sometimes
use a guided method, such as placing a dab of peanut butter on a small plate or plastic target; others
prefer shaping, where the target is placed in easy reach, such as in the trainer's hand between the trainer
and the dog, and the dog is rewarded each time he moves in the target's direction or actually touches it.

When the dog is consistently touching the target, the trainer progresses to a target with and without food
and in different positions. Eventually, the trainer can transfer the behavior to a bell, for example by
holding the target behind the bell so that the dog has to touch the bell to get at the target, and then
rewarding the touching of the bell. When the dog is reliably touching the bell, the trainer now adds the
act of opening the door to the reward each time the dog strikes the bell.

The Louisiana Catahoula Leopard Dog, also known as the Catahoula Cur and Catahoula Hog Dog,
is named after Catahoula Parish, Louisiana. Of extant dog breeds, the Catahoula is thought to have been
in North America the longest.

Appearance
As a working dog, Catahoulas have been bred more for temperament and ability than for appearance. As
a result, the physical characteristics of the Catahoula are somewhat varied. They typically range from 50
to 95 pounds in weight and have short to very short hair. They come in a variety of colors: blue, red and
yellow, in both merles and solids. The archetype, however, is the blue merle. They are known for having
haunting light blue "glass eyes", or half-blue, half-brown "cracked" eyes, although all-brown is also an
acceptable eye color. Some Catahoulas have a short tail.

Temperament
Catahoulas are highly intelligent, energetic and quick, yet are generally very loving and gentle with
children. They are inquisitive and have an independent streak. However, the Catahoula temperament is
NOT suited for everyone; these dogs tend to be very protective of their territory and family, and can also
be aggressive towards other dogs, especially of the same sex. This, combined with their independent
nature, their high energy levels, and physical strength, can make a Catahoula "too much dog" for
inexperienced or meek owners, and can make it a liability in surburban neighborhoods. Ideally, a
Catahoula should have proper obedience training, secure confinement on the owner's property, and an
outlet for its energy.

History
                            Young red-and-white Catahoulas

One theory as to the breed's origins states that the Catahoula is thought to have descended from "war
dogs" (Mastiffs and Greyhounds) brought to Louisiana by Hernando de Soto in the 16th century. Dogs
left behind by the explorer's party were interbred by the local Indians with a semidomesticated Red
Wolf. The "Red Wolf" theory, however, was mainly proposed on the incorrect assumption that the
Native Americans were "too uncivilized" to have domesticated animals prior to the arrival of Europeans,
leaving the Red Wolf as the only canid in the region with which the Spanish dogs could have mated,
when in fact this is not true. The Native Americans had many different types of domesticated dogs, and
it is more likely that one of the ancestors of the Catahoula was the village dogs of the Native tribes
living in the Mississippi Delta area, of a type closely resembling a breed known as the "Carolina Dog"
today.

In the 17th century, French settlers arrived in Louisiana. They brought with them the Beauceron and
mixed it with the local Indian dogs.

The Catahoula is the working dog of the region. They are used for herding cattle and sheep, and for
tracking and hunting feral pigs (as well as anything else huntable from squirrel to deer to bear...) In
1979, they were named the official state dog of Louisiana in recognition of their importance in the
history of the region.

       For information about many breeds of the bulldog type, see Bulldog breeds.

The Bulldog, often called the English Bulldog, is a medium-sized dog breed that originated in England.


Appearance
The ideal show Bulldog must be of medium size and smooth coat; with heavy, thick-set, low-slung
body, massive short-faced head, wide shoulders and sturdy limbs. The size for mature dogs is about 50
pounds (23 kg); for mature bitches about 40 pounds (18 kg).

Temperament
Contrary to classic cartoon parodies and nicknames of the breed, such as 'Sour-Puss', that depicted the
bulldog as ferocious and wearing a spiked dog collar, the bulldog is not a vicious dog breed (though it
was during the days of bullbaiting, the aggressive tendencies were bred out of them by the time of the
Second World War) and gets along well with both humans (including children) and sometimes other dog
breeds. Bulldogs are very friendly and playful, whilst also being stubborn and protective, characteristics
which have helped make the breed one of the unofficial symbols of the United Kingdom.

Health




Bulldogs tend to have breathing problems as their flat face restricts air; because of this they should be
closely monitored in hot weather as they can suffer heat stroke easier than breeds with long noses. They
also have problems swimming and can drown if left unattended near a pool. Other common health
problems include cherry eye, allergies, and (among older bulldogs) hip problems and cataracts. Because
of the large heads in proportion to body size, baby bulldogs are usually delivered by c-section as most
pups get stuck in the birth canal during natural birth.
History
Bulldogs were originally used for bullbaiting, a wagering sport popular in the 17th century in which
trained bulldogs leapt at a bull lashed to a post, latched onto its snout and attempted to suffocate it. It is
adaptation to these rough origins that resulted in the bulldog's unusual look. Its short and slightly upward
facing snout enables it to breathe while keeping hold of the bull, its wrinkles allowed blood to flow away
from the dog's eyes and nose, and its thickly-muscled neck and light hind end helped to prevent the
thrashing of the bull's head from breaking the dog's spine. The practice of bullbaiting was banned in
England in 1835.

After bullbaiting was banned, the breed began to die out (known as the Old English Bulldog) until fans
turned to dog shows. The first show to have a class for bulldogs was in Birmingham. Just a few years
later, in 1864, a club was organized to enhance the breed. Unfortunately, this group never picked a
specific breed standard, and in 1891 the two top bulldogs, King Orry and Dockleaf, were greatly
different in appearance. King Orry was reminiscent of the original bulldogs -- lighter boned and very
athletic. Dockleaf was smaller and heavier set -- more like modern bulldogs. Dockleaf was declared the
winner that year. Although some argued that the older version of the bulldog (known as the Old English
Bulldog) was more fit to perform, the modern version’s looks won over the fans of the breed.

Recently, many people have tried to recreate the a breed more akin to the original bullbaiter. Examples
of the trend are the Olde Englishe Bulldogge, Renaissance bulldog, Victorian, Continental and Dorset
Old Thyme bulldog. The American bulldog is also thought by some to have similarities to the original
bullbaiters.

                                    Spaying And Neutering
                                                                                          Back | Home | Up


Spaying and neutering are the respective processes of female and male animal sterilization, in order to
keep them from producing offspring.

Unlike in humans, this usually includes (somewhat controversially) the entire removal of related major
organs. While most agree on the advantages of sterilization itself, the necessity of the castration part is
even now hotly debated.

The processes are sometimes referred to as castration, due to the removal of organs, although the term in
itself specifically refers to the removal of the male testicles.

Household pets
Most humane societies, animal shelters, and rescue groups urge pet owners to have their pets "spayed or
neutered" to prevent the births of unwanted and accidental litters, contributing to the overpopulation of
animals.

In addition, the process has theoretical health benefits (uterine and testicular cancer or similar diseases
are definitely ruled out, and hormone-driven diseases such as breast or prostate cancer become a non-
issue as well), and it may help to address behavioral issues that otherwise can result in animals being
given up to shelters, abandoned or put to sleep. Obviously, the animals lose their libido, and females no
longer experience heat cycles. This is due to the great hormonal changes involved with both genders,
and any neutering will definitely cause minor personality changes in the animal.

Modern Non-surgical Alternatives

Injectable

     ●   Male dogs - Zinc gluconate neutralized by arginine. [1]
     ●   Female mammals - Purified porcine zona pellucida antigens encapsulated in liposomes
         (cholesterol and lecithin) with an adjuvant. [2]

Other Methods

     ●   Noninvasive vasectomy using ultrasound. [3]
Females (spaying)




                                 Spaying of a female cat.

In female animals, spaying involves invasive abdominal surgery to remove the ovaries and uterus, rarely
involving major complications. It is commonly practiced on household pets such as cats and dogs as a
method of birth control, but is rarely performed on livestock. Possible complications include urinary
incontinence and minor weight gain.

                                  The Whippet shows the characteristic long legs, deep chest, and narrow
waist of a sight hound.

Sight hounds, also called gaze hounds, are hounds that primarily hunt by sight instead of by scent.


Appearance
These dogs specialize in following prey by keeping it in sight. Therefore, the dog must be able to
quickly detect motion, so these hounds usually have extremely good vision and smaller ear flaps so as
not to obstruct possible sounds. Because the prey is often quite fast and agile, such as deer, the dog must
be able to keep up with it. As a result, most of these dogs have long legs for a long stride, a deep chest to
support a strong cardiovascular system for long sprints, and a thin, wiry body to keep its weight at a
minimum.

History
Sight hounds similar to the Saluki have existed for at least 5,000 years, with the earliest known
sighthounds appearing in Arabia. Although today sight hounds are kept primarily as pets, they have been
bred for thousands of years to detect movement, chase, capture, and kill prey. They thrive on physical
activity. Most have mellow personalities, but the instinct to chase running animals remains strong.

So much so that, apart from pure hunting, various dog sports are practiced with purebreds, and
sometimes with Lurchers. Apart from Greyhound racing (and Whippet racing) there are lure coursing,
oval track racing, straight racing, open-field coursing, and other events practiced outside of North
America.

Miscellaneous
The fastest sight hounds can reach speeds of over 40 mph (60 km/h).

                                               Rabies
                                                                                       Home | Up | Next

Rabies (from a Latin word meaning rage) is a viral disease that              Virus classification
causes acute encephalitis in animals and people. It can affect most
species of warm-blooded animals, but is rare among non-carnivores.     Group: Group V ((-)ssRNA)
In unvaccinated humans, rabies is almost invariably fatal once full-   Order:    Mononegavirales
blown symptoms have developed, but post-exposure vaccination can
                                                                       Family: Rhabdoviridae
prevent symptoms from developing.
                                                                       Genus: Lyssavirus
Transmission and symptoms                                              Species: Rabies virus




                                               Micrograph with numerous rabies viruses (small dark-grey
rod-like particles) and Negri bodies, larger cellular inclusions typical of Rabies infection

The stereotypical image of an infected ("rabid") animal is a "mad dog" foaming at the mouth, but cats,
ferrets, raccoons, skunks, fox, coyotes and bats also become rabid. Squirrels, chipmunks, other rodents
and rabbits are very seldom infected, perhaps because they would not usually survive an attack by a
rabid animal. Rabies may also be present in a so-called 'paralytic' form, rendering the infected animal
unnaturally quiet and withdrawn.
The virus is usually present in the saliva of a symptomatic rabid animal; the route of infection is nearly
always by a bite. By causing the infected animal to be exceptionally aggressive, the virus ensures its
transmission to the next host. Transmission has occurred via an aerosol through mucous membranes;
transmission in this form may have happened in people exploring caves populated by rabid bats.
Transmission from person to person is extremely rare, though it can happen through transplant surgery
(see below for recent cases), or even more rarely through bites or kisses.

After a typical human infection by animal bite, the virus directly or indirectly enters the peripheral
nervous system. It then travels along the nerves towards the central nervous system. During this phase,
the virus cannot be easily detected within the host, and vaccination may still confer cell-mediated
immunity to pre-empt symptomatic rabies. Once the virus reaches the brain, it rapidly causes an
encephalitis and symptoms appear. It may also inflame the spinal cord producing myelitis.

The period between infection and the first flu-like symptoms is normally 3-12 weeks, but can be as long
as two years. Soon after, the symptoms expand to cerebral dysfunction, anxiety, insomnia, confusion,
agitation, abnormal behaviour, hallucinations, progressing to delirium. The production of large
quantities of saliva and tears coupled with an inability to speak or swallow are typical during the later
stages of the disease; this is known as "hydrophobia". Death almost invariably results 2-10 days after the
first symptoms; the handful of people who are known to have survived the disease were all left with
severe brain damage, with the recent exception of Jeanna Giese (see below).

The virus
The Rabies virus is a Lyssavirus. This genus of RNA viruses also includes the Aravan virus, Australian
bat lyssavirus, Duvenhage virus, European bat lyssavirus 1, European bat lyssavirus 2, Irkut virus,
Khujand virus, Lagos bat virus, Mokola virus and West Caucasian bat virus. Lyssaviruses have helical
symmetry, so their infectious particles are approximately cylindrical in shape. This is typical of plant-
infecting viruses; human-infecting viruses more commonly have cubic symmetry and take shapes
approximating regular polyhedra.

The Lyssaviruses are the only viruses known to travel along the nerves after infection. Biopsy shows
typical "Negri bodies" in the infected neurons.

The Rabies virus has a bullet-like shape with a length of about 180 nm and a cross-sectional diameter of
about 75 nm. One end is rounded or conical and the other end is planar or concave. The lipoprotein
envelope carries knob like spikes, composed og Glycoprotein G. Spikes do not cover the planar end of
the virion. Beneath the envelope is the membrane or matrix (M) protein layer which may be invaginated
at the planar end. The core of the Virion consists of helically arranged ribonucleoprotein. The genome is
unsegmented linear negative sense RNA. Also present in the nucleocapsid are RNA dependent RNA
transcriptase and some structural proteins.

Prevention
There is no known cure for symptomatic rabies, but it can be prevented by vaccination, both in humans
and other animals. Virtually every infection with rabies was historically a death sentence, until Louis
Pasteur developed the first rabies vaccination in 1886. Pasteur demonstrated its effectiveness by treating
Joseph Meister, who had been bitten by a rabid dog.

Pasteur's vaccine consisted of a sample of the virus harvested from infected (and necessarily dead)
rabbits, which was weakened by allowing it to dry. Similar nerve tissue-derived vaccines are still used
today in developing countries, and while they are much cheaper than modern cell-culture vaccines, they
are not as effective and carry a certain risk of neurological complications.

Treatment after exposure (known as post-exposure prophylaxis or "PEP") is highly successful in
preventing the disease if administered promptly, within 14 days after infection. In the United States, the
treatment consists of a regimen of one dose of immunoglobulin and five doses of rabies vaccine over a
28-day period. Rabies immunoglobulin and the first dose of rabies vaccine should be given as soon as
possible after exposure, with additional doses on days 3, 7, 14, and 28 after the first. The vaccinations
are relatively painless and are given in one's arm, in contrast to previous treatments which were given
through a large needle inserted into the abdomen. In case of animal bites it is also helpful to remove, by
thorough washing, as much infectious material as soon as possible. Since the development of effective
human vaccines and immunoglobulin treatments the US, death rate from rabies has dropped from 100 or
more annually in the early 20th century, to 1-2 per year, mostly caused by bat bites, which may go
unnoticed by the victim and hence untreated.

PEP is effective in treating rabies because the virus must travel from the site of infection through the
peripheral nervous system (nerves in the body) before infecting the central nervous system (brain and
spinal cord) and glands to cause lethal damage. This travel along the nerves is usually slow enough that
vaccine and immunoglobulin can be administered to protect the brain and glands from infection. The
amount of time this travel requires is dependent on how far the infected area is from the brain: if the
victim is bitten in the face, for example, the time between initial infection and infection of the brain is
very short and PEP may not be successful.

Prevalence
                                                                       [citation needed]
Between 40,000 and 70,000 human beings die annually from rabies                   , with about 90% of
those cases occurring in Asia. About 6 million people receive treatment annually after suspected
exposure to rabies. Every ten to fifteen minutes someone dies of rabies in the world.

Dog licensing, killing of stray dogs, muzzling and other measures contributed to the eradication of rabies
from Great Britain in the early 20th century. More recently, large-scale vaccination of cats, dogs and
ferrets has been successful in combatting rabies in some developed countries.

Rabies virus survives in widespread, varied, rural wildlife reservoirs. However, in Asia, parts of Latin
America and large parts of Africa, dogs remain the principal host. Mandatory vaccination of animals is
less effective in rural areas. Especially in developing countries, animals may not be privately owned and
their destruction may be unacceptable. Oral vaccines can be safely distributed in baits, and this has
successfully impacted rabies in rural areas of France, Ontario, Texas, Florida and elsewhere.
Vaccination campaigns may be expensive, and a cost-benefit analysis can lead those responsible to opt
for policies of containment rather than elimination of the disease.

Rabies was once rare in the United States outside the Southern states, but raccoons in the mid-Atlantic
and northeast United States have been suffering from a rabies epidemic since the 1970s, which is now
moving westwards into Ohio[1]. The particular variant of the virus has been identified in the
southeastern United States raccoon population since the 1950s, and is believed to have traveled to the
northeast as the result of infected raccoons being among those caught and transported from the southeast
to the northeast by hunters attempting to replenish the declining northeast raccoon population (Nettles
VF, Shaddock JH, Sikes RK, Reyes CR. "Rabies in translocated raccoons". Am J Public Health
1979;69:601-2.). As a result, urban residents of these areas have become more wary of the large but
normally unseen urban raccoon population. It has become the common assumption that any raccoon
seen in daylight is infected; certainly the reported behavior of most such animals appears to show some
sort of illness, and autopsies usually confirm rabies. Whether as a result of increased vigilance or just the
normal avoidance reaction to any animal not seen in the course of day to day life, such as a raccoon,
there have been no documented human rabies cases as a result of this variant. This does not include,
however, the greatly increasing rate of prophylactic rabies treatments in cases of possible exposure,
which numbered less than 100 persons annually in New York State before 1990, for instance, but rose to
approximately 10,000 annually between 1990 and 1995. At approximately $1500 per course of
treatment, this represents a considerable public health expenditure. Raccoons do constitute
approximately 50% of the approximately 8,000 documented animal rabies cases in the United States
(Krebs JW, Strine TW, Smith JS, Noah DL, Rupprecht CE, Childs JE. "Rabies surveillance in the
United States during 1995". J Am Vet Med Assoc 1996;204:2031-44). Domestic animals constitute only
8% of rabies cases (ibid.), but are increasing at a rapid rate.

In the midwestern United States, skunks are the primary carriers of rabies, comprising 144 of the 237
documented animal cases in 1996. The most widely distributed reservoir of rabies in the United States,
however, and the source of most human cases in the U.S., are bats. Nineteen of the 22 human rabies
cases documented in the United States between 1980 and 1997 have been identified genetically as bat
rabies. In many cases, victims are not even aware of having been bitten by a bat, assuming that a small
puncture wound found after the fact was the bite of an insect or spider; in some cases, no wound at all
can be found, leading to the hypothesis that in some cases the virus can be contracted via inhaling
airborne aerosols from the vicinity of a bat or bats. For instance, the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention warned on May 9, 1997, that a woman who died in October, 1996 in Cumberland County,
Kentucky and a man who died in December, 1996 in Missoula County, Montana were both infected with
a rabies strain found in silver-haired bats; although bats were found living in the chimney of the
woman's home and near the man's place of employment, neither victim could remember having had any
contact with them. This inability to recognize a potential infection, in contrast to a bite from a dog or
raccoon, leads to a lack of proper prophylactic treatment, and is the cause of the high mortality rate for
bat bites.

In case of an attack by a possibly rabid animal, most states in the United States allow the killing of the
attacking animal. Because a rabies diagnosis requires that the brain tissue be preserved, it is
recommended that rabid animals are not to be shot in the head.

Australia is one of the few parts of the world where rabies has never been introduced. However, the
Australian Bat Lyssavirus occurs naturally in both insectivorous and fruit eating bats (flying foxes) from
most mainland states. Scientists believe it is present in bat populations throughout the range of flying
foxes in Australia.

Many territories, such as the United Kingdom, Ireland, Hawaii, and Guam, are free of rabies (although
there may be a very low prevalence of rabies among bats in the UK; see below).
Recently publicised cases

Transmission by animal bites

Several recently publicised cases have stemmed from bats, which are known to be a vector for rabies.

The United Kingdom, which has stringent regulations on the importation of animals, had also been
believed to be entirely free from rabies until 1996 when a single Daubenton's bat was found to be
infected with a rabies-like virus usually found only in bats - European Bat Lyssavirus 2 (EBL2). There
were no more known cases in the British Isles until September 2002 when another Daubenton's bat
tested positive for EBL2 in Lancashire. A bat conservationist who was bitten by the infected bat
received post-exposure treatment and did not develop rabies.

Then in November 2002 David McRae, a Scottish bat conservationist from Guthrie, Angus who was
believed to have been bitten by a bat, became the first person to contract rabies in the United Kingdom
since 1902. He died from the disease on November 24, 2002.

In October 2004 a wild female brown bear killed one person and injured several others near the city of
Brasov, Central Romania. The bear was killed by hunters and diagnosed with rabies. More than one
hundred people were vaccinated afterwards.

In November 2004, Jeanna Giese, a 15-year old girl from Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, became one of only
six people known to have survived rabies after the onset of symptoms, and the first known instance of a
person surviving rabies without vaccine treatment. All of the other five received vaccination before
symptoms developed. Giese's disease was already too far progressed for the vaccine to help, and she was
considered too weak to tolerate it. Doctors at the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin in Wauwatosa, a
suburb of Milwaukee, achieved her survival with an experimental treatment that involved putting the girl
into a drug-induced coma, and administering a cocktail of antiviral drugs. Giese had symptoms of full-
blown rabies when she sought medical help, 37 days after being bitten by a bat. Her family did not seek
treatment at the time because the bat seemed healthy. Jeanna regained her weight, strength, and
coordination while in the hospital. She was released from the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin on
January 1, 2005.

Transmission through organ transplants

Rabies is known to have been transmitted between humans by transplant surgery. The medical advisory
web site Manbir Online notes "Under no circumstances should a cornea be transplanted from a donor,
who died of an undiagnosed neurological disorder."
                                              A patient with rabies, 1959

Infections by corneal transplant have been reported in Thailand (2 cases), India (2 cases), Iran (2 cases),
the United States (1 case), and France (1 case). The CDC documents the case in France in 1980. Details
of two further cases of infection resulting from corneal transplants were described in 1996.

In June 2004, three organ recipients died in the United States from rabies transmitted in the transplanted
kidneys and liver of an infected donor from Texarkana. There are bats near the donor's home, but he did
not mention having been bitten. The donor is now reported to have died of a cerebral hemorrhage, the
culmination of an unidentified neurological disorder, although recipients are said to have been told the
cause of death had been a car crash. Marijuana and cocaine were found in the donor's urine at the time of
his death, according to a report in The New England Journal of Medicine. The surgeons

       "thought he had suffered a fatal crack-cocaine overdose, which can produce symptoms
       similar to those of rabies. 'We had an explanation for his condition,' says Dr. Goran
       Klintmalm, a surgeon who oversees transplantation at Baylor University Medical Center,
       where the transplants occurred. 'He'd recently smoked crack cocaine. He'd hemorrhaged
       around the brain. He'd died. That was all we needed to know.' ... Because of doctor-patient
       confidentiality rules, doctors involved with this case would not talk about it on the record,
       but a few did say that no cocaine was found in the donor's blood, the E.R. doctors might
       have investigated his symptoms more aggressively instead of assuming he had overdosed.
       (Because no autopsy was done, doctors have not been able to establish whether the rabies
       or the drugs actually killed him.)" (The New York Times Magazine, July 10, 2005)

In February 2005, three German patients in Mainz and Heidelberg were diagnosed with rabies after
receiving various organs and cornea transplants from a female donor. Two of the infected people died.
Three other patients who received organs from the woman have not yet shown rabies symptoms. The 26
year old donor had died of heart failure in December 2004 after consuming cocaine and ecstasy. In
October 2004, she had visited India, one of the countries worst affected by rabies world-wide. Dozens of
medical staff were vaccinated against rabies in the two hospitals as a precautionary measure.

Associated Press reports that "Donated organs are never tested for rabies. The strain detected in the
victims' bodies is one commonly found in bats, health officials said." According to CNN "Rabies tests
are not routine donor screening tests, Virginia McBride, public health organ donation specialist with the
Health Resources and Services Administration, said. The number of tests is limited because doctors have
only about six hours from the time a patient is declared brain-dead until the transplantation must begin
for the organs to maintain viability."

Transport of pet animals between countries
Rabies is endemic to many parts of the world, and one of the reasons given for quarantine periods in
international animal transport has been to try to keep the disease out of uninfected regions. However,
most developed countries, pioneered by Sweden, now allow unencumbered travel between their
territories for pet animals that have demonstrated an adequate immune response to rabies vaccination.

Such countries may limit movement to animals from countries where rabies is considered to be under
control in pet animals. There are various lists of such countries. The United Kingdom has developed a
list, and France has a rather different list, said to be based on a list of the Office International des
Epizooties (OIE). The European Union has a harmonised list. No list of rabies-free countries is readily
available from OIE.

However, the recent spread of rabies in the northeastern United States and further may cause a
restrengthening of precautions against movement of possibly rabid animals between countries.

Rabies and domestic skunks in the United States
Since there is no USDA-approved vaccine or quarantine period for skunks, pet skunks are frequently put
down after biting a human.

The post-exposure rabies series must be administered to the bite victim before the disease progresses too
far. For that reason, there has to be a means of determining whether the animal has rabies within a
reasonable amount of time. Without a recognized quarantine period for skunks, there is no way of
knowing how long to watch the animal for signs of the disease. That leaves no option but to kill the
skunk and test its brain cells for rabies.

Skunk owners have recently organized to campaign for USDA approval of a vaccine and quarantine
period for skunks in the United States.

                                       Canine Parvovirus
                                                                                 Back | Home | Up | Next


Canine parvovirus (CPV) is a contagious virus affecting dogs. The disease is highly infectious and is
spread from dog to dog by physical contact and contact with faeces.

History
CPV is a relatively new disease that appeared in the mid 1970s. Before 1976, CPV did not exist
anywhere; within two years, CPV had invaded every part of the world. The virus is very similar to feline
distemper; in fact, they are almost identical. The consensus is that the feline distemper mutated into
CPV; however, this has never been proven.

Varieties
There are two forms of CPV: intestinal and cardiac. Cardiac form is less common. It attacks the heart
muscle and the dog dies suddenly of a heart attack.

Certain breeds, such as Rottweilers and Dobermanns, have a higher rate of death.


Infection
Dogs become infected through contact with CPV in faeces. Dogs that have become infected show
symptoms of the illness within 7 to 10 days. The symptoms are lethargy, vomiting, and diarrhea (usually
bloody). After a dog is infected, there is no cure. The virus itself does not kill the dog: diarrhea and
vomiting result in dehydration and secondary infections set in.

The virus attacks the lymph nodes, intestines, and the bone marrow. Bacteria that normally live in the
intestines then leak into the bloodstream and cause septicemia. Due to dehydration, the dog's electrolyte
balance is destroyed. Normally 80% of the body is composed of water and, when the body loses 10 to
15% of its water content, death ensues. Myocarditis can occur when puppies younger than 8 weeks are
infected.

Survival rate depends on how quickly it is diagnosed and how aggressive the treatment is. Diagnosis is
made through detection of CPV in the faeces, although the presence of bloody diarrhea and a low white
blood cell count in an unvaccinated dog are strong indications of infection. Treatment usually involves
costly hospitalization, including IV fluids, antinausea injections, and antibiotic injections. Even with
hospitalization, there is no guarantee that the dog will survive.

Prevention and contamination
Direct contact with infected faeces is not necessary for the disease to spread: faeces on shoes, clothing,
hair, and so on are all that is needed for the transmission. The disease is extremely hardy and has been
found to be present in faeces even after a year including extremely cold temperatures. The only
household disinfectant that kills the virus is a mixture of bleach and water, 1 part bleach and 30 parts of
water.

Prevention is the only way to ensure that a puppy or dog remains healthy. This disease is extremely
virulent and contagious. After the disease starts and symptoms show, the dog normally dies within 48 to
72 hours. It is a painful death. It is extremely important to vaccinate dogs every year against CPV.

A dog that successfully recovers from CPV is still contagious for up to 2 months, so the dog must be
kept away from other dogs and puppies. Neighbors and family members with dogs should be notified of
infected animals so that they can ensure that their dogs are vaccinated and tested.

Canine Parvovirus affects dogs, wolves and foxes. It does not transmit to cats, birds, or humans;
although each species has its own parvovirus.

Canine distemper is a viral disease affecting animals in the                 Virus classification
families Canidae, Mustelidae, Mephitidae, Procyonidae, and
possibly Felidae (though not domestic cats; feline distemper or        Group: Group V ((-)ssRNA)
panleukopenia is a similar, but different, virus exclusive to cats).   Order:   Mononegavirales
                                                                       Family: Paramyxoviridae
Infection                                                              Genus: Morbillivirus

Dogs from four months to four years old are particularly               Species: Canine distemper virus
susceptible. It prevails most in spring and autumn. Canine distemper virus (CDV) spreads through the
air and through contact with infected bodily fluids. The time between infection and disease is 14 to 18
days.

Canine distemper virus has a tropism for lymphoid, epithelial, and nervous tissues. Therefore, the typical
pathologic features of canine distemper include lymphoid depletion (causing immunosuppression and
leading to secondary infections), interstitial pneumonia, encephalitis with demyelination, and
hyperkeratosis of foot pads . Histologic examination reveals intranuclear and intracytoplasmic
eosinophilic inclusion bodies in numerous tissues.

Symptoms
     ●   Dullness and redness of the eye
     ●   Discharge from nose
     ●   Vomiting and diarrhea
     ●   Cough
     ●   Shivering
     ●   Fever
     ●   Loss of appetite and energy
     ●   Weight loss
     ●   Seizures
     ●   Thickened footpads

Diagnosis
The above symptoms, especially fever, respiratory signs, neurological signs, and thickened footpads
found in unvaccinated dogs strongly indicate canine distemper. Finding the virus by various methods in
the dog's conjunctival cells gives a definitive diagnosis.

Treatment and prevention
There is no specific treatment for canine distemper. The dog should be treated by a veterinarian, usually
with antibiotics for secondary bacterial infections, intravenous fluids, and nutritional supplements. The
prognosis is poor.

There exist a number of vaccines against canine distemper for dogs and domestic ferrets, which in many
jurisdictions are mandatory for pets. The type of vaccine should be approved for the type of animal
being inoculated, or else the animal could actually contract the disease from the vaccine. Animals should
be quarantined if infected. The virus is destroyed in the environment by routine cleaning with
disinfectants.

Flea is the common name for any of the small wingless insects of
the order Siphonaptera. Fleas are external parasites, living by
hematophagy off the blood of mammals and birds.

Note: There is also a genus of Protozoa named Siphonaptera

Some well known flea species include:

     ●   Cat Flea (Ctenocephalides felis),
     ●   Dog Flea (Ctenocephalides canis),
     ●   Human Flea (Pulex irritans),
     ●   Northern Rat Flea (Nosopsyllus fasciatus),
     ●   Oriental Rat Flea (Xenopsylla cheopis).

pupa and adult. Completion of the life cycle from egg to adult            Leptopsyllidae - Bird and rabbit
varies from two weeks to eight months depending on the                    fleas
temperature, humidity, food, and species. Normally after a blood          Ischnopsyllidae - Bat fleas
meal, the female flea lays about 15 to 20 eggs per day – up to 600        Ceratophyllidae
in its lifetime – usually on the host (dogs, cats, rats, rabbits, mice,   Amphipsyllidae
squirrels, chipmunks, raccoons, opossums, foxes, chickens,                Malacopsyllidae
humans, etc.). Eggs loosely laid in the hair coat drop out almost         Dolichopsyllidae - Rodent fleas
anywhere, especially where the host rests, sleeps or nests (rugs,         Ctenopsyllidae
carpets, upholstered furniture, cat or dog boxes, kennels, sand
boxes, etc.).

Eggs hatch between two days to two weeks into larvae found indoors in and along floor cracks, crevices,
along baseboards, under rug edges and in furniture or beds. Outdoor development occurs in sandy gravel
soils (moist sand boxes, dirt crawlspace under the house, under shrubs, etc.) where the host may rest or
sleep. Sand and gravel are very suitable for larval development which is the reason fleas are erroneously
called "sand fleas."

Larvae are blind, avoid light, pass through three larval instars and take a week to several months to
develop. Their food consists of digested blood from adult flea feces, dead skin, hair, feathers, and other
organic debris; larvae do not suck blood. Pupae mature to adulthood within a silken cocoon woven by
the larva to which pet hair, carpet fiber, dust, grass cuttings, and other debris adheres. In about five to
fourteen days, adult fleas emerge or may remain resting in the cocoon until the detection of vibration
(pet and people movement), pressure (host animal lying down on them), heat, noise, or carbon dioxide
(meaning a potential blood source is near). Most fleas overwinter in the larval or pupal stage with
survival and growth best during warm, moist winters and spring.

Flea Bites from the Berkeley can be treated with Calamine Lotion or 0.5-1% conc. hydrocortisone
cream. Lufenuron is a veterinary medicine that attacks the larval flea's ability to produce chitin.

Tick is the common name for the small wingless arachnids that,
along with mites, constitute the order Acarina. Ticks are
ectoparasites (external parasites), living by hematophagy on the
blood of mammals, birds, and occasionally reptiles and amphibians.
Ticks are an important vector of a number of human and animal
diseases.

The major families of tick include the Ixodidae or hard ticks, which
have thick outer shells made of chitin, and Argasidae or soft ticks,    Ixodidae - Hard ticks
which have a membraneous outer surface. Soft ticks typically live in Argasidae - Soft ticks
crevices and emerge briefly to feed, while hard ticks will attach themselves to the skin of a host for long
periods of time. Tick bites look like mosquito bites, but can also sometimes bruise or resemble a
bullseye.

Ticks as disease vectors
Hard ticks can transmit human diseases such as relapsing fever, Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted
fever, tularemia, equine encephalitis and several forms of ehrlichiosis. Additionally, they are responsible
for transmitting livestock diseases, including babesiosis and anaplasmosis.

Diseases such as HIV/AIDS and malaria can be transmitted by soft ticks.
Generally, tick-borne diseases correspond to a specific tick-host combination, and are limited in their
geographical extent.

According to the Rhode Island Department of Health, roughly 70% of people who develop Lyme
disease catch it from ticks in their own yard[1].


Location




                                 male tick

Ticks are often found in tall grass, where they will rest themselves at the tip of a blade so as to attach
themselves to a passing animal or human. It is a common misconception that the tick can jump from the
plant onto the host. Physical contact is the only method of transportation for ticks. They will generally
drop off of the animal when full, but this may take several days. Ticks contain a structure in their mouth
area that allows them to anchor themselves firmly in place while sucking blood. Pulling a tick out
forcefully may squeeze contents of the tick back into the bite and often leaves the mouthpiece behind,
which may result in infection.

Facts




                                 male tick size comparison

    ●   Dermacentor variabilis, the American dog tick, is perhaps the most well-known of the North
        American hard ticks.
    ●   Ixodes dammini, the deer tick, is common to the eastern part of North America and is known for
        spreading Lyme disease.
    ●   I. pacificus lives in the western part of the continent and is responsible for spreading Lyme
        disease and the more deadly Rocky Mountain spotted fever. It tends to prefer livestock as its
        adult host.
    ●   In some parts of Europe, tick-borne meningoencephalitis is a common viral infection.




                                 Ixodes holocyclus

    ●   Australian tick fauna consists of approximately 75 species, the majority of which fall into the
        Ixodidae, hard tick, family. The most medically important tick is the Paralysis tick, Ixodes
        holocyclus. It is found in a 20-kilometre band that follows the eastern coastline of Australia. As
        this is where much of the human population resides in New South Wales, encounters with these
        parasites are relatively common. Although most cases of tick bite are uneventful, some can result
        in life threatening illnesses including paralysis, tick typhus and severe allergic reactions.[2]


Life cycle

Deer (black-legged) tick




                                 deer tick

The deer (or black-legged) tick, and the related western black-legged tick, are the primary known
transmitters of Lyme disease in the United States. Both are hard-bodied ticks with a two-year life cycle.
Like all species of ticks, deer ticks and their relatives require a blood meal to progress to each successive
stage in their life cycles.

The life cycle of the deer tick comprises three growth stages: the larva, nymph and adult. In both the
northeastern and mid-western U.S., where Lyme disease has become prevalent, it takes about two years
for the tick to hatch from the egg, go through all three stages, reproduce, and then die. A detailed
description of this life cycle and the seasonal timing of peak activity, as they occur in these regions, is
provided below.

Larva

Eggs laid by an adult female deer tick in the spring hatch into larvae later in the summer. These larvae
reach their peak activity in August. No bigger than a newsprinted period, a larva will wait on the ground
until a small mammal or bird brushes up against it. The larva then attaches itself to its host, begins
feeding, and engorges with blood over several days.

If the host is already infected with the Lyme disease spirochete from previous tick bites, the larva will
likely become infected as well. In this way, infected hosts in the wild (primarily white-footed mice,
which exist in large numbers in Lyme-endemic areas of the northeast and upper mid-west) serve as
spirochete reservoirs, infecting ticks that feed upon them. Other mammals and ground-feeding birds may
also serve as reservoirs.




                                  Visible tick damage on a kitten

Because deer tick larvae are not born infected, it is believed that they cannot transmit Lyme disease to
their human hosts. Instead, "reservoir" hosts, as mentioned above, can infect the larvae. Having already
fed, an infected larva will not seek another host, human or otherwise, until after it reaches the next stage
in its life cycle. It is not completely known whether larvae, in themselves, pose a threat to humans or
their pets.

Nymph

Most larvae, after feeding, drop off their hosts and molt, or transform, into nymphs in the fall. The
nymphs can remain active throughout the winter and early spring.
In May, nymphal activity begins. Host-seeking nymphs wait on vegetation near the ground for a small
mammal or bird to approach. The nymph will then latch on to its host and feed for 4 or 5 days,
engorging with blood and swelling to many times its original size. If previously infected during its larval
stage, the nymph may transmit the Lyme disease spirochete to its host. If not previously infected, the
nymph may become infected if its host carries the Lyme disease spirochete from previous infectious tick
bites. In highly endemic areas of the northeast, at least 25% of nymphs have been found to harbor the
Lyme disease spirochete.

Too often, humans are the hosts that come into contact with infected nymphs during their peak spring
and summer activity. Although the nymphs' preferred hosts are small mammals and birds, humans and
their pets are suitable substitutes. Because nymphs are about the size of a poppy seed, they often go
unnoticed until fully engorged, and are therefore responsible for the majority of human Lyme disease
cases.

Adult




                                     Adult deer tick.

Once engorged, the nymph drops off its host into the leaf litter and molts into an adult. These adults
actively seek new hosts throughout the fall, waiting up to 3 feet above the ground on stalks of grass or
leaf tips to latch onto deer (its preferred host) or other larger mammals (including humans, dogs, cats,
horses, and other domestic animals). Peak activity for adult deer ticks occurs in late October and early
November. Of adults sampled in highly endemic areas of the northeast, at least 50% have been found to
carry the Lyme disease spirochete.

As winter closes in, adult ticks unsuccessful in finding hosts take cover under leaf litter or other surface
vegetation, becoming inactive when covered by ice and snow. Generally, winters in the northeast and
upper mid-west are cold enough to keep adult ticks at bay until late February or early March but not
when temperatures begin to rise. At this time, they resume the quest for hosts in a last-ditch effort to
obtain a blood meal allowing them to mate and reproduce. This second activity peak typically occurs in
March and early April.

Adult female ticks that attach to deer, whether in the fall or spring, feed for approximately one week.
Males feed only intermittently. Mating may take place on or off the host, and is required for the female's
successful completion of the blood meal. The females then drop off the host, become gravid, lay their
eggs underneath leaf litter in early spring, and die. Each female lays approximately 3,000 eggs. The eggs
hatch later in the summer, beginning the two-year cycle anew.

Hip dysplasia is a congenital disease that, in its more severe form, can eventually cause lameness and
painful arthritis of the joints. It is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. It can
be found in many animals and occasionally in humans, but is common in many dog breeds, particularly
the larger breeds.




                                  Hip dysplasia with osteoarthritis

Description
In the normal anatomy of the hip joint, the thigh bone (femur) joins the hip in the hip joint, specifically
the caput ossis femoris. The almost spherical end of the femur articulates with the hip bone acetabulum,
a partly cartilaginous mold into which the caput neatly fits. It is important that the weight of the body is
carried on the bony part of the acetabulum, not on the cartilage part, because otherwise the caput can
glide out of the acetabulum, which is very painful. Such a condition also may lead to maladaptation of
the respective bones and poor articulation of the joint.

In dogs, the problem almost always appears by the time the dog is 18 months old. The defect can be
anywhere from mild to severely crippling. It can cause severe osteoarthritis eventually.

Causes
In dogs, there is considerable evidence that genetics plays a large role in the development of this defect.
There might be several contributing genetic factors, including a femur that does not fit correctly into the
pelvic socket, or poorly developed muscles in the pelvic area. Large and giant breeds are susceptible to
hip dysplasia, and cocker spaniels and Shetland sheepdogs are also known to suffer from it. Cats are also
known to have this condition, especially Siamese.
Detection
The classic diagnostic technique is with appropriate X-Rays and hip scoring tests. These should be done
at an appropriate age, and perhaps repeated at adulthood - if done too young they will not show
anything. Since the condition is to a large degree inherited, the hip scores of parents should be
professionally checked before buying a pup, and the hip scores of dogs should be checked before relying
upon them for breeding.


Prevention
Overfeeding puppies and young dogs, particularly in the giant breeds, might aggravate the problem or
bring it on earlier, because pups tend to be more active, less aware of their physical limitations, and have
immature bones and supporting structures carrying their weight. Dogs from breeds which are known to
be prone to dysplasia, can be kept slightly leaner than normal until around 2 years old, by which time the
bones are full strength and the animal can be easily brought up to its normal adult weight.
Overexercising young dogs whose bones and muscles have not yet fully developed might also be a
contributing factor.

Symptoms
Dogs might exhibit signs of stiffness after rising from rest, reluctance to exercise, bunny-hopping gait,
lameness, pain, or wasting away of the muscle mass in the hip area. Radiographs often confirm the
presence of hip dysplasia, but radiographic features may not be present until two years of age in some
dogs. Moreover, many affected dogs do not show clinical signs, but some dogs manifest the problem
before seven months of age, while others do not show it until well into adulthood.

Treatment
There is no complete cure, although surgery can alleviate the clinical signs. Depending on the extent of
the problem, surgical alternatives include excision arthroplasty, in which the head of the femur is
removed and reshaped or replaced; pelvic rotation--[triple pelvic osteotomy or pubic symphodesis]--in
which the hip socket is realigned, may be appropriate if done early enough. Hip replacement is also
possible, it is expensive but (since it completely replaces the faulty joint) has the highest percentage of
success, usually restores complete mobility, and also completely prevents recurrence.

Since less joint mobility may result in loss of muscle mass and quality as a dog ages, there is often an
advantage in having hip replacement whilst the dog is at an early age, while muscle is more likely to re-
developed, rather than in old age when convalsecence is longer and more difficult.

Responsible breeders who track the incidence of hip dysplasia have been able to reduce the incidence in
some breeds but not to eliminate it altogether.

Luxating patella, or trick knee, is a condition in which the patella, or kneecap, dislocates or moves out
of its normal location. The luxation is usually medial, but can be lateral. It can be caused by some form
of blunt trauma, or may be a congenital defect. In congenital cases, it is usually bilateral. Patellar
luxation is a common condition in dogs, particularly small and miniature breeds. The condition usually
becomes evident between the ages of 4 to 6 months. It also occurs in cats, especially the Domestic
Shorthair.

Diagnosis is made through palpation of the knee. Rarely, x-rays are necessary. The luxating patella often
causes no or very slight symptoms. There may be intermittent limping in the rear leg. Osteoarthritis can
develop secondarily. There are several stages in patellar luxation, ranging from minor (the patella's
position is normal most of the time) to very serious (the patella is permanently luxated). The more
serious stages require surgery to correct, if the animal has difficulty walking. The surgery involves
deepening the groove (trochlea) that the patella sits in.

Diabetes mellitus strikes 1 in 400 cats and a similar number of dogs. Symptoms in dogs and cats are
similar to those in humans. Generally, most dogs and about half of cats experience type-1 (insulin-
dependent) diabetes, rather than the type-2 that's now becoming common in obese humans. The
condition is definitely treatable, and need not shorten the animal's life span or life quality. In cats,
prompt effective treatment can even lead to diabetic remission, in which the cat no longer needs injected
insulin. Untreated, the condition leads to blindness in dogs, increasingly weak legs in cats, and
eventually malnutrition, ketoacidosis and/or dehydration, and death.

Symptoms
Cats and dogs will generally show a gradual onset of the disease over a few weeks, and it may escape
notice for a while. The condition is unusual in animals less than 7 years old. The first obvious symptoms
are a sudden weight loss or gain, accompanied by excessive drinking and urination. Appetite is suddenly
either ravenous (up to 3 times normal) or absent. In dogs, the next symptom is vision problems and
cataracts, while in cats the back legs will become weak and the gait may become stilted or wobbly. A
quick test at this point can be done using keto/glucose strips (the same as used on the Atkins diet) with
your pet. If the keto/glucose strips show glucose in the urine, diabetes is indicated. If a strip shows
ketones in the urine, the pet should be brought to an emergency clinic right away.

Watch for noticeable thinning of the skin and apparent fragility -- these are also serious and indicate that
the pet is consuming all its body fat. Dehydration is also common by this point, and death can follow
quickly.

Treatment
Diabetes can be treated but is life-threatening if left alone. Early diagnosis and treatment by a qualified
veterinarian can help, not only in preventing nerve damage, but in some cases, in cats, can even lead to
remission.[1][2]

Diet

Diet is a critical component of treatment, and is in many cases effective on its own. For example, a
recent mini-study[3] showed that many diabetic cats stopped needing insulin after changing to a low-
carbohydrate diet. The rationale is that a low-carb diet reduces the amount of insulin needed and keeps
the variation in blood sugar low and easier to predict. Also, fats and proteins are, in dogs and perhaps
cats, turned into blood glucose much more slowly and evenly than carbohydrates, reducing blood-sugar
highs right after mealtimes.

Latest veterinary good practise is to recommend a low-carb diet for cats, and a high-fiber, moderate-carb
diet for dogs. In dogs another alternative is to feed a normal healthy diet but give mealtime insulin bolus
supplements.

It's now becoming clear that lower carbohydrate diets will significantly lower insulin requirements for
diabetic cats. Carbohydrate levels are highest in dry cat foods (even the expensive prescription types) so
cats are best off usually with a low-carb healthy canned diet. Some prescription canned foods made for
diabetic cats are effective, but some ordinary ones work just as well. Between 3 and 9% calories from
carbohydrates seems to be optimal. These lists of common commercial cat foods and their carbohydrate
energy content are kept up-to date.

Pills

Oral medications like Glipizide that stimulate the pancreas promoting insulin release, (or in some cases,
reduce glucose production) work in some small proportion of cats (Most dogs are Type I diabetics so
oral hypoglycemic drugs are usually not prescribed for them), but these drugs may be completely
ineffective if the pancreas is not working. Worse, these drugs have been shown in some studies[4] to
damage the pancreas further, reducing the chances of remission for cats. They have also been shown to
cause liver damage. Many are reluctant to switch from pills to insulin injections, but the fear is
unjustified; the difference in cost and convenience is minor, (many cats are easier to inject than to pill!)
and injections are more effective in almost all cases.

Insulin injections

Humans with Type-1 diabetes are often treated with a "basal plus bolus" method, where a long-acting
insulin is injected once or twice daily to provide a "basal" insulin level, then shorter-acting insulin is
used just before mealtimes. For cats and dogs a "basal" method is usually employed instead -- a single
slow-acting dose, twice daily, attempts to keep the blood sugar within a recommended range for the
entire day. In this case it's important for the pet to avoid large meals, since they can seriously affect the
blood sugar. (Meals may also be timed to coincide with peak insulin activity.) Once-daily doses are not
recommended for most cats, since insulin usually metabolizes faster in cats than in dogs or humans; an
insulin brand that lasts 24 hours in people may only be good for about 12 in a cat.

Cats and dogs may be treated with animal insulins (pork-based seems to work best in dogs, beef-based
in cats), or with human synthetic insulins. The best choice of insulin brand and type varies between pets
and may require some experimentation. One of the popular human synthetic insulins, Humulin N /
Novolin N/ NPH, is reasonable for dogs, but is usually a poor choice for cats, since cats' metabolisms
run about twice as fast. The Lente and Ultralente versions were therefore very popular for feline use
until summer 2005, when Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk both discontinued them.

Until the early 1990's, the most recommended type for pets was beef/pork-derived PZI, but that type was
phased out over the 1990's and is now difficult to find in many countries. There are sources in the US
and UK, and many vets are now starting to recommend them again for pets.

Caninsulin, known in some countries as Vetsulin, made by Intervet (owned by Akzo Nobel), is a brand
of pork-based insulin, which is designed for cats and dogs, and is only available through veterinarians,
unlike most other insulin brands, which are designed for people and available to pet owners through
pharmacies with a veterinarian's prescription[5]. Since it was never sold to humans, its market share was
less harmed by the introduction of human synthetic insulin. Though not its original purpose, in some
jurisdictions, it is also approved for use in pet rabbits.

Two new ultra-slow time-release synthetic human insulins are just becoming available in 2004 and 2005
for improving basal stability, generically known as Insulin Detemir ("Levemir")[6] and Insulin Glargine
("Lantus"). A mini-study at the University of Brisbane, Australia[7] has had remarkable results with
Insulin Glargine in cats. No studies have yet been performed on pets with Detemir/Levemir, but early
anecdotal evidence[8] shows that it is also very effective on cats.

Neuropathy in cats

The weak legs syndrome found in many diabetic cats is a form of neuropathy, in particular caused by
damage to the myelin sheath of the peripheral nerves caused by glucose toxicity and cell starvation.
(There are other conditions that can cause weak legs too, consult your vet before assuming neuropathy.)
Most common in cats, the back legs become weaker until the cat displays "Plantigrade stance", standing
on its hocks instead of on its toes as usual. The cat may also have trouble walking and jumping, and may
need to sit down after a few steps. Some recommend a form of vitamin B12 called methylcobalamin to
heal the nerve damage. Neuropathy often heals on its own within 1 to 3 months once blood sugar is
regulated, but anecdotal evidence points to a faster recovery rate with these supplements.

Blindness in dogs

Dogs' eyes are highly sensitive to high blood sugar, and will have blurred vision, cataracts, or even total
blindness after as little as a few days at blood glucose concentration above 16.7mmol (300 mg/mL).
Cataracts may be treated later, but blindness is permanent in some cases. Fortunately, dogs rely more on
smell and hearing than on vision, and so may surprise you with how well they get along without their
eyes.

Dosage and regulation
Cats and dogs may in some cases have their mealtimes strictly scheduled and planned to match with
injection times. In other cases where the pet free-feeds and normally eats little bits all day or night, it
may be best to remain on this schedule and try to use a very slow-acting insulin to keep a constant level
of blood glucose. Consult your veterinarian. Note that some veterinarians still use the outdated
recommendation of using Humulin "N" or NPH insulin for cats. This insulin is too fast-acting for most
cats (though fine for dogs and humans). Cat metabolism runs about twice as fast as human, and the often-
effective slower-acting Lente and Ultralente (Humulin L and Humulin U) insulins are being
discontinued (as of 2005), so most cats are now using either the veterinary PZI insulins, or the new full-
day analogs glargine (Lantus) and detemir (Levemir).

The goal at first is to "regulate" the pet's blood glucose, which may take a few weeks or even many
months. This process is basically the same as in type-1 diabetic humans. The goal is to keep the blood
glucose values in a comfortable range for the pet during the whole day, or most of it.

The recommended method is to Start Low - Go Slow:

    1. Have an initial blood curve taken over 24 hours at the vet and receive an initial dosage
       recommendation.
    2. The initial dosage will be very conservative (low) (usually between 0.5 and 2 units daily, split
       into 12-hour dosages) and may not affect the pet's symptoms noticeably at first. This is necessary
       because although high blood sugar can kill within weeks, low blood sugar can kill in minutes.
       Dosage must be increased gradually and carefully. The usual recommended method is to increase
       the dose by 1/2 to 1 unit every 7 to 14 days, followed by further glucose testing. An initial
       decrease may also be necessary -- it is fairly common for the initial recommendation to be a little
       bit too high, especially if it was estimated by weight. See Chronic Somogyi Rebound below.
       Buying an inexpensive blood glucose meter and testing for yourself just before each shot and at
       midpoint is essential -- it will save many expensive trips to the vet, avoid dangerous overdoses,
       and give you a better handle on the pet's ongoing condition. Urine strips are not accurate enough
       for this.
    3. Your pet is "regulated" when its blood glucose remains within an acceptable range all day, every
       day. Acceptable varies somewhat between cats, dogs, and vets, but is roughly from 5 to 16.7
       mmol/L (90 to 300 mg/mL in the USA) for cats, and between 5 and 14 (90 to 250) for dogs. (The
       range is wider for diabetic animals than non-diabetic, since shots cannot replicate the accuracy of
       a working pancreas.) It's important, though, that the glucose level be in the lower half of that
       range for as much of the day as possible. If you are not doing home glucose testing, some vets
       recommend that you stop increasing the dosage when the dog or cat is drinking normally,
       urinating normally, and eating normally, although organ damage may continue in some cases
       until glucose is below the "Renal Threshold" -- testing urine with keto/glucostix will show when
       this has been achieved.
    4. Obstacles to regulation:

           ❍   Sometimes your pet will suddenly appear to need less insulin than before. If this happens
             (their blood sugar will go lower than usual one day), drop the dose immediately and call
             your vet. If testing just before an injection, and the reading is much lower than expected, it
             may be wisest to skip that dose and continue retesting every 2-3 hours. If the drop is
             dramatic and leads to a hypoglycemic episode (see below), the cat's sensativit to insulin
             may increase dramatically. You should consider dropping their dose after consulting your
             veterinarian, and raise it only by half to one unit per 5-7 days, as before.

         ❍   Sometimes your pet's blood sugar will suddenly seem much higher than usual. This is
             often not a good time to increase their insulin dosage -- quite the opposite. It often
             indicates that a low blood sugar condition (or rapid sugar drop) was experienced a few
             hours before, and a Somogyi rebound is in progress. To be sure, drop the next dose by
             15%-50% and take glucose readings every 4 to 8 hours until the glucose levels out. Then
             wait a few more days for the Somogyi hormones to decrease in the body, and then you can
             increase again by 0.5-unit steps every 5-7 days. If you experienced this rebound, chances
             are that your original dose was too high, so you should try to find an ideal dose at a lower
             point.

         ❍   Chronic overdose masked by Somogyi: A dose that is fractionally too high can easily
             cause a Somogyi rebound, which can look like a need for more insulin. This condition can
             continue for days or weeks, and it's very hard on the cat's metabolism. See more on this
             topic in the Somogyi section below.

         ❍   High-carb cat/dog food: Many commercial foods (especially "Light" foods) are extremely
             high in cereals and therefore carbohydrates. The extra carbohydrates will keep the cat or
             dog's blood sugar high, and if you're free-feeding may also make the blood sugar curve
             over the course of the day unpredictable. In general, canned foods are lower in
             carbohydrates than dry ones, and canned "kitten" foods lower still. Recent studies[9] show
             that cats' diabetes can be better regulated and even sometimes cured with a low-
             carbohydrate diet. This may not apply to dogs. If switching to a lower-carbohydrate food,
             do it gradually and lower the insulin dosage appropriately, with your vet's help. If your cat
             is on a special diet for pancreatitis, chronic renal failure, or any other condition, consult
             your vet for the appropriate diet for that condition plus diabetes.

         ❍   Wrong insulin: Different brands and types of insulin have idiosyncratic effects on
             different cats and dogs. If you've settled on a dose that seems to keep the pet's blood sugar
             within range at peak effectiveness, but the sugar readings remain dangerously high at shot
             times, the insulin may not be lasting long enough for your pet, or may not be the best
             choice. Switching to a slower-acting or a better-tolerated insulin for that pet, and lowering
             the dose initially to be safe, may be the next step.

Blood sugar guidelines
Absolute numbers vary between pets, and with meter calibrations. The numbers below are as shown on
a typical home glucometer, not necessarily the more accurate numbers a vet would see. For general
guidelines only, the levels to watch are approximately:

                        immediately life-threatening. Always check urine for ketones at high readings.


The regulation process is described in more detail here.

Detecting and avoiding chronic somogyi rebound

It's confusing but true: Too little insulin means pre-shots are too high; too much insulin often also means
pre-shots are too high. This effect is often noted by those who test their pets' blood glucose at home.

The reason: Anytime the glucose level drops too far or too fast, the cat or dog may defensively dump
glucose (converted from glycogen in the liver), as well as hormones epinephrine and cortisol, into the
bloodstream. (If these are insufficient, hypoglycemia ensues!) The glycogen raises the blood glucose,
the other two may make the pet insulin-resistant for a day or two. This phenomenon was first
documented by a Dr. Somogyi.[10] [11].
Even when raising the insulin dose slowly and carefully, it's possible to pass the correct dose and go on
to an overdose. (A typical case is increasing bidaily dosage from 1 unit to 2, passing a correct dose of
1.5 units.) This may produce a rebound -- a swift jump in blood glucose up from a dangerously low
reading, to beyond the previous pre-shot level. The pet may be a bit less responsive to the same dose the
next shot, from those other hormones. Repeating the overdose on subsequent days, and checking only
pre-shot readings or urine glucose, can give the dangerously wrong impression that more insulin is
needed! Remember to check occasionally at the expected nadir (low point) as well.

It's unusual to be monitoring glucose right when this happens, and typical to just continue the overdose,
leading to a repeated rebound situation. So it's good to learn to recognize the patterns of repeated
rebound.

     ●   A typical rebound pattern, most often seen with long-acting insulins, is a high, flat, unresponsive
         blood sugar over a period of days. Sometimes, often when raising dosage, this high flat curve will
         be punctuated by sudden drops to very low values, (with possible hypoglycemic events) followed
         by a fast return to high unresponsive numbers. (It's the sudden dip that distinguishes this pattern
         from inadequate insulin!)
     ●   When using shorter-acting insulins, repeated Somogyi rebound may manifest instead as rapidly
         alternating high and low blood sugar numbers with no apparent logic. The highs and lows will
         both be exaggerated compared to what you'd see on a smaller dose.

According to recent experience on internet diabetes forums, the rebound phenomenon may be less
dramatic and more common than usually thought, in some pets. The term "mini-rebound" is beginning to
gain currency. If your insulin dose is just a smidgen high, you may see either nothing at all, or a
hypoglycemic episode or a mini-rebound. Some Feline Diabetes Message Board regulars describe mini-
rebounds here: [12]

It's not always easy to tell a rebound from a regular curve showing insulin action ending normally. One
way to tell the difference is to take a "curve" (repeated tests every 2 hours starting with the insulin shot)
on a weekend and look for the shape of the curve. If the curve is valley-shaped, and gradual, then you
are not seeing Somogyi rebound. Other shapes should arouse suspicion. In particular, if the rise after
peak action is faster and rises higher than the original pre-insulin level and the original fall in blood
sugar, you have good cause to consider rebound. The only sure way to check is to reduce dosage and
look for a better-shaped curve.

A fairly sure sign: Anytime blood glucose numbers seem higher after dosage is raised, consider the
possibility of a somogyi rebound. But other things can cause unexpectedly high blood glucose too, so
look for a clear correlation with dosage changes.

Hypoglycemic episode
An acute hypoglycemic episode (very low blood sugar) can happen even if you are careful, since pets'
insulin requirements sometimes change without warning. The symptoms are depression/lethargy,
confusion/dizziness, loss of excretory/bladder control, vomiting, and then loss of consciousness and/or
seizures. As soon as possible, administer honey or corn syrup by rubbing it on the gums (even if
unconscious, but not if in seizures), and rush it to the vet. Carry more honey or corn syrup with you on
the way and keep rubbing it on the gums, where it can be absorbed -- it could save the pet's life. Every
minute without blood sugar causes brain damage. (Some recommend administering syrup anally if the
animal is in seizures!)

If the pet has hypoglycemia according to the blood glucose meter (<2.2mmol/L or 40mg/dL), but no
symptoms, give treats or food if possible. If they won't eat, try putting food in their mouth. If that doesn't
work, administer some honey followed by food or cat treats, and continue to do so until the blood
glucose is rising, and the latest insulin shot's peak action is past.

Sometimes a mild hypoglycemic episode will go unnoticed, or leave evidence such as an "accident"
where kitty fails to make it to the litterbox. In these cases the blood sugar will probably appear
paradoxically high upon the next test hours later, since the pet's body will react to the low blood sugar
by stimulating the liver to release stored glycogen. This condition is known as Somogyi rebound (see
link above), and requires a lowered insulin dosage for the next few days. The Somogyi rebound may
also occur when the pet's blood glucose drops too rapidly, even if it never actually reaches a low reading.

                                                  Bloat
                                                                                          Home | Up | Next


Bloat, also known as torsion, gastric torsion, and gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV) is a medical
condition in which the stomach becomes overstretched by excessive gas content. The distortion of the
stomach constricts the oesophagus, preventing the gas from escaping. The condition occurs most
commonly in domesticated animals, especially dogs and cattle. In dogs, it occurs most commonly in
large-chested breeds, such as Great Danes, Airedales, and boxers.

The condition exists in two varieties, depending on the direction of movement of the stomach. If the
stomach twists around the axis of the digestive tract, the condition is known as torsion, and if the axis of
movement is perpedicular to the digestive tract, the condition is known as volvulus. In either case, the
oesophagus is closed off, thereby preventing the animal from relieving the condition by belching or
vomiting. At the other end of the stomach, the spleen may be damaged if the twisting interrupts its blood
supply. If not quickly treated, the condition can lead to blood poisoning, peritonitis and death by toxic
shock.

In dogs, the causes of bloat are unclear, and currently there is little agreement on the factors that may
contribute. Some of the more widely acknowledged factors are stress, eating foods such as kibble that
expand in the stomach, swallowing too much air while eating, overfeeding, and other gastrointestinal
distress. There is also no consensus on ways in which to prevent bloat from happening, and suggestions
are sometimes contradictory, for example, "Raise your dog's feeding dish - he will not swallow as much
air while eating" as opposed to "Lower your dog's feeding dish so that he eats slower, and thus swallows
less air."

In cattle, bloating is most often caused by the animal eating damp, green alfalfa. New (green) alfalfa
hay, especially that made from the first cutting of the year, must be kept from cattle until it has aged for
several weeks. When a calf has become bloated, often a section of hose is inserted down the throat and
into the stomach to relieve the gas pressure that builds up. A veterinarian should be called for treatment.
Death of the animal often results if bloat is not quickly treated.

Symptoms are not necessarily distinguishable from other kinds of distress. A dog might stand
uncomfortably and seem to be in extreme discomfort for no apparent reason.

Bloat is an emergency medical condition: having the animal examined by a veterinarian is imperative.
Bloat can become fatal within a matter of minutes. Treatment usually involves emergency surgery.

Dog society can be thought of as dog packs characterized by companionate hierarchy, in which each
individual has a rank, and in which there is intense loyalty within the group. Dogs thrive in human
society because their relationships with humans mimic their natural social patterns. The dog is always
aware of its rank relative to other individuals in the group. An assertive dog may consider itself the alpha
animal, considering its human master to be subordinate.

Dominance and submission




                               Properly socialized dogs can interact with unfamiliar dogs of any size
and shape and understand how to communicate.

Dogs, like wolves, establish a hierarchy through aggressive play and roughhousing along a continuum of
dominance and submission. When kept as pets, dogs include humans in this hierarchy. It is important for
successful socialization that puppies participate with their littermates in learning to relate to other dogs.
Dogs learn to successfully relate to other dogs by keeping the peace rather than constantly fighting to
reestablish this hierarchy.

Dominance behavior

Dominant dogs generally take the initiative and are more active than less dominant dogs. Displays of
dominance include standing above or over other dogs, placing a paw on other dogs, holding the tail and
ears erect, looking directly at other dogs, circling and sniffing other dogs, growling if the other dog
moves, and aggressive marking of territory with urine. Submissive displays mirror dominant displays
and include adopting a posture that is lower than other dogs, such as crouching, rolling over on the back
and exposing the abdomen, lowering the tail—even tucking it beneath the legs, flattening of the ears,
averting the gaze, nervously licking or swallowing, dribbling of urine, and freezing or fleeing when
other dogs are encountered.

Ideally, the dominant/submissive social structure of dogs avoids conflict and enforces social stability.
Poorly socialized dogs who are inept at establishing dominance hierarchy may become involved in
excess conflicts, especially from a human viewpoint. People who misunderstand dog behavior or who
have inadvertently placed themselves in a disadvantageous position within the dominance submissive
hierarchy can find themselves participants in similar conflicts with the animal(s).

It is problematic to anthropomorphize the dominance/submission behavior of a pet or to mistake it for
characteristics more appropriately applied to humans. It can be dangerous for a dog to be dominant
relative to its master or mistress. By rewarding "bravery" or "boldness", there is a risk that in fulfilling a
dog's wants it begins to feel it is the dominant pack member. Likewise, it can be dangerous for a dog to
consider itself "the equal of any dog", because unnecessary and destructive conflict can result; rewarding
a dog's aggressive behavior may eventually backfire. Likewise, submission in a dog is not necessarily an
indication of a problem dog. Continuing to discipline a dog after it has adopted a submissive posture is
contrary to a goal of obedience. From the dog's viewpoint, it has conceded the point and is
communicating its acceptance of the owner's dominance.

Behavior when isolated




                                  Dog language can generally be learned by humans; this dog is inviting
play.

Dogs value the companionship of the others in their "pack" and are sometimes distressed if they are
separated from it. Typical reactions when a dog is separated from the pack are barking, howling,
digging, and chewing. These activities may distress humans when they need to leave dogs alone for a
period of time. However, this behavior, called separation anxiety, can be overcome with training, or at
least decreased to the point where it becomes manageable. If young puppies are habituated to periods
alone from an early age, this can normally be prevented entirely. Some owners struggling to deal with
this problem resort to debarking.


Favorite activities
Dogs enjoy spending time with and interacting with other dogs. Roughhousing and chasing one another
are favorite activities. Off-leash dog parks can be good places for dogs to exercise and interact with
other dogs. When seeking relaxation, dogs enjoy lying about with their companions, favoring spots with
a good view of their surroundings.

                            Notes



The Labrador Retriever ("Labrador" or "Lab" for short), is one of several kinds of retriever, and are
the most popular breeds of dog (by registered ownership) in both the United States and the United
Kingdom. The breed is exceptionally friendly, intelligent, and good natured, and therefore makes an
excellent companion, or service dog.


Appearance
Labradors are relatively large with males typically weighing 60 to 80 lb (27 to 36 kg) and females 50 to
70 lb (23 to 32 kg). They are energetic outgoing dogs, and are black, yellow, or brown (called
"chocolate") in color, in that order of frequency. Puppies of all colors can potentially occur in the same
litter. The color is determined primarily by two genes. The first gene (the B locus) determines the
density of the coat's pigment granules: dense granules result in a black coat, sparse ones give a chocolate
coat. The second (E) locus determines whether the pigment is produced at all. A dog with the recessive e
allele will produce little pigment and will be yellow regardless of its genotype at the B locus[1].
Variations in numerous other genes control the subtler details of the coat's coloration, which in yellow
labs varies from white to light gold to a fox red. Yellow labs can have black or pink noses; chocolate and
black labs's noses match the coat color. Lab hair is usually fairly short and straight, and the tail quite
broad and strong. The otter-like tail and webbed toes of the Labrador Retriever make them excellent
swimmers. Their interwoven coat is also relatively waterproof, providing more assistance for swimming.
The tail acts as a rudder for changing directions.

                                                                                    fox red.

As with some other breeds, the English and the American lines differ slightly. Labs are bred in England
as a medium size dog, shorter and stockier with fuller faces than their American counterparts which are
bred as a larger dog. No distinction is made by the AKC, but the two classification come from different
breeding. Australian stock also exists; though not seen in the west, they are common in Asia.

Many people unfamiliar with retrievers find that the Lab is quite similar to the Golden Retriever in size,
general shape, and general color, especially when young and especially to those Goldens with lighter
coats. The most obvious difference is the short straight coat of the Labrador Retriever (the Golden has
long wavy fur) and the Lab's thick, otter-like tail compared to the Golden's plumed tail. To confuse the
two breeds would be a serious faux pas to a fancier of either, of course.

History




                                 The coat of the black Labrador, like this puppy's, is solid black.




                                This young Labrador's coat is chocolate, which was not always
recognized as an acceptable coat color. Now chocolate is accepted along with black and yellow.

The Labrador is believed to have originated on the island of Newfoundland, now part of the province of
Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. It is thought to have descended from the St. John's Water Dog (no
longer in existence), a crossbreed of native water dogs and the Newfoundland to which the Labrador is
closely related. The name Labrador was given to this dog by the Earl of Malmesbury and other breeders
in England in order to differentiate them from the Newfoundland dog. The Labrador Retriever was
originally called the lesser Newfoundland or the St. John's dog. Other origins suggested for the name
include the Spanish or Portuguese word for workers, "labradores", and the village of Castro Laboreiro in
Portugal whose herding and guard dogs bear a "striking resemblence" to Labradors [2].

Many fishermen originally used the Lab to assist in bringing nets to shore; the dog would grab the
floating corks on the ends of the nets and pull them to shore.

The first known written reference to the Labrador is in 1814 in "Instructions to Young Sportsmen". In
1823 sporting artist Edwin Landseer painted a black dog with white markings titled "Cora. A Labrador
Bitch," by which time it appears the breed was already firmly established, with several of the nobility
either owning or breeding them by the end of that century. The first Yellow Lab on record, named Ben
of Hyde, was born in 1899.

The modern Labrador Retriever is among the oldest of the modern "recognized" breeds; according to the
American Kennel Club, pedigrees exist back to 1878. The Kennel Club recognized the Lab in 1903. The
first registration of Labradors by the AKC was in 1917; many English dogs were imported post World
War I and these formed the foundation of the American variety.

Temperament and activities
Labradors are a well-balanced and remarkably versatile breed, adaptable to a wide range of functions as
well as making very good pets. As a rule they are not excessively prone to territorialism, pining,
insecurity, aggression, destructiveness, hypersensitivity, or other difficult traits which manifest in a
variety of breeds, and as the name suggests, they are excellent retrievers. As an extension of this, they
instinctively enjoy holding objects and even hands or arms in their mouths, which they can do with great
gentleness. They are, however, prone to chew objects (though they can easily be trained out of this
behavior). The Labrador Retriever's coat repels water to some extent, thus facilitating the extensive use
of the dog in waterfowl hunting.




                                Labradors are often used as guide dogs

Labradors have a reputation as a very mellow breed and an excellent family dog (including a good
reputation with children of all ages), but some lines (particularly those that have continued to be bred
specifically for their skills at working in the field rather than for their appearance) are particularly fast
and athletic. Their fun-loving boistrousness and lack of fear can result in mischief, and may require
training and firm handling at times to ensure it does not get out of hand. Anecdotally, between the
different subtypes, black Labs may have a tendency to be slightly more dominant, and yellow to be
slightly less so (more mellow). Most Labs enjoy retrieving a ball endlessly and other forms of activity
(such as dog agility or flyball), are considerably "food and fun" oriented, very trainable and open minded
to new things, and thrive on human attention and interaction, which they find hard to get enough of.

The steady temperament of Labs and their ability to learn quickly make them an ideal breed for
assistance dogs.


Health




                                Some lines of Labs are fast and athletic, as demonstrated by this Lab
doing the weave poles in dog agility.

Labrador life expectancy is generally 12 to 13 years[3], and it is a healthy breed with relatively few
major problems. Common Lab health issues are:

     ●   Labs are somewhat prone to hip dysplasia, especially the larger dogs, though not as much as
         some other breeds. Hip scores are recommended before breeding.
     ●   Labs are sometimes prone to ear infection, because their floppy ears trap warm moist air. This is
         easy to control, but needs regular checking to ensure that a problem is not building up unseen. A
         healthy Lab ear should look clean and light pink (almost white) inside. Darker pink (or inflamed
         red), or brownish deposits, are a symptom of ear infection. The usual treatment is regular
         cleaning daily or twice daily (being careful not to force dirt into the sensitive inner ear) and
         sometimes medication (ear drops) for major cases. As a preventative measure, some owners clip
         the hair carefully around the ear and under the flap, to encourage better air flow.
     ●   Labs are often overfed and are allowed to become overweight, due to their blatant enjoyment of
         treats, hearty appetites, and endearing behavior towards people. A healthy Lab should keep a
        very slight hourglass waist and be fit and lithe, rather than fat or heavy-set. Excessive weight is
        strongly implicated as a risk factor in the later development of hip dysplasia and diabetes, and
        also can contribute to general reduced health when older.

Miscellaneous




                                A black Labrador is structurally the same as a yellow Lab but the coat
color makes them look quite different.

Puppy mills and dog theft

    ●   Because the Labrador is such a popular breed, they are often reared in puppy mills where the
        people responsible care primarily for profit, and not for the dog's well being.
    ●   Labs and Lab owners also commonly fall victim to dog theft, where any purebred-looking
        Labradors may be sold to puppy mills or unknowing prospective owners for a high profit to the
        thief. Microchipping for Labradors—as for any dog—increases the possiblity of finding lost or
        stolen dogs, because the microchip cannot be removed in the way that a collar and dog tags can.

Labrador variants

    ●   Although kennel clubs and registries recognize the Labrador in variations of only three colors—
        black, yellow, and chocolate—some breeders sell light-colored yellow Labrador puppies as a
        "white" labrador, the dark yellow Labrador puppies as "fox red," or chocolates possessing the
        dilution factor as "silver Labradors". These colors are nonstandard and would disqualify the dogs
        in the show ring; however, the dog's color does not affect its behavior or health and many people
        own them as companion dogs. There is some controversy over whether these rarer colors are
        worth more (because they are rare) or less (because they are nonstandard and unsuitable for
        breeding show dogs or for showing).
    ●   The Labradoodle is a common mixed-breed dog that combines a Labrador with a Poodle.

Famous Labs

    ●   U.S. President Bill Clinton's pet Labrador was called Buddy.

                                                                                        Back | Home | Up


A service dog is a type of assistance dog that is specially trained to help people who have disabilities
other than visual or hearing impairment. Examples of these include Psychiatric service dogs, mobility
assistance dogs, and seizure alert dogs. Service dogs are sometimes trained and bred by private
organizations. In other cases, the disabled handler may train their dog themselves with the aid of a
private trainer. While the law does not require any special labeling of these dogs, many service dogs can
be identified by the cape, jacket, or harness they wear.

Among other things, service dogs are trained how to pick up objects, open and close doors, and operate
light switches. Some service dogs are trained to pull individuals in wheelchairs. During their training,
the dogs usually spend a year or more with a host family to become acquainted with working around
people. Many service dogs continue their training after they are formally placed with a person, usually
on a yearly basis.

The process of obtaining a service dog varies by each organization. Normally, an application must be
submitted, and a waiting list is usually involved. The costs for a service dog also vary, however financial
assistance may be available.

Patience and repetition are critical components of successful animal training for service dogs. In the
United States, use of selected inmates in prisons as animal trainers has proved a valuable resource to
service animal agencies. In addition to teaching the dogs basic obedience and other skills needed to
prepare them for their future careers and thereby adding to the short-supply of service animals, such
programs in correctional centers have proved to be mutually beneficial relationships. Often, the inmates
develop improved socialization skills and behavior as a result of their work with the dogs.

Service dogs and their handlers enjoy special protection under the U.S. Americans with Disabilities Act
of 1990, which gives them equal access to public facilities, such as restaurants, parks, taxis, and
airplanes.

A guard dog or watch dog is a dog employed to guard against, or watch for, unwanted or unexpected
animals or people.

Both guard dogs and watch dogs bark to alert their owners of an intruder's presence. The barking is also
an attempt at scaring away the intruder. The watch dogs's function ends here, while a guard dog might
be trained to restrain or attack the intruder. For example, livestock guardian dogs are often large enough
and strong enough to attack and drive away predators such as wolves. In cases where intruders are more
likely to be human, guard dogs are sometimes trained simply to restrain an intruder with his owner's
guidance, as in Schutzhund training. Occasionally, guard dogs are trained to attack human intruder(s),
though this practice might be locally illegal.

                                             A Koolie working with sheep.

A herding dogor pastoral breed is a dog that either has been trained in herding or that is a member of a
breed developed for herding. Some herding breeds work well with any kinds of animals; others have
been bred for generations to work with specific kinds of animals and have developed physical
characteristics or styles of working that enhance their ability to handle these animals. Commonly herded
animals include cattle, sheep, and reindeer.

Herding dog is also sometimes used to refer to dogs whose primary job is to guard the herd from
predators and to be sure that it does not go astray. A Maremma Sheepdog is an example. For more
information about dogs of this type, see Livestock guardian dog.
In general terms when categorizing dog breeds, herding dogs are considered a subcategory of working
dogs, but for dog shows they usually form a separate group.


Herding behavior




                                              A Border Collie at work with goats.

Dogs can herd other animals in a variety of ways. Some breeds, such as the Australian Cattle Dog,
typically nip at the animals' heels (for this reason they are called heelers). Others, notably the Border
Collie, get in front of the animals and use what is called eye to stare down the animals; they are known
as headers. The Koolie has been observed to use both these methods and to jump on the backs of their
charges. Koolies are therefore said to 'head', 'heel', and 'back'.

All herding behavior is modified predatory behavior.

Most herding breeds have physical characteristics that help them with their work, including speed and
endurance. Shorter breeds, such as Welsh Corgis, were bred so that they would be out of the way when
cattle, their primary charges, kicked at them.

Herding dogs as pets
Due to their intelligence and beauty, herding dogs are often chosen as family pets. It is important to
remember that these dogs have been bred to work, and must be kept active. Herding breeds will herd
family members, particularly children, in the absence of other charges.

                                    Guide dog training.

Guide dogs are assistance dogs trained to lead blind or visually impaired people around obstacles. They
are commonly but incorrectly called "Seeing Eye" dogs, since Seeing Eye is the name of only one of
many guide dog training schools.

These dogs spend their early lives in foster homes where they are socialized through exposure to loving
attention, and taught rudimentary skills through obedience training. Once potential guide dogs reach a
certain age, they then begin their intense schooling as assistance animals while residing at a training
school before being matched with compatible human partners.
These matches are cemented through a 30-day training course, wherein the human half of the team
learns to control the dog and interpret its signals. Very few visually impaired people go through this
training, and these candidates must already have fully developed orientation and mobility skills before
they do.

Dogs are partially (red-green) color blind and so guide dogs cannot see colors the way people do, nor are
they able to interpret street signs. The human half of the guide dog team does the leading, based upon
skills acquired through previous mobility training.

In several countries, guide dogs are exempt from regulations against the presence of animals in places
such as restaurants and public transportation.

History
The first guide dog training schools were established in Germany during the First World War, to
enhance the mobility of returning veterans who were blinded in combat. The United States followed suit
in 1929 with the Seeing Eye in Morristown, New Jersey. This school was followed, two years later, by
the British Guide Dog Association.

Breeds
Early on, trainers recognized which breeds produced dogs with the most appropriate temperaments for
this work, so that, now, Golden Retrievers, Labradors and sometimes German Shepherd Dogs, are more
likely than dogs of other breeds to be chosen, although by no means does this indicate that only these
three are appropriate (for example, Boxers are also used but as they have a long adolescence they are
less common.) The preferred breed is a Golden Retriever/Labrador cross because both breeds (which are
in fact closely related) are known for their intelligence, responsiveness to obedience, and early
maturation. There is also a recent trend of breeding a Labrador with a Poodle, to create a new
hypoallergenic breed called a Labradoodle that is more suitable for those who suffer allergies. Less
common breeds also trained as guide dogs include Collies, Vizlas, and Dobermans.

Guide dog training
Guide dog puppies generally leave the breeding facility at about 8-10 weeks of age, where they go to
'puppy raisers' or 'puppy walkers.' These are families that volunteer to give training and basic commands
to a potential guide dog for up to 16 months, during which time the raisers or walkers expose the puppy
to as many real-world experiences as possible.

At the end of the 16-month period, the puppy is brought back to the guide dogs school. At this point,
some of the schools conduct a test to analyze the dog's potential for guide dog work. If the dog passes
this test, they continue on to harness training, where they learn to help a person move around safely,
including such achievements as navigating curbs and avoiding overhead obstacles. The dogs may be
taught additional skills, such as retrieving items for their handler.

At the end of approximately two to three months of individual training, blind students are brought to the
school to work with the instructors and get a guide dog. After an additional 3 months, the team is ready
to go out and be on their own.

                                              Dog Agility
                                                                                    Back | Home | Up | Next


Dog agility is a sport in which a handler directs a dog through an obstacle course in an accurate race
against the clock. Dogs must run off-leash with no food or toys as incentives. Consequently, the
handler's only controls are voice and body language, requiring exceptional obedience training of the
animal. In competition, the handler must assess the course, decide on handling strategies and direct the
dog through the course, with precision and speed equally important.

In its simplest form, an agility course consists of a set of standard obstacles, laid out by an agility judge
in a design of his own choosing on a roughly 100 by 100 foot (30 by 30 m) area, with numbers
indicating the order in which the dog must complete the obstacles.

Competition basics
Because each course is different, handlers are allowed a short walk-through before the competition
starts. During this time, all handlers competing in a particular class can walk or run around the course
without their dogs, determining how they can best position themselves and guide their dogs to get the
most accurate and rapid path around the numbered obstacles.

The walk-through is critical for success because the course's path takes various turns, even U-turns or
270 degree turns, can cross back and on itself, can use the same obstacle more than once, can have two
obstacles so close to each other that the dog and handler must be able to clearly discriminate which to
take, and can be arranged so that the handler must work with obstacles between himself and the dog,
called layering, or at a great distance from the dog.




                                Course map showing the layout of the course in the preceding photos.
Maps like this are commonly used by handlers to help design their strategies. This is a fairly simple,
flowing course, probably used for novice dogs.

Handlers often use printed copies of the course map to help plan their course strategy. There is standard
format used course maps, with obstacles having standard icons, measurements and grid having fairly
standard dimensions (in the U.S., the grid is drawn in ten-foot squares), and numbers indicating the
order in which the obstacles are to be taken.

Each dog and handler team gets one opportunity together to attempt to complete the course successfully.
The dog begins behind a starting line and, when instructed by his handler, proceeds around the course.
The handler typically runs near the dog, directing the dog with spoken commands and with the position
of arms, shoulders, and feet.

Because speed counts as much as accuracy, especially at higher levels of competition, this all takes place
at a full-out run on the dog's part and, in places, on the handler's part as well.

When all competitors have run, scoring is based on how many faults are incurred. In addition to course
faults, such as knocking down a bar in a jump, time faults which are the number of seconds over the
calculated standard course time, which in turn is determined based on the competition level, the
complexity of the course, and other factors.

Agility obstacles
Although different organizations specify somewhat different rules for the construction of obstacles, the
basic form of some obstacles is the same wherever they are used. Obstacles include the following (note
that dimensions vary by organization, so consult the regulations for each organization before purchasing
or building equipment):

Contact obstacles

A-frame
      Two platforms, usually about 3 feet (1 m) wide by 8 to 9 feet (3 m) long, hinged together and
      raised so that the hinged connection is between five and six-and-a-quarter feet above the ground
      (depending on the organization), forming roughly an A shape. The bottom 36 to 42 inches (1 m)
      of both sides of the A-frame are painted a bright color, usually yellow, forming the contact zone,
      onto which the dog must place at least one paw while ascending and descending. Most
      sanctioning organizations require that A-frames have low profile, narrow, horizontal slats all
      along their length to assist the dog's grip going up and down.

Dogwalk
     Three 8 to 12 ft (3 to 4 m) planks, 9 to 12 inches (25 to 30 cm) wide, connected at the ends. The
     center plank is raised to about 4 feet (1.2 m) above the ground, so that the two end planks form
     ramps leading up to and down from the center plank. This obstacle also has contact zones. Most
     sanctioning organizations also require slats on the dogwalk ramps; a slatless dogwalk looks
     almost the same as a teeter-totter to a dog approaching it head-on.
                                      Teeter-totter - Dogs, such as this Welsh Corgi, must be in control
as it hits the ground but then continue running.

Teeter-totter (or seesaw)
       A 10 to 12 foot (3 to 4 m) plank pivoting on a support, much like a child's seesaw. It is
       constructed slightly off-balance so that the same end always returns to the ground. This is done
       either by placing the support slightly off-centre or else weighting one end of the board. This
       obstacle also has contact zones. The balance point and the weight of the plank must be such that
       even a tiny dog, such as a Papillon or Chihuahua, can cause the high end of the teeter-totter to
       descend to the ground within a reasonable amount of time, specified by the sanctioning
       organization's rules (usually about 2 seconds). Smaller dogs get more time to run a course, and
       this is one reason why it can take them longer than it takes larger dogs.

Crossover
      Picture a 4 foot (1.2 m) high table (see "Miscellaneous") obstacle with dogwalk ramps
      descending from the center of all four sides. The dog must ascend the correct ramp and then
      possibly change direction at the top to descend the ramp indicated by the handler. This has not
      been a commonly used obstacle, mostly because of its size, and not all organizations have
      allowed it.
                                 Tunnel - This Boxer demonstrates how most dogs run full speed
through a tunnel, often using the back of a curved tunnel rather than trying to remain vertical.

Tunnels

Tunnel (or chute)
      A vinyl tube, 10 to 20 feet (3 to 6 m) long and about 2 feet (60 cm) in diameter, through which
      the dog runs. The tunnel is constructed of flexible vinyl and wire so that it can be configured in a
      straight line or curved.

Collapsed tunnel (also called chute)
      A barrel-like cylinder with a tube of fabric attached around one end. The fabric extends about 8
      to 12 feet (3 to 4 m) and lies closed until the dog runs into the open end of the chute and pushes
      his way out through the fabric tube.

Tunnel maze
      A new obstacle (as of 2004) consisting of several interconnected tunnels through which the
      handler must guide the dog by voice commands. In the United States, only CPE currently allows
      this obstacle, and it must be an optional obstacle when used.
                                     Winged single jump - Jump heights, and often course times, are
adjusted so that small dogs such as Jack Russell Terriers compete against similar-sized dogs.

Jumps

Jump (or hurdle)
      Two upright bars supporting a horizontal bar over which the dog jumps. The height is adjusted
      for dogs of different heights. The uprights can be simple bars or can have wings of various
      shapes, sizes, and colors.

Double and triple jumps
      Two or three sets of uprights, each with horizontal poles. The Double can have parallel or
      ascending horizontal bars; the triple always has ascending bars. The spread between the
      horizontal bars is sometimes adjusted based on the height of the dog.

Panel jump
       Instead of horizontal bars, the jump is a solid panel from the ground up to the jump height,
       constructed of several short panels that can be removed to adjust the height for different dog
       heights.

Broad jump
       A set of four or five slightly raised platforms that form a broad area over which the dog must
       jump without setting their feet on any of the platforms. Length is adjusted for dog's height.

Tire jump
       This is just what it sounds like: A tire shape suspended in a frame. The dog must jump through
       the opening of the tire, which varies between about 18 and 24 inches (450 to 600 mm). The tire is
       usually wrapped with tape so that there are no openings or uneven places in which the dog could
       catch. The height is adjusted for dogs of different sizes.

Miscellaneous

Table (or pause table)
       An elevated square platform about 3-foot-by-3-foot (1-meter-by-1-meter) square onto which the
       dog must jump and pause, either sitting or in a down position, for a designated period of time
       which is counted out by the judge, usually about 5 seconds. The height ranges from about 8 to 30
       inches (20 to 75 cm) depending on the dog's height and sponsoring organisation.

Pause box
       A variation on the pause table. The pause box is a square marked off on the ground, usually with
       plastic pipe or construction tape, where the dog must perform the "pause" behavior (in either a sit
       or a down) just as he would on the elevated table.




                                  Labrador Retriever demonstrates fast weave poles.

Weave poles
     Similar to a slalom, this is a series of upright poles, each about 3 feet (1 m) tall and spaced about
     20 inches (50 cm) apart, through which the dog weaves. It is one of the most difficult obstacles
     for a dog to master. It varies from 5 to 12 poles at one time. The dog must always enter with the
     first pole to his left and must not skip poles.

Agility scoring and clean runs
Each organization has its own rules about what constitutes faults and whether one can earn a qualifying
score with faulted runs. A completed run that passes the minimum defined standards for time, faults,
points, or so on, is referred to as a qualifying run and in some cases earns credit towards agility titles. A
qualifying run is also referred to as a leg. A clean run is one with no faults.
Different organizations place different values on faults, which can include the following:


                                Going over the maximum time alloted by the judge to complete a course
 Time faults
                                (the standard course time (SCT)).

 Missed contact                 When the dog fails to place a foot in the contact zone while performing
                                a contact obstacle. In popular jargon, a flyoff is when the dog misses the
                                descending contact zone because he leaps from the obstacle a long way
                                above the zone, often in a spectacular flying manner.

 Knocked or dropped bar         Displacing a bar (or panel) when going over a jump.

 Weave pole fault               The dog must enter with the first pole to his left and proceed through the
                                weaves without skipping any. Entering incorrectly, skipping poles, or
                                backweaving when attempting to correct missed poles can all be faulted.

 Off course                     Dog takes the wrong obstacle on a course in which the obstacles are
                                numbered sequentially.

 Refusal                        The dog makes an approach towards the correct obstacle, but then turns
                                away or hesitates significantly before attempting the obstacle.

 Runout                         The dog does not directly approach the next obstacle, instead running
                                past it.

 Other faults                   Can include dog biting the judge or the handler or other
                                unsportsmanlike behavior, the handler exhibiting unsportsmanlike
                                behavior, the dog eliminating in the ring, the dog leaving the ring and
                                not coming back, the handler carrying toys or food into the ring, the dog
                                running with his collar on (collars are prohibited in some organizations),
                                and others.


Agility classes
Given the available set of obstacles and possible faults, there are many permutations of games, or
classes, that one can play on the agility field. A typical course is laid out within a 100 by 100 foot (30 by
30 m) area, with roughly 10 to 20 feet (3 to 6 m) between obstacles.

Judges design their own courses (with the exception of NADAC where judge's pick their courses from a
book) using the rules of the sanctioning organization. Each organization decides which classes are valid
for achieving titles and how each must be performed, but there are many similarities.
Some of the common classes are

    ●   Standard or Regular: This is a numbered course consisting of (usually) at least one of each of
        the three contact obstacles plus jumps, tunnels, and weave poles of various flavors. A novice
        course might consist of as few as 15 obstacles; a higher-level course might have 22. The dog
        must negotiate the obstacles in the correct order within the standard course time (SCT).

    ●   Jumpers: This numbered course consists primarily of various types of jumps and, depending on
        the organization, also weave poles and tunnels. The dog must negotiate the obstacles in the
        correct order within the standard course time (SCT). The dogs achieve their fastest speed on these
        courses because there are no contact obstacles to slow them down.

    ●   Gamblers , Jackpot or Joker: An unnumbered course. The game typically consists of two parts,
        an opening period and the closing period, also known as the gamble, joker, or jackpot. In the
        opening period, the dog has a certain amount of time in which to do whatever obstacles the
        handler deems appropriate and accrues points based on the obstacles completed. At the end of the
        allocated time for the opening period, a whistle blows. At that point, the gamble begins. The dog
        has a certain small amount of time (about 15 seconds) in which to complete a sequence of
        obstacles designated by the judge ahead of time. The challenge is that there is a line on the
        ground past which the handler must not step, typically parallelling the gamble obstacles, from 10
        to 20 feet (3 to 6 m) away depending on the level of competition. The handler must choose an
        opening sequence that flows comfortably for the individual dog's skills and experience. The
        sequence must also be planned so that, when the whistle blows, the dog is in a good position to
        immediately begin the gamble. The greatest challenge is the distance handling--getting the dog
        to move or even turn away from you.

    ●   Snooker: Loosely based on the pool game of Snooker. The course has at least three red jumps,
        each numbered 1, and six other obstacles numbered 2 through 7. The dog accumulates points
        based on the obstacle's number. This also has two parts, an opening sequence and a closing
        sequence. In the opening sequence, the dog must complete a 1, then any obstacle numbered 2 to
        7, a different 1 and any 2 to 7 obstacle (including the one already performed), and yet another
        different 1 and another 2-7 obstacle. For example, the dog could perform the red on the left for 1
        point, the 7-point obstacle, the red in the middle for 1 point and then the 7-pointer again, then the
        red on the far side of the course and the 7-pointer one more time, for a total of 24 points in the
        opening. After successfully completing this, the dog must complete the obstacles 2-7, in order,
        for an additional possible 27 points. Failure to follow these rules exactly (such as knocking a bar
        or taking 2 reds in a row) results in the dog and handler being whistled off the course.
             ❍ Strategy and entertainment value: The dogs might have to negotiate between other

                obstacles without taking them or make a difficult entry to the obstacle, often combined
                with a longer distance between the reds and the 7 so that it consumes more time to do the
                higher-point obstacle in the opening.
Fairness among dogs
Although each organization has its own rules, all divide dogs into smaller groups that are close to each
other in size and experience for purposes of calculating winners. This means that there will be winners
in each group for each class (or game) over the course of a trial.

Dogs are measured in height at the peak of their withers (shoulders). They are then divided into height
groups; for example, dogs measuring between 12 and 16 inches (30 and 37.5 cm) might compete
together with the jumps set at a height of 16 inches (37.5 cm). This ensures that dogs who might have an
advantage on a particular course because of their size (larger or smaller) keep the advantage to a
minimum.

Dogs are further divided into their experience levels. So, for example, you might have the 12 inch (30
cm) Novice dogs competing, the 12 inch (30 cm) Intermediate dogs competing, and the 12 inch (30 cm)
Masters dogs competing. Dogs typically have to have certain numbers of successes at lower levels
before they can move up to compete with more advanced dogs.

Some organizations even further divide dogs into special categories because the dogs are older (usually
over 7 years) or have junior handlers (usually under 18) or the like.

History of dog agility
Dog agility is a fairly new sport, created as merely a demonstration in the late 1970s in the United
Kingdom. It has since spread rapidly around the world, with major competitions held worldwide.

Its first widely-documented appearance was as entertainment at the Crufts dog show in 1978. John
Varley, a committee member from the 1977 show, was tasked with coming up with entertainment for the
audience between the obedience and conformation competitions in the main ring. Varley asked dog
trainer Peter Meanwell for assistance, and they presented a largely jumping-style course resembling
something from the equestrian world to demonstrate dogs' natural speed and agility. It was reported in
Our Dogs newspaper in 1974 that Meanwell had either been a witness to or participated in such a
competition at an agricultural fair, thus pre-dating more widely published accounts for the start of dog
agility. (By some oral accounts, there was an earlier demo with similar intent using playground articles
such as a teeter-totter and a tunnel, although this has not been documented. Another account attributes
the other obstacles to exhibitions by the Royal Air Force K-9 Corps exhibitions of the time, which is
more plausible, given the nature of the first regulations for dog agility in the UK.)

At the 1978 Crufts, the demonstration immediately intrigued dog owners because of its speed and
challenge and the dexterity displayed by the dogs. People wanted to see more, and indeed wanted their
own dogs to be able to participate. The demonstration was so popular that it grew into local, then
national, and eventually international, competitions with standardized equipment. In 1980, The Kennel
Club became the first organization to recognize agility as an official sport with a sanctioned set of rules.
By this time, agility equipment included some additional elements modified from the training of police
dogs and Schutzhund competitions, such as the A-frame and the dogwalk.

History in the United States

In the United States, several people experimented with dog agility based generally on the KC rules. The
first exhibitions took place in the early 1980s.

USDAA's influence

In 1985, Kenneth Tatsch collaborated with his local obedience club and others, and began putting on
exhibitions in Texas. A year later he founded the United States Dog Agility Association (USDAA) and
incorporated in January 1987 in Texas. To promote the sport, USDAA secured Pedigree Dog Food
(formerly Kal Kan Dog Food, a sister company to Chum Dog Food, the guiding sponsor in the UK) as a
sponsor, and the first national championship tournament series in North America—the Grand Prix of
Dog Agility—was introduced in 1988 at the Astro World Series of Dog Shows in Houston, Texas.

Until 1990, USDAA agility competitions were only for placement ribbons, but at that time the USDAA
began offering agility titles, for which the dog had to perform to certain standards in several
competitions to earn scores towards the various titles. At first, the only titles offered were the Agility
Dog (AD), or starters-level title; the AAD Advanced Agility Dog (AAD), or intermediate-level title, and
the Master Agility Dog (MAD), or expert-level title. This increased the appeal for all dog owners; one's
dog did not have to be a superstar to succeed at agility, but could simply be good enough and fast
enough to meet the requirements to earn title points. USDAA's vision was far broader than a single class,
and in 1994, USDAA introduced an expansive titling program to incorporate title recognition in each of
four nonstandard classes (those other than the basic form)—gamblers choice, jumping, snooker agility,
and relay.

In 1988, almost no one had heard of dog agility in the United States, while meanwhile in England it had
become an extremely popular sport, drawing hundreds of spectators. By 1989, however, when the
USDAA Grand Prix of Dog Agility was first filmed for TV, nearly 2000 spectators attended the final
round. Just a year later, attendance neared 4000. The event's popularity sparked interest around the
country, and in 1989, Tatsch expanded the tournament to include local qualifying events, hosted by
groups formed by competitors in attendance at the Grand Prix the prior year in Texas. The tournament
grew rapidly, jumping from 8 events in 1989 to more than 150 local and regional championship events
in 2004, in five countries, leading to a World Championship event. Tatsch also named his first Advisory
Board composed of experienced trainers and agility enthusiasts from different parts of the country, who
began working on a set of regulations for titling programs that were adopted in May 1990.

Meanwhile, the agility equipment used by the USDAA mirrored its British counterparts, as did the basic
rules for the standard agility course. USDAA also introduced Jumpers Classes and other nonstandard
classes from Great Britain, such as Gamblers and Snooker, which encourage handlers to design their
own courses under strict sets of rules established by the judge on the day of competition, and the Relay,
which pairs up two dogs and two handlers to take on a course resembling the standard agility course.

AKC

The AKC, which for decades had sanctioned dog shows, obedience trials, and other dog sports joined
the agility world. In 1987, Charles (Bud) Kramer founded the National Club for Dog Agility (NCDA) in
Manhattan, Kansas with the goal of convincing the AKC to recognize agility as a sport. When the AKC
entered the field each competition had only one standard course. The first AKC event to include a
sanctioned agility match was held in August at the St. Croix Valley Kennel Club Show in Lake Elmo,
Minnesota. Sanctioning by the AKC made the rapidly growing sport nearly explode in the United States,
as AKC handlers began exploring USDAA and NADAC competitions as ways to expand their agility
experience. A few years later, AKC introduced its own version of the Jumpers course, which included
weave poles as did the International rules but which NADAC and USDAA did not include.

Additional organizations

Bob and Marliu Basin created the American Agility Associates in Colorado. Neither of these
organizations lasted much beyond the early 1990s. In 1993, Sharon Nelson founded her own agility
corporation, the North American Dog Agility Council (NADAC), using a slightly different set of rules
and concepts. At that time, NADAC and USDAA used the same equipment and had similar rules for the
standard numbered and jumpers courses; NADAC also included the Gamblers event in its rulebook.

The United Kennel Club (UKC) introduced its own rules at about the same time; UKC agility has
evolved into a different kind of sport than that provided by AKC, USDAA, and international agility
organizations, involving more control of the dog over complicated obstacles rather than speed and
accuracy over basic obstacles.

When the FCI introduced its international agility championships, it continued its affiliation with
purebred kennel clubs around the world, including the AKC, allowing the AKC to choose a team from
among its registered competitors. As a result, many top-level American dogs without AKC registration
were shut out of international competition. To compensate, two additional organizations--the
International Agility Link (organized through email) and the World Dog Show--sponsored international
competitions starting around 1996 that allowed any competing dogs to be part of their country's teams;
the World Dog Show affiliated with the USDAA, while the IAL remained independent. The World Dog
Show hosted a couple of international championships but financially could not continue, so the USDAA
began pursuing its own affiliations with other organizations and clubs worldwide to start its own
International Championships. In 2001, the Grand Prix of Dog Agility®, previously national in scope
reached beyond North American boundaries and became a truly international event, hosting teams from
several countries on other contients..
Meanwhile, in the early 1990s, the Australian Shepherd Club of America (ASCA) decided to provide its
own sanctioning rules for agility in lockstep with NADAC, so that one could earn either ASCA or
NADAC titles, or both, at dual-sanctioned events. However, over time, NADAC has moved away from
the International standards, focusing on its own vision of a faster but less physically stressful
environment. It has gradually eliminated or changed many of the obstacles so that its equipment
specifications and many of its rules no longer match those of the USDAA, AKC, or FCI. As of May
31st, 2006, ASCA and NADAC will no longer be dual sanctioning trials as the ASCA agility program
returns to an earlier set of rules that more closely match those of the rest of the agility community.

In 1995, Canine Performance Events (CPE) was founded by Linda Eikholt, who preferred an
environment that was less intense and with less rigorous requirements than those preferred by the
USDAA, yet retained the variety of events and the invitation for able-bodied dogs of any ancestry to
compete. CPE agility continues to grow in the United States.

Continuing changes

The sport of agility continues to grow and change. Every year brings the addition of new clubs and new
classes. The rules for each organization go through periodic review as well, requiring that competitors in
each organization keep up with the current rules, regulations, and class offerings.

Agility in the United States
The first agility competition in the United States took place around 1986 under the rules of the newly-
formed United States Dog Agility Association (USDAA).

The following organizations have rules for agility performance, titles, and equipment in the United
States. These organizations sanction clubs to allow them to host agility competitions ("trials" or
"matches").

Agility titles and championships
For most sanctioning organizations, there are a variety of titles that a dog and handler can earn by
accruing sufficient qualifying runs--also called legs--that is, runs that have no more than a certain
number of faults (typically none) and are faster than the maximum standard course time (SCT).

For example, under USDAA rules, a dog can earn novice-level titles in Standard, Jumpers, Gamblers,
Snooker, and Pairs Relay classes by earning 3 qualifying runs in each of the classes; the dog can also
earn intermediate-level titles and masters-level titles in the same classes. After earning all of the masters-
level titles--five qualifying runs in each, with some that must be in the top 15% of dogs competing at
each trial--the dog earns its Championship. Other organizations have similar schemes; in AKC, to earn
the Championship, the dog's qualifying runs must be earned two at a time on the same day; in NADAC,
the quantity of qualifying runs is much larger; and so on. Most champion titles have "CH" in the title:
NATCH (NADAC Agility Trial Champion), ADCH (Agility Dog Champion for USDAA), CATCH
(CPE Agility Trial Champion), MACH (Master Agility Champion for AKC), TACH (Teacup Agility
Champion), ATCH (ASCA Agility Trial Champion) and so on.

National championships

In addition, each sanctioning organization holds its National championships each year. Dogs must meet
certain minimum scoring requirements to qualify to compete in the annual championship; for example,
must earn qualifying scores in at least 50% of the runs at each of at least 3 trials during the year; or must
place in the top certain percentage of dogs at certain trials; or must have a qualifying run in special
regional qualifying events; and so on.

Just as with any agility competition, there will be national champions at each height category because it
is not really possible for dogs of greatly different sizes to compete equally. For example, USDAA has
12", 16", 22", and 26" (30, 40, 55, and 66 cm) jump height categories; it crowns 4 national Grand Prix
champions each year, as well as four Veterans and four Performance (lower-level performance) Grand
Prix champions. It also holds championships for its Dog Agility Steeplechase® and its Dog Agility
Masters® Three-Dog Team tournament series.

International championships

Some competitions invite qualified entrants from multiple countries, thereby making them International
Championships. Examples:

     ●   FCI, the oldest and best-known, usually held in Europe
     ●   The International Federation of Cynological Sports (IFCS), since 2002 has organized a biannual
        international agility world championship competition open to any breed or mixed-breed dog
        regardless of pedigree. The United States, via the United States Dog Agility Association
        (USDAA), is an associate member along with, as of 2005, more than twenty participating
        countries.

Training
Teaching a dog the basic execution of most obstacles takes only a small amount of time and simple
training techniques; most dogs can be readily convinced to run through a short, straight tunnel to chase a
toy or to go to their owner, for example. However, to compete in agility trials and to develop speed and
accuracy, both dog and handler must learn a wide range of techniques for doing the equipment,
performing sequences of obstacles, and communicating on course while running full out.

The teeter-totter and the weave poles are probably the most challenging obstacles to teach, the first
because many dogs are wary of the board's movement, and the second because it is not a behavior that
they would do naturally over a series of 12 poles. However, it can also be challenging to train the dog to
perform its contact obstacles in a manner that ensures that they get paws into the contact zone without
sacrificing speed.

Training techniques vary greatly. For example, techniques for training the weave poles include using
offset poles that gradually move more in line with each other; using poles that tilt outward from the base
and gradually become upright; using wires or gates around the poles forcing the dog into the desired
path; putting a hand in the dog's collar and guiding the dog through while leading with a toy or treat;
teaching the dog to run full speed between 2 poles and gradually increasing the angle of approach and
number of poles; and many other techniques.

                                                 Flyball
                                                                                  Back | Home | Up | Next




                               Dogs from two teams race against each other over parallel lines of
jumps. The jump height is based on the smallest dog on each team.




                                    The dog hits a spring-loaded box in which a team member has placed a
tennis ball; this releases the ball, which the dog catches and returns over the line of jumps.

Flyball is a dog sport in which teams of dogs race against each other from their handlers, over a line of
hurdles, to a box that releases a tennis ball to be caught when the dog presses the spring loaded pad, then
back to their handlers while carrying the ball.

Flyball is run in teams of four dogs, as a relay. The course is four hurdles placed 10 feet (3 m) apart
from each other, with the starting line six feet (1.8 m) from the first hurdle, and the flyball box 15 feet
(4.5 m) after the last one, making for a 51-foot (15.5 m) length. The hurdle height is determined by the
shoulder height of the smallest dog in the team, and should be 4 inches (10 cm) below that, to a height of
no less than 8 inches (20.3 cm) and no greater than 16 inches (40.6 cm). Each dog must return its ball all
the way across the start line before the next dog in released, and penalties can be applied to team time if
the ball is dropped or if the next relay dog is released early.

Invented in California in the 1970s, flyball took off during the 1980s and the first flyball organization,
the North American Flyball Association, was created to design uniform competition rules and to
promote the sport. Flyball provides an entertaining and active way to interact with one's dog and other
dog lovers in an environment that is fun and allows the dogs to get lots of exercise and enjoyment. It is
especially a great way to burn off the energy of dogs with a high drive to work, such as Border Collies
and Terriers.
A great part of flyball's popularity stems from the fact that it is one of the competition activities
available to mixed-breed dogs, allowing rescued mutts to shine along side their purebred canine friends.
Though herding dogs currently dominate the courses, many champion teams have mutts on them.

Also, flyball is not limited to the size of the breed, as smaller dogs such as Parson Russell Terriers and
Whippets often compete with great success in mixed-breed teams (teams consisting of dogs of various
sizes and breeds), especially because the hurdle height is based on the height of the smallest dog in the
team. Their only limitation is whether they can trigger the release pad, and small dogs often have to fully
jump on it to do so.

Flyball is one of the non-hunting dog sports in which dogs and people work as a team together. Many
casual pet owners use their flyball time more as a way to relax and socialize with other dog owners than
as a competition, and many champion flyball dogs are essentially pet dogs with a hobby, not dedicated
sporting dogs.

                                              Irish setter

The Setter is a type of gundog used most often for hunting game such as quail, pheasant, and grouse. A
setter silently searches for game by scent. When prey is encountered the dog's behavior defies nature,
and the dog freezes rather than chases after the game. Setters get their name from their distinctive
stance; a sort of crouch or "set" upon finding their quarry. Most setters are born with a natural proclivity
to hunting. Dogs which show excitement and interest in birds are described as being "birdy", and trainers
look for puppies that show this particular trait. Training is usually done with domesticated pigeons.

The ancestors of modern setters probably originated in Spain in the 1500s and evolved from spaniels.
Later these dogs were exported to France and England where the breeds were developed into today's
varieties.

Most setter breeds have long, silky coats that require maintenance. Setters have a tendency to be happy,
playful dogs and are usually very friendly both to people and other dogs. They have a great deal of
energy and require daily exercise.

Setters include the following breeds:

    ●   English Setter
    ●   Gordon Setter
    ●   Irish Setter
    ●   Irish Red and White Setter

A retriever is a family of gundogs that retrieve game for a hunter. These dogs were originally bred to
retrieve birds or other prey and return them to the hunter without damage. As a result, retrieving breeds
have extremely gentle mouths and a great willingness to please, learn, and obey. These traits have made
retrievers such as the Labrador Retriever and Golden Retriever popular as Assistance dogs.

                            Notes



A Beagle is a medium-sized dog breed and a member of the hound group, similar in appearance to a
Foxhound but smaller with shorter legs, and with longer, softer ears. Beagles are scent hounds used
primarily for hunting rabbits to larger hares.

Appearance
The Beagle has a somewhat oval skull; a medium-length, square-cut muzzle; large, hound-like hazel or
brown eyes; long, low-set ears (big), turning towards the cheeks slightly and rounded at the tips; a
medium-length, strong neck without folds in the skin; a broad chest narrowing to a tapered abdomen and
waist; a short, slightly curved tail; an overall muscular body; and a medium-length, smooth, hard coat.
One standard calls for ideally shaped beagles to be twice as long as tall, and twice as tall as wide.

They appear in a range of colors, not limited to the familiar tricolor (white with large black and light
brown spots). Two-color varieties are always white with colored areas, including such colors as
"lemon", a very light tan; "red", a reddish, almost orangish brown; "liver", a darker brown, is the only
colour not allowed. "Ticked" varieties may be either white or black with different colored spots
("ticking"), such as the bluetick beagle, which has spots that appear to be a midnight-blue color, similar
to the bluetick coonhound. Some tricolor beagles also have ticking of various colors in their white areas.
The brown is usually the last color to appear on beagles, usually taking 1-2 years to fully develop.
Beagles have a white-tipped tail, or "flag", which is important in locating them in the field due to their
short height.

Breed varieties

The American Kennel Club and the Canadian Kennel Club recognize two separate varieties of Beagle:
the 13-inch for hounds less than 13 inches, and the 15-inch for those between 13 and 15 inches. The
Kennel Club (UK) and FCI affiliated clubs recognize a single type, with a height of between 13 and 16
inches.

In Medieval times, there was a breed called a "pocket beagle", which stood at 8–9 inches. This breed no
longer exists, and many claims by some breeders to have pocket beagles for sale usually indicate poor
breeding practices.

Temperament
                                  The Beagle has a very well-developed sense of smell

The Beagle has a very good temper and gentle disposition. Beagles are intelligent, but are stubborn and
may be hard to train (due to their strong will). They are an especially loyal breed and are very friendly.
They rarely show signs of aggression, and are excellent with children. Beagles also get along with other
dogs, provided that they have been socialized correctly.

They are playful and energetic dogs who enjoy long walks. Never let a Beagle off its leash except in a
confined area. If released, it may follow a scent endlessly or will incessantly try to tag along with other
dogs.

Beagles are pack animals, and can be prone to separation anxiety. Beagles are best in pairs if they are
going to be alone for long periods of time.

Health
Beagles are a healthy breed, often living for 12 to 15 years, but they do have a few common health
problems.

The Beagle's ears are long and floppy, which can trap warm moist air or prevent air from reaching the
ear canals. This condition can be successfully treated with regular cleaning daily and sometimes
medication for major cases. Careless bathing can get water into their ears, potentially causing ear
infections.

Sometimes their eyelashes grow into the eye and irritate the eye; this might require surgery to remove
the eyelashes.

Obesity is a common health problem in Beagles due to people overfeeding them in response to their
playful and kind behavior. A healthy Beagle should have some definition to its waist and have an
hourglass appearance when viewed from above. You should be able to feel their ribs. Excessive weight
can lead to problems such as hip dysplasia and heart trouble. They need exercise and a good diet.

Some Beagles are prone to congenital heart disease.

In some rare cases Beagles may develop polyarthritis (where the immune system attacks the joints) even
at a young age. This can be sometimes treated effectively with cortisone.

Beagles are also prone to seizures/epilepsy. This disease is treatable with medication.

History




                                 The rare instance of a Beagle taking a break.

Beagles (or their ancestors) appear to have been used for hare hunting in England as early as the reign of
Edward III, who had a pack of up to 120 hare hounds with him on the battlefield during the Hundred
Years' War. The first mention of the beagle in English literature by name dates from 1475. The origin of
the word "beagle" is uncertain, although it has been suggested that the word derives from the French
begueule (meaning "open throat", or more colloquially, "loudmouth") or from an Old English, French, or
Welsh term beag, meaning "small." Other possibilities include the French beugler (meaning "to bellow")
and the German begele (meaning "to scold").

Beagles were originally used for hunting, and still are in some places. Beagling has been referred to as
"the poor person's foxhunting," as a Beagle pack (30–40 dogs) is followed on foot, not horseback. The
usual quarry is the hare. Beagles are admired by some for the bloodcurdling "Beagle music" they emit
when in full pursuit, also called tonguing. Beagling, like foxhunting, is banned in England. Drag hunting
is another Beagle sport.

Working life
                                 A Very Happy Beagle Puppy

Beagles have superb noses and, despite their self-willed temperament, are sometimes used as sniffer
dogs for drug detection. More often, though, they are the breed of choice of the United States
Department of Agriculture to detect food items in luggage being transported into the U.S. The force is
called the Beagle Brigade and these dogs wear a green jacket. Beagles were chosen because they are
small and easy to care for, and because they are not as intimidating for people who are uncomfortable
around dogs. They are also used for this purpose by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in New
Zealand and by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (for whom they wear maroon jackets).

Beagles are the dog breed most often used in animal testing, due to ther passive nature.

                                 Hounds have been used for hunting since ancient times, as suggested by
this statue of the goddess Diana hunting.

A hound is a type of dog that assists hunters by tracking or chasing the animal being hunted. Compare
with gun dogs, which assist hunters by identifying the location of prey or retrieving it rather than by
chasing it.

There are two types of hound, with several breeds belonging to each type:


                                  Type                                               Example

                                    A Rough Collie

Collie refers to a breed of herding dog originating primarily in Scotland. The exact origin of the name is
uncertain, although it probably originates in Older Scots col(l) (coal), meaning black.

The Lassie movies, books, and television shows, which starred Rough Collies, helped to popularize
Collies in the United States and the United Kingdom, as well as in many other countries. The Collie
Club of America [1] is one of the oldest breed-specific clubs in existence in the United States (founded
in 1886). However, there are three different dog breeds with "Collie" in their name:

    ●   Collie (including both Rough Collie and Smooth Collie varieties)
    ●   Border Collie
    ●   Bearded Collie

The farm collie was a generic term for a wide range of herding dogs common in North America until the
middle of the 20th century.

Shetland Sheepdogs (commonly known as "Shelties") are sometimes mistaken for Collies, but are a
completely different breed of distinct origin.

The highlands of Scotland were the natural home of the Collie, where the sheepdogs had been used for
centuries by shepherds, but the modern form of the breed was mostly developed in England in the late
1800s. This early form of the breed was usually referred to as the Scotch collie (or Scottish collie) in the
19th and early 20th centuries. Scotch collies were heavier and less fine-boned than today's Rough and
Smooth dogs. The ancestors of the modern Collie were first exhibited as "Scotch Sheep-Dogs" in the
1860 Birmingham (England) dog show.




                                     A rough tri-color puppy.

The modern Collie of both Rough and Smooth varieties are available in four distinct colors. Sable and
White dogs are generally the most recognizable, the choice of the Lassie television and movie producers.
The sable color on these dogs can range from a light blonde color to a deep reddish-brown, with any hue
in between possible. Tri-Color dogs are mostly black and white with sable markings. Blue Merle collies
are best described as Tri-Color dogs whose black has been diluted to a mottled gray-blue color. White
collies are usually mostly white on the body with a head coloration of any of the three previous. A lesser-
known variant of collie coloring is that of the "phantom merle" - a seemingly tricolor dog, with only
perhaps a slight merling of one or two areas of fur, who actually carries the gene for merling. If bred to
another dog with a merle gene, the resulting pups may be "double-dilute" - which can result in
devastating neurological conditions.

As modern-day "Lassies", both rough and smooth collies have become successful guide dogs, service
dogs, and therapy dogs. At least one guide dog school (Southeastern Guide Dogs in Florida) currently
trains smooth coated collies as guide dogs, and a number of collie service dogs are currently partnered
with disabled individuals around the United States.

                                             Dog Attack
                                                                                 Back | Home | Up | Next


Dog attacks on humans have become common news items in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.
There is much debate over whether the attacks can be blamed on the prevalence of certain breeds of
dogs or whether they are due primarily to the actions or inactions of the dogs owners.

After thousands of years of domestication and selective breeding for dogs who do not show aggression
towards humans, most dogs are unlikely to attack people. However, provocation can range from
something as seemingly innocuous as a toddler pulling a dog's tail, in which case the dog might nip to
discourage the behavior, to something completely transparent to humans, such as an odor or a movement
that sets a dog off, to blatant human aggression or violence towards a dog, causing it to defend itself.
There are hundreds of shades of provocation; it is not always a black and white case as to why a dog
might attack a human.

No matter the reason, dogs can inflict serious injury to humans. As evidenced by their attacks on other
creatures, both wild and domestic dogs are superpredators. Their sharp teeth and powerful jaws can
inflict serious injuries; their sharp claws have powerful muscles behind them. Scratches from dogs are
easily infected. Even a boisterous dog of adequate size can knock down a person and possibly cause
serious injury although there was no intent on the part of the animal. A single large dog, or a group of
medium-sized dogs, are capable of seriously injuring or killing an adult human.

Note that dogs can exhibit dog aggression towards other dogs without ever exhibiting aggression
towards humans. These are generally accepted to be separate traits.

Human-dog interactions
Education for adults and children, animal training, selective breeding for temperament, and society's
intolerance for dangerous animals combine to reduce the incidence of attacks and accidents involving
humans and dogs. However, improperly managed confrontations can lead to severe injury from even the
most well-tempered dog, much like most humans can be incited to violence given sufficient provocation.

Ignoring a dog's warning bark can be very dangerous. A wagging tail indicates an attempt to
communicate excitement, but a territorial dog may wag its tail at a chance to defend its home. A highly
disturbed dog may sometimes emit confusing or misleading signals, much as humans can be difficult to
read or misleading.

Human behavior as provocation
Some human behavior (especially by people unfamiliar with dogs) can potentially evoke a predatory or
aggressive response from some dogs. Not every dog responds to all or even any of these behaviors with
aggression. However, some do. These behaviors include:

    ●   Attacking a dog or its companions, or acting in a manner that the dog perceives as an attack (for
        example, a sudden enthusiastic hug or inadvertently stepping on any portion of the dog's
        anatomy, such as a paw or tail).
    ●   Attempting to take food away from a dog, or moving towards a dog's food or between a dog and
        its food, even inadvertently.
    ●   Threatening a puppy in the presence of an adult dog, especially its mother.
    ●   Looking a dog directly in the eyes. In dog communication, this is an act of dominance or
        aggression. This is more dangerous when on the same visual level as the dog (such as small
        children), or when the human is unfamiliar to the dog.
    ●   Approaching a sick or injured dog. Note that older dogs, like people, often become "cranky" and
        develop a tendency to become "snappish".
    ●   Related to the previous point, failure to recognize a dog showing signs of insecurity or fear and
        continuing whatever behavior is causing the dog's anxiety to increase, until "fear biting" occurs.
        Again, an older or chronically infirm dog is liable to develop feelings of vulnerability and
        anxiety, and therefore become less tolerant and more aggressive.
    ●   Running away from a dog: the atavistic chase-and-catch instinct is not fully lost, and most dogs
        can outrun and overtake the average human.
    ●   Similarly, the natural instinct to jerk one's hands upwards away from an inquisitive dog often
        elicits in the dog a strong impulse to grab and hold, or at least to investigate, resulting in the dog
        jumping on the person and thrusting its head towards the raised hands.
    ●   Ignoring "Beware of Dog" signs: trained attack dogs, unlike most dogs, may attack an intruder
        without warning.
    ●   Startling a resting or sleeping dog.
    ●   Entering a dog's "territory" and behaving in an unfamiliar pattern or being unfamiliar to the dog.
        The dog's territorialism, powerful senses, and latent ferocity makes almost any dog, irrespective
        of size, a powerful deterrent to burglars. The territory that a dog recognizes as its own may not
        coincide with the property lines that its owner and the legal authorities recognize such as the
        inside of a neighbor's home
    ●   Attempting to disrupt a fight between dogs.

Many adoption agencies test for certain aggressive behaviours in dogs, and destroy any animal that
shows certain types of aggression.

Child safety

In 1999, more child maulings by dogs were as a result of a child being left alone with a Golden Retriever
than with any other breed of dog. A parent would rarely leave a child alone with an unknown pitbull, but
people forget that a even a cute dog is still a dog. Just because a dog typically has a good temperament,
does not mean that it is safe to leave a child alone with it. Since children are most easily harmed by
dogs, there are a few steps that can be taken to ensure no harm comes to a child, or the dog by extension.

    ●   Teach your child never to approach a dog that they don't know.
    ●   Always ask the owner if you can pet their dog. Owners know the temperament of their dogs.
    ●   Approach dogs from the front. They could be startled if approached from behind and at the least
        may knock you over.
    ●   Refrain from making sudden jerky movements. This could make the dog think you are playing or
        being aggressive.
    ●   Never let a child play unsupervised with an adult dog or puppy, yours or a neighbours. An
        accident only takes a minute.
    ●   Intervene and stop play if it looks too rambunctious or boisterous. Children aren't as durable as
        puppies. Puppies regularly bite as a part of regular play with other puppies.

Training and aggression

In a domestic situation, canine aggression is normally suppressed. Exceptions are if the the dog is feral,
trained to attack intruders, threatened, or provoked. It is important to remember that dogs are predators
by nature and instinct is something that never completely disappears. It is possible to acclimatize a dog
to common human situations in order to avoid adverse reactions by a pet. Dog experts advocate removal
of a dog's food, startling a dog, and performing sudden movements in a controlled setting to train out
aggressive impulses in common situations. This also allows better animal care since owners may now
remove an article directly from a dog's mouth, or transport a wounded pet to seek medical attention.

Small children are especially prone to provoking dogs, in part this is because their size and movements
can be similar to prey. Also, young children may unintentionally provoke a dog (pulling on ears or tails
is common, as is surprising a sleeping dog) because of their inexperience. Because of a dog's pack
instincts, more dominant dogs may view children or even adults as rivals rather than as superiors, and
attempt to establish dominance by physical means. Any attempt at dominance behavior, no matter how
tentative, should be extremely firmly discouraged as early as possible, to affirm to the dog that all
humans are pack superiors. To avoid potential conflicts, even reliably well-behaved children and dogs
should not be allowed to interact in the absence of adult supervision until both human and animal have
demonstrated the ability to always behave appropriately towards each other.

Dogs with strong chase instincts, especially shepherds, may fail to recognize a human being in its
entirety. They may fixate on specific aspect of the person, such as a fast-moving, brightly colored shoe,
as a prey object. This is probably the cause for the majority of non-aggressive dogs chasing cyclists and
runners. In these cases, if the individual stops, it immediately loses interest since the prey has stopped.
This is not always the case, and aggressive dogs might take the opportunity to attack.

Additionally, most dogs who bark aggressively at strangers, particularly when not on "their" territory,
will flee if the stranger challenges it. Conversely, there is always the danger of the occasional dog who
will stand its ground and escalate the situation.

Breed-specific attacks
Dog attacks on humans that appear most often in the news are those that require the hospitalization of
the victim or those in which the victim is killed. Although it is possible for small dogs to seriously maul
or kill humans, it is more difficult for them to do so than it is for large, muscular breeds.

Some large breeds have surged in popularity in recent years, such as pit bull-type dogs, Rottweilers, and
other similar muscular breeds. Not unexpectedly, attacks involving such breeds have also become more
common. This has occurred historically; for example, when German Shepherd Dogs were among the
most common breeds chosen as pets, attacks by German Shepherds also increased. As a result, many
countries and municipalities have enacted breed-specific legislation in an attempt to prevent additional
attacks from the dogs perceived to be dangerous.

Considerable controvery reigns about such legislation. Proponents might argue that pit pulls and certain
other breeds are inherently aggressive towards humans and shouldn't be allowed at all, or they might
simply argue that since the breed is so popular, they are often owned by irresponsible owners who
provide insufficient training or, worse, aggressiveness training, and that controlling the breed is the best
way to control the irresponsible owners.

Opponents might argue that no breed is inherently aggressive towards humans or that regulating one
breed simply moves the irresponsible owners to start focusing on breeds that haven't yet been regulated,
moving the problem to other breeds.

It is extremely difficult to establish the inherent human aggressiveness of a breed in general. To
establish meaningful results, research would have to consider such factors as the following:

     ●   What proportion of a breed's owners are knowledgable about dog training? When a breed's
         popularity increases, it might be more likely to be the first choice among owners with no
         previous experience with dogs because it's the breed with which they're familiar. Novice owners
         might not know how to properly socialize a dog of any breed.
     ●   What proportion of owners deliberately encourage aggression in their dogs? This would be a
         difficult number to discover, because it seems likely that not many owners would readily admit to
         it.
     ●   What proportion of dogs involved in acts of human aggression came from a known mother or
         father who exhibited human aggression? This can happen in any breed, and responsible breeders
         would generally not breed such a dog. However, as a breed's popularity increases, people who
         know nothing about breeding or genetics (or who don't care), might breed dogs who otherwise
         shouldn't be bred.
    ●   What proportion of that breed in the community exhibits human aggression? For example, if
        there were 5,000 pit bulls in a given area, and 5 attacked humans during the previous year, but
        there were 100 of some other breed in the same area and 5 also attacked humans, statistics would
        suggest that the other breed is a far more aggressive breed than pit pulls, with 4,995 pit bulls
                                 [1]
        behaving quite decently. Most statistics published show only the number of dogs of various
        breeds involved in attacks, not the percentage of dogs of that breed in the area who were involved
        in attacks. Any popular breed is more likely to show up with more attacks because there are
        simply more dogs.

One approach that acknowledges that it's hard to determine the dangerousness of a specific breed takes
the strategy of regulating all dogs over a certain size or weight, which would greatly reduce the chance
of a dog being large enough to inflict serious harm. This, of course, would remove from circulation most
of the hundreds of breeds available in the world today, most of whom would never deliberately harm a
human.

                                 [2]
Although research and analysis         suggests that breed-specific legislation is not effective in preventing
                                                                                                       [3]
dog attacks, with each new attack, pressure mounts to enact such legislation, despite indications that
dangerous dog legislation would be more effective—that is, focusing on specific individual dogs having
exhibited signs of human aggression. The controversy is bound to continue.

Specific examples

For example, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported in 1997[4] that fatal attacks
by Rottweilers rose fairly steadily from 0 in 1979 to 10 per year in 1995 and 1996. During the same
time, fatalities from pit bulls peaked in the mid-1980s and have been declining since to only 3 in 1996;
however, if one were to look only at the total number of fatalities over those 18 years, it would appear
that the pit bull was the bigger threat, when in fact Rottweilers were currently a more common attacker.

However, it is interesting to note that AKC registration of Rottweilers rose from 27th most popular in
                                                            [5]
1982, with just over 9,000 dogs of that breed registered , to second most popular in 1996, with roughly
                       [6]
90,000 dogs registered . That doesn't account for the possibly hundreds of thousands of Rottweilers not
registered with the AKC. With this many dogs of a single breed in the country, it is possibly not
surprising that there were some attacks on humans. However, even if one were to ignore all the hundreds
of thousands of non-AKC Rottweilers, 10 out of 90,000 dogs is one one-hundredths of one percent of
Rottweilers involved in fatal attacks on humans. One might question whether that proves that this breed
is inherently dangerous and should be regulated by legislation.

By the same token, "pit bull" is a term often used to lump several similar-looking breeds. Many people
                                                                                   [7]
have difficulty distinguishing one broad-faced, muscular breed from another . It is difficult to track the
registration of the "pit bull" during the same time period.
Legal issues

Although a gun may seem possible to save your own life from a dog, the United States law prohibits this
on charges of cruelty to animals, discharging a firearm in a city, and reckless endangerment. There are
monthly news reports of people being incarcerated for this. [8] [9]

A pariah dog originally referred to the feral population of dogs in India, but has come to refer to any
population of feral dogs who live around human villages, scavenging for food and seldom interacting
directly with humans.

India has long been home to the Pariah Dog, one of the world’s oldest canine breeds. In slightly varied
forms, the Pariah Dog has existed for over 14,000 years all over Asia and North Africa. Most rural
families own at least one. As villages and rural areas turned into cities, these dogs became stray dogs.

                                                                                    Back | Home | Up | Next




Mastiffs are a group of large, solidly built breeds of dogs typically with heavy bones, pendant ears, a
relatively short and well-muscled neck, and a short muzzle. The English Mastiff breed is also sometimes
called simply a Mastiff. Although some mastiff breeds are used for search and rescue, such as the Saint
Bernard and the Newfoundland, most are used as guard dogs, due to their deep voices and natural
guarding instincts, or herding dogs, not for actual herding but for protection against large predators as
well as poachers. Some breeds like the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog have also been used as cart dogs.

The word "Mastiff" is derived from Old French mastin or Provençal mastis, which both derive from
Vulgar Latin *mansuetinus "domesticated". The form of the word is also influenced by another Old
French word, namely mestif "mongrel".

Other words for "mastiff" are "molosser" (from Molossia, a country once located in what is now
Western Greece), "dogge" (Germanic) and "dogue" or "dogo" (romance languages).

The origin of the Mastiff is disputed, but Assyrian bas-relief carvings of Mastiffs found in Nineveh date
back as far as approximately 640 BC. Many believe that the Tibetan Mastiff is the ancestor of modern
Mastiffs, although there is little evidence to support this theory. It is a fact, though, that large watchdogs
have existed in Asia and the Middle East for several thousand years.

Some of today's Mastiff breeds come from the British Isles and points farther north, which accounts for
their thick coats and solid build. The name "Mastiff" is also used specifically for one breed, also known
as the English Mastiff or Old English Mastiff.
The Bulldog breeds split from the Mastiffs in England and spread to the New World with colonization as
well as Western Europe and, though smaller, are considered by some to still be mastiff breeds.

                            Notes



The Pug is a small but robust toy dog breed with a compressed, wrinkly face.


Appearance




                                 Pug with fawn coat

The Pug's appearance is characterized by a flat, wrinkled face, compact body, and curled tail. Pugs have
four color variations: fawn with a black mask and ears, entirely black, silver, or apricot. The silver or
apricot-fawn colors should be decided so as to make the contrast complete between the color and the
trace and the mask. The breed generally stands between 10 and 11 inches (25–28 cm) tall at the withers
with an ideal weight range of 14 to 18 lb (6.3 to 8.1 kg). However, current AKC judges indicate slightly
larger Pugs as higher quality. "Fawn" is the most common Pug color, black is rare, and silver is very
rare. Most fawn Pugs have black facial features.

Noise
While Pugs do not bark much, they are still quite noisy. Many Pugs make a grunting nasal noise, which
increases when they get excited. Some may snore, especially if overweight.
                                 A Pug's nose is mashed in and is responsible for snoring and snorting

Temperament
The Pug is a very sociable dog, but quite stubborn. The breed even has its own motto associated with it:
"multum in parvo" (a lot in a little). The Pug is a popular breed for a housepet, as it is easy to groom
(though it sheds substantially more than other dogs of similar size). Pugs are true "lap dogs", in that they
most often want nothing more than to curl up in their owner's lap (and perhaps a snack). They require
regular exercise, and some Pugs will walk for an hour or more. When exercising a Pug, however, it is
important to make sure they do not overheat, as their short noses do not cool them off as easily as those
of longer-nosed breeds. Pugs are generally compatible with most children and other animals.

Pugs are not noted for high achievement in obedience competitions, although, like all dog breeds, they
are intelligent and learn quickly in the right environment. According to the book The Intelligence of
Dogs, they have only fair ability to learn new commands and to obey commands the first time. On the
other hand, it is worth noting that there is much debate about how to accurately measure dog intelligence.

Unlike many other breeds, Pugs have not been bred for physical attributes, but rather have been bred for
human companionship. In other words, Pugs have been bred to have amiable dispositions, and to enjoy
being with humans.

Health




                                 Part of the Pug's appeal is the wrinkled, expressive face.
Because they have extremely short snouts and no skeletal brow ridges, Pugs can easily scratch their
corneas or puncture their eyeballs. Their short noses can also cause them to develop breathing problems.
They are also prone to skin infections if the crevices in their faces are not kept clean. Additionally, Pugs
may be prone to skin allergies, which if not treated can lead to infection as the Pug scratches the
inflamed areas. The breed's characteristic flat face may also contribute to tooth and mouth problems.
Pugs typically love to eat, and so are prone to obesity; they can quickly reach unhealthy weights. It is
therefore important for Pug owners to make sure their pets get regular exercise. Due to their short
snouts, Pugs are vulnerable to temperature extremes. It is important to make sure that they do not
overheat in hot weather, and likewise they should not be left outside in very cold weather.

Pugs can also suffer from a chronic form of Granulomatous Meningoencephalitis (an inflammation of
the brain) specific to the breed called Pug Dog Encephalitis (PDE). PDE is estimated to occur in 1% of
Pugs. There is no known cause or cure for PDE, although it is believed to be an inherited disease. [1].
PDE is invariably fatal. All dogs either die or are put to sleep within a few months after the onset of
clinical signs. [2].

A healthy Pug can be expected to live 10 to 13 years, although many well cared for Pugs have reached
18.

History




                            The demeanor of a Pug ranges from expressive and playful to calm and
warm.

Most agree that the Pug originated in China, dating back to around 700 BC, though there is some debate
as to the breed it was derived from, perhaps from Korea. It was bred to be a companion dog, rather than
a guardian. Pugs were kept by the royalty and were pampered and spoiled, and the expectation of such
treatment is a characteristic that seems to remain with them to this day. Sometimes, as a mark of great
esteem, Pugs were given to members of the court.
Some interesting anecdotal history (not officially verified, but worth mentioning) includes an ancient
Chinese law whereby only the Emperor was allowed to own a Pug. According to these anecdotes, a
person could be put to death for owning a Pug, unless it was given to him by the Emperor himself.

When the Dutch started trading with China, sailors smuggled some Pugs home to Europe, where the
small dogs and natural companions quickly became popular. Like in China, they soon became associated
with nobility.

According to legend, during a campaign against the Spanish by Prince of Orange, William The Silent,
his Pug, Pompey, thwarted an assassination attempt. One night at Hermigny, while the prince slept,
assassins crept toward his tent. Pompey heard them and began barking and scratching to warn his
master, finally jumping on his master's face to alert him to the impending danger. [3]

                                 St. Bernard

The St. Bernard Dog is a large breed of dog originally bred for rescue and as a working dog. A full-
grown male can weigh between 150 and 200 lb (68 and 90 kg). There are two varieties of the breed: the
short-haired or smooth-coat variety and the long-haired or rough-coat variety.

The St. Bernard is known for its loyalty and vigilance and is tolerant of both children and animals.
Because of these traits, it has become a family dog. They also make good watchdogs, as their size can be
intimidating to strangers, though their temperament is gentle.

History
The ancestors of the St. Bernard were the herding dogs of Swiss farmers as well as hunting dogs and
watchdogs. Their history has also been connected with the hospice at the Great St. Bernard Pass. First
reports of the dogs' presence at the pass date to the 17th century, and they still are loyal companions to
the monks there.

The most famous St. Bernard to save people at the pass was Barry (sometimes spelled Berry), who
reportedly saved somewhere between 40 and 100 lives. There is a monument to Barry in the Cimetière
des Chiens and his body was preserved in the Natural History Museum in Berne[1].

Varieties

The St. Bernard originally was a smooth-coated dog developed to rescue travellers from the snow. In the
1830s the monks who owned and bred the dogs introduced Newfoundland blood to strengthen the breed,
and this gave rise to the rough-coat St. Bernard. Although more popular, the rough-coat variety proved
to be unsuitable for mountain work because the long hair tended to collect icicles. For this reason the
monks kept the smooth coat variety for rescue work.
Temperament

St. Bernards are very gentle giants. They are extremely fond of children and are loyal to their family,
but, as with any dog, should not be left unsupervised with young children.

Miscellaneous

Naming

The name "St. Bernard" was not in widespread use until the middle of the 19th century. The dogs were
called "Saint Dogs", "Alpenmastiff", or "Barry Dogs" before, and in parts of North America, they're still
called "Saints".

Movies

In 1977, Wonderful World of Disney played a TV movie about St. Bernard rescue dogs, Barry of the
Great St. Bernard. Other movies about St. Bernards include Beethoven and Cujo.

Media portrayal

St. Bernards are often portrayed, especially in comics and cartoons, with small barrels of brandy worn
around their necks. This stems from their use as search dogs in avalanche rescue efforts in the Alps
where the alcohol in the barrel was believed to help warm up rescued victims.

                          Notes
A Bloodhound (a.k.a. Chien de Saint-Hubert) is a large dog. It is a scenthound famed for its ability to
follow a scent many days old, over vast distances. This dog is often used as a police dog to track missing
people, fleeing suspects, or escaped prisoners.

Appearance
Modern Bloodhounds weigh from 80 to 110 lb (36 to 50 kg) and stand 23 to 27 inches (58 to 69 cm)
high at the withers. Bloodhounds now come in black and tan, liver and tan, or red. In the Middle Ages,
they also occurred in other solid colors, including white (known as the Talbot Hound), but these no
longer occur. The colors appear in other breeds descended from the early Bloodhounds, though.

Temperament
This breed is a mellow, cheerful, relaxed dog who is nonetheless tireless in slowly and steadily
following a scent. Its laid-back attitude makes it somewhat difficult to obedience train. However, with
the proper amount of time and effort, this can be achieved.

Health
Like most large breeds, their life expectancy is only 10 to 12 years.

The Bloodhound is prone to hip dysplasia and Bloat.


History
The ability to follow a scent has always been valued and superb scent trackers were developed
separately in lowland Europe at the St. Hubert Monastery and in Britain. It was mentioned by Roman
Emperor Marcus Aurelius in his history of the Roman Empire. This dog has been known as a breed
since at least the Middle Ages. Its excellent tracking skills were a target as it was used in the
development--intentional or unintentional--of other fine tracking breeds such as the American
Coonhound, Swiss Jura Hound, Bavarian Mountain Hound, and many others.

The name "bloodhound" has often been incorrectly thought to show the breed's talent at following a
blood trail. In truth, it was taken from "bloodstock"' showing the breed's history with aristocracy.

Miscellaneous
Scenting ability

Although all dogs can follow scents on the ground, in the air, and in water, the Bloodhound's physical
characteristics make it well-known in its ability to follow a scent. Odors are picked up and identified by
scent receptors in a dog's nasal chambers; the larger the chambers, the better chance the dog has of
identifying even the smallest and least number of particles that provide a scent. The Bloodhound's nasal
chambers are larger than most other breeds. It is believed that pendulous ears and moist, pendulous lips
help to trap scent particles, further enhancing its scenting abilities.

                             Notes



The Tibetan Mastiff is a rare, very large breed of dog.


Appearance
The Tibetan Mastiff is among the largest breeds. Its sturdy bone structure and large, wide head makes it
appear considerably more massive than other dogs of a similar height. It can reach heights up to 31
inches (80 cm) at the withers, although the standard English breed is typically in the 25 to 28 inch (61 to
71 cm) range. The largest of the breed weighs nearly 220 pounds (100 kg), but the English standard dogs
are more typically between 140 to 180 pounds (64-82 kg). Its double coat is long and usually all black,
although it can also have areas of tan or gold, and coat colors of Gray, gold, and brown are also possible.

Unlike many other Mastiffs, it has a smooth rather than wrinkled brow and lacks their large jowls.

Temperament
The native strain of dog, which still exists in Tibet (though sparsely), and the English breed are very
different in temperament. Elizabeth Schuler states, "The few individuals that remain in Tibet are
ferocious and aggressive, unpredictable in their behavior, and very difficult to train. But the dogs bred
by the English are obedient and attached to their masters."

As a sheepdog and guard dog, it is ferocious in its ability to tackle even wolves and leopards. As a
domestic dog, it requires at least a yard; it is not an appropriate dog for an apartment. Still, the modern
English breed is generally easy-going although mildly aloof around strangers. Through hundreds of
years as a guard dog, the breed has developed a tendency to bark at sounds during the night, so leaving it
outside at night with nearby neighbors is not usually recommended. The Tibetan Mastiff is usually good
with children in a family home.

Like most herding breeds, they are intelligent and learn quickly. Obedience training is imperative, since
this is also a strong-willed dog with powerful jaws, strong muscles, and a tremendous body.
Socialization is also critical with this breed because of their natural caution around strangers and
guarding instincts.

Health
Like most very large breeds, its life expectancy is relatively short, usually not more than 10 or 11 years.
The breed has a higher incidence than normal of hypothyroidism, entropion or ectropion, skin problems
including allergies, missing teeth, maloclusion (overbite or underbite), cardiac problems, progressive
retinal atrophy (PRA), and small ear canals with a tendency for infection. As do most giant breeds, some
suffer from elbow or hip dysplasia, although this has not been a major problem in the Tibetan Mastiff.
Canine inherited demyelinative neuropathy (CIDN), a rare inherited neural disease, appeared in one
genetic line in the early 1980s but it is believed that this problem has been eliminated and appeared in no
other breeding lines.

History
This is an ancient breed, descended from very early large Tibetan dogs from which most, if not all, of
today's Mastiff-type and Molossuses are descended. Some of the modern breeds thought to have Tibetan
Mastiff ancestry include the Leonberger, the Newfoundland, the Kuvasz, and even the toy dog breed, the
Pug, which itself was a well-established breed before the 1500s. Marco Polo encountered the large
Tibetan dogs in his travels and described them as "tall as a donkey with a voice as powerful as that of a
lion." They were used as guard dogs outside the sacred city of Lhasa.

The breed originated in Tibet as a herding dog and guard dog and it still makes an excellent sheepdog,
but, by the early 19th century, this dog had become nearly extinct in its homeland. English breeders took
an interest in it and developed the Tibetan Mastiff in their own country during the first half of the 19th
century. King George IV owned a pair, and there were enough of the breed in England in 1906 to be
shown at the 1906 Crystal Palace show. Subsequently, however, the breed lost favor and nearly died out
in England, as well.

Today there are many active breeders, although the breed is still uncommon. The breed has suffered
from inbreeding over many generations because of the small number of the original stock, but today's
reputable breeders work hard at reducing the genetic problems.

                                 German Spitz

Spitz-type breeds of dog (the correct German plural is Spitze, though Spitzen is commonly used in the
US) are characterised by long, thick, and often white fur, and pointed ears and muzzles. The tail is
usually curled over the dog's back.

Origins
The exact origins of spitz-type dogs is not known, though most of the spitz-types seen today originate
from the Arctic regions.

There is no archaeological evidence showing transition stages between the wolf and the often-similar
spitz-type dogs. Skeletal remains up to 5,000 years old suggest it is far more likely that the ancestors of
spitz types mated with wolves.

Though it is not completely certain that there has been wolf blood in the spitz-type dogs for that long, it
is certain the humans have intentionally mated spitz types with wolves in more recent times to achieve
the wolf-like appearance of breeds such as the Alaskan Malamute.


Migrations
About three thousand years ago, dogs began to migrate from the Arctic into temperate Europe, North
America, Asia, and to a lesser extent, Africa.

Skeletal remains around 2,000 years old unearthed in Switzerland indicate that spitz-type dogs have
inhabited Central Europe for millennia. These dogs are almost certainly the ancestors of the European
spitz-types, such as the Keeshond and Schipperke.

Many spitz-types also migrated into Korea and China. Over the centuries, many of these dogs were
transported by humans to Japan, most likely from Korea. These Asian spitz types are the ancestors of
today's breeds such as the Chow Chow and the Akita Inu.

Through selective breeding, spitz types have evolved to fit three purposes helping humans: hunting,
herding, and pulling sleds.

The larger and more powerful breeds such as the Karelian Bear Dog and the Norwegian Elkhound were
used for big game hunting, helping humans kill moose and elk.

Smaller breeds such as the Finnish Spitz and the Lundehund were used in Scandinavia to hunt birds and
smaller mammals.

The largest of all the spitz types, notably the Canadian Eskimo Dog and the Greenland Dog, were used
to pull sleds up until the 19th century. During that century, when fur trapping became a lucrative
business, people began to realise that size did not necessarily relate with endurance, and the smaller
Siberian Husky came to be used more frequently in Canada and Alaska. The Finnish Lapphund was used
by the Sami people.

Adaptation to the Arctic
Spitz types are well suited to living in harsh northern climates. They often have an insulating,
waterproof undercoat that is denser than the topcoat to trap warmth.

Small ears help reduce the risk of frostbite and thick fur grows on the paws to protect the dogs from
sharp ice.

However, many spitz-type breeds retain wolflike characteristics such as excessive independance,
suspiciousness, and aggression towards unfamiliar humans or other animals, and can therefore require
much training before they become manageable. Some, such as the Karelian Bear Dog, are almost
impossible to train as companion dogs.


Companions and toys
The charming look of the spitz-type, with its thick fur, fluffy ruff, curled tail and small muzzle and ears,
have caused several people to create non-working types designed to be companions or lap dogs. This
trend is most evident in the tiny Pomeranian, which was originally a much larger dog closer to the size
of a Keeshond before being bred down to make an acceptable court animal.

Other spitz types which have been bred away from working uses are the American Eskimo Dog, the
Alaskan Klee Kai, the German Spitz and possibly even the Papillon.


List of Spitz-type dog breeds
This list might not be complete and is, at best, an educated guess from experts and dog fanciers based on
the physical characteristics of the breeds. Some, such as the Papillon, exhibit the tail, coat, and head of a
Spitz dog, but its ears more closely resemble spaniels although being upright like the Spitz. In the future,
genetic studies might better clarify the relationship among various breeds. Note that dogs listed here
might also be classified as toy dogs, herding dogs, sled dogs, and in other types.

                                                            A Scottish Terrier and a West Highland White
Terrier

The terrier is a group of dog breeds initially bred for hunting and killing vermin. While usually small,
these dogs are brave and tough, and have a lively, energetic, and almost hyperactive personality.

Most terrier breeds were developed in the British Isles. They were used to hunt fox, otter, badger, and rat
both over and under the ground. In fact, the word terrier comes from the Middle French terrier and
before that the Latin 'terra', meaning earth.

Terrier Group is also an official breed grouping for most of the major kennel clubs including the AKC,
ANKC, CKC, Fédération Cynologique Internationale, KC(UK), NZKC and UKC. Bear in mind that not
all terriers are in the terrier group, and not all dogs in the terrier groups are terriers.

Terrier types and groups
Terrier breeds can be divided into different types and groups, such as:

       ●   Hunting Terriers - used to find, track, or trail quarry, and then bolt from a den or tree the quarry.
    ●   Show Terriers - bred for the show ring or as small pets.
    ●   Working Terriers - used to work denning quarry.
    ●   Toy Terriers - bred "down" from larger terriers, these terriers are shown in the Toy or Companion
        group. Included among these breeds are the Toy Fox Terrier, the Silky Terrier, the Manchester
        and the Yorkshire Terrier.
            ❍ Fell Terriers - breeds developed in northern England for predator eradication.

            ❍ Hunt Terriers - breeds developed in southern England to bolt foxes during a traditional fox

               hunt.

The Bull and Terrier types (of which the modern Bull Terrier is one) were originally combinations of
bulldogs and terriers as general mixed breed pit dogs. In the late 1800's, they were refined into separate
breeds that combined terrier and bulldog qualities. Except for Boston Terriers, they are generally shown
as terriers.

                            Notes



Pekingese is an ancient toy breed of dog, originating in China. They were the favoured imperial pet.
Good-natured and happy, these dogs enjoy family environments, but require regular cleaning if in
outdoor environments. Their eyes are very delicate as they sit above the socket rather than within the
socket.

These dogs are also called Dogs of Foo (or Fu) by the Chinese, and how much they are revered can be
seen in the number of Chinese artworks depicting them. They were considered a guardian spirit as they
resembled Chinese lions (see Lion dance).

Appearance
The Pekingese breed is over 2000 years old and has hardly changed in all that time. One exception is
that modern breeders and dog-show judges seem to prefer the long-haired type over the more-traditional
spaniel-type coat.

All breed standards allow all sorts of color combinations. The most common is red sable; this is the
color of the majority of Westminster Pekes. Black and tan is popular as well, but the dog show people
seem to prefer blondes over the black and tans. The solid white (except face) or solid black Pekingese is
quite striking. The face is usually black with deep brown eyes. There was, supposedly, in a British
Pekingese line, a blue (gray) pekingese. Albino dogs are not within the standard.

The Pekingese gait is like no other in the dog world. Because the Chinese originally bred them to be
companions to the Emperor and his ladies and eunuchs, they are bowlegged to discourage wandering.
However, they can and will keep up with the big dogs when allowed. The bowleggedness makes their
walk, run, or trot quite striking.

Pekes weigh from 7 to 14 pounds (3-6 kg) and stand about 6-9 inches (15-23 cm) at the withers.


Temperament
These dogs can be stubborn and jealous. This is not a dog for someone who wants a dog that always
comes when it is called. Pekes are sometimes aggressive, especially to other dogs. It may take a long
time for Pekes to get used any other dogs except puppies, mates, and siblings. However, Pekes can be
properly socialized with dogs and other types of pets and can become fast friends. It is easy to believe
that Pekes know that they are royalty and expect you to know it, too. This might make them unsuitable
for the first-time dog owner. The Pekingese personality has been compared to a cat, although this isn't
quite right. Where a cat can be trained, a Pekingese needs to be convinced that the training is beneficial
to him as well as to you. But, if they love you, they will do anything for you, even fight to the death to
protect you.

The Pekingese is generally a one-person dog. They decide who they like best, and it might surprise you.
They more than tolerate the others in their person's life, but that person might have to withhold some
attention from the Peke if there is a danger that the Peke sees a child as a rival. Most healthy and well-
trained Pekes are fine with children. Unfortunately, because they are among the 'cute and I know it'
breeds, many people don't properly train their dogs and end up with difficult jealousy problems.

Health
Pekes' main problems are eye issues and breathing problems, resulting from its tiny skull and flattened
face, and skin allergies (and hotspots). Pekes should never be kept outside as their flattened faces and
noses can develop breathing problems, this makes it difficult for them to regulate their body temperature
in overly hot or cold weather.

Care
Keeping the Peke coat healthy and presentable requires brushing once a day. If you do this, they will
need to see a groomer only once every 3 months. If a Peke becomes dirty, it is important to take it to a
groomer as soon as possible, as it is difficult to remove dirt from its coat once it has dried.

History
The breed originated in China in antiquity, most likely from Asian wolves. Recent DNA analysis
confirms that this is one of the oldest breeds of dog.[1] For centuries, they could be owned only by
members of the Chinese Imperial Palace.

During the Second Opium War, in 1860, the Forbidden City was invaded by Allied troops. The Emperor
Xianfeng had fled with all of his court. However an elderly aunt of the emperor remained. When the
‘foreign devils’ entered, she committed suicide. She was found with her five Pekingese mourning her
passing.

They were removed by the Allies before the Old Summer Palace was burnt. Lord John Hay took a pair,
later called ‘Schloff’, and ‘Hytien’ and gave them to his sister, the Duchess of Wellington, wife of Henry
Wellesley, 3rd Duke of Wellington. Sir George Fitzroy took another pair, and gave them to his cousins,
the Duke and Duchess of Richmond and Gordon. Lieutenant Dunne presented the fifth Pekingese to
Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom, who named it Looty.
The Empress Dowager Cixi presented Pekingese to several Americans, including John Pierpont Morgan
and Alice Roosevelt, wife of Theodore Roosevelt.

The first Pekingese in Ireland was introduced by Dr. Heuston. He established smallpox vaccination
clinics in China. The effect was dramatic. In gratitude, the Chinese minister, Li Hung Chang presented
him with a pair of Pekingese. They were named Chang and Lady Li. Dr. Heuston founded the
Greystones kennel.

Miscellaneous

Peke legends

There are two origination stories for the Pekingese. The first is the most common, The Lion and the
Marmoset:

        A lion and a marmoset fell in love. But the lion was too large. The lion went to the Buddha and
        told him of his woes. The Buddha allowed the lion to shrink down to the size of the marmoset.
        And the Pekingese was the result.

The second, less-common, originating story is The Butterfly Lions:

        A lion fell in love with a butterfly. But the butterfly and lion knew the difference in size was too
        much to overcome. Together they went to see the Buddha, who allowed their size to meet in the
        middle. From this, the Pekingese came.

Another legend says that the Peke resulted from the mating of a lion and a monkey, getting its nobleness
and coat from the former and its ungainly walk from the latter.

Because the Pekingese was believed to have originated from the Buddha, he was a temple dog. As such,
he was not a mere toy. He was made small so that he could go after and destroy little demons that might
infest the palace or temple. But his heart was big so that he could destroy even the largest and fiercest.
(A book was written from this premise, although the author denies knowledge of the legends: Bride of
the Rat God.)

                                Most spaniels, like this English Cocker Spaniel, are small-to-medium
dogs with drop ears and a longer coat.




                                The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, one of the smaller breeds, is
primarily a lap dog.

A Spaniel is a group of gun dog breeds. Spaniels are generally smaller dogs with longer coats and drop
ears whose job is to assist with bird hunting. Spaniels have the primary purposes of flushing game from
dense undergrowth and retrieving game after it has been shot. Different breeds reflect different emphasis
on the dogs' uses. At one time, spaniels were subdivided into Land, Field, and Water spaniels, according
to the terrain in which they worked best.

There has been so much interbreeding of various gun dogs over the centuries to achieve additional
breeds for new subniches that it is sometimes difficult to determine whether a breed is a spaniel, a
retriever, both or neither.

Not much has changed about spaniels in general over the years, as can be seen in this 1921 entry in
Collier's New Encyclopedia :

        Their distinguishing characteristics are a rather broad muzzle, remarkably long and full ears, hair
        plentiful and beautifully waved, particularly that of the ears, tail, and hinder parts of the thighs
        and legs. The prevailing color is liver and white, sometimes red and white or black and white,
        and sometimes deep brown, or black on the face and breast, with a tan spot over each eye. The
        English spaniel is a superior and very pure breed. The King Charles' dog is a small variety of the
        spaniel used as a lapdog. The Maltese dog is also a small breed of spaniel. The water spaniels,
        large and small, differ from the common spaniel only in the roughness of their coats, and in
        uniting the aquatic propensities of the Newfoundland dog with the fine hunting qualities of their
        own race. Spaniels possess a great share of intelligence, affection, and obedience, which
        qualities, combined with much beauty, make them highly prized as companions.

                                              Toy Dog
                                                                                Back | Home | Up | Next




                                 The Bichon Frisé is an example of a toy dog that requires considerable
grooming.

A toy dog is a very small dog kept as a pet, as compared to a very small working dog, although both pet
and working dogs can be very small. When an all-breed association or kennel club divides dog breeds
into groups for purposes of competition, the Toy Group contains most of the smallest dog breeds in the
club's registry. There has been much discussion as to whether the designation signifies only a dog's size
(weight, height, or both), or also refers to how a breed is used or its temperament. This has sometimes
led to misunderstanding or bad feeling in the world of purebred dogs; there seems to be no consensus.




                                 The Chinese Crested Dog is one of the more fragile toy breeds.

It seems safest to define toy dogs as being determined by the size of the dogs, and leave discussion of
function and temperament to the various breed clubs. However, this can also be problematic, as there is
no firm agreement on what height or weight makes a dog a toy, and the upper height limit of some toy
dog breeds is over 12 inches at the withers, which places these dogs within the height range of dogs in
some other groups as well.
                                 The English Toy Terrier (Black & Tan) shows yet another type of toy
dog.

The use of the word "toy" to describe small dogs that belong to a toy breed is redundant and also
incorrect, suggesting that the breed comes in different sizes—there is no such thing, for example, as a
"toy Chihuahua"; all Chihuahuas are toy dogs. (However, some breeds do come in different sizes, such
as Poodles, which come in standard, miniature, and toy varieties).


What makes a toy breed?

Does size matter?

Inconsistency in the placement of small terriers into various kennel clubs' groups illustrates the point.
The Tenterfield Terrier, for example, is in Group 2, Terriers of the Australian National Kennel Council
(ANKC). It was slated for placement in Group 1, Toys, but quickly reclassified after objection from
owners, who argued that the Tenterfield was a working terrier. In the American Kennel Club (AKC), the
Toy Fox Terrier, a dog of similar type to the Tenterfield, was placed in the Toy Group without objection
from owners, but is in the Terrier Group in the United Kennel Club (UKC). The diminutive Yorkshire
Terrier is undisputedly a toy. The Australian Terrier is one of the smallest terriers, but is in the Terrier
group.

Form versus function

Another area of contention is the idea that toy dogs are only companion animals, slow moving, with
little need for exercise and with low endurance. Papillons give lie to this; although dainty and small they
are quite capable of taking long walks with their humans and often excel at the energetic sport of dog
agility. The UKC defines Italian Greyhounds as having been bred exclusively as pets; the AKC states
that these dogs were bred as gazehounds, dogs that hunt by sight, and are quite fast and hardy, but they
are nevertheless members of the AKC Toy group.

clubs, they usually stand between only 12 and 14 inches.




                                 The Papillon is a very popular toy dog.




                                 The Yorkshire Terrier is one of the most popular of the Toy breeds.


Teacup dogs
The terms "teacup" or ("tea cup") and "tiny toy," have increasingly come to be used to describe adult
dogs that are very small. The terms, however, are not used officially by any kennel club, and their use
remains controversial. Since the terms are unofficial, there is no accepted standard of definition for the
terms; thus, an eight-pound chihuahua (much larger than the maximum defined in the breed standard)
can be described as a "teacup." The increasing frequency of use of the terms by laypersons has led some
to believe that the terms are official, however (see also Deer-face chihuahua).

Many who are involved in dog breeding and judging argue that the whole concept of the "teacup" is
nothing more than a marketing ploy to charge exorbitant prices for dogs that are frequently runts or that
may have health problems due to dwarfing. Dogs that are exceedingly small, particularly those that are
two pounds or less fully grown, often have shortened life spans and require special care.

Sled dogs, known also as sleigh dogs, sledge dogs or sleddogs are dogs that are used to pull a wheel-
less vehicle on runners (a sled or sleigh) over snow or ice, by means of harnesses and lines. It is not
certain when this unique form of transport was first thought of by humankind nor where it originated,
but it may well have been in eastern Siberia, whose tribes have a long history of nomadic winter travel.

tandem hitch on a frozen Yukon lake (Photo by Isa Boucher)

Several distinct dog breeds are in common use as sleddogs, although any medium-sized breed may be
used to pull a sled. Purebred sleddog breeds range from the well-known Siberian Husky to rarer breeds
such as the Mackenzie River husky. Dog drivers, however, have a long history of using other breeds or
crossbreds as sleddogs. In the days of the Gold Rush in Alaska, mongrel teams were the rule, but there
were also teams of Foxhounds and Staghounds. Today the unregistered hybridised Alaskan husky is
preferred for dogsled racing, along with a variety of crossbreds, the German Shorthaired Pointer often
being chosen as the basis for crossbreeding. Some years ago, a team of Standard Poodles participated in
the Iditarod long-distance race.

Sleddogs are expected to demonstrate two major qualities in their work (apart from basic physical
capability to pull the sled). Endurance is needed to travel the distances demanded in dogsled travel,
which may be anything from five to eighty miles (8 to 130 km) or more a day. Speed is needed to travel
the distance in a reasonable length of time. Racing sleddogs will travel up to an average twenty miles per
hour (32.2 km/h) over distances up to 25 miles (40 km). Over longer distances, average travelling speed
declines to 10 to 14 miles per hour (16 to 22 km/h). In poor trail conditions, sleddogs can still usually
average 6 or 7 miles per hour (10 or 11 km/h).

their harness

Sleddogs pull various sorts of sleds, from the small 25 pound (11 kg) sprint-racing sleds, through the
larger plastic-bottomed distance racing toboggan sleds, to traditional ash freighting sleds and the
trapper's high-fronted narrow toboggan. Sleddogs are also used to pull skiers and to draw wheeled rigs
when there is no snow. A team of sleddogs may consist of anywhere from three to two dozen animals.
Modern teams are usually hitched in tandem, with harnessed pairs of sleddogs pulling on tuglines
attached to a central gangline. Trappers in deep snow conditions using the toboggan will hitch their dogs
in single file with traces on either side of the line of dogs. Dog teams of arctic natives are usually run in
"fan hitch", each dog having its own tow line tied directly to the sled.

Driving sleddogs has become a popular winter recreation and sport in North America and Europe;
sleddogs are now found even in such unlikely places as Australia and Patagonia.




                                 A typical sled dog breed, such as the Greenland Dog, has a very dense
double coat, wide padded feet, erect ears, a curled tail, and a muscular build.

                                         Selective Breeding
                                                                                     Back | Home | Up | Next


Selective breeding in domesticated animals is the process of developing a cultivated breed over time.


Selective Breeding Methods
In general, the owners of the animals use three strategies to refine local populations:

    1. Isolation. There must be a period in which the members of the group are relatively fixed, so that
       no new genetic material comes in. Without genetic isolation of the group, the differentiation that
       creates a new breed cannot take place.
    2. Artificial selection. Breeders must prevent random mating from coming about, and limit mating
       to those individuals who exhibit desired characteristics. One logical consequence of this isolation
       is the next characteristic: inbreeding.
    3. Inbreeding. Ordinarily those who are controlling the artificial breeding will find it necessary at
       some stage to employ a degree of linebreeding (mating within one bloodline, or strain) or
       inbreeding (mating closely related individuals), to facilitate the weeding-out of undesired
       characteristics and the fixation of desired traits. Inbreeding and linebreeding are controversial
       aspects of artificial selection, but have been practiced for centuries.

The Appaloosa horse, which was developed by the Nez Percé Indians in the Northwest United States,
provides an example. The Spanish colonists had established horse breeding in what is now New Mexico
by about 1600, and the Spaniards of that era were known to have horses with spotted coats. By 1806
(when they are mentioned in journals kept by the Lewis and Clark expedition) the Nez Percé were
observed to have developed strong, hardy, spotted horses.

It is not known if the Nez Percé practiced inbreeding, but they were reputed to geld stallions judged
unsuitable for breeding, and to trade away mares likewise unsuitable for breeding, which accomplishes
the goals of isolation and artificial selection.

In Europe, the first use of this process was recorded in mid 18th century England, by Robert Bakewell
and Thomas Coke

Closed vs. open studbook

A studbook is the official registry of approved individuals of a given breed kept by a breed association.
It is said to be "closed" if individuals can be added only if their parents were both registered. It is said to
be "open" if individuals can be added without their parents being registered, such as by inspection.

Studbooks have been kept for centuries; the concept of the breed associations and clubs is more recent.
Most of the "purebred horses" have open studbooks. For example, a "purebred" Arabian mare can be
"examined" by the Trakehner authorities; if she is found acceptable, her offspring can be registered as
Trakehner. By contrast, the studbooks of purebred dogs only remain open if the breed is under
development or if there is deemed to be an insufficient genepool.

Crossbreeding and backbreeding

In some registries, breeders may apply for permission to crossbreed other breeds into the line to
emphasize certain traits, to keep the breed from extinction or to alleviate problems caused in the breed
by inbreeding from a limited set of animals. A related preservation method is backbreeding, used by
some equine and canine registries, in which crossbred individuals are mated back to purebreds to
eliminate undesirable traits acquired through the crossbreeding.

Some horse societies accept crossbreds who meet certain criteria onto the breed registry.

Purebred Cats, Dogs and the Debate over 'Breed Purity'
Most purebred cats and dogs of breeds recognized by all-breed club registries are controlled by "closed
studbooks". In a number of modern breeds recognized by the kennel clubs, there are high incidences of
specific genetic diseases or disorders and sometimes increased susceptibility to other diseases, reduced
litter sizes, reduced lifespan, inability to conceive naturally, etc. This came about because:

    1. Many breeds have been established with too few foundation dogs or ones that were already too
       closely related, or both
    2. There was artificial isolation: the registries (stud books) are closed for most breeds; therefore one
       cannot introduce diversity from outside the existing population.
    3. Most selective breeding practices have the effect of reducing the diversity further. In addition, in
       the show world, breeding specimens are often selected on the basis of aesthetic criteria only,
       without regard for soundness.
    4. Even if the foundation dogs were sufficiently diverse genetically, almost no one knows how their
       genetic contributions are distributed among the present day population, consequently, breeding is
       done without regard to conserving these contributions, which may be of value to the general
       health and survival of the breed.

Similar problems affect purebred cats, however to a lesser extent since selective breeding in cats has not
been practiced for nearly the length of time that it has been in dogs. The purebred cat is a relatively new
creature; some breeds of cats have existed less than fifty years.
Purebreds
The very idea of 'breed purity' often strikes an unpleasant chord with modern animal fanciers because it
is reminiscent of nineteenth-century eugenics notions of the "superior strain" which were supposedly
exemplified by human aristocracies and thoroughbred horses. The application of theories of eugenics
has had far-reaching consequences for human beings, and the observable phenomenon of hybrid vigor
stands in sharp contrast.

The idea of the superior strain was that by "breeding the best to the best," employing sustained
inbreeding and selection for "superior" qualities, one would develop a bloodline superior in every way to
the unrefined, base stock which was the best that nature could produce. Naturally the purified line must
then be preserved from dilution and debasement by base-born stock. This theory was never completely
borne out. It can be said that when the ideal of the purified lineage or aesthetic type is seen as an end in
itself, the breed suffers over time. The same issues are raised in the world of purebred cats.

His claim that selective breeding had been successful in producing change over time was one of the key
arguments proposed by Charles Darwin to support his theory of natural selection in his acclaimed yet
controversial work Origin of Species. Here, the “selective” does not mean breeding selected in a
humanly controlled fashion.

A kennel club (known as a kennel council or canine council in some countries) is an organization for
canine affairs that concerns itself with the welfare, promotion, and maintenance of more than one breed
of dog. A club that handles only one breed is known as a breed club. All-encompassing kennel clubs are
also referred to as 'all-breed clubs', although "all" means only those breeds that they have decided to
recognize, and "breed" means purebred dogs, not including dog hybrids and crossbreeds or mixed
breeds.

Kennel clubs can be for working dogs or show dogs. They maintain breed standards, accreditation of
judges, and registries, which are lists of adult purebred dogs and lists of litters of puppies born to
purebred parents.

Nations that have active groups of dog breeders and people who practice the hobby of dog fancy usually
have their own national breed and kennel clubs, often affiliated with those of other countries.

The Fédération Cynologique Internationale (In English, the International Canine Federation, but still
referred to as the FCI); represents many countries internationally and has ties to many countries' major
kennel clubs. There may be reciprocal agreements or understanding between affiliate members of the
FCI.

The major, most-widely accepted kennel clubs for various countries are:

    ●   American Kennel Club (United States)
    ●   Australian National Kennel Council
    ●   Canadian Kennel Club
    ●   The Kennel Club (UK)
    ●   Kennel Club of India, KCI
    ●   Kennel Union of Southern Africa
    ●   United Kennel Club (United States)
    ●   Verband für das Deutsche Hundewesen (VDH) (German Kennel Club)

Purebreds, also called purebreeds or pedigreed, are cultivated varieties or cultivars of a species,
achieved through the process of selective breeding.


Purebred dogs
In the hobby of dog fancy, the word 'purebred' causes controversy, largely because of unresolved
differences of opinion over what constitutes a breed.

In general, there are two types of purebred: those 'recognized' by a kennel club and those of independent
breed clubs.

Kennel clubs usually have strict sets of criteria for the recognition of a new or existing dog breed,
normally with some period of developmental or provisional status. It cannot be assumed that the date of
recognition of a breed indicates how long the breed has existed as a pure breed.

Independent purebreds are typically dogs of renown in their originating countries, usually with a long
history of breeding true to type. They may remain independent due to any of the following reasons:

    ●   The lack of a national kennel club or low interest in dog fancy in smaller nations.
    ●   The dogs being so venerable that there is no reason to seek outside affiliation.
    ●   The desire to preserve independent control over the attributes of the breed.

Recently, proposed breed-specific legislation has threatened the existence of independent dog clubs, as
the fanciers of independent breeds are forced to seek alliance with kennel clubs to preserve their dogs'
purebred status.

The fanciers of newly developed breeds now almost always seek kennel club affiliation at the outset.

                             Notes



The Poodle is a breed of dog; specifically, it is a gun dog noted for its ability in the water and bird
hunting skills. The English name comes from the German Pudel, or Pudelhund – from pudeln, meaning
"to splash about". In France the poodle is known as a caniche and in Spain as a perro de lana (literally
"wool dog").

Appearance
Breed standards call for a dignified, elegant carriage.

The breed comes in three sizes (as described by most breed registries):

     ●   Standard: Over 38 cm (15 in) at the shoulder
     ●   Miniature: Over 28 cm (11 in) high, but under 38 cm
     ●   Toy: Under 28 cm (11 in) and 10 lbs or under




                                  Black Miniature Poodle

The American Kennel Club has a slightly different standard, with the maximum for Toys and the
minimum for Miniatures at 25cm (10 in). The FCI standards divide Poodles into four groups: Large (45
to 60 cm), Medium (35 cm to 45 cm), Miniature (28 cm to 35 cm) and Toy (less than 28 cm with an
ideal size of 25 cm).
Coat

Breed standards call for a coat of solid color, one of black, white, brown, grey, blue, or apricot.
"Parti" (partial), "phantom," and other coat colors exist, but are not acceptable in the show ring.

The fur on the animal's body is naturally curly, often in small tight clumps of small curly ringlets. Hair
on the ears can be straight or slightly curly. With brushing, the dog's fur will still retain wavy or curly
properties, but will soften and straighten somewhat.




                                  Apricot Toy Poodle

The coat can be clipped in various styles. For show purposes, only three clips—the puppy clip (only for
dogs one year old or younger), the Continental or Lion clip (with the instantly-recognisable 'mane'), and
the English Saddle clip (with leg bracelets)—are acceptable. The traditional show-cut 'bracelets' of long
fur covering the dog's leg joints are said to date back to winter hunts, where most of the fur was clipped
short to facilitate swimming but the joints, lungs, heart, and kidneys needed protection from the cold.
The pom-pom on the end of the tail served as a "flag" when the poodle dove under the water's surface.
Clip styles for pets include the Kennel clip (fur same length all over) and other styles, generally variants
of the Continental. Left alone, poodle fur will become corded in the manner of a Puli.

Corded Poodle

The Corded Poodle is a Poodle whose hair has been allowed to grow in the corded manner: it is not a
distinct breed.

Most national registries recognize two coat types for Poodles: curly and corded. Some Poodles have
coats which will more or less naturally cord, others must be coaxed into it, but virtually all Poodles are
capable of having corded hair once their adult hair has been established. Puppies can be born with either
type of coat, even in the same litter. Once cords have been established, they cannot be brushed out, but
must be clipped away.

Breed historians seem to agree that the corded coat is the older of the two varieties. Corded coats are
more difficult to take care of, and corded dogs fell out of fashion, in favor of those with wooly coats.

Temperament
Poodles are generally intelligent, alert, and active. In particular, the Standard variety is quite
independent and has a noticeable hunting drive. Even Toys will point birds. Because they are so
intelligent, they can become bored easily, and can get quite creative about finding mischief.

Poodles are extremely people-oriented dogs and, therefore, are eager to please. They are excellent
watchdogs, but unlike some working breeds, don't usually become "one-person" dogs when they are part
of a family. Standard Poodles in particular tend to be good with children. When they are from good
bloodlines, all three varieties are fairly mellow dogs. Most Poodles don't like to try new things, but are
adaptable and easy to train. They don't require as much exercise as other hunting or working breeds
(even the Standards), but being agile and athletic, they appreciate lots of exercise.

Care

Poodles make good companions and are extremely loyal, sometimes to the point of being possessive.
The owner should be a competent trainer, as poodles can be willful if trained poorly. Well-trained
Poodles are eager to please and love putting on a show for family and friends. Poodles do not shed and
are considered a hypoallergenic breed. (See list of Hypoallergenic dog breeds) Some Poodles have
hyperactive tear ducts that do not drain very well. It is quite common to see Poodles with streaks of
gooey brownish-red secretions in the corners of their eyes. If lots of drainage needs to occur, the tear
duct may clog and a small ball of yellowish mucous may form near the tear duct. It is advisable to gently
remove this accumulation with a lint-free and soft towel wrapped around the index finger. Many
products exist in pet stores designed to help remove this drainage from Poodles' faces, as it can be
unattractive. Often these clear solutions are applied to a cotton ball which is then firmly wiped over the
stained fur.

Poodles' coats require plenty of grooming to keep the constantly growing hair at a manageable length
and to prevent it from matting. Matted fur can be very difficult to untangle, and often the clumps must
be cut out with scissors. There a number of short pet clips that make a very easily maintained family pet.

History
The poodle is often thought of as a typically French breed (it is frequently referred to as the "French
Poodle"). However, it is an old breed and its region of origin is a matter of contention. Most experts
believe the poodle originated in Germany or Russia, but it may have come from Iberia. Related breeds
are the Portuguese Water Dog and Irish Water Spaniel.
Use

Today, Poodles are generally kept as pets. However, they are a versatile breed capable of hunting,
tracking, protection, or entertainment. French customs, for instance, uses Poodles to search for illegal
substances. Because of their small size, they are more unobtrusive, when searching cars and train
compartments, than bigger breeds such as the German Shepherd.

Their intelligence and athletic build has made them popular as trick dogs or circus performers. They can
compete well in some dog sports, such as dog agility, although their independent or playful nature can
sometimes distract them from the focus and drive needed for these sports.

Miscellaneous

Hybrids

Many hybrids have been created by crossing a poodle with another breed, such as Labradoodles and
Cockapoos. These "hybrids" are not, however, recognized breeds. Many breeders promote Poodle
hybrids as actual breeds and charge more for them than is usually charged for a mixed-breed dog.

                                 Kazakh shepherd; his and his dogs' primary job is to guard the sheep
from predators.

Livestock Guardian Dogs or LGDs are dogs of breeds which were bred to independently live with and
guard livestock such as sheep. Because of this, LGDs are also referred to as sheep dogs. Unlike a
herding dog, a LGD does not control the movement of the flock with predatory actions towards it.
Instead, they blend into the flock and generally ignore the individual animals in favor of keeping an eye
out for potential threats.

Livestock Guardian Dogs are generally large, protective and independent, which can make them less
than ideal for suburban or urban living and housepets. None the less, they are often chosen for their
guardian qualities towards children, and will be as protective of their family as they would be of their
flock. They are also used as guard dogs for people and property. Generally, most LGDs around the
world are still kept as working dogs.

There has been an increased interest in the traditional uses of a LGD in North America, where LGDs
allow for predator control that is effective and less environmentally damaging than trapping and
poisoning.

                            Notes



A Border Collie is a hard-working herding breed of dog that originated in the border country of
England and Scotland. Border Collies are highly intelligent herding dogs. Like most working dogs, they
have a tendency towards neurotic or destructive behavior if not given enough to do. They are still
frequently used on farms all over the world for assisting with the handling of livestock. Though known
to be reserved with strangers, these dogs can also be protective of a human family member and
affectionate to those they know.

Appearance




                                 Border Collies commonly have red and white or black and white coats.

Because Border Collies have historically been selected for working ability, and not looks, they vary
widely in appearance. In general, they are medium-sized dogs without extreme physical characteristics
and a moderate amount of coat. Their double coats can be anywhere from slick to lush, and can come in
many colors, although black and white is by far the most often seen in the show ring and herding trials
and therefore the most common in public perception; tricolor (black/tan/white) and red and white also
occurs regularly, with other colors such as, blue and white, red merle, blue merle, or sable seen less
frequently. Eye color varies from deep brown to amber or blue with occasionally one eye of each color.
The ears of the Border Collie are also highly variable -- some have fully erect ears, some fully dropped
and other are semi-erect (similar to that of the Rough Collie). Although working Border Collie handlers
sometimes have superstitions about the appearance of their dogs (many handlers do not prefer red dogs,
or mostly white dogs), in general a dog's appearance is considered to be irrelevant. It is much more
useful to identify a working Border Collie by its attitude and ability, not its looks.

Those dogs bred for the conformation ring are much more uniform in appearance than working Border
Collies, since to be successful show dogs they must conform to kennel club standards that are specific
on many points of the anatomy and furnishings. Kennel clubs specify that the Border Collie must have a
keen and intelligent expression; the preferred eye colour is generally brown. In deference to the dog's
working origin, scars and broken teeth received in the line of duty are not to be counted against a Border
Collie in the show ring, although how many show collies actually work might be arguable.

Temperament




                                   Blue merle BC puppy at 14 weeks using herding eye (gaze and lowered
stance); this dog's eyes are different colors, which is not uncommon in merles.

Border Collies are extremely energetic and require a lot of attention. They are better off in a household
that can provide them with plenty of exercise and a job to do. Like most herding breeds, they will
attempt to herd family members, cats, squirrels, bicycles, cars, or anything else that moves in the
absence of other charges. Border Collies make bad pets for people who cannot provide a considerable
amount of daily exercise, both physical and mental. Many Border Collies end up in shelters or rescue
groups because families, attracted by their appearance, discover that they cannot provide the attention
and effort required for this driven, active, easily bored breed—though this problem can be alleviated by
giving the dog lots of mental and physical stimulation. This can be done by taking them to training
classes and for long, brisk walks. Participating in dog sports such as dog agility, flyball, sheepdog trials,
dog sledding races and obedience are also popular with Border Collie owners for this reason. It may also
help to have more than one dog; with Border Terriers and other Collies the most ideal companions.
Among some breeders of the breed in Britain, there is a common saying: "no sheep, no collie", referring
to the dog's usual unsuitability to people who just want a "smart dog". Border Collies love to play and do
not always know when to stop on their own; owners must ensure that they do not overexert themselves,
especially in hot weather, which can be dangerous.

Health
Hip dysplasia is widespread among purebred Border Collies. Elbow dysplasia also occurs, along with
epilepsy and hypothyroidism. Dogs homozygous for the merle gene are likely to have eye and/or hearing
problems. Collie eye anomaly (CEA) can now be tested for genetically. Some Border Collie breed clubs
are active in promoting research into hereditary diseases of this breed.
History

Breed standards




                                 A smooth-coated Border Collie cross

As is the case with many breeds of dogs that are still used for their original purposes, breed standards
vary depending on whether the registry is more interested in a dog that performs its job superbly or a
dog whose appearance meets an ideal standard.

There are two types of tests, or standards, to determine the breeding quality of a Border collie. The
original test was the ISDS sheepdog trial, where a dog and handler collect groups of livestock and move
them quietly around a course. The 'standard' comes from the fact that, the world over, there are certain
standard elements to this test. Sheep must be gathered without being too much disturbed, from a distance
farther than the typical small airport runway. They then must be directed through obstacles at varying
distance from the handler, and then the dog must demonstrate the ability to do work close at hand by
penning the sheep and sorting them out. It is these elements which have shaped the working abilities of
the Border collie and defined the breed until very recently. These dogs are necessarily capable of
incredible feats of athleticism, endurance, intense focus, and high levels of trainability.

In nearly every region of the world, the Border collie is now also a breed which is shown in ring or
bench shows. For the people who participate in these events, the Border collie is defined by the breed
standard, which is a description of how the dog should look. In New Zealand and Australia, where the
breed has been shown the longest, the Border collie standards have produced a dog with a long double
coat (smooth coats are not allowed), a soft dark eye, a body slightly longer than square, a well-defined
stop, and a gentle and friendly expression. This style of Border collie has become quite popular in
winning show kennels around the world, as well as among prestigious judges, so it is to be expected that
this type will soon predominate even in countries like the US where the native lines are very different.

It is possible (although unlikely) for a dog to do both, but a working dog's options for competition in dog
shows might be limited depending on its ancestry and on the opinions of the various kennel clubs or
breed clubs involved, and most handlers of working Border Collies are uninterested in participating in
dog shows. Conformation-bred dogs are seldom if ever seen on the sheepdog trial field.
In the UK, there are two separate registries for Border Collies. International Sheep Dog Society [1] and
other similar organizations encourage breeding for herding ability, whereas the Kennel Club (UK)
encourages breeding for a specific appearance.

In the United States, the vast majority of Border Collies are registered with the American Border Collie
association, which is dedicated to the preservation of the working dog. However, the breed was also
recognized in 1995 by the American Kennel Club, which promotes standards based on appearance and
promotes registration of dogs whose parents were registered. The recognition was under protest[2] from
the majority of Border Collie-affiliated groups, such as the United States Border Collie Club, that felt
that emphasis on the breed's working skills would be lost under AKC recognition.

Some people believe that the emphasis placed on appearance might ruin the breed for its traditional
livestock work because breeding for appearance eliminates emphasis on intelligence and working
ability. Others believe that, in today's world, where livestock work is uncommon, the beauty of the breed
is the factor that should be preserved.

The many people who depend on the breed for their livelihood in managing livestock know that Border
collies bred strictly to work are the best representatives of the original premier livestock working breed.
Breeding for "beauty contests" has long been understood to water down this ability.

However, most people who own Border Collies as pets and also compete with them in the wide variety
of dog sports available to them prefer to have Border Collies who come from working lines, not show
lines, because the intelligence, drive, and athleticism are preserved over a lush coat or standard size and
weight. The future shape of this breed is still very much in question and is largely dependant on whether
working breeders will accept being marginalized or whether they can educate people to appreciate the
breed for what it really is, a premier livestock working dog.

Miscellaneous

Dog activities and sports

These collies can take direction by voice and whistle at long distances when herding. Their great energy
and herding instinct are still used to herd all kinds of animals, from the traditional sheep and cattle, free
range poultry, and pigs, to deer and ostriches. They are also used to remove unwanted wild birds from
airport runways, golf courses, and other public and private areas.

Border Collie competitions may involve actual herding or simulated tasks. Shepherds in Britain have
taken the most critical elements of herding and designed a sheepdog competition. Originally farmers
used such competitions to evaluate possible mates for their working dogs, but they have now developed
into a true sport with many competitors from outside the farming community taking part. In the US, the
national body for these competitions is the USBCHA[3]. In Britain it is the International Sheepdog
Society, and in Canada the CBCA[4].

Because of their working background, Border Collies excel at several dog sports. They dominate the
higher jump heights at dog agility competitions, so much so that in England the Border Collies
occasionally are given competitions separate from all other breeds.

Gundogs, also called bird dogs, are a category of dog breeds developed to assist hunters or sports
people to retrieve prey, usually birds.

There are several types of gundogs, each type consisting of multiple breeds; see each type for a detailed
description and a list of breeds:

       Type                          Example


Pointers                             Pudelpointer




Retrievers                           Chesapeake Bay Retriever




Setters                              English Setter




Flushing Spaniels                    English Cocker Spaniel




Water dogs                           Standard Poodle



Several breeds have been used in different ways, so the line among different types is not always clear
and different people might think of one breed as different types.

Training for Pointers and Setters
Bird dog training varies among breeds and handlers, but methodologies are usually similar to the
following: Training for hunting can begin soon after a pup is weaned, around 10 to 12 weeks. A pup is
encouraged to search for treats hidden in the handler’s pockets. In this way, he learns that he is rewarded
for using his nose. At this time, the pup is introduced to a gamebird in a cage (often a common pigeon).
If the dog shows excitement, he is said to be birdy and is rewarded for this behavior. At this stage, some
pups already exhibit a natural tendency to point. Handlers encourage the pointing behavior through
games, such as attaching a bird wing to a fishing line and pole and dragging it along the ground. The
pups are often trained as a group, which supports the pointing behavior. Dogs progress through several
stages, working up to pointing caged birds in the field. A long lead can be attached to the dog so that the
trainer can correct the dog for bad behavior and teach the dog to work closely with hunters. Younger
dogs are sometimes paired with experienced dogs for trips to the field.

Method of Work for Pointers and Setters
Upon reaching the field, the handler often will cast or direct the dog in a wide circle. Experienced dogs
will search the edges of the field knowing that birds are usually found there. This wide run helps to burn
off the dogs initial exhuberence and may help the dog establish its bearings and form a "background"
upon which game smells will be processed. The dog then begins working back and forth, starting near
the hunter and slowly ranging out. The dog repeats this process as the hunters move through the field.
How far a handler allows the dog to range is a matter of personal preference. When a pair of dogs work
as a team, one works close in while the other ranges out in larger circles. If either dog becomes birdy,
the other dog works its way over to assist. Good bird dogs are alert to their handlers and to the
disposition of other dogs in the field. They should readily comply if the handler casts them to an area of
particular interest, such as a brush pile or shuck of corn.

When game is detected, a dog freezes, either pointing or crouching. If other dogs are present, they also
freeze, "honoring" the first dog’s point. The pointing dog remains motionless until the hunters are in
position. Handlers give the command whoa, instructing the dog to remain still. What happens next
depends on how the dog has been trained. Some trainers train the dog to stay motionless while the hunter
steps forward and flushes the game. Other trainers direct the dog to flush the game with a command such
as get it!

If a bird is downed, the dogs are instructed to search for it with the command dead bird, or simply dead.
The dogs then search for and retrieve the downed game.

                                 Pointer's pointing stance

The Pointer is a group of dog breeds; specifically, they are a type of gundog typically used in hunting
birds. The name pointer most likely comes from the dog's stance when they spot prey; many dogs point
naturally at interesting noises or possible prey by lifting one paw and tucking it under their chests, with
their nose extended and tail straight behind. Pointers were selectively bred for dogs who had this natural
trait. They typically start to acquire their hunting instincts at about 2 months of age, although they need
to be trained to assume the stance at all appropriate times and to maintain it until released by the hunter.

The Pointer originated in England in about the 1650s. It was the first dog used to stand game.

Pointers typically have short-haired coats, although some breeds, such as the German Pointer, come in
longer-haired or wire-haired versions.

                                 Like most scent hounds, the Basset Hound has long ears, large nasal
passages, and a sturdy body for endurance.

Scent hounds are hounds that primarily hunt by scent rather than sight. They are generally regarded as
having some of the most sensitive noses among canines.

These dogs specialize in following a smell or scent. Most of these breeds have longer, drooping ears;
one theory says that this helps to collect scent from the air and keep it near the dog's face and nose. They
also have large nasal cavities to better process scent. Their typically loose, moist lips also trap scent
particles.

Most of these breeds have deep, booming voices and use them actively when running and especially
when following a scent trail. Although this is a distraction when it is your neighbor's hound barking in
the back yard, is a valuable trait that allows the dog's handler to follow the dog or pack of dogs during a
hunt even when they are out of sight, such as when following a fox through woodland.

Scent hounds do not need to be as fast as sight hounds because they do not need to keep prey in sight,
but they need endurance so that they can stick with a scent and follow it for long distances over rough
terrain. The best scent hounds can follow a scent trail even across running water and even when it is
several days old. Most scent hounds, even when kept as pets, still are happiest when following a scent
trail.

Most scent hounds were used in packs, sometimes with hundreds of dogs in a single pack. Longer-
legged hounds ran more quickly and usually required that the hunters follow on horseback; shorter-
legged hounds allowed hunters to follow on foot.

                            Notes



The Basenji is a breed of dog and a member of the sighthound family. The basenji is a Congolese
hunting dog that rarely, (if ever) barks, but does have an odd yodelling sound.

Appearance
Basenjis are small, elegant-looking, short-haired dogs with erect ears, tightly curled tail, and graceful
neck. Some people equate their appearance to that of a miniature deer. Their forehead is wrinkled,
especially when young. Eyes are typically almond shaped, which gives the appearance of squinting with
a serious look.

Basenjis typically weigh around 20 to 24 pounds (9 to 11 kg) and stand about 17 inches (43 cm) tall at
the withers. They are an athletic dog, and are deceptively powerful for their size. They have a graceful,
confident gait like a trotting horse, and skim the ground in a "double-suspension gallop" when running
flat out at their considerable top speed.

The AKC recognizes the following colorations: red/white, black/white, tricolor (red/black/white), and
brindle (black stripes on a background of red)/white. There are additional variations, such as the
"trindle", which is a tricolor and brindle, and several other colorations that remain in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo.

Temperament
Like wild canids, Basenjis don't bark. They will, however, give the occasional single "woof". They will
also chortle, whine, squeal, and make a Basenji-specific noise called a yodel or a baroo. Also like wild
canids, most Basenjis come into season only once a year, usually in the autumn.

Most Basenjis have a strong dislike for contact with water, and will go to great, and sometimes amusing,
lengths to avoid getting wet. On the other hand, they are extremely inquisitive dogs, and can temporarily
be completely oblivious to the pouring rain if something piques their interest.
They are highly intelligent and learn quickly, but they also have a cat-like independence and "self-
motivation" which can make them somewhat casual about obedience. A healthy Basenji is a
mischievous and good-humored animal, and is not above testing the limits of its environment and owner
just for sport. They can be aloof with strangers but form strong bonds with their owners. If not
supervised or trained properly, Basenjis can become bored and destructive when left alone. Basenjis are
also expert climbers, and have been known to scale chain-link fences as much as eight feet high.

Extremely quick and fast on their feet, Basenjis love to run and chase, so much so that they are
sometimes competitively raced in lure courses. There are few creatures the Basenji is likely to encounter
(including its owner!) that it does not believe it can either outwit or outrun. This, combined with a
virtually fearless approach to the world, make it a good idea not to allow a Basenji to run free in an
unconfined area or where it may get into trouble. Basenjis can be very good with children if raised
around them, but may not have much patience for them otherwise.

History




                                               Tri-colored Brindle

The Basenji is one of the most ancient dog breeds. Originating on the continent of Africa, it has been
venerated by humans for thousands of years. Basenjis can be seen on steles in the tombs of Egyptian
pharaohs, sitting at the feet of their masters, looking just as they do today, with prick ears and tightly
curled tail.

The Basenji had all but disappeared from civilization when it was rediscovered in the Congo region of
Africa in 1895. There, the Basenji was highly prized by natives for its intelligence, courage, speed, and
silence. They were invaluable assistants to the hunt, chasing wild game into nets for their masters. The
Azande and Mangbetu tribes from the northeastern Congo region describe Basenjis, in the trade
language of Lingala, as "embwa na bwasenji". Translated, this means "dogs from when we were wild"
or "dogs from long ago". Another local name is "M'bwa m'kube M'bwa wamwitu", or "jumping up and
down dog", a reference to their tendency to jump straight up to spot their quarry.
Several attempts were made to bring the breed to England, but the earliest imports succumbed to
disease. It was not until the 1930s that foundation stock was successfully established in England, and
thence to the United States. So it is that nearly all the Basenjis in the western world are descended from
these original imports. The breed was officially accepted into the AKC in 1943. For a fascinating
account of the importation of the Basenji from Africa, read The History of the Breed[1], a letter to the
AKC in support of opening the stud book to admit new African imports. The AKC stud book was
reopened to several new imports in 1990, at the request of the Basenji Club of America.

Health




                                              Basenji puppy

Some Basenjis are prone to an inheritable kidney disorder called Fanconi syndrome (basenji.org). A
Basenji with Fanconi syndrome usually begins to diplay symptoms after reaching the age of four.
Owners can test for Fanconi syndrome by checking for sugar in the urine.

Basenjis, along with certain other breeds of dog have been known to be carriers of a simple recessive
gene which, when homozygous for the defect, causes genetic Hemolytic Anemia (basenji.org). Most
Basenjis today are descended from ancestors that have been tested clear. When lineage from a fully
tested line (set of ancestors) cannot be completely verified, the dog should be tested before breeding. As
this is a non-invasive DNA test, a Basenji can be tested for HA at any time.

As with other breeds of dog, Basenjis sometimes suffer from hip dysplasia, resulting in loss of mobility
and arthritis-like symptoms.

Malabsorption, or immunoproliferative enteropathy, is an autoimmune intestinal disease that leads to
anorexia, chronic diarrhea, and even death. Special diet can improve the quality of life for afflicted dogs.

The breed can also fall victim to progressive retinal atrophy (a degeneration of the retina causing
blindness), and several less serious hereditary eye problems such as coloboma, (a hole in the eye
structure), and persistent pupillary membrane (tiny threads across the pupil).

                             Notes



The Whippet is a breed of dog, specifically a member of the sighthound family. They are active and
playful and are physically similar to a small greyhound. Their popularity has led to the reuse of the
Whippet name on a large number of things, from cars to cookies.




                            White whippet with brindle saddle and head

Appearance
Because color is considered immaterial in judging Whippets, they come in a wide variety of colors and
marking patterns, everything from solid black to solid white, with red, fawn, brindle, blue, or cream. All
manner of spots and blazes and patches are seen, sometimes all in the same litter. Whippets are a
medium-size dog ranging from 25 to 40 lbs (11-18 kg), with a maximum height of 22 inches (56 cm).

There are dogs who have been referred to as "long-haired Whippets", but it is the opinion of the
American Kennel Club and the American Whippet Club that these dogs are actually mixed breeds. They
are not recognized by the AKC or by any other major canine registry, and cannot compete in events such
a racing or coursing.

Temperament
Whippets are generally quiet and gentle dogs, content to spend much of the day sleeping. They are not
generally aggressive with other animals, and although especially attached to their owners, they are
friendly to visitors. They are not prone to snapping, so they are good with young children. They may or
may not bark when strangers arrive, and are not suited to be guard dogs due to their trusting and
unsuspicious nature. Outside, however, particularly when they are racing or lure coursing, they
demonstrate their superb athletic skills and will pursue their “quarry” (even when it is an artificial lure)
with the heart of a lion.

Unlike many other breeds, the males are as easy to housebreak, and no more aggressive than females.
Both sexes make excellent pets. Males tend to be slightly more loyal and enjoy repetitive play. Females
can be a little more complex and strong-willed, but are equally devoted to their owners. Males tend to
run one to two inches taller, and three to six pounds heavier, than females.




                                     Whippet sleeping

Whippets are not well adapted for living in a kennel or as outside dogs. Their coats do not provide the
insulation to withstand prolonged periods of exposure to the cold. Their natural attachment to people
makes them happiest when kept as housepets. The quiet Whippet is well suited to apartment life,
although they do need regular exercise. Care should be taken with Whippets on the street as it is difficult
to instil any sort of traffic sense into them.

Whippets, as their heritage would suggest, are outstanding running dogs and are top competitors in lure
coursing, straight racing, and oval track racing. In these events, a temporary track and lure system is set
up. The lure is usually a white plastic trash bag. With new methods of motivational obedience training
being used, Whippets are becoming successful obedience dogs. Many enjoy flyball and agility. The
elegance and ease of grooming of the Whippet have made it a popular show dog, but to be successful at
this sport, you must purchase a puppy who is considered by its breeder to be show quality.

Health
Given proper nutrition, exercise, and veterinary care, most Whippets live for 12 to 15 years. They are
generally healthy, and are not prone to the frequent ear infections, skin allergies, or digestive problems
that afflict other breeds. Genetic eye defects have been found in the breed, but are still very rare.
Because of this threat, the American Whippet Club recommends that all breeders have the eyes checked
clear on their breeding stock. Hip dysplasia is not a problem in Whippets. Undescended testicles are
common in the breed.

History
These dogs were bred to hunt by sight, coursing game in open areas at high speeds. Although one can
find numerous representations of small Greyhound-like hounds in art dating back to Roman times, the
modern Whippet was created by working-class people of northern England by crossing Greyhounds with
several other breeds, including the Italian Greyhound and a now-extinct long-legged terrier. These small
coursing hounds were cheaper to feed and house than Greyhounds but were very handy at providing
rabbits for the pot. They also were used to provide sport on nonworking days as their owners enjoyed
racing them against each other. The modern look of the breed was created by upper-class English dog
fanciers, who bought the best-looking Whippets and bred them selectively to appear most similar to a
miniature Greyhound.

                                       Dog Communication
                                                                                    Back | Home | Up | Next




                                  A dog might stretch after standing up, just as people do, or might drop
into a stretch when bored or to lead into a play bow.

Dog communication comes in a variety of forms. Dogs use certain movements of their bodies and body
parts and different vocalizations to send signals to other dogs, animals and humans. There are a number
of basic ways a dog can communicate. These are movements of the ears, eyes and "eyebrows", mouth,
head, tail, and entire body, as well as barks, growls, whines and whimpers, and howls.

Dominance and submission
One of the most common communications between dogs, and from dogs to their human companions, is
the display of either dominance or submission. Most dogs and wild canines live in groups, or packs, with
an established hierarchy. Dogs will, usually, submit to any dog that is more dominant than they are.
There are innumerable ways a dog can show their dominance or submission, depending on situation, the
amount of difference in social rank, and each dogs' own personality. Dominant dogs are more confident,
while submissive dogs are more insecure. Both of these traits show in almost every communication
signal a dog gives.

Body movements
       See also Wolf body language

Tail

How high or low the tail is held, in relation to how the dog's breed naturally carries their tail, and how it
is moved can signify the dog's mood and/or rank. The higher the tail is carried, the more dominant/
confident the dog is; the lower, the more submissive/insecure. A tail held straight up, or even slightly
curved over the back, shows that the dog is very dominant. If the fur on the tail is also bristled, the dog is
saying they are willing and able to defend their position.

Small, slow wags of the tail says the dog is questioning things around them. Either they aren't sure if the
target dog or person is friendly, or they aren't sure what is going on or what is expected of them.

Large, fast wags of the tail is a sign of a happy dog. If the wags are large enough to pull the dog's hips
with them, the message includes a bit of submission to someone they view as pack leader.

Dogs with docked tails, like Dobermanns, tend to have some problems communicating with other dogs,
since their tail movements are extremely difficult to detect.

Ears

Ear position relates the dog's level of attention, and reaction, to a situation or animal. Erect ears facing
forward means the dog is very attentive, while ears laid back suggests a negative, usually fearful,
reaction. Dogs with drop ears, like Beagles, can't use these signals very well, as the signals first
developed in wolves, whose ears are pricked.

Mouth

Mouth expressions can provide information about the dog's mood. When a dog wants to be left alone, he
might yawn (although yawning also might indicate sleepiness, confusion, or stress) or start licking his
mouth without the presence of any food. When a dog is happy or wants to play, he might pant with lips
relaxed, covering the teeth and with what sometimes appears to be a happy expression (it might appear
as a smile to some observers) or with the mouth open. Mouth expressions that indicate aggression
include the snarl, with lips retracting to expose the teeth, although some dogs also use this during play.

It's important to look at the dog's whole body and not just the mouth or tail before deciding what the dog
is trying to communicate. What appears initially as aggression might be an invitation to play.

Eyes and eyebrows

While dogs don't have actual eyebrows, they do have a distictive ridge above their eyes, and some
breeds, like the Rottweiler and the German Shepherd, have markings there. A dog's eyebrow movements
usually express a similar emotion to that of a human's eyebrow movements. Raised eyebrows suggest
interest, lowered brows suggest confusion or mild anger, and one eyebrow up suggests bewilderment.
Slitted eyes translate the same as human's also: suspicion or anger.

Vocalizations
Barks

Dogs bark for many reasons, such as when perceived intruders (humans, dogs, or other animals)
approach its territory, for identification, when hearing an unfamiliar or unidentified noise, when seeing
something that the dog doesn't expect to be there, or when playing. Barking also expresses different
emotions for a dog, such as loneliness, fear, suspicion, stress, and pleasure. Play or excited barks are
often short and sharp, such as when a dog is attempting to get a person or another dog to play.

Dogs generally try to avoid conflict; their vocalizations are part of what communicates to other dogs
whether they mean harm or are in a playful mood.

The bark of a distressed or stressed dog is high pitched, atonal, and repetitive (and tends to get higher in
pitch as the dog becomes more upset). For example, a dog left home alone and who has separation
anxiety might bark in such a way.

Some research has suggested that dogs have separate barks for different animals, including dog, fox,
deer, human and cat.

Growls

Growls can be used to threaten, to invite play, and to show dominance. Growling should be watched
with special attention because it can indicate dominance or aggression. A soft, low-pitched growl often
indicates aggression; the dog may feel threatened and may be provoked to attack. An intense growl,
without showing any teeth, may often indicate a playful attitude. Always consider the context of a growl,
and approach with caution.

Whines and whimpers

Dogs whine and whimper to show that they are in pain or are afraid, but also when excited, such as
when greeting another dog. Some dogs may use whining as a means of getting attention.

Howls

Howling provides long-range communication with other dogs or owners. Howling can be used to locate
another pack member, to keep strangers away, or to call the pack for hunting. Sometimes dogs howl in
response to high-pitched or loud noises such as alarms, sirens, music, or singing. In Russia, a howling
dog represents a bad sign, for it is believed that howling dogs sense somebody's death somewhere in the
vicinity.

Barking is the one of the noises most commonly produced by dogs.


Why dogs bark
Although dogs are a subspecies of the wolf, Canis lupus, their barking constitutes a significant
difference from their parent species. Although wolves do bark, they do so only in specific situations.
According to Coppinger and Feinstein, dogs bark in long, rhythmic stanzas but adult wolf barks tend to
be brief and isolated [1]. Dogs, by contrast, bark frequently and in many different situations.

It has been suggested that the reason for the difference lies in the dog's domestication by humans. Dogs
present a striking example of neoteny, the retention of juvenile characteristics in the adults. They are
similar to young wolves in many of their mannerisms and physical features, such as large heads, flat
faces, large eyes, submissiveness and vocalizing – all of which are exhibited in wolf puppies.

It is thought that these characteristics were deliberately selected for by early humans. There may have
been a number of reasons for this. For instance, an overgrown puppy would very likely have been seen
as a more engaging companion than a more mature but less amusing pet. More prosaically, an increased
tendency to bark could have been useful to humans to provide an early warning system. Dogs may have
been used to alert their owners that another unfamiliar band of humans or a predatory animal was in the
area.

Individual dogs bark for a variety of reasons – although despite what frustrated humans might think,
spite does not appear to be one of them. They may bark to attract attention, to communicate a message,
or out of excitement. Dog barks do not constitute an information-rich message in the same fashion as
human speech, but they do nonetheless constitute more than mere noise. Statistical analysis has revealed
that barks can be divided into different subtypes based on context and that individual dogs can be
identified by their barks. Disturbance barks tend to be harsh, low frequency, and unmodulated, whereas
isolation and play barks tend to be tonal, higher frequency, and modulated. Barks are often accompanied
by body movements as part of a broader package of dog communication.


Representation
Woof is the conventional representation in the English language of the barking of a dog. As with other
examples of onomatopoeia or imitative sounds, other cultures "hear" the dog's barks differently and
represent them in their own ways. Some of the equivalents of "woof" in other European and Asian
languages are as follows:

    ●   English - woof, woof, ruff, ruff arf, arf (large dogs and also the sound of sealions); yap, yap

                                             The dog license tag might be one of several dog tags worn.

Dog licences (dog license in American English) are required in some jurisdictions to be the keeper of a
dog. Usually a dog-license identifying number is issued to the owner, along with a dog tag bearing the
identifier and a contact number for the registering organization. If a stray pet is found with the tag, a
rescuer can call the registering organization to get current contact information for the dog's owner.

Licensing a dog might require additional actions on the owner's part, such as ensuring that the dog has a
current rabies vaccination. Licenses typically must be renewed yearly or after some small number of
years.

Licencing information worldwide
Great Britain
       Dog licences used to exist, but were abolished in 1987. The final rate for a dog licence was 37.5p,
       which went to local authorities. A dog licence was mandatory to keep a dog, but was widely
       ignored, with only about half of owners having one.

Northern Ireland
      Dog licences continue to exist, under the Dogs (Northern Ireland) Order 1983. A dog licence
      costs £5.00 / year, or £2.50 for pensioners.

Republic of Ireland
      Dog licensing exists. Individual dog licences cost €12.70 / year, and general licences (allowing
      unlimited dogs) are €252.42.
United States
       Most states, municipalities, or other jurisdictions require dog licenses along with rabies
       vaccination.

New Zealand
        Exist.
Isle of Man
        Exist.

A dog's coat is its fur. A dog can be double coated—that is, having both a soft undercoat and a coarser
topcoat. Some dog breeds are single-coated—having only one type of coat or the other, more often only
the topcoat. The state of the coat is considered an indication of the animal's breeding and health.

Most dogs shed their undercoat each spring and regrow it again as colder weather comes in; this is also
referred to as blowing the coat. Many domesticated breeds shed their coat twice a year. In many
climates, the topcoat and undercoat might shed continuously in greater and smaller quantities all year.

Some dog breeds' coat is more like human hair than like other animals' fur; for example, the Poodle's
coat grows continuously, getting longer and longer, and requires frequent trimming.

Show dogs
The nature and quality of a show dog's coat is an important conformation point in the hobby of dog
fancy.

Some considerations in judging the quality of a dog's coat:

    ●   Colour (coat colour other than those allowed in the breed standard results in disqualification)
    ●   Markings (distribution of colour, spots, and patches; for example the spotted coat of a Dalmatian
        and the merle coat of an Australian Shepherd are distinctive, the markings of a terrier vary.)
    ●   Pattern (specific, predictable markings; brindle, for example, is a common pattern.
    ●   Texture of hair (smooth, rough, curly, straight, broken, silky)
    ●   Length of hair

Colours and patterns
Dogs' coats come in a tremendous variety of colours and patterns. Some breeds come in only one or two
specific colors, while other breeds can have a wide range of colors, patterns, and shades. Breeds bred
strictly for their working ability tend to have more variations than breeds bred primarily for their
appearance over a longer time, although some very old breeds also have more limited coat colors.

Words used for coat colours can vary from breed to breed, so a colour that is called red in one breed
might be called brown in other breeds.

                                The Puli's corded coat requires a large amount of patient grooming to
keep it attractive.

In animal grooming, cording is a technique in which dog coats are teased patiently into dreadlocks for
coat care or presentation purposes. Some dog breeds that are often corded are the Puli and the
Komondor. The Havanese is also occasionally corded for showing.

Although considered attractive and desirable for the show ring, a corded coat acts very much like a dust
mop as the dog moves through its environment. Dust, dirt, twigs, leaves, burs, and everything else
quickly become tangled in the coat. To keep the coat attractive, the owner must put in considerable time
and effort in cleaning it and in entertaining and exercising the dog in a way that minimizes the
accumulation of litter. Such dogs often have their cords tied up or covered with assorted dog clothing
when they are not in a clean environment.

Debarking, or devocalization, is a controversial procedure to permanently stop a dog from barking by
cutting its vocal cords or removing laryngeal tissue. A common impetus for debarking is a neighbor
upset at the dog's frequent or ill-timed barking. The procedure has come under fire partly because dogs
bark to express a variety of emotions, such as loneliness, which could perhaps be addressed by other
means, such as keeping the dog inside with the family instead of penned up in a yard. In addition, the
surgery reportedly involves a great deal of pain post-operatively[1].

Up to 35% of dog owners report problems with barking, which can be quite a nuisance in populous areas
[2].

                                               Dewclaw
                                                                                  Back | Home | Up | Next




                                 The dog's front dewclaw grows on the side of the foot, above the other
four toes but below the rear heelpad. This one is well worn from contact with the ground when the dog is
running.

A dewclaw is a vestigial digit on some mammals' legs. It grows higher on the leg so that, when the
animal is standing, it does not make contact with the ground.

Dogs
Dogs almost always have dewclaws on the front legs and occasionally on the hind legs. There is some
debate about whether the dewclaw helps dogs to gain traction when they run because, in some dogs, the
dewclaw makes contact when they are running and the nail on the dewclaw often wears down in the
same way that the toenails on their other toes do, from friction with running surfaces. However, in many
dogs, the dewclaws never make contact with the ground; in this case, the dewclaw's nail never wears
away, and it must be trimmed to keep it at a safe length.




                                 This dog's dewclaw never makes contact with the ground and has
grown.

There is also some debate as to whether dewclaws should be surgically removed. The argument for
removal states that dewclaws are a weak digit, barely attached to the leg, so that they can rip partway off
or easily catch on something and break, which can be painful and prone to infection. In some countries,
however, removing the dewclaws is illegal, the argument being that the dewclaw will rarely or never
suffer injury leading to amputation and that removing it is unnecessarily painful to the dog. In addition,
for those dogs whose dewclaws make contact with the ground when they run, it is possible that
removing them could be a disadvantge for a dog's speed in running and changing of direction,
particularly in performance dog sports such as dog agility. There also exists in folklore a story which
claims that dogs that have not had their dewclaws removed are immune to snakebite.

                                               Docking
                                                                                 Back | Home | Up | Next


Docking is the cutting off or removal of something, such as a person's pay or an animal's tail. It is
commonly used to refer to the removal of part of an animal's tail or ears. The term cropping is also
used, more commonly in reference to the docking of ears, while docking more commonly—but not
exclusively—refers to the tail. The term bobbing is also used.

History of docking and cropping
Originally, most docking was done for practical purposes. For example, a large horse used for hauling
large loads might have its tail docked to prevent it from becoming entangled in tow ropes or harnesses;
without docking, it could be dangerous to the horse and inconvenient to the owner to tie up the horse's
tail for every use.

The tradition of docking dogs originates in the old Roman empire where worms in the tail of the dog
were thought to cause rabies. This belief led to the tradition of cutting off the tail as a preventive
measure.

Some hunting dogs originally had tails docked to prevent them from becoming tangled in undergrowth
or similar reasons.




                                              Boxers with natural and docked ears and docked tails
Some hunting and fighting dogs' ears and tails were cropped to make them less available as targets for
other animals that they might fight with.

In dogs used for guarding property (such as Dobermanns or Boxers), docked ears often makes the breed
appear more ferocious; hanging ears are reminiscent of the naturally droopy ears of puppies, looking
more cute than dangerous. To ensure the best use of the dog (intimidating possible thieves or
interlopers), a more ferocious appearance was important.

For dogs who worked in fields, such as some hunting dogs and some herding dogs, tails could collect
burrs and foxtails, causing pain and infection; tails with long fur could collect feces and become a
cleanliness problem; and particularly for herding dogs, longer tails could get caught in gates behind
livestock. These arguments are often used to justify docking tails for certain breeds, although the same
rationale is not applied to all herding or to all hunting dogs with long or feathered tails.

In many breeds whose tails (or whose ancestors' tails) have been docked over centuries, such as
Australian Shepherds, no attention was paid to selectively breeding animals whose natural tail was
attractive or healthy—or, in some cases, dogs with naturally short ( or bob) tails were selectively bred,
but inconsistently (since docking was done as a matter of course, a natural bob didn't have an extremely
high value). As a result, in many of these breeds, naturally short tails can occur but so do longer tails and
some inbetween, and occasionally tails have developed with physical problems or deformities because
the genetic appearance was never visible or because of the inconsistent emphasis on natural bobs.
Breeders often consider many of the resulting tails to be ugly or unhealthy and so continue to dock all
tails for the breed.

Current status
Docking is usually done almost immediately after birth to ensure that the wound heals easily and
properly. An old belief said that newborns hardly felt the injury, but now reputable breeders have
cropping and docking performed only under licensed veterinary care. Today, many countries consider
cropping or docking to be cruel or mutilation and ban it entirely. This is not true in the United States,
and the breed standards for many breeds registered with the American Kennel Club (AKC) make
undocked animals presumably ineligible for the dog show ring. The AKC states that it has no rules that
require docking or that make undocked animals ineligible for the show ring, but it also states that it
defers to the individual breed clubs (who define the breed standards) to define the best standards for
each breed.

In such an environment, even people who desire undocked dogs often cannot get them. Most people
prefer to choose a puppy from a reputable breeder after the puppy is old enough to determine personality
and conformation, whereas docking is done immediately after birth. A breeder normally does not want
to withhold docking on an entire litter so that a potential owner can later have one of the puppies with
undocked tail or ears.
Show dogs of many breeds are still routinely docked in the UK. Kennel Club standards allow for docked
or undocked dogs to enter conformation shows. However, many owners believe that an undocked dog is
at a disadvantage when judged. An undocked dog's tail must be within the standard, so a docked dog is
at an advantage by having one less attribute to be judged. There is also a perception that many judges
have a preference for docked tails.

Although docking should be performed by a veterinary surgeon, often the methods used are far from
ideal. In the UK a common method is to apply a rubber ring around the tail base, so that circulation is
cut off and the tail dies. This extends the period of pain for the puppy and increases the risk of infection.

In Europe, the cropping of ears is prohibited in all countries that have ratified the European Convention
for the Protection of Pet Animals.

Legality in the UK
In the UK ear cropping is illegal and no dog with cropped ears can take part in any Kennel Club event
(including agility and other nonconformation events). Tail docking is legal, but only when carried out by
a registered veterinary surgeon. The Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons (RCVS), the regulatory body
for veterinary surgeons in the UK, has said that they consider tail docking to be "an unjustified
mutilation and unethical unless done for therapeutic or acceptable prophylactic reasons". In 1995 a
veterinary surgeon was brought before the RCVS disciplinary council for "disgraceful professional
conduct" for carrying out cosmetic docking. The vet claimed that the docking was performed to prevent
future injuries and the case was dismissed for lack of evidence otherwise. Although cosmetic docking is
still considered unacceptable by the RCVS, no further disciplinary action has been taken against vets
performing docking.

Arguments against docking dogs' tails
Robert Wansborough argues in a 1996 paper [2] that docking dogs' tails puts them at a disadvantage in
several ways. Firstly, Wansborough argues that dogs use their tails actively in communicating with other
dogs (and with people); a dog without a tail might be significantly handicapped in conveying fear,
caution, aggression, playfulness, and so on. In addition, certain dog breeds use their tails as rudders
when swimming, and possibly for balance when running, so active dogs with docked tails might be at a
disadvantage compared to their tailed peers.

Wansborough also investigates seven years of records from an urban veterinary practice to demonstrate
that undocked tails result in fewer harms than docked tails.

Although each of these criticisms has its counterarguments [3] the balance of scientific evidence is that
docking causes pain and may lead to behavioural problems.

Docking in agriculture
Tail docking may be performed on livestock for a variety of reasons. In some cases where commercially
raised animals are kept in close quarters, tail docking is performed to prevent injury or to prevent
animals from chewing or biting each others' tails. In sheep, tails may be docked for sanitary reasons. If
the tail is not docked, this can lead to flystrike, an infestation of maggots in the rectal area. On the other
hand, if the tail is docked too short, this may contribute to other problems such as rectal prolapse. [4]

A hairless dog is a dog with a genetic disposition for hairlessnes. There are two known types of genetic
hairlessness, a dominant and a recessive type.

Dominant genes
Dogs with dominant genes for hairlessness can pass their attributes to their offspring in natural
conditions, that is, not under the control of humans. Therefore, it is possible that, in some parts of the
world, groups of hairless dogs came into existence. Later in history, people developed these groups into
a recognized breed.

Known breeds at this time are the Chinese Crested Dog, the Mexican Hairless Dog, and the Peruvian
Hairless Dog. Other breeds there are said to exist are the African Hairless Dog and the Thai Hairless
Boran Dog.

This type of genetic structure is said to be homozygous lethal for the dominant gene. This means that
dogs with two dominant genes cannot live. Therefore, all dominant-hairless dogs have a heterozygous
gene structure. There's also a homozygous recessive type, which is a coated variety. On average, every
litter of hairless puppies should come with some coated ones, too. Statistically, for every 2 hairless
puppies, there should on average be one coated.

However, some breeders claim varying averages from 1:0 to 2:1; that is, some breeders claim to have no
coated offspring in any of their litters, while others claim to have an average ratio of 8:1 or 4:1 or 2:1.
Averages that show more coated than hairless are not known.

The Chinese Crested coated variety is called "Powder Puff", and is a recognized type. For the other
breeds coated varieties are not recognized as valid varieties for show dogs.


Recessive genes
Dogs with a recessive gene for hairlessness are not known in natural conditions. The only known such
breed, the American Hairless Terrier, is created by mankind.

The marcel is a term used to describe a hairstyle. The word's origin is with French hairdresser François
Marcel Grateau (1852-1936) who developed the hairstyle in the 1920s by using a heated curling iron to
create deep, regular waves. In more recent times the term's use has expanded to describe the natural
coats of some wavy-haired dogs.

Merle is a colour combination in dogs’ coats. It is a solid base color (usually red/brown or black) with
lighter blue/gray or reddish patches, which gives a mottled or uneven speckled effect. Although most
breeds that can have merle coats also typically have white markings (such as around the neck, under the
belly, and so on), and often tan points (typically between the white and the darker parts of the coat),
these are separate colors from the merle; some dogs do appear completely merled with no white or tan
markings.

Merle is a distinguishing marking of several breeds, particularly the Australian Shepherd, and appears in
others such as the Shetland Sheepdog, various Collies, the Welsh Corgi (Cardigan), the Pyrenean
Shepherd, the Catahoula Leopard Dog, the Koolie, and others.

Merle is actually a heterozygote of an incomplete dominance gene. If two such dogs are mated, on the
average one quarter of the puppies will have eye defects and are often deaf. Knowledgeable breeders
who want to produce merle puppies mate a merle with a nonmerle dog; roughly half the puppies will be
merles without the risk of vision or hearing defects.

A natural bobtail is a tail which due to a mutated gene grows to a shortened length, or is completed cut
off at the base of the spine. The term also refers to animals carrying the gene for a naturally short tail or
animals that naturally have no tail. The genes for the shortened tail may be dominant or recessive,
depending on the species.

Due to anti-tail docking legislation, natural bobtails are growing in importance in the hobby of dog fancy
for some traditionally docked breeds. For example, one Boxer breeder in England has reputedly
successfully petitioned the Kennel Club for permission to cross corgis into his lines and then backcross
to Boxers, to introduce the gene into his lines. This would have been unheard of in decades past.

In Australia, the prices for a registered purebred Miniature Fox Terrier bitch carrying the gene have
more than tripled.

A piebald is an animal that has large white and black patches. The colour of the horse's skin underneath
its coat may vary between black (under the black patches of hair) and pink (under the white patches). It
is typically a manifestation of the Tobiano gene.

Similar to the skewbald and oddbald, these colours are now no longer in common use in the UK and are
more correctly referred to as Coloured. However, the term is still in common parlance in Ireland where
piebald horses are popular amongst Irish Travellers. In the U.S., the more common term for this
colouring is paint or pinto, with paint referring to a horse with American Quarter Horse breeding and
pinto referring to a horse with any other breed, such as a pinto half-Arabian.

Dogs or cats may also be piebald. Snakes, especially Ball Pythons, may also exhibit seemingly varying
patches of completely pigmentless scales along with patches of pigmented scales.

A snout is the protruding portion of an animal's face, consisting of its nose, mouth, and jaw. The snout
is also often called a muzzle. An extremely elongated snout is often called a proboscis.

A piece of equipment also called a muzzle can be placed over the snout to prevent the animal from
biting or eating. See animal muzzle.


Dog's muzzle
Dogs' muzzles range in shape from extremely long and thin (dolichocephalic), as in the Rough Collie to
nearly nonexistent because it is so flat (extreme brachycephalic), as in the Pug. Some breeds, such as
many sled dogs and spitz types, have muzzles that somewhat resemble the original wolf's in size and
shape, and others in the less extreme range have shortened it somewhat (mesocephalic) as in many
hounds.

The muzzle begins at the stop, just below the eyes, and contains the dog's nose and mouth. Most of the

muzzle that hang to different lengths over the dog's mouth are called flews.

                           Notes
The Basset Hound is a chunky, short-legged breed of dog of the hound family. They are scent hounds,
bred to hunt by scent. Their sense of smell for tracking is second only to that of the Bloodhound. The
name Basset derives from the French word "bas" meaning "low" or "dwarf".

Appearance
These dogs are around 33 to 38 cm (13 to 15 inches) in height at the withers. They have smooth, short-
haired coats and are generally tricolor (black, tan, and white). These dogs also occur in open red and
white (red spots on white fur), closed red and white (a solid red color with white feet and tails), and
lemon and white. Some, though few, are also classified as grey Basset Hounds.

They have long, low-set ears and powerful necks, with much loose skin around their heads that forms
wrinkles. Their tails are long and tapering and stand upright with a curve. The breed is also known for its
hanging skin structure, which causes the face to have a permanently sad look; this, for many people,
adds to the breed's charm. The loose, elastic skin around the neck and trailing ears are thought to help
catch the scent of what they are tracking.

Basset Hounds are a "large dog" on short legs. They were specifically bred to have dwarfism,
specifically achondroplasia. Their short stature can be deceiving: Bassets are surprisingly long and can
reach things on table tops that dogs of similar heights cannot.

Temperament




                           Tricolour Basset

The Basset Hound is a very calm and companionable breed, but they are often very stubborn. They are
an especially loyal breed, are very friendly, and will gladly play with children. Bassets are amiable and
generally love being around people.

When left on their own, Bassets tend to excessively eat and sleep rather than exercise. Care must be
taken to prevent unhealthy weight gain. The mournful appearance of the Basset Hound can cause owners
to be "sympathetic" and give them extra food; owners should resist this temptation lest their dogs
become overweight.

Like other hounds, Basset Hounds are often very difficult to obedience train. Many Basset Hounds will
obey commands when offered a food reward, but will "forget" the training when a reward is not present.
Bassets are notoriously difficult to housebreak.

The breed has a strong hunting instinct and will give chase or follow a scent if given the opportunity.
They should be trained in recall; failing that, they should be kept on a leash when out on walks.

Bassets might howl or bay rather than bark when they want something or to suggest that they think
something is wrong.

History
Basset Hounds are an aristocratic breed of French lineage, a descendant of the St. Hubert's Hound, a dog
similar to the present-day Bloodhound. Friars of St. Hubert's Abbey in medieval France desired a shorter-
legged dog, capable of following a scent under brush in thick forests, as hunting was a classic sport of
the time. Both Bassets and St. Hubert's Hounds were bred to trail, not kill, their game. Bassets were
originally used to hunt rabbits and hare. The first application of the word "Basset" to a breed of dog can
be traced to an illustrated text on hunting written by Fouilloux in 1585.

Early French Bassets closely resembled the Basset Artésien Normand, which is still a breed today
though it is not recognized outside of France. Because many short-legged dogs from this time were
called basset and record-keeping from this time was sparse, it is difficult to speculate which of these
breeds have bloodlines in common with today's Basset Hounds. It is commonly believed that Marquis de
Lafayette brought Basset Hounds to the United States as a gift to George Washington.

In 1863 the Basset Hound reached international fame at the Paris Dog Show. At that time there were two
common Bassets, those with a rough coat (Basset Griffon) and those with smooth (Basset Français). The
dogs were further classified by the length of their legs. The two popular Basset breeders at this time
were M. Lane and the Count Le Couteulx.

In 1866, Lord Galway imported a pair of Le Couteulx Bassets to England, but it was not until 1874 that
Basset Hounds were widely introduced there by Sir Everett Millais. The Kennel Club accepted the breed
in 1882 and the English Basset Hound Club was formed in 1884. The American Kennel Club first
recognized Basset Hounds as a breed in 1885. In 1935, the Basset Hound Club of America was
organized in the United States. The current American breed standard was adopted in 1964.


Health
In comparison to other breeds, the Basset Hound is an especially healthy breed, but there are some
illnesses to which they may fall prey.

They are a deep-chested breed, and are therefore prone to bloat. Many bloodlines are genetically prone
to glaucoma, luxating patella, and ectropion ("cherry eye"). Young Bassets occasionally develop
panosteitis. Older Bassets occasionally develop Von Willebrand disease. Long dogs on short legs can
easily develop back pain, especially if excessive weight is already a concern. Hip dysplasia can be a
problem in Bassets. Grey Basset Hounds are more likely to be born with medical problems, and it is
advisable not to purchase these.

Care
Bassets tend to shed a lot, but do not require frequent brushing. Like the Bloodhound, they are a "wet
mouthed" dog and tend to drool. As Basset Hounds often overeat, feedings should be regulated to
prevent weight gain. Long ears are prone to infection if not regularly cleaned. Trailing bellies and
massive paws will carry and track dirt to the despair of many owners.

Miscellaneous




In 1928, Time magazine featured a Basset Hound on the front cover. The accompanying story was about
the 52nd annual Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show at Madison Square Garden as if observed by the
Basset Hound puppy. This prestige is often seen as the event which made the Basset Hound a popular
part of American pop culture.

                              Notes
The Mexican Hairless Dog is a rare, (almost) hairless breed of dog which can be quite variable in size.
It's also known as Xoloitzcuintli or Xoloitzcuintle (the initial x is pronounced as an sh), Tepeizeuintli or
Mexican Hairless. Owners of this dog call them "xolos" for short. The breed was native to Pre-
Columbian Mesoamerica, and may date back 3500 years.

Appearance
The breed ranges in size from about 10 pounds (4 kg) to 50 pounds (20 kg), with an average body
temperature of 40 °C. Similar in appearance to a Pharaoh Dog, with a sleek body, almond-shaped eyes,
large bat-like ears, and a long antelope neck, the Xolo is notable for its dominant trait of hairlessness.
Many members of this breed are also missing several teeth. There is also a "coated" Xolo with a very
short coat of hair, and individual dogs may exhibit varying degrees of head and body coats.

History
The breed was native to Pre-Columbian Mesoamerica, and may date back 3500 years or earlier. Some
cultures are believed to have kept them as pets, and believed the animals to be sacred.

Xolos were considered sacred dogs by the Aztecs because they believed the dogs were needed by their
masters’ souls to help them safely through the underworld. According to Aztec mythology, the god
Xolotl made the Xoloitzcuintle from a sliver of the Bone of Life from which all man was made. Xolotl
gave this gift to Man with the instruction to guard it with his life and in exchange it would guide Man
through the dangers of Mictlan, the world of Death, towards the Evening Star in the Heavens.

Even today some people may believe this breed to have healing, telepathic, or (gray) alien qualities.
Other cultures ate the meat of the Xoloitzcuintli for ritual or medicinal purposes, and the meat may still
be found for sale in some parts of rural Mexico.

Xolos are not currently recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC), making them a rare breed in
the United States and other parts of the world. The breed is recognized by the FCI (Federacion Canofila
Mexicana) which began a registration and breeding program for the Xolo on May 1, 1956. Prior to that
time the Xolos were considered nearly extinct. New breed stock is still found in remote pockets of rural
Mexico.

                            Notes



The Australian Shepherd is a working dog that was developed—despite its name—in the United States
in the 19th century. The dog, commonly known as an Aussie, is popular in its native California and is
growing in popularity in countries across the world.

Like many working breeds, the Aussie has considerable energy and drive and usually needs a job to do.
It often excels at dog sports such as frisbee and dog agility.


Appearance
The coat comes in several colors—blue merle, red merle, solid red, or solid black; all can occur with or
without white markings, tan (copper) points, or both. Dogs with tan and white along with the primary
color are usually called tricolor.

The breed's general appearance also varies greatly depending on the particular line's emphasis. As with
many working breeds that are also shown in the ring, there are differences of opinion among breeders
over what makes an ideal Australian Shepherd.

Reflecting the great variation that still exists in the breed, an Aussie can stand between 18 and 23 inches
(46 to 58 cm) at the withers and weigh between 35 and 70 pounds (16 to 32 kg). For show dogs, females
should fall in the lower heights and males in the higher ranges.

A hallmark of the breed is a short bobbed or docked tail in countries where docking is permitted. Some
Aussies are born with naturally short bobbed tails, others with full long tails, and others with natural
partial bobs, where the tail is midlength and appears stubby. Most breeders dock the tails when the
puppies are born.

Temperament
                                 Red merle and white Aussie

Because of the dog's origins, this breed is not for everyone. It is an energetic dog that requires exercise
and needs a job to do, whether it is learning and practicing tricks, competing in dog agility, or any other
physically and mentally involving activity. It needs to run, full out, regularly. It is usually a sweet and
affectionate dog who is faithful to its owners and is good with children, although its overwhelming
instinct to work may subvert its ability to function as a family dog, including chasing and nipping at
running children to herd them if not properly trained. Its protective instinct and behaviors can be
frightening to children, strangers, and small animals. It was bred to guard stock and can be sometimes
annoying with its inclination to bark warnings about neighborhood activity, but it is not generally an
obsessively barking dog. It is intelligent, learns quickly, and loves to play. This means that a bored,
neglected, unexercised Aussie will invent its own games, activities, and jobs, which to a busy owner
might appear to be hyperactivity in the house around fragile furnishings or involve the destruction of
yard and property.




                                 Aussies can be friendly and affectionate.

History
The Australian Shepherd's history is vague, as is the origin of its misleading name. Most of the breed's
antecedents most likely originated in the Basque region near the Pyrenees Mountains between Spain and
France.

Early European settlers took many of their herding dogs with them as they emigrated to the eastern
United States in the 19th century. Breeds included some that are now extinct or that have merged into
other breeds. These probably included the English Shepherd, Dorset Blue Shag, Cumberland Sheepdog,
Scottish Collie, Glenwherry Collie, and Bouvier des Flandres, as well as dogs from Germany and Spain.
For many centuries, shepherds had more interest in dogs who performed well when helping to manage
flocks of sheep than they had in the specific appearance of the dogs. As a result, over time, shepherds
interbred dogs that they believed would produce better workers for the given climate and landscape.
Terrain and weather conditions in the eastern U.S. were similar to that of Europe, however, so the
existing imported breeds and their offspring worked well there.

In the western states, conditions were quite different. In the primarily arid and semiarid areas inhabited
sparsely by early Spanish settlers, temperatures reached extremes of hot and cold, and fields varied in
altitude from sea level into the higher, rougher Sierra Nevada and similar mountain ranges. A few
Spanish and Basque shepherds, their flocks, and their herding dogs came to California with the Spanish
missionaries and other settlers in the 18th and early 19th centuries.




                                 Black tricolor and blue merle tricolor Aussies.

With the 1849 California gold rush, a massive migration occurred from the east coast to the west coast,
and along with the people came flocks of sheep and the eastern herding dogs. But it was just as effective
to bring sheep in by ship, and in they came, including flocks from Latin America and other regions.
Shepherds came along with the flocks and also independently, from Latin America, Europe, and
Australia, along with their own herding breeds.

Dogs from Australia had already begun to be selected and bred for climates and terrains that were often
similar to California.

As shepherds worked to develop dogs who could handle stock in harsh storms, high arid heat, and
chilling cold, and who could think on their own in challenging terrain, reacting instantly to the
movement of sheep and to their handlers' commands, the type that became the Australian Shepherd was
born.

The name remains somewhat of a mystery, however; the largest influx of shepherds from Australia
arrived in the early 20th century, well after the breed had been established as a distinct type. It is
possible that many of the imported Australian herding dogs had merle coloring, which was also common
in the American Australian Shepherd breed, and so all merle herding dogs were simply referred to as
Australian. This remains conjecture.
Recent history




                                 Black and white (bicolor) Australian Shepherd stopping cows

Selective breeding for many generations focused on aspects of the dog that enabled it to function as an
effective stockdog in the American west. It had to handle severe weather; have plenty of speed,
athleticism, energy, and endurance; and be intelligent, flexible, and independent while remaining
obedient. The Australian Shepherd remained more of a type than a breed until the 1950s, when they
became popular as performing dogs in rodeos. Their stunts and skills earned them places in several
Disney films, including Run Appaloosa Run and Stub: The Greatest Cowdog in the West.

The Australian Shepherd Club of America (ASCA) was founded in 1957 to promote the breed, and the
National Stock Dog Registry became its official breed registry the same year, which it continued until
ASCA took over in the 1970s. In the late 1970s, ASCA created a breed standard, which described
exactly how a dog should look and be constructed (its conformation). This was the first step in becoming
a breed rather than a type.

In the United States, the AKC is the primary breed registry for purebred dogs. However, many Aussie
breeders felt that AKC put too much emphasis on conformation and not enough on performance, so
ASCA declined to join the AKC. Those breeders who felt that AKC membership had its advantages split
off from ASCA to form their own Australian Shepherd club, the United States Australian Shepherd
Association, created their own breed standard, and joined the AKC in 1993. The decision about
affiliation with the AKC remains controversial, as it does with many performance breeds.

These dogs excel at many dog sports, especially herding, dog agility, frisbee, and flyball.

                             Notes



A Dalmatian is a breed of dog, noted for its white coat with (usually) black spots. "Liver" (brown) and
"lemon" (yellow) types also exist, though they are much rarer. In the US Dalmatians are often known
(and portrayed, for example in children's books), as firehouse dogs.

Appearance
This popular breed of dog is a well-muscled, midsized dog with superior endurance. Known for its
elegance, the Dalmatian has a body type similar to the Pointer, to which it may be related. The coat is
short, dense, and fine. The ground color is white with round, well-defined spots in either black or liver
(brown). Lemon, orange, blue, tricolor, and brindle spots can also occur, but they are a disqualifying
fault according to the breed standard. The feet are round and compact with well-arched toes. The nails
are either white and/or the same color as the spots. The nose can be black or brown in liver-spotted dogs.
The eyes are brown or blue, with an intelligent expression. The ears are thin, tapering toward the tip, set
fairly high and carried close to the head

Puppies are born completely white and the spots develop later.

Temperament
As a result of their history as coach dogs, the breed is very active and needs plenty of exercise. They are
quite affectionate and need constant companionship or there is a risk they may become depressed. They
are good with children, but because of their playfulness, they may not be well-suited for toddlers.
Dalmatians are famed for their loyalty, good memories, and kindly natures.

Reputation
                                     Dalmatian dog

The Dalmatian's reputation as a firehouse dog appears to be rooted in the popular use of the Dalmatian
as a carriage dog, that is, a dog whose role was to run along, beside, and sometimes even under horse-
drawn carriages (therefore also known as Spotted Coach-dog). Carriage dogs were useful for clearing
the way in front of the carriage, possibly for helping to control the horses when at a full run (such as for
horse-drawn fire engines), and undoubtedly because they were attractive and eye-catching. This use
might have transferred to horse-drawn fire engines although it is unclear why this link is made in the US
and not other countries.

However, their origins are as a generalized working dog. They were used for so many tasks--herding
sheep, hunting in a pack, and working as a retriever and as a bird dog--that they were never specialized
into one particular area.

Origins
The breed was named in the 18th century after Dalmatia.

However, it is believed to have existed for possibly centuries before it was so named:

    ●   4000-year-old Greek art displays dogs that appear similar to the modern Dalmatian
    ●   There is some evidence that it originated even before that in India
    ●   The breed could have originated from the Norman introduction of the Talbot hunting dog whose
        image was the crest of the Talbot family, who came to Britain with the original Norman invasion.
Health
Some Dals have a tendency towards deafness, as is the case with many mostly white or all-white dogs.
Information from Dalmatian clubs can usually address this issue for new owners. Some male Dalmatians
are aggressive towards other male dogs.

Dalmatians, like humans, apes, and guinea pigs, lack an enzyme called uricase, which breaks down uric
acid. Uric acid can build up in joints and cause gout or kidney stones. These conditions are most likely
to occur in middle-aged males. Owners should be careful to limit the intake of purine by not feeding
these dogs organ meats in order to reduce the likelyhood of stones.

Miscellaneous

The breed experienced a massive surge in popularity caused by the 1956 novel The Hundred and One
Dalmatians by Dodie Smith, and especially the Disney films based on the book. At the time of the 1996
live action film 101 Dalmatians concern was expressed that people, having seen the film, would buy the
dogs without thinking through the responsibilities of ownership: for example, Dalmatians, having been
bred to run with horses, need plenty of exercise. It is not clear whether these concerns turned out to be
correct, although there is evidence that problems occurred in 1961 when the first animated film, One
Hundred and One Dalmatians, was released.

The Yorkshire Terrier, also known as a Yorkie, is a breed of small dogs, one of many toy dog breeds.
Yorkies can be very small indeed, usually not weighing more than about 5 or 6 pounds (less than 3kg.)

Appearance
The breed standard calls for a long, blue and tan coat that hangs straight and parts down the middle.
However, many yorkies do not conform directly to the standard. Some coats are black or grey on the
body. Brown and gold on the faces and legs is most common. The fur in a show dog is usually straight
and can grow very long. Yorkies can also have somewhat wavy fur, although clubs do not recognize this
variation for dog shows. In either case, Yorkie fur is soft, fine, and high-maintenance, and must either be
trimmed short or washed and brushed frequently.

Temperament
The Yorkshire Terrier, though a Toy Breed, still retains much of its Terrier ancestry in terms of
personality. Though personalities differ from dog to dog generally Yorkies are intelligent, independent
and spunky. Yorkies, especially males, are very territorial and are known for their disregard for the
limitations of their own size. They will often attack much larger dogs despite their extreme size
disadvantage.

Yorkies typically get along well with cats or other dogs, and love to play together in groups. However,
they are still terriers, and even an old, sedentary lap dog will eagerly hunt rodents. Because they are so
small, they are easily injured, so while they will get along very well with children, it can be dangerous
for the Yorkie to keep it in a house with small or abusive children. Also, despite their small size, if
continually provoked or if attacked, like all dogs, they pack a surprisingly powerful bite.

Yorkshire Terriers tend to be more difficult to train than some of their canine cousins; however, this
difficulty is considered to be a result of the breed’s characteristic stubbornness rather than any major
deficiency of intelligence.
Health
Yorkies tend to develop cataracts in their old age, but their small size limits the effects of conditions
such as arthritis. There is also the possibility of Trachea collapse, the cause of which is thought by many
to be partially genetic, and partially caused by environment- specifically, the strain an energetic Yorkie
puts on its neck when straining against its collar. Most veterinarians recommend use of a harness instead
of a collar to help prevent the chronic coughing caused by partial trachea collapse. As with many
purebred dogs, the Yorkshire Terrier is prone to certain genetic disorders. Most common is the liver
shunt (portosystemic shunt). In this condition some of the dog's blood bypasses the liver and as such
does not get cleaned of those toxins that the liver is responsible for removing. A Yorkie with this
condition might exhibit some or all of the following symptoms: small stature, poor muscle development,
behavioral abnormalities, unresponsiveness, seizures, and so on; however, if treated by a veterinarian, in
time, the condition is most often reversible.

History
Most believe that the Yorkshire Terrier is the product of co-mingling Scottish and English terriers when
many Scots were displaced by the Industrial Revolution and settled in England. Though pedigrees are
not available for the first Yorkshire Terrier ancestors, several breeds have been suggested including (for
the Scottish contribution) the Waterside Terrier, the Clydesdale Terrier, and the Paisley Terrier. English
contributions to the bloodline of the Yorkshire Terrier may have included, according to many sources,
the Manchester Terrier, the Maltese, and the Dandie Dinmont Terrier.

The original Yorkshire Terrier, known as the "Broken-Haired Scotch Terrier" was a 12-to-14 pound dog
with wire hair whose intended purpose was the catching of rats and other vermin that lived in small
spaces.

In 1870, the breed was renamed the Yorkshire Terrier, after the county of Yorkshire, England where the
breed is believed to have originated. The father dog of the breed is considered to be Huddersfield Ben,
who was born in 1865, the inbred offspring of a mother and son. Huddersfield Ben was bred by Mr. W.
Eastwood Huddersfield, who died in 1871. A multiple champion, Huddersfield Ben set the foundation
for what would develop into the modern Yorkie.

Miscellaneous
A newly proposed breed, the Biewer, might or might not be a variation of the Yorkie or an entirely new
breed.

Famous Yorkies
    ●   Chow Mein from Gypsy
    ●   Smoky World War II hero

Smoky was a Yorkshire Terrier who belonged to William Wynne of Ohio. Mr. Wynne adopted Smoky
while serving with the 5th Air Force in the Pacific Theatre. Mr. Wynne trained Smoky to perform
various tricks to entertain himself and his comrades. Smoky was later entered in Yank Magazine’s Best
Mascot Contest. She won first prize and had her picture on the cover!

Smoky became a war dog when she used her small size to her advantage and helped to “run”
communication wire through a culvert that was under a runway. Without Smoky’s assistance, the
runway would need to be excavated while the cable was laid. The runway would have been inoperable
for several days. Smoky was deemed the most famous dog of World War Two. She returned home to
Ohio with Mr. Wynne where she continued her “entertainment” career.

The coat is wiry and the breed has a typical beard. The color can be liver, black, or either color with
white. Commonly the head is a solid or nearly solid color and the body is speckled, with saddles or large
patches of solid color.

Temperament
This version of German Pointer makes a good family dog and a working dog with tolerance for a variety
of conditions.

Health
Hip and elbow arthritis can be an inherited problem.

History
This gun dog was created by selective breeding from various other breeds, including the French Griffon,
Pudelpointer, Short-Haired Pointer, and Broken-Coated Pointer.

                              Notes



A Border Terrier is a small, rough-coated breed of dog in the terrier family.


Appearance
The Border Terrier has a double coat consiting of a soft undercoat and harsh, wiry outer coat. Colours
include grizzle and tan ( a sort of salt and pepper look), blue and tan (sometimes looks almost black), red
grizzle, and, less commonly, wheaten. The coat needs to be stripped by hand (not clipped) regularly, as
the top coat becomes long and shaggy and eventually dies. Borders being shown generally have a short
coat that has been stripped and is starting to grow back in.

Temperament
Border Terriers are friendly and playful, and can make good family pets as they are sometimes good
with children. They are best kept by people who have had dogs before and know how to maintain human
social dominance over them. They are highly energetic dogs, and so unless a lot of time can be devoted
to them, they are generally best kept with other dogs of similar temperament. Ideal companions would
be other Border Terriers, Collies, and most Spaniels.

Border Terriers are relatively easily trained, although they can develop a cat-like independence and,
when kept as part of a group of dogs, can have confusion recognising that each dog has a different name
(they occasionally respond to them all). Some members of the breed make a highly effective alternative
to a doorbell, due to their sharp hearing and the distinctive frenzied barking that results when they hear
someone approaching the door. They are best kept in pairs or small groups, or with dogs of other breeds.
Their dominant personalities can be used to the advantage of the owner if larger dogs are also kept as,
like all terriers, they will generally occupy a high position in the 'pack', subordinate to the owner. This is
especially true if a Border Terrier is an adult and the larger dog a puppy when introduced. However, if a
large dog comes into the family, although it is already an adult one, the Border Terrier starts to "test" his
new companion and, if there's no objection from the side of the larger dog, maintains his leadership.

Border Terriers are generally unsuitable for homes where there are rabbits, cats (except Maine Coons),
smaller breeds of dogs, or other similar pets, as they will attack and kill all animals smaller than
themselves; they were bred for this purpose. Exceptions to this are where the Terrier was introduced to
the other animal as a puppy. Despite this instinct, they are generally amicable with other dogs, and often
develop strong friendships with dogs they meet frequently. Nevertheless, in case they don't like another
dog, they don't hesitate to start a fight and, as it is the case with most terriers, it's not easy to stop them.
One has to train the Border Terrier carefully from the beginning so that he learns a correct social
behaviour with other dogs (especially with dogs that are of bigger size!).
Any toy given to a Border Terrier needs to be virtually indestructible. Solid, tough rubber toys such as
rubber rings are suitable; however, certain individuals might have a fascination for other objects found
in their environment, some of which the owner might not have wanted to be dog toys.

Health
Border Terriers are generally hardy and long-lived dogs with few health problems; however, they also
have a very high resistance to pain and so a Border Terrier, when it is unwell, will very often appear
perfectly healthy. Consequently, any sign of illness should be taken very seriously. Due to their low
percentage of body fat, Border Terriers are very sensitive to anesthetics and therefore care should be
taken in selecting a veterinarian that is aware of this and is cautious in administering anesthesia.

In addition, due to their instinct to kill and consume smaller animals, Border Terriers often destroy
(rather than play with) their toys—especially toys that are insufficiently robust—and often eat such toys
in the process. A Border Terrier can remove the squeak from a squeaky toy within 30 seconds, and
reduce such toys to fragments within a matter of minutes. This tendency can cause the appearance of
illness as a result of the subsequent indigestion; typical symptoms include lethargy, unwillingness to
play, a generally 'unhappy' appearance, lack of reaction to affection, and inability or unwillingness to
sleep. These symptoms are generally very noticeable; however, they are also present just prior to Border
Terrier bitches being on heat. Food-grade liquid paraffin is often an effective solution to digestive
problems caused by the consumption of dog toys.

Border Terriers occasionally have genetic health problems. Some of these include:

    ●   Hip dysplasia
    ●   Perthes disease
    ●   Luxating patella
    ●   Various heart defects
    ●   Juvenile cataracts
    ●   Progressive Retinal Atrophy
    ●   Seizures
    ●   CECS (Canine Eptiloid Cramping Syndrome [1]

Reliable breeders check all breeding stock for as many of these as possible before breeding.

History
The breed was developed for fox hunting in the area around the border of England and Scotland.

The Puli is a medium-small breed of dog known for its long, corded coat. The tight curls of the coat
make it virtually waterproof.




                            Black Puli with cords tied up to avoid collecting twigs and dirt

Appearance
The Puli comes in white, apricot, and black. It weighs around 22 pounds (13 kg) and is about 16 inches
(42 cm) at the shoulder. The coat needs considerable grooming to keep its cords clean, neat, and
attractive, or it needs regular trimming to a short coat for lower maintenance, although the corded coat is
what attracts many people to the breed.

The Puli does shed though less than some breeds, but the cording of the coat keeps much of the shed fur
from leaving the dog, making it attractive for dog owners with allergies.

History
The Puli is an ancient sheep dog of Hungary, introduced by the migration of the Magyars from Central
Asia in the middle ages. Nomadic shepherds of the Hungarian plains valued their herding dogs, paying
as much as a year's salary for a Puli.

In Asia, the breed goes back 2000 years and anecdotal evidence suggests a Puli-like dog existed 6000
years ago. This breed is possibly the ancestor of the modern Poodle. The ancestry of the Puli, however,
is not known with certainty.

Temperament
This breed is very energetic and makes for a good watchdog and family pet.

    Some kennel clubs consider this the same as a Parson
                      Russell Terrier.

The Jack Russell Terrier is a type of small terrier that has its origins in fox hunting. The name "Jack
Russell" has been used for all of the several types of Russell terrier but is now most commonly used for
working terriers similar in form to Parson Russell Terriers. The Parson Russell Terrier itself was
known as the Jack Russell Terrier in the United States until 2003. In England the name has been used to
refer to the Parson Russell Terrier and to the short-legged type, the Russell Terrier. In Australia and
other countries affiliated with the Federation Cynologique Internationale (FCI) a fourth type, the
Australian Jack Russell Terrier, is also talked about but official name is Jack Russell Terrier. These
types are not always considered to be separate breeds, definitions are still evolving and the naming of
the breeds is still sometimes unclear.

Appearance




                                 Broken coated JRT

All Russells are small terriers; Jack Russell Terriers vary between 25 and 30 cm at the withers and
Parson Russell Terriers are between 32-38 cm.

They are predominantly white with black, tan, or tricolour markings, particularly on the face and the
base of the tail. They have small V-shaped ears that usually fold sharply forwards, and strong teeth with
a scissor bite.

They have a dense double coat that appears in three varieties: smooth coat, where the topcoat is very
short (approx. 1cm) and stiff; rough coat, where the topcoat is longer (as much as 10cm long, though
usually groomed shorter); and broken, which is used to describe both dogs with topcoats of intermediate
length and dogs that have longer coats only on some parts of the body (always on the face, frequently on
the head and back, sometimes extending to the shoulders, occasionally everywhere except the legs).

Although tail docking is banned in most countries, tails are often seen docked to about four inches (100
mm) long and held high and upright. When not docked, the tail should be straight for show dogs.
The breed has a sturdy and robust appearance and an outgoing character; breed standards emphasize that
the Jack Russell must have a 'keen expression'.

Temperament




                           Jack Russells make excellent pets for the right owners.

Jack Russell Terriers are considered an intelligent, high-energy breed. Their compact size, friendly and
inquisitive nature, and intelligence make them popular as pets. Built for speed and strength, they will
always be ready to play. However, they require consistent training and a good deal of attention and
exercise to maintain their temperament and to occupy their minds. Jack Russells who are not trained on
a consistent basis, or are not exercised regularly, may occasionally exhibit aggressive or unmanageable
behaviour, including excessive barking, escaping from the yard, or digging in unwanted places inside
and outside the house. In America, several Jack Russell rescue networks have to work constantly to find
temporary and permanent homes for JRTs whose owners could not meet these requirements for keeping
JRTs as house pets.

They will bark if startled by a sound, which makes them a good security system.

Health
A well-cared-for Jack Russell can live for over 15 years.

History
                                             A young Australian Jack Russell

Russell terriers were first bred by the Reverend Mr. John Russell, a parson and hunting enthusiast born
in 1795. In his last year of university at Oxford he bought a small white and tan terrier bitch called
Trump. She was the basis for a breeding programme to develop a terrier with high stamina for the hunt
as well as the courage and formation to chase out foxes that had gone to ground, but without the
aggressiveness that would result in their harming the fox, which was considered unsporting. The line of
terriers developed by John Russell was well respected for these qualities and, when he died in 1883, his
dogs were taken on by other hunt enthusiasts.

The first split between the types of Russell terriers may have occurred early in their history with dogs
being sold by the sister of John Russell's kennel man. These she described as "Jack Russells" but they
may not have been part of the line of terriers developed by John Russell. Instead they may have been
shorter-legged working terriers of variable heritage. Later, around the turn of the century, the secretary
of the Parson Jack Russell Terrier Club bred a strain of terriers for badger digging. These needed the
brave character and endurance of the Jack Russell Terrier, which were crossed with Bull Terriers to give
a stronger and harder dog with shorter legs than the original type. Again these were described as "Jack
Russells".

Breed development

Along with these changes the Second World War had a great impact on the breed. Sporting dogs were
needed less and the numbers of working Russell terriers were drastically reduced during these years. The
original working Russells often became family dogs and were crossed with other popular family dogs
including Corgis, Chihuahuas and terriers such as the Fox Terrier and the Staffordshire Bull Terrier.
These crosses resulted in changes in form and function and led to a new type of short-legged terrier with
a variable conformation. It is this form of the descendants of Trump that are now known as "Russell
Terriers", "shortie Jacks", or "Puddin' Dogs".
                                 Parson Russell Terrier

The original longer-legged forms were also preserved and, in England, were called "Parson Jack Russell
Terriers". This form was recognised by the Kennel Club (UK) in 1990 and gained provisional
recognition by the international breeds association, the F.C.I, in the same year. The name of the breed
was changed to "Parson Russell Terrier" in 1999 by the Kennel Club (UK) and gained full recognition
by the F.C.I under this name in 2001.

In the United States a group of enthusiasts opposed to the registration and regulation of the working
breed registered "Parson Jack Russell" as a trademark. This led to the long-legged breed being
recognised by the American Kennel Club under the name "Jack Russell Terrier". This name was
changed to the "Parson Russell Terrier" in 2003 to conform with the nomenclature in other countries.
Breeders of the unregistered, working strain continued to use the Jack Russell name for their dogs.
Currently there are few differences between the two types, although working Jack Russell Terriers are
sometimes smaller than Parson Russell Terriers. However, it is likely that the differing approaches to
breeding and the restricted gene pool of the registered type will result in divergence between the types,
possibly leading to two very different breeds.

In England, the Kennel Club recently re-opened its registry to allow the inclusion of some Jack Russell
Terriers under the Parson Russell name. The standard was extended to include slightly smaller dogs to
about 10 inches (25 cm) high but still with the longer-legged form. Individuals registered with the Jack
Russell Terrier Club of Great Britain or the British Jack Russell Terrier Club and with registered parents
and grandparents were accepted for registration. This may have a delaying effect on any divergence of
the two types, but many breeders remain opposed to registration and are likely to continue to breed
outside the Parson Russell standard and to continue to use the "Jack Russell Terrier" name.

Breed controversies

The working strains of Jack Russell Terriers are not recognised by the FCI, or by any major registry.
Some breeders have campaigned for recognition either as part of the Parson Russell Terrier breed or
separately. However, other breeders, such as the Jack Russell Terrier Club of America, feel that this
working breed should not be restricted by the standardisation and limits to breeding that this would
involve. Most large registries recognise and register only breeds that they regard as "purebred", that is,
dogs who breed true to form, within a set standard, and whose parentage is known to be of other
examples of the breed meeting these criteria. For working-terrier enthusiasts this may not always be
acceptable. They want to breed for function rather than form, which might include using dogs of
variable ancestry to improve the working abilities of the offspring.




                                     Jack Russell (short legs) excelling at dog agility

In 1990 Jack Russell Terriers were given full recognition by the Australian National Kennel Council.
The FCI followed with recognition in 2001. This breed is sometimes called the "Australian Jack Russell
Terrier" to distinguish it from the other forms of Jack Russell terriers found in other countries. Its form
is very similar to the Parson Jack Russell and to working Jack Russell Terriers, although its standard
form is for the body to be longer than it is tall. This gives it a form somewhere in between that of
"shortie" Jacks and the taller formation of other Jack Russell Terriers and of Parson Russell Terriers.

Because of the recent nature of these changes there is still considerable variation in the names used for
the different types of dog. Additionally, controversy over registration, conformity to set standards and
breeding restrictions may still lead to other variations in the naming and classification of these dogs.

Miscellaneous

Jack Russells on screen

The Jack Russell's endearing facial expressions, feisty personality, and cuteness make it a natural choice
for television and the cinema. Some famous Jack Russells include Wishbone, the title character of a
popular children's television series in the United States, Milo from the hit movie The Mask played by
Max, Rimshot from the comical Ernest P. Worrell movies, and Bijoux the policeman-hating dog from
Hooperman. There was even a Jack Russell in the movie Crimson Tide, and in the movie the character
played by Gene Hackman introduced the dog breed as one of the smartest in the world.

Some Jack Russell Terriers have near-superstar status, including Eddie, the clever, irrepressible dog
belonging to character Martin Crane on the sitcom Frasier. Eddie was played by a dog called Moose,
but later in the series, Moose also had a stunt double; his son Enzo stepped in for the more physically
demanding tricks to spare his aging sire. Moose and Enzo also appeared in the movie My Dog Skip. Also
prominent is Soccer, the dog star who portrayed Wishbone, a veteran performer with many television
commercials to his credit. He reportedly hated swimming and had two stunt doubles and a body double.

Superman's dog, Krypto, in the older DC Comics's Superman comic books, was possibly a Jack Russell
Terrier. The dog which accompanies Rick Stein on his ventures is a Jack Russel Terrier, named
"Chalky".

Jack Russell is also the name of the protagonist of Radiata Stories.

A Rough Collie is a breed of dog developed originally for herding in Scotland. It is well known because
of the works of author Albert Payson Terhune, and was popularized in later generations by the Lassie
novel, movies, and television shows. There is also a smooth-coated variety; some breed organizations
consider the smooth-coat and rough-coat dogs to be variations of the same breed.


Appearance
Collies come in four basic coat colors: sable and white, where the "Sable" ranges from pale tan to a
golden mahogany; white (which some breed standards disallow); tricolor, which is primarily black
edged in sable; and blue merle, which is a mottled gray. All come with white chest, legs, and tail tip and
many have white blazes on their faces.

The desired size and weight varies among breed standards; male collies can stands 55.8 to 66 cm (22 to
26 in) at shoulder; the bitch averages 5 cm (2 in) shorter. The male can weigh 20.4 to 34 kg (45 - 75 lb)
and bitches 5 to 10 pounds (2.3 - 4.5 kg) less.

The mascot of Texas A&M University, Reveille VII, is a Rough Collie.

Temperament
By all accounts, this is an intelligent dog who loves to work, but in contemporary times has little herding
instinct, since its bloodline consists of 50% bird-hunting dogs and 25% wolf-hunting dogs, which dilute
the influence of the 25% herding dog.

History
Both Rough and Smooth collies are descended from a localised variety of herding dog originating in
Scotland. [1] Originally, there were numerous forms of these dogs. After the industrial revolution, dog
ownership became fashionable, and these early collies were crossed with the Borzoi (Russian
Wolfhound), to get a more "noble" head, which is today one of the true characteristics of the rough
collie. Continued breeding for show purposes drastically changed the appearance of the dogs; it was in
the 1960s a much taller dog than today. Earlier dogs were also more sturdy in build.

They are friendly, unaggressive dogs. The coat needs to be brushed frequently to keep it in a show
condition, but it doesn't require extensive care. They are mid-sized dogs, suiting them to live in small
houses and apartments.

                             Notes
The Tibetan Terrier is not a member of the terrier group, the name being given to it by European
travelers to Tibet who were reminded of terriers from back home when they first encountered the breed.
Its origins are uncertain at best, as some sources claim them to be lucky temple dogs, whereas others
place them as general use farm dogs.

The Tibetan Terrier is a dog with many uses, able to guard, herd, and also be a suitable companion dog.
Their utility in Tibet meant that the first examples of the breed available in the west were generally
given as gifts, as the Tibetan Terrier, along with other Tibetan breeds, were too valuable to the people
who owned them to casually sell. As such, the early history of the breed is linked to only a handful of
foundation dogs.

Recent DNA analysis has concluded that the Tibetan Terrier is one of the most ancient dog breeds.


Appearance
The appearance of the Tibetan Terrier is that of a powerful, medium sized dog of square proportions,
with a shaggy coat. Overall, there should be a feel of balance.

The head is moderate, with a strong muzzle of medium length, and a skull neither rounded nor flat. The
eyes are large, dark, and set fairly far apart. The V-shaped drop ears are well feathered, and should be set
high on the sides of the skull. The nose is always black, regardless of coat colour.

The body is well muscled and compact. The length of the back should be equal to the height at the
withers, giving the breed its typical square look. Height for either sex is 14-16 in (35-41 cm) and weight
is 18-30 lbs (8-14 kg), with 20-24 lbs (9.5-11 kg) preferred, but all weights acceptable if in proportion to
the size.

The tail is set high, well feathered, and carried in a curl over the back.

One of the more unusual features of the Tibetan Terrier is the broad, flat feet, not found in any other dog
breed. They are ideal for climbing mountains and act as natural snow shoes.

Coat

The double coat is profuse, with a warm undercoat and a topcoat which has the texture of human hair. It
should not be silky or curled, but wavy is acceptable. Long and thick, it is shown natural, but should not
be so long as to touch the floor, as is typical in breeds such as the Lhasa Apso or Maltese. A fall of hair
covers the face and eyes, but long eyelashes generally prevent hair from getting in the Tibetan Terrier's
eyes, and the breed has very good eyesight.
Colour

All colours are permissible, barring liver and chocolate, and none are preferred. Tibetan Terriers are
available in any combination of solid, particolour, tricolour, brindle or piebald, as long as the nose
leather is black and the eyes and eye rims are dark.

Temperament
The temperament has been one of the most attractive aspects of the breed since it was first established in
the 1920's. They are amiable and affectionate family dogs, sensitive to their owners and gentle with
older children. As is fitting a dog formerly used as a watch dog, they tend to be reserved around
strangers, but should never be aggressive nor shy with them.

Suitable for apartment living, the Tibetan is still an energetic and surprisingly strong dog, and needs
regular exercise. Their energy level and intelligence is well suited for dog sports such as agility. They
are steadfast, determined, and clever, which can lead to them being stubborn.

Though not yappy, the Tibetan Terrier has an assertive bark, likened to a rising siren.

Health
The Tibetan Terrier enjoys the long life span often associated with small dog breeds, and generally lives
from 15-17 years.

Though an atheletic breed that has been bred for a natural look, the Tibetan Terrier is still susceptible to
a variety of health problems, especially those related to the eyes and joints. These can include:

     ●   Canine hip dysplasia
     ●   Luxating patella
     ●   Progressive retinal atrophy
     ●   Lens luxation
     ●   Cataracts

Because of that, Tibetan Terrier clubs recommend purchasing from breeders who participate in eye and
hip testing, such as the Canine Eye Registration Foundation (CERF) and Orthopedic Foundation for
Animals (OFA).

A Kerry Blue Terrier is a dog breed that comes from Kerry, Ireland. It was used for hunting, cattle
herding, dog fighting, and guarding. Today, the Kerry is a companion and working dog.


Appearance
Some characteristics of the Kerry Blue Terrier include a long head, flat skull, deep chest, and a soft
wavy to curly coat that comes in several shades of blue (the term for "gray" in dog coats). Puppies are
born black; the blue appears gradually as the puppy grows older, usually up to 2 years of age.
Grooming

The coat care is extensive. The Kerry Blue Terrier doesn't shed. The coat is close to the structure of
human hair, similar to that of the Poodle or Maltese, and might be suitable for some people with
allergies. But the Kerry owner will pay his dues. The coat never stop growing and the Kerry requires
weekly brushing to prevent matting. They also need to be trimmed every six to eight weeks. The coat
has only one layer and does not protect from the weather, cold, water, or mud. The Kerry should not be
kept outside all the time and should dried immediately when back at home.

Temperament
Kerry Blue Terriers are strong-headed and highly spirited. They are, together with the Airedale Terrier,
one of the best-suited terriers for work. They are fast, strong, and intelligent. They do well in obedience,
dog agility, sheep herding, and tracking. They have been used as a police dogs in Ireland. They require
an active, skilled owner who can provide them with early socialization and obedience training.

Because they can be dog aggressive and vocal, socialization from puppyhood is an absolute necessity to
prevent future problems and veterinary bills.

As a long legged breed, their activity level is moderate to high. Kerries require work daily, such as
walks, jogging, training, agility, or dog day care activities, to keep them busy and occupied. If they are
locked in a fenced yard, they become bored and might bark, fence fight, dig holes or try to escape.

It is loyal and gentle towards children.

                            Notes



The German Shepherd Dog (known also as the Alsatian or Schäfer (hund) is an intelligent breed of
dog. Because they are eager to please, they are easily trained in obedience and protection. German
Shepherd Dogs are often used as working dogs in many capacities, including search and rescue (SAR),
military, police or guard dogs. They are also used as assistance dogs / service dogs (such as guide dogs),
though not as much as Labrador Retrievers and Golden Retrievers.


Appearance
The German Shepherd Dog is a large, strong, substantial-looking dog. The fur is a double-coat and can
be either short or long haired. It varies in color, coming in many different shades, mostly cream (tan) and
brown, but also solid black or white. Dogs with coats that have tricolored hair (that is, black and white
and either brown or red) are called sable or agouti. Different kennel clubs have different standards for
the breed according to size, weight, coat color and structure.

Common faults

Some GSDs have ears that never stand up completely; instead, the top 10 to 15 percent of the ear
remains floppy. These are called "friendly-tipped" dogs. It is a disqualifying fault in show dogs.

A small percentage of GSDs have a tail that stands vertically, exposing their anus. This is also a
disqualifying fault in show dogs.

Breed lines

There are several types or lines of GSD and the behavior, abilities, and appearance of each is quite
different. The major lines are the international working line, the international show line, and the North
American show line.




                                 Black Sable (or gray) GSD, the original color and still common in
working lines
Dogs from FCI-recognised international working lines are bred primarily for traits involving their
working ability rather than appearance, so their appearance can be somewhat varied.

The FCI-recognised international show lines differ in that emphasis is given more to the appearance of
the dog when breeding, so they are very consistent in type or appearance.

The North American show lines have also been bred primarily for their looks, but have a markedly
different appearance from the international dogs, featuring a noticeably sloped back and sharp
angulation of the hock joint. There is a current debate over whether the American show lines still
represent the original German Shepherd Dog, or whether the line has become distinct enough that it
should be considered a separate breed. Critics of the American line argue that the working ability of
these dogs has been lost, and that the angled back is detrimental to the health of the animal. Proponents
of the line believe that the altered bone structure of their dogs represents an improvement to the herding
ability of the animals.

In the erstwhile GDR, the German Shepherds more closely adhered to the old prewar standard marked
by straighter back, longer and denser coat and darker color. These dogs are now praised for breeding
working dogs as they are less prone to hip dysplasia. Attempts to preserve this distinct line and raise it to
the status of an officially recognized breed ("East German Shepherd Dog") are stalled.

Variant sizes and coats

Some groups or breeders have focused on variants or mutations of the breed that are not recognized by
most kennel clubs as acceptable show GSDs but that might eventually become breeds on their own.

White coat




                                  White German Shepherd Dog

A white (or very light), but not albino, version of the German Shepherd has also always occurred, but
was designated a disqualifying fault in the AKC in the late 1960s; it is also considered a fault by German
breed standards. This fault, however, does not prevent the white coated German Shepherd Dog from
being registered in the AKC as a German Shepherd Dog. White Shepherds hold champion titles in the
UKC (United Kennel Club).
Now, some breeders selectively breed White Shepherds for their beautiful snowy white coats and
physical stature, striving for a Shepherd that closely resembles the original dog; less angular than today's
German Shepherd breed. See the WGSDCA or American White Shepherd Association for more detail.
However, the white German Shepherd has been recognised by some organisations under the name
Berger Blanc Suisse (or White Shepherd Dog).

Long-haired coat
      The so-called "long-haired German Shepherd" is considered a "fault" in the German Shepherd
      Dog breed according to American Kennel Club standards. The long hair gene is recessive. Dogs
      with this coat look somewhat like the Tervueren type of Belgian Shepherd Dog. An example with
      pictures can be found here. Popular myth holds that long-haired GSDs ("fuzzies") are more
      affectionate, but there is little evidence for this.

Giant shepherd
       Some organizations recognize a deliberately bred, larger variation of the breed as the Shiloh
       Shepherd Dog or other names.


Temperament




                                 While attempting to play with a cat, a shepherd's teeth are displayed.

Well-bred GSDs have powerful jaws and strong teeth, can develop a strong sense of loyalty and
obedience, and can be trained to attack and release on command. Poorly bred GSDs such as those from
puppy mills can be fearful, overly aggressive, or both. The common misconception that GSDs (like Pit
Bulls) are inherently violent is due most often to a combination of poor breeding (bad nerves) and the
owner's lack of control/training. Also to blame is the constant media depiction of these dogs as guard or
attack dogs, and dogs used by the police, although they are more often used as dogs to search for things,
as opposed to dogs used for attack.

GSDs' sense of loyalty to, and emotional bond with, their owners is almost impossible to overstate.
Separation trauma is one reason they have been used less in guide dog roles in recent years, since that
program typically trains dogs from puppyhood under one owner prior to final placement.
                                 GSDs can make loyal and obedient pets.

Temperament Differences Among Lines

The different types or lines of GSD display differences not only in appearance but also in ability and
temperament.

Dogs from working lines have very high energy, and have been bred to have a natural drive for
protection, tracking, and obedience. They are bred primarily for consistent temperament, working drive,
and intelligence. These dogs can be used as pets, but will be unhappy if not exercised daily or trained to
do a job of some sort. These dogs are more commonly seen in rescues in North America due to their
high prey drive and owner's inability to control or train them.

German and Eastern European lines tend to be stockier, with shorter snouts and more muscular chests,
and typify the working lines.

North American lines have a tendency towards a longer croup, longer back, higher wither and more
stable temperament ideal for companionship. They do not require something to do constantly to keep
them from becoming bored and without an outlet, destructive.

These dogs can make excellent pets, provided that an irresponsible breeder has not sacrificed consistent
temperament or health in the quest for popular standards for good looks.
Health
As is common in many large breeds, German Shepherds are prone to elbow and hip dysplasia. Other
health problems sometimes occurring in the breed are von Willebrand's disease and skin allergies.
German Shepherds are also prone to bloat. They have an average life span of ten to twelve years.


History
The breed was originated by Captain Max von Stephanitz in the late 1800s and early 1900s. His goal
was to breed an all-purpose working dog. The first registered GSD was Horand v. Grafrath [1]. Von
Stephanitz admired the landrace herding dogs of his native Germany, and believed they had the potential
to be all-purpose working dogs. Additionally, he was aware of the declining need for herding dogs and
believed that the working abilities of the breed would decline unless it was put to other uses. Von
Stephanitz created the Verein für Deutsche Schäferhunde [2], or SV as the official governing body for
the breed. The SV then created the schutzhund trial as a breed test for the German Shepherd Dog, and
prohibited the breeding of any dog which could not pass the trial. The schutzhund trial, along with the
SV's conviction that "German Shepherd breeding is working dog breeding, or it is not German Shepherd
breeding" led to a rapid development of the breed's abilities. After WWI, British and American soldiers,
impressed by the abilities of the dog, brought home examples to breed. The breed instantly become
popular, both as a family pet and as a working dog. To this day, the German Shepherd Dog is considered
one of, if not the most intelligent and versatile breeds in existence.




                                GSDs commonly display high intelligence, which makes them ideal
candidates for various working class positions.

Working German Shepherd Dogs
German Shepherds often compete and excel in obedience trials and Schutzhund competitions. German
Shepherds are also often trained as police dogs, due to their trainability, size and work drive.
Shepherding

The original purpose for the German Shepherd Dog, was (not surprisingly) to herd sheep, cattle or any
other animal that may require the assistance of a shepherd. Even given the name "shepherd" some
people are surprised to hear that these dogs were bred for herding, as the GSD is more often found
working as a guard dog, police dog or companion pet than in the field working sheep.

The German Shepherd Dog does not have the "eye" as border collies or other similar breeds. They are
trained to follow their instinct, which for the GSD is to "work the furrow", meaning that they will patrol
a boundary all day and restrict the animals being herded from entering or leaving the designated area. It
is this instinct that has made the breed superb guarding dogs, protecting their flock (or family) from
harm.

A German Shepherd Dog's instincts to herd might manifest themselves by the dog closely watching or
even nipping at members of its family as they go for walks. The dog might attempt to lead people to
what it perceives is the correct location, even going so far as to gently take a hand in his teeth to lead the
person.

Miscellaneous

Breed names

The proper English name for the breed is German Shepherd Dog (a literal translation from the German
"Deutscher Schäferhund") but they are usually informally referred to as GSDs or simply German
Shepherds. Alsatian is also commonly used in the United Kingdom and countries of the Commonwealth
of Nations (the reason for the alternative name is historical: during World Wars I and II, Germany was
out of favour in the UK and many German names were translated or anglicised. See more below under
Breed Name History). In addition, the sobriquet police dog is used in many countries where the GSD is
the predominant or exclusive breed used in the canine police force.

Breed Name History

The anti German sentiment which followed the First World War caused the British to re-name the breed
as the Alsatian Wolf Dog. The breed began to spread world-wide after World War I, when a few dogs
were taken to England. At that time, however, it was known as "Alsatian Shepherd", as it was
inappropriate that the breed's name could be a reminder of the war against Germany. Only in 1930 did
the British Kennel Club authorise the breed to be known again as German Shepherd.

Despite fads, poor breeding practices, malign-ment of character as "attack" dogs, and discrimination
against anything German during the years of and following World War I, the breed has thrived. During
the German phobia, English owners refused to give up the breed they had come to admire. They did
compromise and change the name to Alsatian, which prevailed for nearly 40 years after all hostilities
ended.

The term "Alsatian" is an incorrect name for the breed and was coined within the British Kennel Club as
part of an attempt to divorce the breed from its German origins, due to historical enmity.

                            Notes



Chow Chow, or Chow is a breed of dog originating from China, where it is referred to as Songshi Quan
(鬆獅犬 Pinyin: sōngshī quǎn), which literally means "puffy-lion dog". The breed has also been called
the Tang Quan, "Dog of the Tang Empire".

Appearance
The Chow Chow is a stocky dog with broad skull and small, rounded ears. The breed has a very dense
coat that is either smooth or rough. The fur is particularly thick around the neck, giving the distinctive
ruff or mane. The coat may be one of several colours including reddish-brown (described as "red"),
black, blue, cinnamon, cream, or white. Not all these colour varieties are recognised as valid in all
countries. Individuals with patchy or particoloured coats are considered to be outside the breed standard.
Chow Chows are unusual in having a blue-black tongue and very straight hind legs that result in a rather
stilted gait.

Temperament
While now commonly kept as a companion dog, the Chow Chow has a reputation for being a willful and
independent breed that is sometimes difficult to train. They can be very aloof and wary of strangers.
They often don't get along well with other dogs, as well.

Health




                                 Chow Chows have an unusual blue-black tongue.

Like many heavy-set dogs, the Chow Chow may be prone to hip dysplasia. They may also be
succeptable to entropion, an eye irritation caused by an eyelid abnormality.


History
It is a unique type of dog, thought to be one of the oldest recognizable breeds. A bas-relief from 150 BC
(during the Han Dynasty) includes a hunting dog similar in appearance to the Chow Chow. Recent DNA
analysis confirms that this is one of the oldest breeds of dog.[1] Chow Chows were originally bred as a
general-purpose working dog for herding, hunting, and guarding. The breed has also been used to pull
sleds and for meat and fur.

A backyard breeder is a person who practices random or ignorant dog breeding on a small scale. The
name is something of a misnomer, as many excellent breeders run small-scale programs in their houses,
garages, barns, or backyards

The term is meant to refer to people who are ignorant of selective breeding goals and techniques, and are
not familiar with the breed standard of their chosen breed of dog. Backyard breeders are motivated by
the idea of profit, not realizing that the hobby of animal breeding practiced on a small scale is not
usually profitable when one factors in costs such as health, maintenance and pregnancy care. People who
have not considered these factors often stint their breeding stock in terms of veterinary care and
adequate maintenance, the puppies they produce may have genetic disorders or undisclosed illnesses; it
is these people who are disparaged as 'backyard breeders'.

When such breeding is carried out on a large scale, the venue is called a puppy mill (or puppy farm in
Commonwealth English).

A breed club, in the hobby of dog fancy, is an organization dedicated to breeding and showing of one
single breed of dog as opposed to a diverse mixture of dogs.

Breed clubs are important to the hobby for several reasons. One of the primary reasons is in resolving
disagreements over just what characterizes a breed. Not all so-called "all-breed" kennel clubs accept all
breeds, or recognize certain varieties of dogs as constituting a true breed. In this instance, a breed club
may maintain its own registry of lineage while at the same time lobbying for the acceptance of its breed
by one or more kennel clubs.

Other breed clubs are for owners of well-established breeds who merely enjoy interaction with fellow
owners of similar dogs. These breed clubs leave the function of a registry to such major kennel clubs as
the American Kennel Club, the United Kennel Club, and the like and exist more for social purposes, the
dissemination of news about the breed, and in some instances the organization of single-breed shows.

Affiliation or independence?
Clubs organized around working breeds often maintain their own registries with no intent of seeking
recognition by any all-breed kennel club. This is usually because they believe that the common practices
of the all-breed clubs, such as maintaining closed studbooks and awarding prizes based on appearance
and conformation rather than on performance, don't serve to protect the working abilities of the dogs.

In some cases, the breed clubs of non-working dogs also choose to remain independent. These clubs cite
the desire to maintain control over their breed; often these clubs have more stringent breeding criteria
than the all-breed clubs. Differences can also arise over the breed's conformation points.

The decision to remain independent poses its own set of problems. Members are denied the fun and
prestige of competing in all-breed shows. Unless the group is very large, it can suffer from a lack of
funding and lobby support that the kennel clubs can provide. Breed-specific legislation poses another
threat. In Australia, for example, it has long been rumoured that so-called animal rights groups favour
legislation that would forbid the breeding of dogs from any breed recognized by the Australian National
Kennel Council; this could lead to a breed's extinction.

These issues have led to situations in which unresolved conflicts have resulted in the creation of
competing breed clubs for the same breed (as in the Rat Terrier clubs; notorious for the amount of ill
will among them, and the clubs of the Coton de Tulear). The differences of opinion have even resulted
in the development of some new breeds; the Tenterfield Terrier from the Miniature Fox Terrier is an
example, as are the several forms of Jack Russell Terrier and the Shiloh Shepherd Dog. These divisions
are sometimes mutually agreed upon, sometimes not. In such an atmosphere it becomes difficult for
kennel club to determine which club has or should have authority over the breed, and even more difficult
for the layperson to decide which club to join.

When an all-breed kennel club does recognize one of these breeds, there can be considerable acrimony.
In the worst cases, the kennel club recognition can be compared to a hostile takeover in a Mergers and
Acquisitions deal. In some cases, the all-breed club recognizes the breed club's registry, as the American
Kennel Club recognizes the National Greyhound Association, the Master of Foxhounds Association, and
so on. In some cases, they do not, and instead start their own registry. Many breed clubs—such as, in the
United States, the Australian Shepherd Club of America, the Jack Russell Terrier Club of America, and
the United States Border Collie Club—opposed recognition of their breeds by the all-breed registries.
These breed clubs have continued to maintain their own registries despite the creation of the all-breed
clubs' registries, and have expressed in varying degrees opposition to how the all-breed clubs' standards
and values affect the breeds.

A breed registry, also known as a stud book or register, is an official list of animals within a specific
breed whose parents are known. Animals are usually registered by their breeders when they are still
young. The terms "stud book" and "register" are also used to refer to lists of male animals "standing at
stud", that is, those animals actively breeding, as opposed to every known specimen of that breed.

Kennel clubs always maintain registries, either directly or through affiliated breed clubs. Some multi-
breed clubs also maintain registries, and there are a few registries that are maintained by other private
entities. Working dog organizations also maintain registries.


Types of registry
In a closed stud book, the parents must also be registered in this or another registry for the breed that the
organization maintaining the registry will accept (such as that in another country). This ensures that the
animal is a purebred member of the breed.

In an open stud book, animals can be registered without their parents having been previously registered.
This allows breeders to strengthen breeds by including individuals who conform to the breed standard
but are from unknown or undocumented origins. Some horse clubs allow crossbreds who meet specific
criteria to be registered.

Another form of open registry in the purebred dog world is a Registry on Merit. In a Registry on Merit
any dog that meets certain performance criteria is eligible for inclusion in the registry, regardless of
conformation or ancestry. Registry on Merit is prevalent with sheepdog registries, in particular those of
the Border Collie, and some other breeds with a heavy emphasis on working ability.


Crossbreeding and backbreeding
In some registries, breeders may apply for permission to crossbreed other breeds into the line to
emphasize certain traits, to keep the breed from extinction or to alleviate problems caused in the breed
by inbreeding from a limited set of animals. A related preservation method is backbreeding, used by
some equine and canine registries, in which crossbred individuals are mated back to purebreds to
eliminate undesirable traits acquired through the crossbreeding.
Registered names
Show dogs have a registered name, that is, the name under which they are registered as a purebred with
the appropriate kennel club, and a call name, which is how their owners talk to them. In working dog
registries, the registered name and the call name are usually the same.

The registered name often refers directly or indirectly to the kennel where the dog was bred; kennel
clubs often require that the breeder's kennel prefix form the first part of the dog's registered name. For
example, all dogs bred at the Gold Mine Kennels would have names that begin with the words "Gold
Mine". Many breeders name their puppies sequentially: Litter A, Litter B… in which the names of all
the puppies start with the letter "A", then "B" etc. Some breeders include the names of the sire, dam or
other forebears in the puppies’ names. A more imaginative breeder at the Gold Mine Kennels might
name all the puppies of one litter after precious stones or minerals. The names of all the puppies from
another litter might be required to start with "Emerald" or refer to any precious stone that's green. A
subsequent litter might contain the adjectives describing precious stones: Gold Mine Sparkle, Gold Mine
Brilliance, etc. Breeders may be as creative or as mundane as they wish.

In order to minimize the unwieldiness that long and fancy names can bring, kennel clubs usually limit
the total number of characters that may compose the dog’s registered name. Further, breeders are
generally not allowed to use any name that may be misleading, such as the word ‘champion’ in a name,
a trademark, or anything that can be mistaken for the name of another kennel.

The call name can be anything that the dog's owner prefers. For example, Ch. Gold Mine Emerald's
Brightest Sparkle might be called “Goldie’, "Sparky", "Bright", "Green", "Precious", "Gem", or, for that
matter, "Fido".

By contrast, dogs in the breed registry of a working dog club (particularly herding dogs) must usually
have simple, no-nonsense monikers deemed to be “working dog names” such as “Pal”, “Blackie” or
“Ginger”. The naming rules for independent dog clubs vary but are usually similar to those of kennel
clubs.

A breed standard (also called bench standard) in animal fancy and animal husbandry is a set of
guidelines which is used to insure that the animals produced by a breeding facility conform to the
specifics of the breed. It is also used in competition to judge a given animal against the hypothetical
ideal specimen of that breed. This article refers to breed standards in dogs.


General
The breed standard contains a narrative description of the breed and a long, often highly-detailed list of
conformation points, any deviation from which is considered a fault and results in penalties against the
individual animal. Some breed standards specify the percentages or number of points to be awarded for
each characteristic, the total of which equals the dog’s overall score.

Inconsistency of breed standards

Format

The form in which breed standards are written differs among the kennel clubs, but also differs from club
to club within the same all-breed organizations. There is inconsistency in the amount of detail required
to describe a particular characteristic, and sometimes even in the wording used for the characteristics.
The result is that breed standards are open to interpretation and to a judge’s individual taste.

Nomenclature

The naming of dog breeds is inconsistent and capricious.

Faults versus variants

A further problem is that a deviation from the standard in one breed might result in a fault, where a
similar deviation in another breed might be an acceptable variant; in a third breed the same deviation
might be a disqualification, while in another breed that deviation might result in a breed separation.

The ear shape is a case in point. In erect-eared breeds, an ear that does not stand straight up by the time
the puppy is 6 months old is usually faulted. A German Shepherd Dog will be disqualified for a floppy
or folded ear. In contrast, the Miniature Fox Terrier breed standard allows a variation where the ear is
folded above the line of the skull. The Papillon with a fully dropped ear (not a folded or weak ear, which
is a fault) is accepted equally with the erect-eared variant and is known as a Phalène, but under FCI rules
the Phalène and the Papillon are considered different breeds. The Norwich and Norfolk terriers have
differing ear shapes and are always considered separate breeds.

It must be borne in mind that ear characteristics are only one conformation point; this is multiplied by
many dog attributes and variations thereon. For example, another common area of frustration is in the
area of bite and teeth. A judge must be aware that some breed standards (usually for working dogs)
allow for missing and broken teeth, others require that these are faulted. Working dog standards may
also specify that scars are not to be penalized.

Different countries, different standards, different interpretations

In addition, the written standard may vary from country to country. A case in point is the American
Kennel Club standard for the Bull Terrier, which states clearly that a level bite or a scissor bite is
acceptable, but the Australian National Kennel Council Bull Terrier standard only recognizes the scissor
bite. Since an incorrect bite is a serious flaw, breeders in one country might cull out puppies that would
be acceptable for show in another country, alternately, international competitors might find their state or
national champions marked down or disqualified in a foreign competition or by a foreign judge. During
the dog show at the 2004 Sydney Royal Easter Show an unusually large number of protests against the
judges’ decisions were lodged; it was felt by some owners that the international judges did not
completely understand the commonly accepted breed standard interpretations of the ANKC.

Conclusion
It can be seen that the task of judging is a difficult one. The breed judge must know the standard for one
breed, the group judge for all the breeds in that group, and the amount of knowledge an all-breed judge
must have is huge. Add in the fact that standards and their interpretations differ between nations, and the
task seems monumental. See conformation point for a list of some of the most common areas of
evaluation.

The term crossbreed or crossbred refers to a hybrid animal of two purebred parents created by means of
crossbreeding. Crossbreed may also refer to a domestic animal where the breed status of only one parent
or grandparent is known.

Names of crossbreeds in specific animals

Dogs and cats

A dog of unknown parentage is called a mongrel; a mongrel cat is often referred to as a moggie.

A dog hybrid is a cross between two purebred dogs of different breeds (selectively bred varieties).
Hybrids are also known as crossbreeds or crossbreds, although the term crossbreed is also used to refer
to a mixed-breed dog where the breed of only one parent or grandparent is known. A dog of unknown
parentage is called a mongrel.

In biology, the word hybrid refers specifically to a cross between two different species e.g. the dog and
coyote. In less technical conversation and particularly in the dog world, the word refers to selective
crosses and their progeny, even if outcrossed to other breeds. For example, the Queensland Wild Dog
Management Strategy, September 2002, states that hybrid will also refer to the descendants of crossbred
progeny.

Some dog hybrids are now being selectively bred. The term designer dogs has been coined to refer to
these crosses. The practice causes much controversy; opponents cite the often exorbitant prices charged
for these puppies, the 'impulse buy' nature of such purchases (which leads to a high abandonment rate),
the unpredictability of temperament or type and the lack of pedigree history, particularly any defective
genes or genetic illnesses in the breeding lines.

Proponents argue that supply follows demand, and point out that there are bona fide reasons for the
breeding of some of these crosses, notably to provide pets for people with allergies.

Among the better known dog hybrids are Labradoodles and Australian Bulldogs, which each have their
own breed fancy associations. Poodle crosses are also popular.

Dog hybrids are not recognized by the main registries. They should not be confused with independent
breeds, which are also not recognized. The difference lies in the longevity of the breed, the numbers of
breeders and the existence of a legitimate breed club, the number of specimens of the breed past a
certain number of generations, whether or not it breeds true to type, for how long a breed registry has
been maintained, and the reason for the non-recognition. Often independent breed clubs oppose
recognition, for reasons which usually concern maintaining independent control of the qualities of their
chosen breed.

Casual crossbreeds
With the long-time popularity of the "breed" name cockapoo, used since at least 1970 and constructed
by combining elements of its two contributing breeds (Cocker Spaniel/Poodle), it has become extremely
common to find mixed-breed dogs named with breed names invented in the same way. The tendency for
using such names in a jocular way dates back at least to Queen Elizabeth's Dorgis (Dachshund/Corgi).
However, extremely few of these become mainstream "breeds" over long periods with determined
breeders, and, as of 2004, cockapoo is still the only such combined name to make it into the dictionary.
None-the-less, names such as these commonly appear in for-sale ads.

Among these:

    ●   Poodle hybrids of all kinds.
    ●   Bordachy (Pron. bor-DA-ki) Border Terrier/Dachshund.
    ●   Bug Boston terrier/Pug or Beagle/Pug
    ●   Chiweiner (Chihuahua/Dachshund). Its popularity is increasing especially in the Pacific
        Northwest. The Chiweiner is characterized by its Dachshund face and slightly long Chihuahua-
        like body. Its small size makes it a good house pet.
    ●   Gerchowder (German Shepherd Dog/Chow Chow)
    ●   Puggle (Pug/Beagle)[1]. (also sometimes known as a Bug)
    ●   Chowggle (Beagle/Chow Chow)

In animal breeding, a fault is a characteristic whose state or quality falls outside of the acceptable range
for the attribute being judged. This article discusses faults in dogs. (See conformation point for a list of
some of the more common areas in which faults can occur.)

There are many faults, which may be said to be major or minor, or may be considered so serious as to
merit disqualification. Unfortunately, these delineations differ among the various breed clubs.

Whose fault is it? Interpretation of the standards
There are no hard-and-fast rules when it come to faults; these are decided by individual breed clubs and
written into breed standards, so what constitutes a fault may differ from breed to breed. Some breed
standards are punctilious in the extreme, spelling out exactly what constitutes a fault in every part of the
animal, and the degree to which each fault must be penalized. Some are more loosely written, leaving
more open to interpretation by the judge, or not describing a conformation point at all, which leaves the
matter up to the individual judge’s taste. A particularly troubling instance is one where the breed
standard states that the fault is to be penalized to the degree of the severity of the fault; conformation
points which are open to human interpretation cause much ill-will at dog shows.

For example, most breed standards list a ‘scissor bite’ as the correct one. Dogs with a level bite, an
under-bite or an overbite are said to have a ‘fault’. Under many breed standards, the judge must decide
the degree of severity of the faulty bite, and therefore how much the dog must be marked down in
relation to other dogs. However, some breed clubs find a level bite acceptable; some find it equally
acceptable with the scissor bite. The all-breed judge, therefore, would have to know that this dog from
this particular breed must not be marked below that dog from that other breed solely on the basis of this
dog’s level bite, as the level bite is not a fault in this breed.

Another example is coat colour. A given colour may be acceptable, it may be preferred, it may be the
only acceptable colour, it may be a fault, or it may be a disqualification. Sometimes these colours
change over time, often after much in-fighting and bitterness. For many years, the only acceptable coat
pattern in a Dalmatian was white with black spots, very recently liver spots have been accepted as a
variant, but black still appears to be the preference of most. A black German Shepherd Dog is penalized;
a white GSD is disqualified. Many GSD fanciers like the white colour and continue to breed for the
white coat; some lobby for its acceptance into the breed standard, others argue for the creation of a new
breed.
Working dogs
The breed standards for working dogs usually specify that scars, broken teeth or other damage that
evidence injuries sustained during a working career (often termed ‘honourable scars and injuries') are
not to be penalized. This sometimes holds true for show dogs whose breed comes from working lines;
the Australian Cattle Dog is an example of this as are some terriers, where the breed standards
specifically state that scars are not to be penalized on the conformation bench.

Conformation points and faults are very divisive in the dog-breeding community and are hotly debated.
Fanciers note that such qualities have the capacity to change the breed, and sometimes even minute
details are argued over to a point that would astound the average pet owner.

Often it is the breeders of working dogs who are the most vehement, pointing out that changes in fashion
and fancy have led to what they see as a loss in working dog qualities of many breed that have show
lines.

A pedigreed dog is a dog that has its ancestry recorded and tracked by a major dog registry. The
number of generations required varies from breed to breed, but all pedigreed dogs have papers from the
registering body that attest to its ancestry.

Sometimes purebred is used to mean pedigreed, but as all breeds came from random bred dogs
originally, the term pedigreed is preferred.

                                                                                 Back | Home | Up | Next


Puppy mills (known as puppy farms in the UK and Australia) are dog breeding operations that are
considered to be disreputable and irresponsible. The term originated among critics of such operations.
Small-scale, irresponsible dog breeding operations are usually called backyard breeding; the terms are
akin but not synonymous.

Reputable breeders raise their animals in humane conditions, provide good socialization and often
formal training, and adhere to the breed standard. They are knowledgeable about health problems
associated with their breed, and with the principles of genetics, frequently undertaking specific matings
to produce or refine particular desirable characteristics in their dogs. They are also sensitive to the
requirements of their breeding adults -- who may also be breed or performance champions -- and the
puppies they produce. Reputable breeders frequently screen potential customers rigorously, and usually
provide a pedigree and health guarantee with their puppies.

Although many responsible breeding operations tend to be small, size alone is not an indication that a
particular operation is a puppy mill. Rather, puppy mills are characterized by ignoring duties that are
standard among responsible dog breeders. They may keep their dogs in overcrowded, unclean or
otherwise inappropriate surroundings. The puppies they produce may be improperly socialized or may
suffer from health problems which are often not disclosed to purchasers. Their breeding animals may
also suffer, with females sometimes forced to undergo repeated pregnancies.

Puppy mill operators may misrepresent the breed of dog being sold, and adult puppy mill dogs may
exhibit characteristics uncommon to their breed. Unlike the puppies produced by reputable breeders, the
vast majority of puppy mill animals are sold to pet stores. Puppy mill operators are frequently accused of
being motivated only by profit rather than a commitment to the breed or any empathy for the animals in
their care.

Purchasing dogs, especially those claimed to be purebred, from a pet store is strongly discouraged by
reputable breeders and animal shelters. While many pet stores claim to purchase dogs from "local
breeders" instead of puppy mills, this is often untrue or is a difference in name only, as reputable
breeders generally do not sell animals to pet stores.

                                   Dr. Hwang Woo-Suk beside "Snuppy".

Snuppy (born April 24, 2005) is the first cloned dog. This Afghan hound clone was created by Hwang
Woo-Suk and his team of scientists at Seoul National University (SNU) in South Korea. The name
"Snuppy" is a combination of "SNU" and "puppy."

The researchers transferred 1,095 dog embryos into 123 females, inducing three pregnancies. One fetus
miscarried, and one clone died of pneumonia after three weeks. A Labrador Retriever carried the third
embryo to term. The team announced their success in cloning in August of 2005. [1]

Later in 2005 Hwang Woo-Suk was found to have fabricated evidence in stem cell research projects.
This caused some to question the veracity of his other experiments, including Snuppy. [2] In their
investigation of Hwang Woo-Suk's publication, however, a team from SNU confirmed that Snuppy was
a true clone of Tei, the DNA donor dog. [3]

A Stud Master is an individual responsible for an employer's breeding stock, the term is usually used of
dogs or horses. It is usually applied regardless of gender; the term 'Stud Mistress' is rarely seen.

The Stud Master typically suggests desired matings to the owner, and arranges for the same, whether in-
house or by contract with animals standing at stud, approves and arranges matings to the owner's
animals at stud requested by outsiders, and keeps all records, including notifying the appropriate animal
registries.

In a large or formal household the Stud Master may be a permanent position; in this case the Stud
Master is often responsible for the maintenance of the stables and/or kennels as well, but usually it is a
part time or contractual arrangement.

                                      Conformation Point
                                                                                 Back | Home | Up | Next


In dog breeding and showing, a conformation point is any one out of a long list of dog attributes known
as the breed standard. This is a set standard, usually written, which is used to judge a given dog against
the hypothetical ideal specimen of that breed. Winners of Best of Breed titles compete against those of
other breeds in all-breed competitions. An incorrect conformation point is known as a fault.


Common conformation points
    ●   Coat, includes colour, type, length, pattern and tactile quality
    ●   Quality, quantity and distribution of markings
    ●   Temperament (should be characteristic of breed) and general attitude

    ●   Head shape; colour of head
    ●   Bite (how the teeth meet when the jaws are closed)
    ●   Eye shape and colour
    ●   Shape, set and carriage of ears

    ●   Size of animal
    ●   Ratio of animal’s height to its length
    ●   Skin health (and often pigmentation)
    ●   Gait (quality and style of stride and general movement)
    ●   Grooming, in breeds where that applies
    ●   Tail shape, set and carriage
    ●   Shape of feet

There are many other qualifiers, and many specifics within these. For example, in some breeds, skin
must include an assessment of the quality of the wrinkles. In some breeds, an examination of the mouth
includes measurement and judging of the flews, in most others, this does not apply.

                                                                                   Back | Home | Up | Next




                                               Some show dogs, like this Poodle, undergo hours of
grooming for their best presentation.

A show dog is a purebred dog who is displayed at conformation dog shows to determine how well it
conforms to established breed standards.

In many cases, show dog is used to distinguish dogs whose appearance is valued above its ability to do a
job, or whose ancestors were selected more for appearance than for skills, in comparison to working
dogs. Show dogs are supposed to be breeding stock and therefore are entire individuals.

Dog shows are hierarchical competitions and winners earn points at each level; these are recorded and
added up and eventually a dog may earn enough points to be accorded the title Champion.

Championship titles and registered names
A dog who has earned the Championship title is entitled to use the designation "Champion" (or "Ch") in
front of its name, for example, Ch. Emerald's Brightest Sparkle.

Show dogs have a registered name, that is, the name under which they are registered as a purebred with
the appropriate kennel club, and a call name, which is how their owners talk to them.

The registered name often refers directly or indirectly to the kennel where the dog was bred; kennel
clubs often require that the breeder's kennel prefix form the first part of the dog's registered name. For
example, all dogs bred at the Gold Mine Kennels would have names that begin with the words "Gold
Mine". The call name can be anything that the dog's owner prefers. For example, Ch. Gold Mine
Emerald's Brightest Sparkle might be called “Goldie’, "Sparky", "Bright", "Green", "Precious", "Gem",
or, for that matter, "Fido".

By contrast, dogs in the breed registry of a working dog club must usually have simple, no-nonsense
monikers deemed to be “working dog names” such as “Pal”, “Blackie” or “Ginger”.

                             Notes
    The CKC "miscellaneous class" is for breeds working
             towards full CKC recognition.

The Greater Swiss Mountain Dog, or Grosser Schweizer Sennenhund, is the largest of the traditional
Swiss herding breeds, the Sennehunds, a grouping in which the Bernese Mountain Dog is also included.
They are believed descended from large dogs brought to Switzerland by the Romans in the first century
B.C., although another theory states that they arrived many centuries earlier with Phoenician traders. In
any case, they are almost certainly the result of the mating of indigenous dogs with large mastiff-type
dogs brought to Switzerland by foreign settlers. Greater Swiss Mountains Dogs are believed to be in the
ancestry of both the Saint Bernard Dog and the Rottweiler.


Appearance
This dog is a large, muscular, tricolour (black, red, and white; typically with a white blaze) dog of up to
140 pounds (64 kg). It is double-coated, with a gentle expression and triangular, folded ears. The dog
should give the impression of working ability.

Temperament
The Greater Swiss Mountain Dog has a reputation of combining protectiveness with a gentle nature,
particularly with respect to its love of its family, especially children.

These dogs are strong and active. A Swissy can be trained for weight-pulling competitions and/or to pull
carts behind them carrying goods or even a person. Prospective owners need to be prepared to give them
lots of time and attention.

History
The Greater Swiss Mountain Dog, a dog of great strength, was originally a herding dog, but was later
used for draft. It may have been the advent of mechanized vehicles, combined with the rise in popularity
of the Saint Bernard Dog, that led to the decline in popularity of the GSMD. However it happened, the
breed was believed to be extinct, or nearly so, by the turn of the 20th Century.

In 1908 an owner named Franz Schertenlieb entered his mountain dogs in the Swiss Kennel Club (SKG)
jubilee dog show, knowing that they would be seen by an expert in native Swiss dogs, Dr. Albert Heim.
Dr. Heim, an avid fancier, was apparently delighted to find a living example of the Grosser Schweizer
Sennenhund, and exhorted the members of the Kennel Club to do all that they could to safeguard the
breed, including scour farms and villages for healthy specimens for a breeding program.

His suggestion was acted upon, and a careful breeding program was begun. Due to the meticulous nature
of the selection process, the lack of worthy brood bitches, and the requirement that all puppies be
reexamined as adults for conformation and temperament before being certified as suitable for breeding,
breed numbers grew slowly.

All-breed club recognition

The Greater Swiss Mountain Dog, now often known as the GSMD or ‘Swissy’, is an example of an
ancient, well-documented and established pure breed that was nevertheless not recognized by large all-
breed kennel clubs around the world. The first GSMDs were introduced to the United States in 1968,
and were recognized provisionally by the AKC in 1985 and received full recognition in 1995, an
ironically late date for such an old breed of dog. It was recognized by the UKC in 1992.

Dogs have been selectively bred for thousands of years, sometimes by inbreeding dogs from the same
ancestral lines, sometimes by mixing dogs from very different lines. The process continues today,
resulting in a tremendous variety of dog breeds.

The following list uses a wide interpretation of "breed". Breeds listed here may be traditional breeds
with long histories as registered breeds, rare breeds with their own registries, or new breeds that may
still be under development. Please see individual articles for more information. See also dog breed and

Breed categories




                                 This Chihuahua mix and Great Dane show some of the tremendous
variety of dog breeds.

Dog breeds can be divided into different categories, such as:

    ●   Hunting
           ❍ Hounds, including Sight hounds and Scent hounds

           ❍ Gundogs, including Pointers, Retrievers, and Spaniels

           ❍ Terrier

           ❍ Cur

    ●   Working (or Utility)
           ❍ Herding, including Sheepdogs
            ❍  Sled dog
    ●   Bulldogs
    ●   Extinct dog breeds
    ●   Fighting dogs
    ●   Toy

Dog breeds can also be grouped into similar types such as mastiff types, spitz types, pit bulls, or
Lurchers.

                                       Ancient Dog Breeds
                                                                                  Back | Home | Up | Next


Fourteen ancient breeds of dog have recently been identified through advances in DNA analysis. These
breeds of domesticated dog show the fewest genetic differences from wolves. The breeds are
geographically diverse, including dogs from Siberia, Japan, Alaska, China, Tibet, and Africa.

The identification of the fourteen "Ancient" dog breeds was established in the article "Genetic Structure
of the Purebred Domestic Dog" in the journal Science [1], Volume 304 (May 21, 2004).


The fourteen ancient breeds
The following are the dog breeds listed as ancient in the published study and their countries of origin:

    ●   Afghan Hound (Afghanistan)
    ●   Akita (Japan)
    ●   Alaskan Malamute (United States (Alaska))
    ●   Basenji (Congo)
    ●   Chow Chow (China)
    ●   Lhasa Apso (Tibet)
    ●   Pekingese (China)
    ●   Saluki (Egypt)
    ●   Samoyed (Siberia)
    ●   Shar Pei (China)
    ●   Shiba Inu (Japan)
    ●   Shih Tzu (China/Tibet)
    ●   Siberian Husky (Siberia)
    ●   Tibetian Terrier (Tibet)


Controversy
There is some controversy over the results of the study, as some have noted that breeding between
wolves and specific breeds in recent times may have led to inaccurate results. As a result of these
breedings, the offspring would have gained genetic similarities with wolves and may mask the truth
about the real differences between the breed and wolves before these interbreedings.

                            Notes



The Great Dane is a breed of dog known for its large size and gentle personality. The breed is
commonly referred to as the "Gentle Giant".

Appearance




                                 Harlequin coat color

There are six show-acceptable coat colors for Great Danes.

       Fawn: Yellow gold with a black mask. Black should appear on the eye rims and eyebrows, and
       may appear on the ears and tail tip.
       Brindle: Fawn and black in a chevron stripe pattern. Often also referred to as a tiger-stripe
       pattern.
       Blue: Deep grey with a bluish tinge. Reminiscent of Weimaraners.
       Black: Pure jet black.
       Harlequin: Torn black patches on white. The Great Dane is the only dog breed that shows this
       particular coat color pattern. (Dalmatians have round black spots.)
       Mantle: Black coat and mask on white. Looks like the markings on Boston Terriers.
Other colors occur occasionally but are not acceptable in the show ring. Because they are not valid for
show dogs, they are not pursued by breeders. These colors include white, fawnequin, merle, merlequin,
fawn mantle, and others. These are sometimes advertised as "rare" colors to unsuspecting buyers. Any
coat that includes "mouse grey" is disqualified from show.

Cropping of the ears is common in the United States and much less common in Europe. Indeed, in some
European countries, in parts of Australia, and in New Zealand, the practice is banned, or controlled such
that it may only be performed by veterinary surgeons for health reasons.

Height and weight requirements for show dogs vary from one kennel club's standards to another, but
generally the minimum weight falls between 100 to 120 lb (46 to 54 kg) and the minimum height must
be between 28 and 32 inches (71 to 81 cm) at the withers. Most standards do not specify a maximum
height or weight. In August 2004, a Great Dane named "Gibson" from Grass Valley, California was
recognized by the Guinness Book of Records as the world's tallest dog, measuring 42.2 inches at the
withers. [1]


Temperament
Typically they are smart, strong dogs who are protective and loyal to their owners. Many are gentle and
delicate, although not to the extent of being timid. They take to training well and are fairly low
maintenance compared to many other breeds. The Great Dane must be spirited, courageous, always
friendly and dependable, and never timid or aggressive.

Health
Great Danes, like most giant dogs, have a fairly slow metabolism. This results in less energy and less
food consumption per pound of dog than in small breeds.

Great Danes have some health problems that are common to large breeds. Bloat (a painful distending
and twisting of the stomach) is a rare but critical condition that affects Great Danes and results rapidly in
death if not quickly addressed. It is a commonly recommended practice for Great Danes to have their
stomachs tacked (Gastropexy) to the interior rib lining during routine surgery such as spaying and
neutering if the dog or its relatives have a history of bloat. Another problem common to the breed is in
the hips (hip dysplasia). Typically an x-ray of the parents can certify whether their hips are healthy and
can serve as a guidline for whether the animals should be bred and are likely to have healthy pups.

Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM) and many congenital heart diseases are also commonly found in the
Great Dane.

Great Danes also suffer from several genetic disorders that are specific to the breed. For example, if a
Great Dane lacks color (not white) near its eyes or ears then that organ does not develop and the dog will
be either blind or deaf.




                                 The brindle coat can be lightly brindled, as here, or with more
distinctive stripes.

History
Often referred to as the "Apollo of Dogs", the Great Dane we know today is thought to have originated
from larger German Bullenbeisser dogs. The Bullenbeisser was used in Germany for hunting large wild
boar. Some texts about Great Danes say this breeding was accidental. There are also those who believe
that the Great Dane was created by crossing a Greyhound with an English Mastiff. The origin of the
"Dane" appellation is unclear; the breed almost certainly did not originate in Denmark, and indeed is still
known in German as the Deutsche Dogge and in French as the Dogue Allemand, both meaning "German
mastiff".

Miscellaneous
The Great Dane is the state dog of Pennsylvania.

The Great Dane is the team mascot at the University at Albany.

The coat is moderate in length, dense, and lustrous; ideally it should lie flat and straight, but the breed
was initially called the Wavy-Coated Retriever. Later, the coat somehow flattened out and the name
changed accordingly, but the tendency toward wavy hair still emerges occasionally.

Temperament
The flat-coat’s personality is described as outgoing, devoted, and friendly, an ideal companion with a
strong bond to its owner. It is said to be a very versatile hunting dog, retrieving well on land or in the
water, flushing upland game, marking downed birds, and generally doing all that can be expected of a
multipurpose gundog. Although little-known and much less popular than the Labrador and Golden
Retrievers, it has benefitted from that lack of popularity by enjoying more careful breeding and better
maintenance of its fine working ability.

Flat-coated retrievers love to please, but may be slightly more difficult to train than the popular Golden
Retriever and Labrador Retriever. They exhibit a streak of willfulness at times, and don't have a really
long attention span. For this reason, it's best to make training sessions fun, entertaining, and relatively
short for the dog.

Flat-coats are known for having a sunny optimism and a tail that's always wagging. They are capable of
getting along well with cats, other dogs, small pets, and strangers. However, due to their exuberant
nature, they may tend to knock over chldren. Socialization and obedience training is highly
recommended. Flat-coats tend to be very rowdy when young, and need plenty of exercise throughout
their life. Sometimes they are referred to as the "Peter Pan of dogs" because they never grow up, acting
playful and puppy-like well into their years.

History
Originating in the late 19th century it gained popularity as a gamekeeper’s dog. Part of its ancestry is
thought to have come from stock imported from North America of Newfoundland type, as was the case
with the Labrador and Chesapeake Bay retrievers.

After its introduction, the flatcoat began to quickly gain in popularity as a gundog, and from 1873 when
the breed became a "stable type" according to the American Kennel Club until 1915 when it was
officially recognized as a breed, the number of flatcoats grew rapidly. However, soon thereafter, the
popularity of the flatcoat began to fall, eclipsed by the golden retriever, which was actually bred in part
from the flatcoat, and other breeds. By the end of World War Two, there were so few flatcoats that the
breed's survival was uncertain. However, beginning in the 1960s, the breed gained in popularity again,
and today, the flatcoat remains a solid breed.

                                        Animal Euthanasia
                                                                                           Home | Up | Next


Euthanasia (Greek, "good death") is the practice of killing a person or animal, in a painless or
minimally painful way, for merciful reasons, usually to end suffering. This article discusses animal
euthanasia; a separate article covers euthanasia in humans.

An animal is euthanized when it is killed in a manner deemed to be humane, and in the case of a pet, in
accordance with the emotional needs of the owner.

It can be done with inhalant agents, noninhalant pharmacologic agents (administered by a lethal
injection), and physical methods. Pets are almost always euthanized via lethal injection, typically a very
high dose of a barbiturate anaesthetic such as pentobarbital. Unconsciousness, respiratory and cardiac
arrest follow rapidly, usually within 30 seconds to several minutes later. Pet owners generally consider it
to be a quick and peaceful death.

Pet and livestock owners might decide to do this when the animal is suffering significantly due to injury
or terminal illness, is overly aggressive, or when the owner/guardian is no longer able to keep or care for
the animal and is unable or unwilling to find a new home for it. Additionally, many stray and feral
animals, in particular, cats, are euthanized due to the lack of adoptive homes. In this latter case, the
simple presence of the animals may be considered objectionable by those who live or work nearby, and
who trap the animals (or request the assistance of animal control services to do so) and surrender them to
the local animal shelter.

Euthanasia is typically performed in a veterinary clinic or hospital, or in an animal shelter, and is usually
carried out by a veterinarian, or a veterinary technician working under the vet's supervision. Note that
euthanasia is performed at the discretion of the attending veterinarian, who may refuse an animal
owner's request to euthanize if he or she feels it is not medically or ethically necessary (so-called
"convenience" euthanasia).

Some in the animal welfare or animal rights movements consider the use of the term "euthanasia", with
its connotation of being done to ease suffering, to be a misnomer when applied to the euthanasia of
homeless (or soon-to-be homeless) animals that are otherwise healthy and free of behavioral disorders.
Some breeders also kill puppies that do not conform to the standard of the dog breed to prevent the
perpetuation of the perceived flaws or faults. Most modern breeders simply spay or neuter the animals
and place them in homes as pets.

Morality Debate
Animal shelters often euthanize animals when they can't find a home for them, typically after a standard
period of time (ranging from several days to several weeks for unclaimed stray animals). Some consider
this immoral and cruel; others believe that euthanasia is a less objectionable alternative to having
unwanted animals go to unsuitable homes or having them live out their lives in shelters which generally
do not have the funding to give unlimited numbers of animals proper care and exercise indefinitely.
Behavioral unsuitability for adoption (ie, aggression, house-breaking, etc) is a major non-clinical reason
for euthanasia in animal shelters.

So-called "no kill" shelters exist, some run by private animal welfare organizations while others are
subsidized wholly or in part by local government agencies. These shelters make it official policy to
never euthanize animals for non-medical reasons. Overcrowding, lack of adoptive homes and
underfunding are recognized problems. Supporters consider these minor compared to the ethics of
euthanasia they consider unnecessary.

Belgian Shepherd Dog (also know as the Belgian Sheepdog or Chien de Berger Belge) can refer to any of four breeds of
dog: the Groenendael, the Laekenois, the Tervueren, or the Malinois. In some regions, these are considered four different
varieties of a single breed; in other regions, they are considered a single breed.

The American Kennel Club (AKC) recognizes only the Groenendael under the name "Belgian Sheepdog", but also recognizes
the Tervueren (with the alternative spelling "Tervuren") and the Malinois as individual breeds. The Laekenois can be registered
as part of the AKC foundation stock service and should eventually be recognised fully by the AKC.

The Australian National Kennel Council and the New Zealand Kennel Club recognize all four as separate breeds. The
Canadian Kennel Club, Kennel Union of South Africa and the Kennel Club (UK) follow the FCI classification scheme and
recognises all four as varieties of the same breed.

All are hard-working, intelligent dogs of the same general size and temperament. They differ in their coats and superficially in
appearance.

They are so closely related that, when breeding any two dogs of the same coat colour and length (eg Groenendael), it is
possible for puppies of different "breeds" to be in the same litter. For example, a Groenendael litter could contain a brown-
coated long-haired puppy; in countries that consider them the same breed with 4 coat variaties, this is fine and the puppy would
be a valid Tervueren, but the AKC considers it to be an aberration of the all-black Belgian Shepherd and disqualifies it in the
conformation ring. This dog can be breed with other Groenendaels (indeed the AKC allows this because the dog is after all
registered as a Groenendael!)and worked in obedience, agility and other sports venues. Likewise, a Tervueren could have a
short-coated puppy; in some countries, this is merely the Malinois coat variation but the AKC again considers it to be a
disqualifiable fault in the conformation ring.

In years gone past, the Groenendael and Tervuren were one breed with coat variations until the Club decided to petition the
AKC to make the separation into two separate breeds.

Appearance
Temperament
Belgian Shepherds are bred to be highly intelligent, alert and sensitive to everything going on around them, and to develop
extremely strong relationship bonds. This means that they need significant socializing as puppies, lifelong activity outlets, and
will seek to be with "their human" all the time, preferably doing something rather than waiting around. They can find it very
difficult to be left alone. During their juvenile years, they can go through irrational fears (similar to the child who believes there
is a monster in the closet), and can suddenly develop anxiety over some object or place which has never been a problem before,
although these fade over time with a good positive lead. They tend strongly to be a "one person dog."

Belgian shepherds like to please, and can over-react badly to "negative" (punishment or deterrence based) training, so they
should as a rule be clicker- or reward-trained only. They can also behave as if they think that they are smarter than their
owners, so it is important for the owner to know how to train dogs or to enroll in training classes. Professional training is highly
recommended by trainers/acadamies specific to this type of dog, as well as continued training or development beyond the
basics, such as obedience, agility and herding and other sports. This is because Belgian Shepherds as a rule require mental
stimulation as much or more so then physical. Most Belgian owners know that rote or pattern-based training is not the ideal for
Belgians. Nor is drilling a particular activity going to prove successful. If a Belgian does something right 3 times in a row, he,
or she, does not see the sense in doing it the fourth time!

All the Belgian Shepherd breeds need a lot of activity and close interaction with people. Like most herding breeds, they need a
job to do (be it frisbee in the park, herding, learning tricks, dog agility). Throwing a toy endlessly for the dog to fetch works for
some breeds, but the Belgian breeds are intelligent and sociable dogs who can easily become bored with such simple and
undemanding repetition. Many Belgians make superb assistance dogs who thrive on knowing that their jobs are indeed
necessary for their chosen person.

An amusing series of humorous cartoons showing the lighter side of the Belgian Shepherd personality can be found here.

Ownership

They are widely considered to be a fine looking dog, loyal, intelligent, fun, and well suited to family life. However because of
their high sensitivity to criticism or to being ignored, their careful handling and socialising needs, their need for ongoing
stimulation and purposeful activity, and their potential (in common with other high energy dogs such as Siberian Huskies) to
develop problems or even become destructive if bored, they are not usually considered suitable for a first time or inexperienced
owner, or one who cannot meet their needs.

Health
Belgians overall are fairly healthy as a breed, especially compared to many other breeds. Their main illnesses as a breed are
epilepsy, hip dysplasia, thyroid conditions, and cataracts. A study at UC indicates that 17% (one in 6) will develop epilepsy,
although most of these will only develop occasional petit mal seizure and not be seriously affected by it. Their more compact
form means they are less likely to develop dysplasia than German Shepherds or other breeds (around 8% or 1 in 12). Cataracts
can develop around ages 2-4.

                            Notes



The Belgian Shepherd Dog (Tervueren) is a breed of dog, sometimes classified as a variety of the
Belgian Shepherd Dog rather than as a separate breed. The Tervueren is recognized in the United States
by the AKC and the CKC under the name Belgian Tervuren, but has recently had an official name
change to Belgian Shepherd dog, Tervueren.

Appearance
Like all Belgian Shepherds, the Tervueren is a medium-sized, hard-working, square-proportioned dog in
the sheepdog family. Males stand between 24 and 26 inches, and weigh approximately 65 lbs. Females
are finer and smaller. The Tervueren is recognized by its thick double coat, generally mahogany with
varying degrees of black overlay, including a black mask. A small patch of white on the chest is
permissable, as well as white tips on toes. Tervueren may also be sable or grey, but this may be
penalized in the show ring in some countries according to the standard of the registering body.

Temperament
Excellent family dogs, they have high energy and require a lot of exercise and coat care. They excel at
obedience, dog agility, and flyball.

A muzzle is a device that is placed over the snout of an animal to keep it from biting or otherwise
opening its mouth.

Muzzles are sometimes used on untrained dogs, large or small, to prevent either unwanted biting or
unwanted barking. They can also be used on aggressive dogs or other animals. They are usually made
with a strong buckle or other fastening device to ensure that they do not come off accidentally.

Muzzles can be primarily solid, with air holes to allow the animal to breathe, or formed from a set of
straps that provides better air circulation and allow the animal to drink. Leather, wire, plastic, and nylon
are common materials for muzzles. The shape and construction of the muzzle might differ depending on
whether the intent is to prevent an animal from biting or from eating, for example.

Dog muzzles can be found in most pet supply stores.

                                 Clicker-training clickers come in various shapes and forms.

A clicker is any device that makes a clicking sound, usually when deliberately activated by its user.

For example, the clickers used in clicker training are small hand-held devices that make a loud and
consistent sound to assist in training animals. They usually consist of a piece of thin metal held in a
casing so that the metal is slightly torqued; depressing one end of the metal causes it to pop out of
alignment and releasing it causes it to pop back into alignment, each time making a sharp click.

With some clickers, the user depresses the metal directly with thumb or finger; with others, a button
extends above the surface of the casing so that depressing the button makes the metal click.

A clicker is also what some people call a remote control.

Crate training is the process of teaching a dog to go into its crate on command and to be comfortable
there while enclosed. Dogs, like all canines, are den-dwelling animals by instinct and a crate becomes a
den substitute, providing a familiar and safe haven for the dog. A crate-trained dog benefits the dog and
the dog's owner in a number of ways.




                                 This dog is relaxing in its familiar wire crate, which is strapped into a
car for safe traveling.

Housebreaking
A crate can be used as an adjunct to housebreaking puppies. By instinct, most dogs do not want to
defecate or urinate in their den -- in this case, the crate.

The puppy is kept in the crate except during feeding time or during supervised play time. When the
puppy comes out of the crate, he or she is taken to the "special area" and given encouragement to "go
potty" or other predetermined voice command. When the puppy "goes potty" she or he is profusely
praised. Until housebroken, the puppy is either in the crate or is closely supervised.

For maximum effectiveness, the crate must be just large enough for the puppy to be able to stand up,
turn around, and lie down comfortably. If there is too much space, the puppy might use the unoccupied
end as a bathroom. In addition, timing of the puppy's potty breaks are crucial. Even a confined puppy
has a difficult time controlling its urination and defecation. Control gets better as the puppy gets older,
but it is the owner's responsibility to ensure that the puppy has ample opportunities to eliminate outside
the crate.
Toys and soft material for bedding in the crate make it more comforting for a dog or puppy.

Even an adult dog, when ill or affected by certain medications, can end up soiling the crate, making the
dog uncomfortable both physically and mentally, if the owner isn't vigilant and aware of the dog's needs.

Away from home
All veterinary clinics and hospitals keep dogs in crates when the dog must stay for observation or care.
A dog who understands the concept of a crate is much less likely to become stressed during medical care
and is much easier for the staff to handle when putting him into the crate or removing him.

The same is true for kennels, where an owner might leave a dog while out of town or during
emergencies. In true emergencies, such as when an owner's home is destroyed or damaged by wildfires,
floods, or earthquakes, a dog who understands and is comfortable in a crate is much easier to manage
while the owner is performing other tasks or while the dog must be left in someone else's care in a
situation that is also likely to be stressful to the dog and make an unconfined dog more likely to try to
escape.




                                   A dog who is familiar with crates so won't chew or dig at it can be
placed in a soft crate, which is easier to fold up and to carry than most wire crates. Experienced crate-
trained dogs usually stay in the crate until verbally released, even when the door is open.

Control at home
A crate-trained dog feels safe and comfortable in its familiar crate at home. When guests visit, when
small children are present unattended, when construction occurs in the home, or in a myriad of other
circumstances, it is convenient to be able to put the dog into its crate, where it can relax and sleep,
unattended, and the owner can also relax that the dog will not be harmed, will not cause problems, and
will not escape out an inadvertently open door. A crate with very see-through sides, such as a wire crate,
can be made to feel more safe and enclosed by draping a towel or sheet over it.
Travel
When a dog travels on an airline, he must be enclosed in a sturdy crate. Because travel is stressful for the
dog to begin with, as is separation from its owner, a dog who is in a familiar and comfortable crate has a
tremendous advantage over a dog who must be forced into an unfamiliar crate along with all the other
stresses of travel.

When a dog travels by car, a loose dog can create several hazards for itself or its human companions.
For example:

     ●   An excitable dog who sees another animal outside the vehicle might leap into the driver's lap
         while the car is moving, potentially causing an accident.
     ●   Dogs have been known to leap through the window of moving cars, injuring or killing
         themselves.
     ●   A loose dog barking at a stranger who comes up to the car (such as a police officer) can pose a
         hazard to the stranger or to itself, as in the case of Leo, the Bichon Frise, who was grabbed and
         thrown into moving traffic in an incident of road rage in San Jose, California in 2001[1], drawing
         tremendous media attention and resulting in the man's conviction for the dog's death.
     ●   Drivers who are distracted by their dogs moving around behind them, barking, or getting into
         forbidden things while the car is moving can also cause accidents, such as the one that nearly
         killed writer Stephen King. A British Royal Auto Club survey showed that 11 percent of drivers
         listed dogs moving around in the car as distractions that they had experienced while driving.
     ●   In the event of an accident, even a well-behaved dog can become a dangerous projectile that can
         seriously injure the driver or passengers in seats in front of the dog.
     ●   Even if the dog doesn't hit a person during an accident, the dog itself can be severely injured or
         killed, for example by being thrown through the windshield when a car going 60 MPH abruptly
         crashes and stops, or can be thrown from a tumbling car.
     ●   If the dog is only moderately injured or uninjured, and particularly if the owner is injured, a loose
         dog might consider people coming to the owner's aid to be the causes of the accident or threats to
         its family or property and might attack or attempt to drive off the helpers.

For all the reasons that humans and children must be securely fastened in their seats, dogs also should
be. A crate that is securely strapped into the car provides an easy method to contain the dog that still
allows the dog to move comfortably during travel.

Training
Crate training usually involves rewarding the dog for entering the crate and for remaining there, using
the crate as part of a play session, feeding the dog in the crate, allowing the dog to explore and use the
crate until it is no longer intimidating, and so on. This is only a summary of detailed techniques.
Types of crates
There are many types of crates, and variations within the types:

    ●   Solid plastic crates are usually more suitable than other types for secure travel, such as in an
        airplane. They might also be safer in a car accident than other types. Disadvantages are that they
        take up a lot of space and do not fold for storage.
    ●   Wire crates usually can be folded for storage or transport, although it might be difficult to do and
        they are fairly heavy for their size. They provide more airflow for the dog and provide people
        with a clearer view inside. Such crates are often used in car travel, at veterinary hospitals, and at
        kennels. There are a variety of covers and pads available to make crates safe and more
        comfortable.
    ●   Soft crates can always be easily folded for storage or transport and are lightweight. They provide
        the dog with a stronger sense of security but still allow visibility and airflow. They cannot be
        used with dogs who are likely to dig or chew at the crate, and they are unsuitable for transporting
        dogs in any type of vehicle.

                                                                                     Back | Home | Up | Next


A dog collar is a collar worn by dogs; usually with a dog tag with the owner's telephone number or the
dog's vaccination information on it.

Dog collar is also an informal term for a clerical collar and for a necklace similar to a wide choker,
popular in the Edwardian period; see Collar (jewelry).

Basic collars




                                   Leather buckle collar with traditional buckle.

A collar is a piece of material put around the neck of a dog for control, identification, or other purposes.
Identification tags and medical information is often placed on collars. Collars are also useful for
controlling the dog, as they provide a handle for grabbing.

     ●   Buckle collars, also called flat collars, are usually nylon or leather with a buckle similar to a belt
         buckle or a quick-release buckle, either of which holds the collar loosely around the dog's neck.
         Usually identification is attached to such a collar; it also comes with a loop to which a leash can
         be fastened.
                                  Nylon quick-release buckle collar with identification and medical tags.

    ●   Flea collars are impregnated with chemicals that repel fleas. They are usually a supplementary
        collar, worn in addition to the conventional buckle collar.
    ●   An Elizabethan collar, shaped like a truncated cone, is worn by a pet, usually a cat or dog, to
        prevent it scratching a wound on its head or neck or licking a wound or infection on its body.

Training collars
Several types of collars are used for dog training:

    ●   Flat collars: Many dogs are trained on leash using a buckle or quick-release collar.




                                  Slip collar, showing how the chain pulls through the loop at one end.

    ●   Slip chain (also called choke chain, slip collar, or choke collar) is a length of chain or nylon rope
        with rings at either end such that the collar can be formed into a loop around the animal's neck
        that slips (adjusts) tighter when pulled and slips looser when tension is released. Used for training
        if the dog is not responsive on a buckle collar; provides some additional control and prevents a
        wild dog from being able to thrash its way out of a looser collar. It can also, when pulled hard
        enough, tighten around the neck in a way that prevents airflow. Properly used, the slip collar is
        quickly popped and released as a firm reminder to the dog to pay attention; it is not pulled tight
        and held.
                                Prong collar; the looped chain limits how tightly the collar can pull in
the same way that a Martingale functions.

    ●   Prong collar (also called pinch collar) is a series of chain links with open ends turned towards the
        dog's neck so that, when the collar is tightened, it pinches the naturally loose skin around the
        dog's neck. When properly adjusted and used, it startles the dog and gives a sharp correction, but
        it is very difficult if not impossible to actually puncture the skin. Proponents argue that this is
        how mother dogs or adult dogs of higher rank correct misbehaving puppies or lower-rank dogs,
        by grabbing the loose skin around the neck in their teeth. Opponents argue that pain is never a
        good default way in which to train animals. Some dogs are nearly oblivious to leash corrections
        of any kind, including the prong collar, but the prong collar might make such dogs pay more
        attention than other collar types. The advantage of the prong collar over the choke collar is that
        the circumference is limited so that it is impossible to compress the animal's throat.
    ●   Martingale collars have a longer section usually made of leather, chain, or nylon, joined through
        loops by a circle of chain or leather to which the leash is fastened; pulling on the leash tightens
        the collar, but the wide section both prevents the chain from tangling in a dog's coat and prevents
        the collar from being pulled tightly enough to cut off the dog's airway.
    ●   Stud collar is fitted with sharp points and metal studs that prevent another animal from biting the
        neck. While such a collar may appear brutal, it is actually the best collar for a milder mannered or
        older animal interacting with its more aggressive fellows.




                                  The halter-style collar controls the dog's head but does not restrict its
ability to pant, drink, or grasp objects.

     ●   Halter collar, such as those sold under the brand names Haltie or Gentle Leader; like a halter on a
         horse, this collar fastens around the back of the neck and over the top of the muzzle, giving more
         control over a dog's direction and the intensity of pulling on a leash than collars that fit strictly
         around the neck. Pressure on this type of collar pulls the dog's head towards the handler.

President Harrison's tenure.

A doghouse (or a kennel) is a small shed, often built in the shape of a little house, in which a dog is kept
or can run into for shelter from the elements.

The expression "in the doghouse" means to be in trouble; often used of a husband who is figuratively
sent to the doghouse in the same way that a dog is removed from the human habitation. The disdained
person may also be "sent to Coventry".

Snoopy's doghouse played a large role in the comic Peanuts.

In architecture, doghouse is more commonly a builder/contractor term for a dormer. The name is
derived from the appearance of improperly proportioned dormers, which do resemble dog houses.
Properly proportioned dormers should neatly fit to the window it is meant to frame - a common mistake
is to undersize the windows or oversize the dormer, which necessitates the use of siding or other infill
material, in which case the structure should be treated as a gable end. Some architects use the word
"doghouse" in a derrogatory manner to indicate an ignorance of "honest" building practices, often found
in low-cost residential and light commercial, developer-built structures.

An Elizabethan collar, shaped like a truncated cone, is worn by a pet, usually a cat or dog, to prevent it
scratching a wound on its head or neck or licking a wound or infection on its body.

A halter is headgear that is used to guide an animal; it fits over the back of the neck and across or
around the animal's muzzle so that, when a handler pulls on the muzzle end of the halter, the animal's
head turns towards the handler.

Halters are commonly used on horses and sometimes on cattle, dogs, and other animals.

The primary difference between a halter and a bridle is that the latter has a bit that goes into the animal's
mouth, providing even greater control.

                                            Dog Harness
                                                                                   Back | Home | Up | Next


A dog harness is similar to harness tack for horses, and varies depending on the type of use: assistance
to a disabled person, for pets whose neck or throat might be sensitive to a collar, hauling a cart or sled,
or pulling a human being as in skijoring or pulka.


Assistance dog harnesses
Assistance dog harnesses are designed with a handle for the person to grip, so that the human/dog team
may communicate as well as provide guidance (the dog) and control (the human being). An exception to
this use is in the case of dogs who haul people in wheelchairs, although the design is similar to that used
for guide dogs.


Sled dog harnesses
Sled dog harnesses vary depending on whether the dog is hauling freight or racing. Harnesses come in
three main types: the freight harness, the H-back harness, and the X-back harness. Dog sports are
growing and more types of harnesses are being developed, including the Y-back style. There will
probably be new variations whenever you read this.

The freight harness, often an H-back harness with a wide chestband and sometimes extra padding, is
designed to help the dog pull heavy weights efficiently, and may feature a spreader bar behind the wheel
dogs and before the sled or cart. The straps form an 'H' or ladder-like effect across the back of the dog.
These harnesses help distribute the weight of the cargo over a broader body area.




                                 Royal Canadian Mounted Police (R.C.M.P.) These dogs are wearing H-
back freight harnesses. Photo from 1957.
Racing harnesses are lighter and shorter than freight harnesses. The X-back harness, so called because
the straps form an 'X' across the back of the dog, is used more frequently than the H-back, with short
versions that ride farther forward on the dog's body recently gaining in popularity.

The Y-back or hybrid harness is similar in appearance to the H-back. The tugline attaches to the harness
on top of the dog's back and stretches parallel to the ground or upwards to the skier, bicycle, or other
load.

In contrast, dogs that participate in weight pulls (as compared to a regular freight harness) will wear very
heavy, padded harnesses, with broad chestbands to help spread the weight and prevent harm to the dog.

                                   A clip-on leash attaches to the collar that the dog might already be
wearing.

A leash or a lead is a rope or similar material attached to the neck of a pet (often a dog) for restraint or
control. Some leashes clip or tie to collars or harnesses, while others go directly around the animal's
neck.

In many jurisdictions, laws require dogs and other animals to wear leashes at all times when outdoors.

Purposes of a leash include: preventing animals from frightening or biting people or other animals,
defecating and urinating in inappropriate places, endangering traffic, digging up lawns and causing other
damage, and getting lost. Leashes also provide a clear method of communication and ensure control
during training.

For dogs, leashes take many forms; for example:

     ●   Very short tab leads; a clip attached to a loop handle or to a short piece of leather with a knot or
         similar short handle. Allows very close, tight control of a dog in certain competition or training
         situations.
     ●   Short, soft, braided leather lead with a loop handle and a clip to attach to the collar, usually about
         4 feet in length, commonly used during obedience training. The softness enables the trainer to
         fold the leash into a shorter length and the braiding allows a firmer grip.
     ●   Nylon webbing leash, usually 4 to 6 feet, with a loop handle and clip, most commonly used for
         walking dogs casually.
     ●   Extended-length webbing leashes, 12 to 30 feet or more, usually with a loop handle and a clip,
         primarily for training at a distance or during tracking sessions.
    ●   Slip-lead, usually with a loop handle and an adjustable, slipping loop at the other end that goes
        around the dog's neck. Often used in work or competitions—such as dog agility—where the leash
        must be quickly removed and replaced.
    ●   Retractable (brands include Flexi and Zenimal), a hook on a thin rope that retracts automatically
        into a large plastic handle, allowing the dog to wander 15 or 25 feet away while keeping the leash
        taut (in theory preventing it from tangling around obstacles or the dog's legs) but still allowing
        the handler to reel in the dog for closer control.

                                             A dog might wear several different identifying dog tags.

A dog tag is a small flat tag worn on collars or harnesses by dogs, usually with identifying information
such as the owner's telephone number so that the owner can be notified if the dog is lost.

Dog tags were traditionally worn on a chain, rope, or collar around the dog's neck. The resemblance of
human identification tags to this method of display led to them also being called dog tags; see dog tag
(identifier). Some dogs wear harnesses instead of collars, so tags might be attached there instead. Most
humane societies and rescue organizations recommend that dog tags be on a buckle-type collar rather
than on a slip collar, because the former remains more securely fastened around a dog's neck when
slipping through a fence or being held by a stranger.

Identifying information
Identifying information on a dog tag might include:

    ●   The dog's dog license number and contact information for the licensing organization
    ●   Dog's name
    ●   Owner's phone number, address, or both
    ●   An identifying number for the dog with a phone number for a lost-pet registry
    ●   Information about the dog's critical medical issues or rabies vaccinations
    ●   A notice that a reward will be paid for the return of the lost dog
    ●   For fun, the dog's titles, or information about the dog's behavior, such as the Canine Good Citizen
        tag

Some organizations recommend not putting a dog's name on a tag because, in an ownership dispute over
a stray dog, the original owner could use the dog's name to demonstrate that the dog recognizes the name
and therefore has an association with that owner. Others believe that a lost dog might feel more
comfortable if strangers call it by its own name.

Materials
Tags are made of many different materials. Metal tags usually have the information embossed or etched
onto the surface, and might also have electronic chips embedded. Plastic chips can be etched or printed,
come in many colors, and are often highly reflective to make the dog more visible if it gets loose and
runs into the street after dark.

Effectiveness
Dog tags on a collar are easiest to use for random people who find a dog wandering loose.

Although dog tags can help to return a stray or lost dog to its owners, they are unreliable as a sole source
of identification for several reasons. The owner might move or change phone numbers and forget to
update the tags. Dogs often leave their collars behind when escaping from a yard, particularly when
squeezing through or under a fence. Some owners don't want their dogs wearing collars unsupervised,
and unsupervised dogs are more likely to be able to escape from a yard. Well-intentioned rescuers might
remove the dog's collar and tags to be able to read the phone number, and the dog might disappear again.
Collars and tags can also be removed intentionally by thieves, leaving the dog unidentifiable.

Today, microchip implants, tattooing, and registering the dog's license number, microship information,
and tattoo number with lost-pet registries are strong backups to the collar dog tag, but cannot be
completely relied on, either, as people unfamiliar with such technology might not know to check for
such identification or be able to figure out where to call. Another option is DNA fingerprinting although
this is much more rare.

                                              A microchip impant

A microchip is an identifying integrated circuit placed under the skin of a dog, cat, or other animal. The
chips are about the size of a large grain of rice and are based on a passive RFID technology..

Tattooing is another, older method for identifying animals.

Uses and benefits
Microchips have been particularly useful in the return of lost pets. They can also assist where the
ownership of an animal is in dispute.

Animal shelters and animal control centers benefit from microchipping by more quickly and efficiently
returning pets to their owners. When a pet can be quickly matched to its owner, the shelter avoids the
expense of housing, feeding, providing medical care, and outplacing or destroying the pet.
Microchipping is becoming increasingly standard at shelters: many require all outplaced animals to
receive a microchip, and provide the service as part of the adoption package.

In addition to shelters and veterinarians, microchips are used by kennels, breeders, brokers, trainers,
registries, rescue groups, humane societies, clinics, farms, stables, animal clubs and associations,
researchers and pet stores. Animal control officers are also trained and equipped to scan animals.

System of recovery
Effective pet identification and recovery depends on the following:
     ●   A pet owner either adopts a pet at a shelter that microchips some or all adoptee animals, or the
         owner with an existing pet brings it to a veterinarian (or a shelter) that provides the service.
     ●   The shelter or vet selects a microchip from their stock, makes a note of that chip's unique ID, and
         then inserts the chip into the animal.
     ●   Before sending the animal home, the vet or shelter performs a test scan on the animal. This helps
         ensure that the chip will be picked up by a scanner, and that its unique identifying number will be
         read correctly.
     ●   An enrollment form is completed with the chip number, the pet owner's contact information, the
         name and description of the pet, the shelter's and/or veterinarian's contact information, and an
         alternate emergency contact designated by the pet owner. (Some shelters or vets, however,
         choose to designate themselves as the primary contact, and take the responsibility of contacting
         the owner directly. This allows them to be kept informed about possible problems with the
         animals they place.) The form is then sent to the manufacturer of the chip to be entered into its
         database. This company typically provides not only the microchips, but a 24-hour, toll-free
         telephone service for pet recovery, good for the life of the pet.
     ●   The pet owner is also provided the chip ID and the contact information of the recovery service.
         This is often in the form of a collar tag imprinted with the chip ID and the recovery service's toll-
         free number, to be worn by the animal.
     ●   If the pet is lost or stolen, and is found by local authorities or taken to a shelter, it is scanned
         during intake to see if a chip exists. If one is detected, authorities call the recovery service and
         provide them the ID number, the pet's description, and the location of the animal. If the pet is
         wearing the collar tag, anyone who finds the pet can call the toll-free number, making it
         unnecessary to involve the authorities. (The owner can also preemptively notify the recovery
         service directly if a pet disappears. This is useful if the pet is stolen, and is taken to a vet who
         scans it and checks with the recovery service.)
     ●   The recovery service notifies the owner that the pet has been found, and where to go to recover
         the animal.

Many veterinarians perform test scans on microchipped animals every time the animal is brought in for
care. This ensures the chip still performs properly. Vets sometimes use the chip ID as the pet's ID in
their databases, and print this number on all outgoing paperwork associated with its services, such as
receipts, test results, vaccination certifications, and descriptions of medical or surgical procedures.

Components of a microchip
Microchips are passive, or inert, RFID devices and contain no internal power source. They are designed
so that they do not act until acted upon.

Three basic elements comprise most microchips: A silicon chip (integrated circuit); a core of ferrite
wrapped in copper wire; and a small capacitor. The silicon chip contains the identification number, plus
electronic circuits to relay that information to the scanner. The ferrite -- or iron -- core acts as a radio
antenna, ready to receive a signal from the scanner. The capacitor acts as a tuner, forming a LC circuit
with the antenna coil.

These components are encased in special biocompatible glass made from soda lime, and hermetically
sealed to prevent any moisture or fluid entering the unit. Animals are not affected physically or
behaviorally by the presence of a chip in their bodies.

Cross-compatibility
Because microchips and scanners are manufactured by different companies, and different countries
adopt their own standards, attempts have been made to establish a universal protocol that enables all
microchips to be read by all scanners. This effort has not yet been successful.

The two companies which dominate the U.S. market -- AVID and HomeAgain -- both sell microchips
which operate at a frequency of 125 kHz. This allows the scanner of one manufacturer to detect the
presence of its competitor's microchip -- even if it cannot actually decode the chip's encoded or
encrypted ID.

But in Canada, Europe, Asia and Australia, microchips for animals adopt a standard set by the
International Organization for Standardization, or ISO, specifying that chips operate at 134.2 kHz.

When Banfield began selling Crystal Tag microchips in the U.S. -- chips made by Switzerland-based
DATAMARS, and following ISO standards -- not enough scanners were distributed to ensure that these
chips (with their different frequency) could be detected. Customers were not aware that far fewer
shelters and clinics were equipped to detect these chips than the 125 kHz chips.

The situation is further complicated by the fact the AVID holds patents on 125 kHz technology, leading
to legal disputes when non-U.S. based companies attempt to market 125 kHz systems in America. One
solution is a scanner that will read both frequencies, known as a forwards-and-backwards scanner. These
are slower and less reliable, and have not been widely distributed at shelters and clinic.

The industry seems to agree that before ISO chips are more widely distributed in the U.S., scanners that
can read the chips should be widely distributed first, and a transition strategy should be in place.

Implant location
In dogs and cats, chips are usually inserted below the skin at the back of the neck, between the shoulder
blades on the dorsal midline. The chip can often be manually detected by the owner by gently feeling the
skin in that area. It stays in place as thin layers of connective tissue form around the biocompatible glass
which encases it.

Horses are microchipped on the left side of the neck, half the distance between the poll and withers, and
approximately one inch below the midline of the mane, into the nuchal ligament.

Birds' microchips are injected into their breast muscles. Because proper restraint is necessary, the
operation requires two people -- an avian veterinarian and a trained assistant.


Animal species
Many species of animals have been microchipped, including birds, horses, llamas, alpacas, goats, sheep,
miniature pigs, rabbits, deer, ferrets, snakes, lizards, alligators, turtles, toads, frogs, rare fish, mice, and
prairie dogs -- even whales and elephants. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service uses microchipping in its
research of wild bison, black-footed ferrets, grizzly bears, elk, white-tailed deer, giant land tortoises and
armadillos.

World-wide use
Microchips are not in universal use, but there are legal requirements in some jurisdictions, such as the
state of New South Wales, Australia. Some countries, such as Japan, require ISO-compliant microchips
on dogs and cats being brought into the country, or for the person bringing the pet into the country to
also bring a microchip reader that can read the non-ISO-compliant microchip. [1]

                                    Small dogs such as this Poodle often need protection from extreme
weather. Dog booties prevent ice balls from forming between dogs' toes.

A rug is a covering or garment made by humans to protect their pets from the elements, as in a horse
rug or dog coat.

Rugs are also used to protect the pelage of show animals, particularly if the wool or fleece is to be
judged separately, as in alpaca fleece sent to an agricultural show, where it would be desirable to have
the wool free from dirt and debris.

Dog coats may be used functionally but are also fashion accessories.

                                                 Dog sled

A dog sled (or dogsled) is a sled pulled by one or more sled dogs used to travel over ice and through
snow. Numerous types of sleds are used, depending on their function.

A basket sled has a bed raised a several inches above the surface of the snow. This type of sled is used in
dogsled racing. Sprint sleds are often short-bodied basket sleds. A toboggan sled has a lower carriage
and uses a closed bed, allowing the sled to slide or float over deep snow. Freight sleds, which are
heavier and sturdier than sprint sleds, may be toboggan or basket sleds. Both of these types of sleds have
runners which stick out behind the sled, on which the musher can stand. Older sleds relied on hooks
attached to the sled with a rope, whereas modern sleds usually include drag and claw brakes built into
the sled.

A recent innovation in sled design was introduced in the 2004 Iditarod by Jeff King, who used a split
sled for the race. This sled, the Tail Dragger, has a basket-style body with a freight-holding back end,
and an open middle. The musher can sit on the back part or stand in the middle.

The komatik is a traditional Inuit sled, used in Canada and Greenland, low-slung and on which the
hunter or racer sits or lies down, facing forward. The runners do not stick out as in basket sleds.

A pulk is a short, flat sled used in the Scandinavian sport of pulka. The dog is hitched to the sled and the
sled to the skier. The pulk is used to carry supplies or equipment, but not usually a person.

The expedition led by the Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen used dog sleds when they reached the
South Pole before Robert Falcon Scott's party did.

A sulky is a lightweight cart, usually two-wheeled and single seated, pulled by horses or by dogs.

Horse sulky
A sulky for horses is a lightweight two-wheeled, single-seat racing cart that is used in most forms of
harness racing in the United States, Australia, and New Zealand, including both trotting and pacing races.

Race sulkies come in two categories,

    ●   Traditional symmetrical sulkies
    ●   Asymmetric or "offset" sulkies

The asymmetric sulky was patented in Australia in the 1980s and came to prominence in 1987 when a
two-year-old gelding named Rowleyalla used one to break the then world record for his category by a
colossal seventeen times the biggest previous margin that any southern hemisphere horse had ever
broken a world mile record. At 3.4 seconds under the existing mark, it was also the greatest margin by
which any world harness racing record was broken in that year.

In 1990 the asymmetric sulky was introduced into North America, winning seven of its first nine starts
at Freehold, NJ. Today the great majority of sulky manufacturers in North America are producing
asymmetric sulkies.

An additional sulky type is the "team-to-pole" or "pairs" sulky, a lightweight single seat sulky designed
for draft by two horses abreast.

These may also be split into two types:

    ●   Traditional pole and yoke with draft by traces.
    ●   Dorsal hitch with draft direct from the saddle to the yoke and, via the pole, to the sulky.

Of the two, the dorsal hitch pairs sulky is the most recent, holding all current world pairs speed records
over the mile to July 31, 2005.

Dog sulky
Smaller sulkies are also used for dogs, both for racing and as transportation.

The dog driving sulkies can be divided into two main types:

    ●   Conventional two-shaft carts attaching to harness on either side of the dog or dogs.
    ●   Single-shaft dorsal hitch carts, which attach to a single point on top of the dog's shoulders.

A further distinction may be made between sulkies with the axles rigidly connected to the vehicle, and
those with the axles insulated from the vehicle by springs and dampers. Those with springs and dampers
may be further divided into single-axle sprung carts and "independent suspension" sprung and damped
carts. Needless to say, those with independent suspension by coil springs and dampers tend to be both
more expensive and smoother riding.

Driving sulky construction materials run the full gamut from timber, through powder-coated steel tube,
aluminum tube, and stainless steel tube. The very latest types (currently undergoing field tests in
California) use nanotechnology-based stainless steels of prodigious strength-to-weight ratio.

The great majority of driving sulkies available have the wheel axles rigidly affixed to the frames. This
makes for a rough ride on anything but smooth surfaces such as pavement. But in recent years
lightweight, single shaft, independent suspension, driving sulkies have been introduced. These allow
safe high speed use in off-road conditions.

The most recent designs are of the single shaft type, as proponents believe that this type gives the dog(s)
greater freedom, less possibility of injury, and a quicker and easier training regime. A single shaft dog
sulky, made of stainless steel tube and fitted with independent suspension and disc brakes, weighs a little
under 18 kg.

However, as at August 2005, multiple shaft types are still the most common.

For off-road use, dog sulkies with sprung and damped independent suspension systems offer greatly
improved comfort and safety over traditional unsprung types.

A dog whistle is a type of whistle used in the training of dogs. The frequency range of a dog whistle is
largely out of the range of human hearing. Typically, a dog whistle is within the range of 5800 Hz to
12400 Hz (disputed — see talk page). Some dog whistles have adjustable sliders for active control of the
frequency produced.

Depending on the way the whistle is used, a trainer may simply gather a dog's attention or inflict pain for
the purpose of behavior modification.

The name dog whistle is often used for both lung-powered whistles as well as electronic devices that
emit ultrasonic sound via piezoelectric emitters. The electronic variety are sometimes coupled with bark
detection circuits in an effort to curb barking behavior.

Some political observers have used the phrase "dog-whistle politics" to refer to the use of words and
phrases that one's political allies will recognize and appreciate but that may not mean anything to other
listeners. For example, members of the United States' Republican Party sometimes speak of a "culture of
life", which sounds innocuous but is typically interpreted by political allies as a reaffirmation of the
speaker's opposition to abortion rights. So, the idea is that one uses words and phrases that only one's
political allies will hear and recognize.

                                      Russian Space Dogs
                                                                                 Back | Home | Up | Next




                                                                        Belka and Strelka orbited the
Earth and returned safely on Korabl-Sputnik-2

During the 1950s and 1960s the USSR used a number of dogs for sub-orbital and orbital space flights to
determine whether human spaceflight was feasible. Before becoming cosmonauts, the dogs were strays
from Moscow. In total in the 1950s and 60s, the Soviet Union launched missions with passenger slots
for at least 57 dogs. The actual number of dogs in space is smaller as some dogs flew more than once.

Training
Stray dogs, rather than animals accustomed to living in a house, were chosen because the scientists felt
they would be able to tolerate the rigours and extreme stresses of space flight better than other dogs.
Female dogs were used because of their temperament and the fact that they did not need to lift their leg
to urinate.

Their training included standing still for long periods of time, wearing space suits, being placed in
simulators that acted like a rocket during launch, riding in centrifuges that simulated the high
acceleration of a rocket launch and being kept in progressively smaller cages to prepare them for the
confines of the space capsules. Dogs that flew in orbit were fed a nutritious gel.

Sub-orbital flights




                                         Original russian space dog box used on suborbital and orbital
flights

Several dogs made high-altitude flights on R-1 series rockets between 1951 and 1952.

Dezik, Tsygan and Lisa

Dezik (Дезик) and Tsygan (Цыган, "Gypsy") were the first dogs to make a sub-orbital flight on July
22, 1951. Both dogs were recovered unharmed after travelling to a maximum altitude of 100km. Dezik
made another flight in September with a dog named Lisa, although neither survived.

Lysa and Ryjik

Lysa (Лиса, "Fox" or "Vixen") and Ryjik (Рыжик, "Red One") flew to an altitude of 100km on June 2,
1954.

Smelaya and Malyshka

Smelaya (Смелая, "Bold" or "Courageous") was due to make a flight in September but ran away the
day before the launch. Russian officials feared she had been eaten by wolves but she was found the next
day and went on to make a successful flight with a dog named Malyshka (Малышка, "Little One").
Bolik and ZIB

Bolik (Болик) ran away just days before her flight in September 1951. A replacement named ZIB
(allegedly, a Russian acronym for "Substitute for Missing Dog Bolik") was quickly located and made a
successful flight.

Otvazhnaya and Snezhinka

Otvazhnaya (Отважная, "Brave One") made a flight on July 2, 1959 along with a rabbit named
Marfusha (Марфуша, "Martha") and another dog named Snezhinka (Снежинка, "Snowflake"). She
went on to make 5 other flights between 1959 and 1960.

Albina and Tsyganka

Albina (Альбина, "Whitey") and Tsyganka (Цыганка, "Gypsy girl") were both ejected out of their
capsule at an altitude of 85km and landed safely. Albina was one of the dogs shortlisted for Sputnik 2
but never flew in orbit.

Damka and Krasavka

Damka (Дамка, "Little Lady") and Krasavka (Красавка, "Little Beauty") were both planned to make
an orbital flight on December 22, 1960, however after the upper stage rocket failed the flight was
aborted. Both were recovered successfully after an unplanned sub-orbital flight. Damka was also known
as Shutka (Шутка, "Joke") and Zhemchuzhnaya (Жемчужная, "Pearly") and Krasavka was also known
as Kometka (Кометка, "Comet") and Zhulka (Жулька, "Mutt?").

Other dogs that flew on sub-orbital flights include Dymka (Думка, "Smoky"), Modnitsa (Модница,
"Fashionable") and Kozyavka (Козявка, "Little Gnat").

At least four other dogs flew in September 1951 with two or more lost.

Orbital Flights
                                     Laika became the first living being in orbit on Sputnik 2

Laika

Main article: Laika

Laika (Лайка, "Barker"), originally named Kudryavka (Кудрявка, "Little Curly") became the first
living Earth-born creature in orbit aboard Sputnik II on November 3, 1957. Some call her the first living
passenger to go into space, but others claim sub-orbital flights passed the edge of space first. She was
also known as Zhuchka (Жучка, "Little Bug") and Limonchik (Лимончик, "Lemon"). The American
media dubbed her "Muttnik." She died between five and seven hours into the flight from stress and
overheating. Her true cause of death was not made public until years after the flight, with officials giving
conflicting reports that she was either euthanized by poisoned food or died when the oxygen supply ran
out. The Russian scientist responsible for the project has since expressed regret for allowing Laika to die.

Bars and Lisichka

Bars (Барс, "Panther" or "Lynx") and Lisichka (Лисичка, "Little Fox") died after their rocket exploded
28.5 seconds into the launch on July 28, 1960. Bars was also known as Chayka ("Gull").

Belka and Strelka

                                                                  Stuffed Strelka on tour in Australia
in 1991

Belka (Белка, literally, "Squirrel," but as a dog's name it more likely means "Whitey", from Russian:
"belyi" (for "white") and Strelka (Стрелка, "Little Arrow") spent a day in space aboard Korabl-Sputnik-
2 (Sputnik 5) on August 19, 1960 before safely returning to Earth. They were accompanied by a grey
rabbit, 40 mice, 2 rats, flies and a number of plants and fungi. All biological passengers survived.
Strelka went on to have six puppies, one of whom named Pushinka (Пушинка, "Fluffy"), was sent to
President John F. Kennedy's children as a present. Pushinka's descendents are still living today.

After death, the bodies of both Strelka and Belka were preserved. Belka is on display in Moscow, while
Strelka continues to tour the world as part of a travelling exhibition.

Pchelka and Mushka

Pchelka (Пчелка, "Little Bee") and Mushka (Мушка, "Little Fly") spent a day in orbit on December 1,
1960 on board Korabl-Sputnik-3 (Sputnik 6) with "other animals", plants and insects. Due to a
navigation error their spacecraft disintegrated during re-entry on December 2 and all were killed.
Mushka was one of the three dogs trained for Sputnik 2 and was used during ground tests. She did not
fly on Sputnik 2 because she refused to eat properly.

Chernushka

Chernushka (Чернушка, "Blackie") made one orbit on board Korabl-Sputnik-4 (Sputnik 9) on March
9, 1961 with a cosmonaut dummy (whom Russian officials nicknamed "Ivan Ivanovich"), mice and a
Guinea pig. The dummy was ejected out of the capsule during re-entry and made a soft landing using a
parachute. Chernushka was recovered unharmed inside the capsule.
Zvezdochka

Zvezdochka (Звездочка, "Little Star"), who was named by Yuri Gagarin, made one orbit on board
Sputnik 10 on March 25, 1961 with a wooden cosmonaut dummy in the final practise flight before
Gagarin's historic flight on April 12. Again, the dummy was ejected out of the capsule whilst
Zvezdochka remained inside. Both were recovered successfully.

Veterok and Ugolyok

Veterok (Ветерок, "Little Wind") and Ugolyok (Уголёк, "Ember") were launched on February 22,
1966 on board Voskhod 3 and spent 22 days in orbit before landing on March 16. This spaceflight of
record-breaking duration was not surpassed by humans until Skylab 2 in 1974 and still stands as the
longest space flight by dogs.

Dempsey was a female American Pit Bull Terrier who was the subject of a high-profile test case of the
Dangerous Dogs Act 1991. She was owned by Dianne Fanneran and lived in London. She died in 2003.

While being walked one evening in April 1992, muzzled and leashed in accordance with the law, she
was taken ill, and the person walking her (who was not her owner) had to remove her muzzle so she
could be sick. This was spotted by two passing policemen.

Three months later, at Ealing Magistrates' Court, Dempsey was sentenced to death under the Dangerous
Dogs Act for being in public unmuzzled.

Dempsey was then put by the police into secret kennels for three years, during which various legal
appeals took place at the Crown Court, the High Court and even the House of Lords. The case was
extensively reported by the British and international media, and even taken up by actress-turned-animal
rights campaigner Brigitte Bardot, who offered Dempsey sanctuary in France to escape British injustice.

The case was finally dismissed in November 1995 on a legal technicality, namely that Dempsey's owner
— who had not been involved in the original incident and bizarrely was not told about it until long
afterwards — did not know about the first court case in advance. Dempsey was reprieved, and went on
to live to the age of 17.

                                   The statue of Hachiko is a favorite meeting spot in Tokyo.




                                   Statue of Hachiko in Shibuya

Hachikō, sometimes known in Japanese as 忠犬ハチ公 (chūken hachikō, lit. 'faithful dog Hachiko'),
was an Akita dog born in November, 1923, in the city of Odate, Akita Prefecture. In 1924 he was
brought to Tokyo by his owner, Eisaburo Ueno, a professor in the agriculture department at the
University of Tokyo. During his owner's life, Hachiko saw him off from the front door and greeted him
at the end of the day at the nearby Shibuya Station. Even after Ueno's death in May, 1925, Hachiko
returned every day to the station to wait for him, and did so for the next eleven years.
Affection between the professor and the dog was immediate. The professor named the pup "Hachi" and
added "ko", a common term of endearment. For his part, Hachi-ko accompanied the professor
everywhere he could. As he grew, Hachi-ko took on the traditional traits of an Akita; his ears stood
upright, and his tail curled up and to the left. Professor Ueno reportedly took great pride in owning a
purebred dog of a breed that had a history going back thirty centuries -- especially as the number of
purebred Akitas in Japan was dwindling at the time.

When the professor died, Mrs. Ueno closed the house and moved, giving Hachiko to some of her
husband's relatives who lived several miles from the station. The Akita refused to stay with them. As
soon as he was let out, he trotted back first to his old house, then to the train station to await his master.
Professor Ueno's gardener, Kikuzaburo Kobayashi, lived close to the station and took over Hachiko's
care.

Hachiko's devotion to his lost master moved those around him, who nicknamed him "faithful dog,"
though some speculate that he kept returning because of the handouts he received from street vendors
(upon his death, an autopsy revealed remnants of what were apparently yakitori skewers in his stomach).

In the first years of his vigil, Hachiko was treated as little more than a tolerable nuisance at the train
station. In 1928, a new station master came to Shibuya Station. He quickly grew very fond of him and
allowed him free run of the facility. Hachiko still kept his schedule, but also was allowed to remain in
the station throughout the day, sleeping in a storeroom set aside for him by the new station master.

That same year, another of Professor Ueno's former students (who had become something of an expert
on Akitas), saw the dog at the station and followed him to the Kobayashi home where he learned the
history of Hachiko's life. Shortly after this meeting, the former student published a documented census
of Akitas in Japan. His research found only thirty purebred Akitas remaining, including Hachiko from
the Shibuya station.

Professor Ueno's former student returned frequently to visit the dog and over the years published several
articles about Hachiko's remarkable loyalty. In 1932 one of these articles, published in Tokyo's largest
newspaper, threw the dog into the national spotlight. Hachiko became a sensation throughout the land.
His faithfulness to his master's memory impressed the people of Japan as a spirit of family loyalty all
should strive to achieve (or rather as propaganda for the government; Japan was at war with China at
that time). Teachers and parents used Hachiko's vigil as an example for children to follow. A well-
known Japanese artist rendered a sculpture of the dog, and throughout the country a new awareness of
the Akita breed grew.

In April, 1934, a bronze statue in his likeness was erected at Shibuya Station, and Hachiko himself was
present at its unveiling. The statue was recycled for the war effort during World War II. After the war,
Hachiko was hardly forgotten. In 1948 The Society For Recreating The Hachiko Statue commissioned
Ando Tekeshi, son of the original artist who had since passed away, to make a second statue. The new
statue was erected in August, 1947, which still stands and is an extremely popular meeting spot. A
similar statue stands in Hachiko's hometown, in front of Odate Station.

Hachiko died in March 1935 of filariasis. His stuffed and mounted remains are kept at the National
Science Museum in Ueno, Tokyo.

Hachiko was the subject of the 1987 movie Hachiko Monogatari.

The story may also have influenced the Futurama episode Jurassic Bark.

                                                 Laika
                                                                                 Back | Home | Up | Next




                                                      Laika, shown here in a harness, died from stress
and overheating several hours after being launched into space.

Laika (from Russian: Лайка, "Barker") was one of the Russian space dogs and the first living creature
to enter orbit. She was launched into space on Sputnik 2, a Soviet spacecraft, on November 3, 1957.
Like many other animals in space, she died during the mission, though earlier than intended.

She was found as a stray wandering the streets of Moscow, a mongrel female weighing approximately 6
kg (13 lb) and about 3 years old. "Laika" is in fact the Russian name for several breeds of dogs similar to
the husky. Her name was changed from Kudryavka (Russian for "Little Curly"), and she was also
nicknamed Zhuchka ("Little Bug") and Limonchik ("Little Lemon"). The American press dubbed her
Muttnik (mutt + suffix "-nik"). Her true ancestry can never be known, although it is generally accepted
that she was part husky or other Nordic breed, and possibly part terrier.

Laika died a few hours after launch from stress and overheating. Her true cause of death was not made
public until decades after the flight, with officials stating that she was either euthanized by poisoned
food or died when the oxygen ran out. Russian officials have since expressed regret for allowing Laika
to die.

Although Laika did not survive the trip, the experiment proved that a living passenger could survive
being launched into orbit and endure weightlessness. It paved the way for human spaceflight, and
provided scientists with some of the first data on how living organisms react to spaceflight environments.
Sputnik 2




                                      A model of Sputnik 2, Laika's space vehicle.

After the success of Sputnik 1, Nikita Khrushchev, the Soviet leader, wanted a second spacecraft
launched on November 7, the 40th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution. There was a much more
sophisticated satellite already under construction, but it would not be ready until December. This
satellite would later become Sputnik 3.

In order to meet the November deadline, a new, less sophisticated design had to be built. According to
Russian sources, the official decision to launch Sputnik 2 was made on October 10 or 12, leaving the
team only 4 weeks to design and build the space craft. Sputnik 2, therefore, was something of a rushed
job, with most elements of the space craft being constructed from rough sketches. Aside from the
primary mission of sending a living passenger into space, Sputnik 2 also contained instrumentation for
measuring solar radiation and cosmic rays.

After reaching orbit the nose cone was jettisoned successfully but the "Blok A" core did not separate as
planned, preventing the thermal control system from operating correctly. Some of the thermal insulation
also tore loose. Consequently, the temperature in the cabin rose to 40 °C (104°F).

Laika's voyage
The Soviet Union and the United States had previously sent animals only on sub-orbital flights. Three
dogs were trained for the Sputnik 2 flight: Albina, Mushka and Laika. Laika was selected and trained by
the Russian space-life scientist Oleg Gazenko. Albina flew twice on a high-altitude test rocket while
Mushka was used to test instrumentation and life support. To adapt the dogs to the confines of the tiny
cabin of Sputnik 2, they were kept in progressively smaller cages for periods up to 15 to 20 days. The
extensive close confinement caused them to stop urinating or defecating, making them restless, and
causing their general condition to deteriorate. Laxatives did not improve their condition, only long
periods of training could. They were also placed in centrifuges that simulated the acceleration of a rocket
launch and placed in simulators that simulated the noises of the spacecraft. This would cause their pulses
to double and their blood pressure to increase by 30–65 torr. The dogs were trained to eat a special high-
nutrition gel that would be their food in space.




                                                   Laika could stand or lie down in her padded space
capsule.

According to a NASA document, Laika was placed in the satellite on October 31, 1957—three days
before the start of the mission.[1] The temperatures at the launch site were extremely cold at that time of
year, so a hose connected to an air conditioner was used to keep her container warm. Two assistants
were assigned to keep a constant watch on Laika before launch. Just prior to launch on November 3,
1957 from Baikonur Cosmodrome, Laika's fur was sponged in a weak alcohol solution, and then
carefully groomed. Iodine was painted onto areas where sensors would be placed to monitor her bodily
functions.

The pressurized cabin on Sputnik 2 allowed enough room for her to lie down or stand and was padded.
An air regeneration system provided oxygen, and a cooling fan was set to activate whenever cabin
temperature exceeded 15°C. Food and water were dispensed in a gelatinised form. Laika was fitted with
a harness, a bag to collect waste, and electrodes to monitor vital signs. The early telemetry indicated
Laika was agitated but eating her food.

The sensors showed that during launch, her pulse rate rose to three times its resting level. After reaching
weightlessness, her pulse rate decreased, but it took three times longer than it had during earlier ground
tests, an indication of stress. Approximately five to seven hours into the flight, no further life signs were
received from the spacecraft.

It had been planned that Laika would be euthanized with a poisoned serving of food after 10 days. For
many years, the Soviet Union gave conflicting statements that she had either died from oxygen
starvation when the batteries failed, or that she had been euthanized. There were many rumours
circulated about the exact manner of her passing. In 1999, several Russian sources said that she died
after four days when the cabin overheated. In October 2002, it was revealed by Dr. Dimitri
Malashenkov, one of the scientists behind the Sputnik 2 mission, that Laika had died between five and
seven hours after launch, from overheating and stress. According to a paper he presented to the World
Space Congress in Houston, Texas, "It was practically impossible to create a reliable system of a
temperature control in such small [sic] term".[2] Sputnik 2 was finally destroyed during reentry on April
14, 1958, after 2,570 orbits.

Controversy
Sputnik 2 was not designed to be retrievable, so Laika was doomed to die from the beginning. It sparked
a debate across the globe on the mistreatment of animals and animal testing to advance science. The
mission was viewed by many, including some Soviet citizens, as a propaganda stunt.

In the United Kingdom, the National Canine Defence League called on all dog owners to observe a
minute's silence, while the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) received
protests even before the Soviet Union had finished announcing the mission's success. Animal rights
groups at the time called on members of the public to protest at Soviet embassies.

However, these protests were politically motivated, at least in part. In the Soviet Union, there was no
controversy, as the Soviet people perceived exploits and personal sacrifices as normal and neither the
media, nor books in the following years, nor the public questioned the decision to send the dog into
space to ultimately die. However, in 1998, Oleg Gazenko, one of the leading scientists responsible for
sending Laika into space, did express regret for allowing her to die: "The more time passes, the more I
am sorry about it. We did not learn enough from the mission to justify the death of the dog." [3]


Laika in Popular Culture
                                    NASA named this soil target on Mars after Laika during the Mars
Exploration Rover mission

Laika's pioneering journey made her one of the most famous dogs in the world. A plaque
commemorating fallen cosmonauts was unveiled at the Institute for Aviation and Space Medicine in Star
City, Moscow in November 1997, and in one corner of the plaque there is an image of Laika. She has
been pictured on several postage stamps in different countries around the world. Brands of chocolate and
cigarettes were named in her honour as well as a large collection of memorabilia that continues to be
sold at auctions today.

On March 9, 2005 a patch of soil on Mars was unofficially named "Laika" by mission controllers, it is
located near Vostok Crater in Meridiani Planum. It was examined by the Mars Exploration Rover
Opportunity's microscopic imager on Sol 400.

Literature

Sputnik Sweetheart by Haruki Murakami references Laika both in the title and several times throughout
the novel.
Star Wreck 7: The Fido Frontier by Leah Rowlinski is a Star Trek parody in which it is discovered that
Laika survived and made alien allies.
The Doctor Who novel Alien Bodies by Lawrence Miles tells of Laika's funeral on the planet Quiescia.
The novel Habitus by James Flint features Laika as one of its protagonists, based on the premise that she
survives and continues to orbit the earth, having learned to draw sustenance from the world's radio
transmissions.
The novel Intervention by Julian May mentions Laika's rescue by a sympathetic alien race called the
Simbiari.

Music

Domenico Modugno's Volare - later remade by the Gipsy Kings, among other bands - is centered around
Laika's exploits.
A number of bands have taken inspiration from Laika for their names, including Laika Dog, Laika and
the Cosmonauts and the eponymous Laika, whose four albums all feature the canine cosmonaut in their
cover art.
The Spanish pop group Mecano wrote a biographical song titled "Laika" on their 1987 album Descanso
Dominical.
The band Moxy Früvous wrote a song titled "Laika" on their 1993 album Bargainville.
The Swedish band The Cardigans included a song titled "Laika" on their 1994 EP Sick and Tired.
Another Swedish band, Blipp!, has a song called "Laika" on their 2005 album Impulser.
The 1996 CCCP release "Cosmos," an album of mostly paeans to the Soviet space program, featured the
song "Laika Laika," complete with Russian military men's chorus.
The Japanese singer Akino Arai wrote a song called "Sputnik" on her 2000 album "Furu
Platinum" (Raining Platinum) about Laika. The song also seems to confuse Laika with Kloka, a Russian
space dog that was invented by the Spanish artist Joan Fontcuberta.
The Reggae dub group Spacemonkeyz in 2002 released an album entitled Laika Come Home, an album
of remixes of the music performed by Damon Albarn's Gorillaz.
Norwegian singer/songwriter Åge Aleksandersen released the album Laika in 1991, with the dog being
remembered in the title track. The album flopped.
The Divine Comedy's 2004 album Absent Friends mourns Laika in the title track, and features an
instrumental "Laika's Theme".
The Arcade Fire wrote a song called "Neighbourhood #2 (Laika)" on their debut LP, Funeral, in 2004.
Laika and the Cosmonauts is a Finnish pop band that has gained some national fame.
The band Polaris dedicated their album Music from the Adventures of Pete & Pete to Laika and Ham the
Chimp.

Cinema and TV

In the 1985 Swedish film My Life as a Dog (Mitt liv som hund) [4], the protagonist - a contemporary
boy who feels powerless over his own fate - poignantly compares himself to Laika. The movie was
nominated for an Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay in 1989.
The Lost In Space episode One of our Dogs is Missing involves a dog coming out of a crashed
spaceship; Judy confirms with Maureen that early ships did take up dogs (not mentioning Laika by
name), but the origin of this dog is almost as unbelievable as the fact that it never appeared after the
episode.

Lassie, a Rough Collie, is "the world's most famous dog" and a fictional character who has starred in
many movies, TV shows, and books over the years.

The character of Lassie was created by British-American author Eric Knight in Lassie Come-Home,
published as a short story in the Saturday Evening Post in 1938 and as a novel in 1940. In Knight's story,
a young Yorkshire boy owns an exceptionally beautiful and loyal collie, but when the family faces
severe economic hardship, the dog is sold to a wealthy nobleman. Both boy and dog grieve over the
separation, made worse when the new owner transports Lassie hundreds of miles away to his estate in
Scotland. However, the collie's instinct and courage cause her to escape, and the book follows Lassie's
desperate efforts to return to the boy she loves.

In 1943 the book was made into what would become the first Lassie movie, also titled Lassie Come
Home (no hyphen), which generally followed the plot of the book. Roddy McDowall starred. Since then,
there have been numerous sequels, television series and spin-offs.

The dog was so popular that it is one of only three dogs awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame,
the others being Rin Tin Tin and Strongheart.

On the 1954-1974 television series Lassie, she had a series of owners, the first two being Jeff (Tommy
Rettig) (reruns of this era were later syndicated as Jeff's Collie) and Timmy (Jon Provost). Both were
farm boys frequently helped out of scrapes by their super-intelligent dog. June Lockhart, who had
previously appeared in Son of Lassie, took over the role of Timmy's mother from Cloris Leachman.
Ranger Corey came later and, near the end of the series, Lassie struck out on her own, with no regular
human master.

The first dog to play the role of Lassie was Pal, owned by animal trainer Rudd Weatherwax and his
brother Frank Weatherwax. Before Pal's death, he was bred with a number of bitches, resulting in
hundreds of offspring, several of which have performed under the name Lassie. Most have been male,
because their coats are usually fuller and more impressive than for the bitches. Because the males tend to
be larger, they are considered more physically suitable to perform many of Lassie's stunts. As is usually
the case with canine film stars, several uncredited doubles have been employed in the films and TV
shows. Director-screenwriter Charles Sturridge has been attached to a film based on Knight's novel,
planned for a 2006 release. Rudd Weatherwax died in 1985, and his son, Bob Weatherwax, has been
handling the Lassie star collies in the years since then.
Currently, the "official" Lassie is used mainly for "celebrity appearances" at dog shows. The Lassie
theme song, "Whistle," was written by Les Baxter.

                                     Dangerous Dogs Act 1991
                                                                                        Back | Home | Up | Next


The Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 is a piece of UK legislation that was introduced in response to various
incidents of serious injury or death resulting from attacks by aggressive and uncontrolled dogs,
particularly on children. These incidents received heavy tabloid attention, causing widespread public
concern over the keeping of "dangerous" dogs and a resulting legislative backlash.

Four breeds in particular were targeted by the Act:

     ●   Pit Bull Terriers - note that 'pit bull' refers to several different breeds, and is not a breed in and of
         itself
     ●   Tosa
     ●   Dogo Argentino
     ●   Fila Brasileiro

It was made illegal to own any of these dogs without specific exemption from a court. The dogs have to
be muzzled and kept on a lead in public and they must be registered and insured, and receive microchip
implants. Although the Act was also supposed to ban the breeding, sale and exchange of these dogs, it is
questionable how effective it has been.

There have been several test cases of the Act, most famously Dempsey (a pit bull terrier) who in 1995
was finally reprieved from a death sentence, to widespread media attention. The definition of the word
"type" in the legislation was of particular controversy, as did the lack of discretion the Act gives
magistrates.

In November 2002, The Princess Royal was fined £500 under the Act after one of her Bull Terriers
attacked two children. Another of her terriers later fatally injured one of the Queen's corgis, and in a
separate incident bit one of the Royal staff.

The Act is commonly suggested as a piece of rushed and mistaken legislation brought in to appease
short-term fears without real need; the Royal Marriages Act 1772 was refered to as "the Dangerous Dogs
Act of its day" in a Private Member's Bill in the Lords.

Other countries also have laws pertaining to dangerous dogs. These vary in severity. In some
jurisdictions in Australia dogs which have been declared dangerous are required to wear a collar of red
and yellow stripes; under the harsh legislation of some municipalities of Queensland, such dogs are
seized and put down.

The Afghan Hound is a very old sighthound dog breed. Distinguished by its thick, fine, silky coat and
its tail with a ring curl at the end, the breed acquired its unique features in the cold mountains of
Afghanistan, where it was originally used to hunt wolves, foxes, and gazelles.

Appearance




                            Afghan with reddish coat

The Afghan Hound is high-stationed, standing 24 to 28 inches (61-71 cm) in height and weighing 45 to
60 pounds (23-28 kg). The coat may be any colour, but white markings, particularly on the head, are
discouraged; many individuals have a black facial mask. However all Afghan Hounds have a white
"blaze" on the chest. Some are almost white, but particolor hounds (white with islands of red or black)
are not acceptable and may indicate impure breeding. The long, fine-textured coat requires considerable
care and grooming. The long topknot and the shorter-haired saddle on the back in the mature dog are
distinctive features of the Afghan Hound coat. The high hipbones and unique small ring on the end of
the tail are also characteristics of the breed.

Temperament
The temperament of the Afghan Hound is aloof and dignified, but happy and clownish when playing.
The breed has the reputation of being the least intelligent dog breed, though this is not necessarily true.
The Afghan Hound has many cat-like tendencies and is not slavish in its obedience as are some other
breeds. The Afghan hound has a leaning towards independence. Owners should not be surprised if their
Afghan hounds sometimes chooses to ignore commands. Although seldom used today for hunting in
Europe and America where they are popular, Afghans are frequent participants in lure coursing events
and are popular as show dogs.
Health
Afghans are a relatively healthy breed; major health issues are allergies, and cancer. Sensitivity to
anaesthesia is an issue the Afghan hound shares with the rest of the sighthound group, as sighthounds
have relatively low levels of body fat.

Afghan hounds as a whole are a fairly long-lived breed, often living 13-14 years.

History
The breed was always thought to date back at least to the pre-Christian era, and recent discoveries by
researchers studying ancient DNA have revealed that the Afghan Hound is in fact one of the most
ancient dog breeds, dating back for many thousands of years. Its original native name, Tazi, betrays its
connection to the very similar Tasy breed of Russia. The proximity of southern Russia and Afghanistan
argue for a common origin for both breeds.

Initially, Afghani people refused to sell their national dog to outsiders; the breed was not seen in Europe
and America until after the turn of the 20th century. AKC and CKC did not recognise the Afghan Hound
until the 1930s.

On August 3, 2005, Korean scientist Hwang Woo-Suk announced that his team of researchers had
become the first team to successfully clone a dog. The dog, an Afghan Hound, was named Snuppy. Later
that year, a pattern of lies and fraud by Hwang Woo-Suk came to light, throwing in doubt all his claims.
Snuppy, nonetheless, was a genuine clone, and thus the first cloned dog in history. ("The panel found
that Hwang's claims last year to have created the world's first cloned dog, however, were genuine.")

                         Notes
Many AKC registered ASTs can also be registered with the
                   UKC as APBTs.
The American Pit Bull Terrier (APBT) is a breed of dog in the terrier group, one of several breeds
loosely classified as pit bulls. These dogs are known for their strength, loyalty, and “gameness,” or
tenacity.

Many young owners purchase them on the grounds of wanting a 'tough dog', which often ends up
maltrained and in poor health. Due to bad publicity caused by these irresponsible owners, people
unfamilar with the dogs often consider them a scary dog and may even avoid walking near them.
However, it is widely acknowledged that the problems that people associate with the breed, mainly
aggression, are most likely due to many people having bred them specifically for fighting, having abused
them, or both.

Appearance
The APBT is the midsized breed of the three generally referred to as pit bulls (see also American
Staffordshire Terrier (AST) and Staffordshire Bull Terrier (SBT)). Males should weigh 35 to 65 pounds
(16 to 29 kg), females 30 to 60 pounds (16 to 27 kg), with height being proportional. The coat is short,
single layered, and stiff but glossy. Any color is accepted and dogs may either have patches or be solid.
All eye colors are accepted except blue. Ears are rose or semipricked, and may be cropped, although
uncropped is preferred. The tail is short and tapering. The body is solidly built and muscular, with a
wide chest. The head is wedge shaped with some slight forehead wrinkles.

Confusion among Pit Bull breeds

The three “pit bull” breeds all have nearly identical standards, with only the acceptable sizes and colors
varying. Also, the AST and the APBT have the same heritage. Many people still consider them to be
simply different types of the same breed. Dogs registered with the AKC as an AST are often dual
registered with the UKC as an APBT. Adding to the muddle is the fact that many people refer to any dog
of these breeds, as well as American Bulldogs, as “pit bulls.”


Temperament and/or characteristics




                                 APBT (fawn)
APBTs can be very sweet, curious, and clownish. As typical with many in the terrier family, they can
also be stubborn and pushy. They are noted for their outgoing, affectionate, and playful disposition and
their fondness for people, even children, and can make a wonderful family pet. The American
Temperament Test Society, Inc. breed statistics as of December 2004 show an 83.4% passing rate for the
APBT as compared to an 81% overall pass rate. However, a firm, even hand and early obedience
training are musts for this breed. They are strong dogs for their size and will walk their owners rather
than the other way around when on lead and so absolutely must be taught to heel from a young age.
APBTs often display some level of dog aggression, especially towards dogs of the same sex or level of
assertiveness; because APBT's do not reach maturity until late (at about 2 1/2 years) these tendencies
may not always be readily apparent. However, with early socialization and knowing each individual
dog's limits, their aggression towards other dogs can be quite easily controlled. (Unbridled aggression
towards man is actually a serious and perilous fault.) APBTs are extremely attached to their owners and
families and are known for their eagerness to please their masters; once they understand their master's
wishes they will do their best to obey. However, inexperienced owners tend to find them to be too much
to handle—they are the Tigger of the dog world. Pit bulls typically have a lot of physical and mental
energy to expend; they need exercise and stimulation or else they may find a way to occupy themselves.
As a breed they are fairly bright.

It is paramount to find a breeder who selects puppies for their good temperament and not for their
aggression. Also research the breeder, ask for references and ask to see their facilities and other dogs
they have raised. It is also a good practice for dogs to receive microchip implants where possible as this
breed is often stolen in and near urban areas for ill uses. If a breeder is not readily accessible, there are
many rescue organizations that do specialize in pit bulls and most of them do test the temperament of the
individual dog.

As athletic dogs, American Pit Bull Terriers excel in many activities, including weight pulling, search
and rescue, dog agility trials, and in the Southern United States have even been used for hunting as catch
dogs. They do well in some advanced obedience training. In America they have been also used as police
dogs for patrol duty and scent dogs because of their tenacity, high energy drive, and versatility. In the
home, their favorite place is wherever the family is; they can do nicely in a family with children and can
easily handle a small child tugging on its ear and tail or an older child's horseplay.

History
When bullbaiting became illegal in England in 1835, clandestine and public matches between dogs filled
the void. Originally pure bulldogs were used, however, it was soon realized that crossings bulldogs to
terriers created a finer product for fighting. While the bulldog was powerful and courageous he lacked
the lytheness and agility of the terrier. Furthermore, bulldogs, whose history was in droving and catching
bulls, was not designed for killing the bulls and bears it baited. While the death of either animal was not
considered unfortunate, the purpose was not specifically to kill the beast. Terriers, however, had always
been bred for exterminating vermin. This trait was enhanced by breeders for the rat pits (which were
also very popular at that time in England). By combining the terrier's killer instinct, a gamier and more
focused, albeit smaller dog emerged. The two terriers that were most sought after were the now extinct
English White Terrier and English Black-and-Tan Terrier.

The bull-and-terrier cross was know by many names and was a generic cross rather than a specific
breed. The breeding scheme was most popular in Staffordshire, England, among the miners of that
county. Today that name Staffordshire Terrier and Staffordshire Bullterrier have stuck with two Bull-
terrier breeds. In actuality, all Bull-terrier breeds are progeny of the dogs bred in that region. The bull-
and-terrier became popular throughout the British Isles with regional dogs emerging. One of the most
famous strains emerged in south western Ireland, in counties Cork and Kerry. A particularly game and
spirited bull-and-terrier whose lineage was a protected secret by local dog-men became notable for its
red coat, golden eyes and red nose. Commonly called Old Family Red's, this was one of the most
successful strains to be introduced into America. Even before his introduction to America, the American
Pit Bull Terrier was being desgined in England and Ireland, but took off in the port cities of his new
homeland when that country entered into the peak of its industrial might.

When bred for fighting, the breeder would look for strength, gameness, and lack of aggression towards
people. Any fighting dog that showed aggression towards its owner or handler would be killed on the
spot. This created a line of strong dogs that, while being dog aggressive, would not turn on their owners.
In the late 1800s to early 1900s, two clubs were formed for the specific purpose of registering APBTs:
the United Kennel Club and the American Dog Breeder's Association. After dog fighting was made
illegal in the United States, many dog owners wanted to legitimize the breed and distance it from its
fighting roots. The name "Staffordshire Terrier" was adopted by some owners and was recognized by the
American Kennel Club in 1936. Later, the word "American" was added to reduce confusion with its
smaller cousin, the Staffordshire Bull Terrier. Not all breeders, however, agreed with the standard
adopted by the AKC, and continued to use the name APBT for their lines. Much confusion still remains
in regard to the APBT, the AST, and the SBT.

Once an extremely popular family dog in the United States, the American Pit Bull Terrier's popularity
began to decline in the United States following World War II in favor of other breeds. Though still by
far largely found in homes with families, it has come under fire in the past thirty years for its association
with inner city crime and drugs; many people of ill repute mistakenly breed this dog for its fighting
heritage and exploit its incredible willingness to please its master (when not refusing to give up its spot
on a soft bed.) However, it is of note that this breed is also often the most common target of abuse in
urban areas. Outside of dog fighting and guarding a drug dealer's property, the APBT is often beaten,
starved, burned, tortured, and generally mistreated to make it particularly aggressive. After the owner no
longer has any use for the dog (that is, after it loses a fight or refuses to fight,), the dog is left for dead or
turned loose to find its way into animal control services, where it most likely will need to be destroyed
because nobody wants it because of its horrendous reputation. (A large percentage of dogs destroyed in
New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles are pit bull type breeds.)

In jurisdictions where breed-specific legislation threatens ownership of Pit Bulls, owners are often
advised by their peers to refer to their Pit Bulls and Pit bull crosses as 'Staffys' or 'Amstaffs', which are
generally exempt from such regulations. Purists among American Staffordshire owners find this
unethical, and resent it, perhaps fearing that the ultimate result of the subterfuge will be restrictions on
their breed as well.

In the United Kingdom, the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 prohibits the sale or breeding of "any dog of the
type known as pit bull terrier". Some jurisdictions in the Australian states of Queensland, New South
Wales, the Canadian province of Ontario, and some areas of the United States have similar breed-
specific legislation.

                           Notes
The Golden Retriever is a relatively modern and very popular breed of dog. It was developed as a
retrieving dog to use while hunting wild fowl. Today it is one of the most common family dogs as it is
easy to handle, very tolerant and does not require very much of the owners, other than regular exercise,
food and veterinary check-ups. It is often affectionately known as a Golden, or Goldie. What makes the
Golden unique is its pleasing personality. This breed gets along well with people and other dogs,
however after the seclusion from dog life it may develop human qualities and then may not be fond of
other dogs. It will bark when startled but other than that it makes a poor watchdog due to its friendly
nature. It is also easily trained because of the natural drive to please the master. This is a dog who wants
only to be with people and is happy in the presence of people without being annoying or demanding.

Appearance




                            Color ranges from nearly blonde to this dark golden coat.

The Golden Retriever reaches its full height at about one year of age, and its full weight at about two.
While it matures physically at about two years' age, mentally it does not fully mature until three or older,
and many owners comment that their dogs retain their puppyish nature for life.

This is a large breed which in appearance is similar in size, general shape, and color to the yellow
Labrador Retriever, especially when young and for those Goldens with lighter coats. The most obvious
difference is the Golden Retriever's luxuriant coat. To confuse the two breeds is a serious faux pas to a
fancier of either, of course.

Coat

The AKC standard states that the coat is a "rich, lustrous golden of various shades", disallowing coats
that are extremely light or extremely dark. This leaves the outer ranges of coat color up to a judge's
discretion when competing in dog shows.


Temperament
                                  Most Goldens enjoy active entertainment, such as dog agility.

Goldies are active and fun-loving but also exceptionally patient, as befits a dog bred to sit quietly for
hours in a hunting blind. Other characteristics related to their hunting heritage is a size suited for
scrambling in and out of boats and an inordinate love for cool water.

Like the Labrador Retriever, they are noted for their intelligence, their affection for people, and their
tolerance of children. They are natural clowns, which characterizes them as great dogs to use in hospitals
or retirement homes. Golden Retrievers make great pets for young children due to their nurturing
instincts and gentle nature. The other side of this is that they require lots of companionship to be happy.
They do well in obedience trials and make excellent guide dogs, however, like people, not all of these
dogs are this way. While they might not do quite as well in field trials as Labrador Retrievers, they are
excellent hunters that are famous for their outstanding scenting abilities. They are exceptionally eager to
please their owners.

Obviously, the Golden Retriever loves to retrieve. Retrieving a thrown stick, tennis ball, or frisbee can
keep a Golden occupied and entertained for hours, particularly if there is also water involved.

Today's Golden Retrievers fall into two groups: show dogs and field dogs. The Goldens in the show
group are generally bigger boned, longer, and heavier. The champagne color and long flowing coat are
highly prized in the show ring. On the other hand, field Goldens tend to be smaller, longer legged, and
be redder golden. These two strains derive from famous goldens from the 1960s. Gold Rush Charlie
moved the show Goldens toward their present characteristics, while Holway Barty greatly affected the
field group. Presently, many breeders are attempting to unite these two strains into the all-Purpose
Golden Retriever.

History
The breed was originally developed in Scotland, at "Guichan", near Glen Afric, the highland estate of
Sir Dudley Majoribanks (pronounced "Marchbanks"), later Lord Tweedmouth. For many years, there
was controversy over which breeds were originally crossed; especially popular was a romantic story
concerning the purchase of a whole troupe of Russian sheepdogs from a visiting circus. In 1952, the
publication of Majoribanks' breeding records from 1835 to 1890 removed all doubt.




                                 A patient Golden showing the breed's broad face and wide muzzle.

The original cross was of a yellow-coloured dog, Nous, with a Tweed Water Spaniel bitch, Belle. The
Tweed Water Spaniel is now extinct but was then common in the border country. Majoribanks had
purchased Nous on 1865 from an unregistered litter of otherwise black wavy-coated Retriever pups. In
1868, this cross produced a litter that included four bitch pups. These four became the basis of a
breeding program which included Red Setter, sandy-coloured Bloodhound, St. John's Water Dog of
Newfoundland, Springer Spaniel, and two more wavy-coated black Retrievers. The bloodline was also
inbred and selected for trueness to Majoribanks' idea of the ultimate hunting dog. This vision included a
more vigorous and powerful dog than previous retrievers but that would still be exceptionally good with
people and thus gentle and trainable. Russian sheepdogs are not mentioned in these records, nor are any
other working dog breeds. The ancestry of the Golden Retriever is all sporting dogs, in line with
Majoribanks' goals.

Golden Retrievers were first accepted for registration by the Kennel Club of England in 1903, as 'Flat
Coats - Golden'. They were first exhibited in 1908, and in 1911 were recognised as a breed described as
'Retriever (Golden and Yellow)'. In 1913, the Golden Retriever Club was founded. The breed name was
officially changed to Golden Retriever in 1920.

The Hon. Archie Majoribanks took a Golden Retriever to Canada in 1881, and registered Lady with the
American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1894. These are the first records of the breed in these two countries.
The breed was first registered in Canada in 1927, and the Golden Retriever Club of Ontario, now the
Golden Retriever Club of Canada, was formed in 1958.

The AKC recognized the breed in 1932, and in 1938 the Golden Retriever Club of America was formed.

Rescue efforts

The breed's prominence and prevalence has produced high demand for purebred Golden Retrievers. As
an unfortunate consequence, many Goldens are abandoned each year by owners who can no longer care
for them. These dogs, many of which are old or in need of medical support, arrive in animal shelters.
Puppy mills, large-scale commercial breeding operations sometimes shut down for their notoriously
poor conditions, are another source of orphan Golden Retrievers.

In response, many volunteer organizations work to rescue, care for, and adopt abandoned Golden
Retrievers. These rescue groups usually accept dogs from owners and establish agreements with local
animal shelters to ensure that dogs will be transferred to their care rather than euthanized. Once rescued,
Golden Retrievers are placed in foster homes until a permanent home is found. It is common for rescue
groups to screen prospective adopters to ensure that they are capable of providing a good home for the
dog.

Golden retriever rescue groups have relied heavily on the world wide web to raise funds and advertise
rescued goldens to adopters. In 1996, breed enthusiast and rescue pioneer Helen Redlus founded Golden
Retrievers in Cyberspace, a website that sold merchandise to fund rescue operations. Many local groups
continue in this tradition, and rescue organizations can be found in most regions of the United States and
throughout the world.

Scottish Terriers are a breed of dog best known for their distinctive profile and their die-hard spirit.


Appearance
A Scottish Terrier, or Scottie, is a small but resilient terrier. Scotties are fast and have a muscular body,
often appearing to be barrel chested. Its traditional grooming is shaggy-to-the-ground. The usual coat
color ranges from dark gray to jet black. Scotties with Wheaten (straw to nearly white) coats sometimes
occur, but should not be confused with the Wheaten Terrier or West Highland White Terrier.


History
They were originally bred in Scotland (their first name was the Aberdeen Terrier) about 1700, but had
achieved their final size and shape by 1890. Scotties are natural "diggers", like other terriers, whose
name derives from the same root as "terre", French for "earth". Their nickname is "little diehard" from
James III of England, the King descended from the Scottish line.

Famous Scotties

         family.
     ●   Fala, pet of F.D.R.
     ●   A Scottie is also one the playing pieces in the board game, Monopoly (game)
     ●   Jock from Disney's Lady and the Tramp

                             Notes



The Bull Terrier is a breed of dog in the terrier family.


Appearance
Bull Terriers are thick-set and muscular with a short, dense coat. Acceptable colours are pure white (a
dog that is mostly white must be disqualified in the show ring, although dark markings on the head only
are permissible) and coloured, which is any colour other than white or any colour with white markings.
The AKC specifies that if all other things are equal, the brindle coat is preferred.

This terrier's most distinctive feature is its head, described as 'egg shaped' when viewed from the front,
almost flat at the top, with a Roman muzzle sloping evenly down to the end of the nose with no stop.
The unique triangular eyes are small, dark, and closely set. The body is full and round, while the
shoulders are robust and muscular and the tail is carried horizontally. It walks with a jaunty gait, and is
popularly known as the 'gladiator of the canine race'.

Temperament
Typically the Bull Terrier is an active, interesting, playful, and clownish breed. It can also become very
attached to certain family members. The breed is usually amenable for obedience training but can be
stubborn and hard to train. If raised in a stable environment, the Bull Terrier will become a well rounded
dog, but correct upbringing is essential with this breed, as their stubborness needs to be kept under
control, and any aggressiveness must be dealt with as early as possible to prevent future problems. Bull
Terriers are very focused on their goals, and will do anything to get what they want. Be sure to keep
unsafe items out of their reach, as they can choke, and make sure foods stay out of their reach, or they
will quite happily eat as much as they can. Bull Terriers can also jump a fair height, and are quite
curious creatures, so be sure to make your house secure. They also need a lot of mental stimulation, and
they enjoy games such as tugging and fetching, although they may be reluctant to bring back the toy!
Health
Bull Terriers are generally free of disabling genetic diseases. All puppies should be checked for
deafness, as this sometimes occurs (most commonly in pure white dogs) and is difficult to notice,
especially in a relatively young puppy. A common problem to many Bull Terriers is a tendency to
develop skin allergies. Insect bites, such as fleas, and sometimes mosquitoes and mites, can produce a
generalized allergic response of hives, rash, and itching. This condition can be stopped by keeping the
dog free of contact from these insects, but this is definitely a consideration in climates or circumstances
where exposure to these insects is inevitable. Their lifespan is somewhere between 11 and 14 years. The
Bullterrier's coat is easy to maintain, but grooming can keep it is near perfect conditions. Adding oils to
their meals can also vastly improve the quality of their coat. The Bull Terrier requires a fair amount of
exercise, but overworking the dog at a young age will cause strained muscles. Older dogs do require
exercise, but in small doses, whereas younger ones will be happy to play for hours on end. The breed is
reknown for being extremely greedy; be sure to maintain a good balance of exercise and food, or the dog
can become overweight. Also, be sure to check ears, eyes, nose and mouth everyday for signs of
infection.

Although Bull Terriers will be happy to eat anything, it is best to feed them a homemade meal,
consisting of brown rice and pasta, fresh vegetables, eggs and a small amount of olive oil. Feeding the
dog a wholesome meal will greatly improve their appearance, and combined with exercise and a warm
bed, you will find yourself in the company of an extremely happy dog.

History




                                 Bull Terrier

The now extinct breeds Old English Bulldog and Old English Terrier were crossed to form a new breed
of dog called the Bull and Terrier. It is also known that Dalmation comes into their genetics, and this can
be seen by looking on the stomach area, where dark, spotted pigment can be seen on the skin. Around
1860, the Bull and Terrier breed split into two branches, the pure white Bull Terrier and the coloured
forms that lived on for another seventy years in the dog fighting pits until they finally were recognized
as a legitimate dog breed called the Staffordshire Bull Terrier.

Pedigrees of Bull Terriers date from the period during which the English Stud books were first written
(circa 1874-6). Although the breed was developed from fighting dogs, the Bull Terrier was intended to
be a showdog and companion.

Miscellaneous




                                   Rick Springfield's dog Ronnie, a bull terrier/Great Dane mix
appeared on several of his album covers.

    ●   Although the name causes confusion, Bull Terriers are not related to American Pit Bull Terriers.

    ●   There is also a miniature version of this breed; this distinct breed is officially known as the Bull
        Terrier (Miniature).

    ●   Bull Terriers feature in several movies, including "Oliver!", "The Incredible Journey", "Patton",
        and "Babe: Pig in the City".

    ●   Bull Terriers have also featured in television shows such as the 1970s television show "Baa Baa
        Black Sheep", in the opening credits of the British television show "Barking Mad", and in the
        short lived Fox series "Keen Eddie".

    ●   The Bull Terrier is the only recognized breed with triangular eyes.

    ●   The Bull Terrier is one of several breeds in which the dog (male) and bitch (female) must have
        distinctly different appearances.

                             Notes



The Chesapeake Bay Retriever is a breed of dog that was developed along the Chesapeake Bay to hunt
waterfowl under adverse weather and water conditions, often having to break ice during the course of
many strenuous multiple retrieves. The breed was used not only to retrieve the game, but also sat in the
boat and on the wagon when the game was taken to market in order to protect the load from theft. Thus,
the breed is very protective of its people and property. Many owners refer to this breed as "Chessies".

Appearance
Distinctive features include eyes that are very clear, of yellowish or amber hue, hindquarters as high or a
trifle higher than the shoulders, and a double coat that tends to wave on shoulders, neck, back and loins.
This "waterproof" coat feels slightly oily compared to other members of the same family. Three basic
colors are generally seen in the breed: brown, which includes all shades from a light cocoa (a silvered
brown) to a deep bittersweet chocolate color; sedge, which varies from a reddish yellow through a bright
red to chestnut shades; and deadgrass, which takes in all shades of deadgrass, varying from a faded tan
to a dull straw color. The breed standard states that white may also appear, but it must be limited to the
breast, belly, toes, or back of the feet.

Temperament
The Chesapeake is valued for its bright and happy disposition, intelligence, quiet good sense, and
affectionate protective nature. The breed is very loving and makes a wonderful companion.

Some Chessies become vocal while happy; while this can be mistaken for a growl it is only a sign of
happiness and not intended to create alarm. In addition, some dogs will 'smile' when happy by baring
their front teeth in a peculiar grin; again this is not a threat but a sign of joy.

The Chesapeake is natually dominant and, while usually won't start a fight over dominance, the breed
will defend his position as the alpha dog. For the casual pet owner, it is usually not a good idea to have
more than one Chesapeake because of dominance issues.

The Chesapeake tends to recognize only one person or family as master. All other people are considered
by the dog to be either equal or subordinate. In order to keep the dog from attempting to become the
alpha family member, the dog's master should regularly reinforce dominance over the dog by issuing a
command such as 'come' or 'sit' at a time when the dog would rather not do so.
The breed is very tolerant of pain, which makes it difficult to tell when they're injured. This trait also
makes Chessies tolerant of roughhousing from young children; when they have had enough they
typically move away rather than snap at or otherwise attempt to correct the child for their behavior.

Training
Training is a necessity with this breed. The trainer must exercise more patience than with most other
breeds as this breed is usually not willing to change its behaviour.

The Chesapeake Bay Retriever is a very intelligent breed and learns faster than most other breeds. Once
a Chesapeake learns what is expected, he will act accordingly from that point on. A Chesapeake is not
willing to break the rules and will attempt to enforce the same rules on subordinate dogs.

During training, if a Chesapeake is asked to perform something that he believes is against the rules, he
will flatly refuse. This has earned the breed the reputation of being very stubborn. This reputation is not
deserved. The trainer must take into account that the dog is being asked to do something that he has
previously been taught not to do.

A Chesapeake's greatest joy is pleasing its master. While giving treats as a reward for good behaviour
works well much of the time, the dog also responds very well to scolding from its master in response to
bad behaviour. A stern scolding followed by forgiveness goes a long way in gaining the animal's trust.

There is a phase that applies to Chesapeakes - "You can order a lab; ask a golden; but you must
negotiate with a Chesapeake."

The Akita or Akita Inu is a breed of large Japanese dog, named for Akita Prefecture, where it is thought
to have originated. "Inu" means "dog" in Japanese, although in practice this animal is nearly always
referred as "Akita-ken," another reading of the same kanji (And also a pun, as the word "prefecture" is
pronounced "ken" in Japanese).

Appearance
A fully grown male adult can be over three feet tall at the withers, although this is rare; more typically,
the breed stands 24 to 28 inches (60 to 71 cm). On average, a full-grown male can reach 120 pounds (54
kg), a female 100 pounds. Akitas come in many different colours and patterns including white, brindle,
black, fawn, and many combinations of these. It is one of the few breeds that the American Kennel Club
recognises in all its coat colour variations.

Temperament
Although the AKC has put the Akita in the Working Group, the Akita was historically used as a hound
to run large game, such as bears, in the mountainous areas of Japan. Anyone who has had hounds will
recognise that group's very laid back, easygoing temperament in this breed.

Despite their enormous size, they are excellent house dogs. They require only a moderate amount of
exercise. Akitas are known to be very quiet dogs, only barking "when there is something to bark about".

When raised indoors with children, they can be excellent companions. Left unattended in the backyard,
they tend to develop "personality" problems and become very destructive to the yard. They are highly
pack oriented, thus, isolating them from the pack (i.e., the owner) causes them great stress.

Health
Some of the health conditions known to affect this breed include:

    ●   Canine Herpes, a strain of the Herpes virus that happens to affect canines
    ●   Gastric Dilitation Volvulus (GDV), a condition associated with bloat;
    ●   Pemphigus, which causes the autoimmune system to attack the dog's skin (leading to pustules)
    ●   Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA), an adult-onset condition which gradual degeneration in the
        eye cells (i.e. rods & cones)
    ●   UveoDermatological Syndrome (UDS), known as Volt-Koyanagi-Harada disease in humans
    ●   Sebaceous Adenitis, an autoimmune condition which attacks and destroys the dog's sebaceous
        glands
History
The Akita's ancestors were dogs used by matagi for hunting. These dogs, usually called matagi inu, were
not as large as modern Akita dogs.

Edo Period

In the Edo Period, Dewa Province (present-day Akita prefecture) was ruled by the Satake clan. Since the
Satake were tozama daimyo (considered potentially rebellious), they received severe restrictions by the
Tokugawa Shogunate in all military areas. The clan decided to encourage dog fighting around 1630 in
order to make it possible for the samurai to retain their aggressive edge in a way that would not offend
the shogunate. Dog fighting became especially popular in the Odate area. Dog fighting enthusiasts in the
area began to interbreed matagi inu with dogs indigenious to the area. These dogs, which later turned
into the Akita, were called Odate inu at that time.

Before World War II

After the Meiji Restoration, people began to breed Akita with many dogs from other regions in Japan,
such as the Tosa. The Meiji Restoration also ended Japan's closed door policy, and large, western dogs
began to enter Japan. As a result, Akita were also bred with German Shepherds, Great Danes, and
Mastiffs. This resulted in the breed losing many of its spitz-like characteristics. Akita were later bred
with Hokkaido and Karafuto dogs, which were introduced to mainland Japan after the First Sino-
Japanese War.

In the Taisho Period, people such as the mayor of Odate Town began a movement to preserve the Akita
breed. By this time, the Akita had began to turn into a mixed breed as a result of excessive breeding with
other dogs. Watase Shozaburo, a Japanese zoologist that successfully proposed the Law for Protection of
Natural Monuments (天然記念物保護法) also worked towards preserving the Akita breed. As a result,
the Akitainu Introduction Foundation (秋田犬保存会) was created in May 1927 by the mayor of Odate,
and nine Akita dogs were designated as natural monuments in 1931. In 1932, the faithful Akita dog
Hachiko was featured in an article in the Asahi Shimbun newspaper, which contributed to the popularity
of the breed. When Helen Keller visited Akita prefecture in 1937, she expressed that she would like to
have an Akita dog. An Akita called Kamikaze-go was given to her within a month. When Kamikaze-go
later died because of canine distemper, his brother, Tsurugiyama-go, was promptly sent to her. By 1938
a breed standard had been established and dog shows had been held, but such activities stopped after
World War II began.

The War and the Aftermath
During World War II, the number of Akita dogs greatly diminished because of the lack of food. There
were also orders to capture all dogs except German shepherds, in order to use their fur for warm army
uniforms. Many people bred Akitas with shepherds to avoid capture. When the war ended in 1945, there
were fewer than twenty purebred Akita dogs in Japan.

However, the Akita became quite popular during the postwar period. Many occupation soldiers liked the
Akita, because it was by far the largest Japanese dog. The fact that Helen Keller had an Akita also
became well-known when she came to Japan in 1948 and thanked people in Akita for the dogs she was
given. Most of the Akita dogs at this time had many German Shepherd-like characteristics. These dogs
are currently known as Dewa line, or Dewa type Akitas.

On the other hand, the Akitainu Introduction Foundation was breeding the remaining purebred Akitas in
order to omit western dog characteristics and make the breed closer to the original matagi inu. Their
efforts created the Ichinoseki line, or Ichinoseki type Akitas, which became recognized as the mainline
in Japan by 1955. Although Dewa line Akitas are now rarely seen in Japan, they achieved popularity
outside Japan through occupation soldiers who took them back from Japan. The Japan Kennel Club and
the FCI consider Dewa line Akitas to be a separate breed, called the Great Japanese Dog or the
American Akita.

Miscellaneous
    ●   Recent DNA analysis confirms that this is one of the most primitive breeds of dog.[1]
    ●   Perhaps the most famous Akita is Hachiko, a dog remembered in Japan for his loyalty. When his
        owner died, Hachiko returned to the train station every day for the rest of his life to wait for him.
        A life-size statue of Hachiko still stands at Shibuya Station.
    ●   Many manga titles by Takahashi Yoshihiro feature Akita dogs as the main character. This is said
        to be because Takahashi Yoshihiro was born in Akita Prefecture.
    ●   The title character in the anime and manga series InuYasha, along with his brother and father, are
        said to be Akita yōkai. A yōkai is a mythical Japanese creature that is said to take human form.
        InuYasha himself is technically a hanyō, a mythical half-human, half-yōkai.
    ●   Main character of the anime and manga series Ginga: Nagareboshi Gin is a Akita Inu pup called
        Gin.

                            Notes



The Newfoundland is a large, usually black, breed of dog originally used as a working dog in
Newfoundland, Canada. They are known for their sweet dispositions. They are very loyal to their
families and possess natural water rescue tendencies.

Appearance




                                                A Landseer painting of a Landseer Newfoundland.

Newfoundlands ("Newfies") have webbed feet and a water-resistant coat. Males weigh 60–70 kg (130–
150 lbs), and females 45–55 kg (100–120 lbs), placing them in the "giant" weight range.

Most Newfies are black, but brown, gray (very rare), Irish Spotted (black with white markings), and
Landseer (black head, white body with black markings) varieties exist. The Landseer is named after the
artist Sir Edwin Landseer, who featured them in many of his paintings. Some kennel clubs consider the
Landseer to be a separate breed; others consider it simply a Newfoundland color variation. Some kennel
clubs consider Irish Spotted to be an "invalid" marking, and these clubs will not allow them to be shown.


Temperament




                                A brown Newfie investigates a Chihuahua-sized mixed-breed dog.
Newfies have a gentle, placid disposition. They are nicknamed the "Gentle Giant" and "Nature's
babysitter." Indeed, the official AKC breed description says "Sweetness of temperament is the hallmark
of the Newfoundland; this is the most important single characteristic of the breed." They are protective
of children. The dog Nana in James M. Barrie's Peter Pan was a Newfoundland. (Newfie owners resent
the depiction of her as a St. Bernard in the Disney animated film version; the 2004 film Finding
Neverland used a Great Pyrenees).

The Newfoundland is smart and loyal. The breed is easily trained as they are eager to please their
masters. They are not easily frightened nor excitable. Relative to other breeds, Newfoundland puppies,
especially older puppies, tend to be calm. Puppyhood doesn't last for extended amounts of time as in
some breeds. They get along wonderfully with other dogs. They have deep, fierce-sounding barks, but
are not good guard dogs. They have been known to grieve when separated from their families. Despite
their wonderful qualities, this breed is not for everyone. Their large size makes them difficult to keep in
many living situations, although they do not require great amounts of exercise and as puppies they tend
to tire easily.

History




                                 Newfoundland Dog Stamp

The origin of the breed is uncertain, but they were in use as working dogs on the island of
Newfoundland as early as AD 1000. It is said that Newfoundlands were bred to pull in the fishermens'
nets. Newfoundlands have been used as water rescue dogs and for draft work. National Geographic's
program "Dogs with Jobs" named the Newfoundland as the strongest draft dog on earth. The breed
almost became extinct; most modern-day Newfoundlands trace their ancestry to a single stud dog named
Siki who lived in the 1920s.

Health
As with many large breeds, they have a tendency for hip dysplasia. A potential buyer should seek proof
of hip certification from the breeder.
Miscellaneous
Capt. Meriwether Lewis owned a Newfoundland named Seaman. The dog was a valuable member of the
famous Lewis and Clark Expedition. [1]
The Newfoundland dog shown on the 14 cents stamp is Ch. Westerland Sieger and was owned by the
Honourable Harold MacPherson.

Unofficially, the second most important breed characteristic is a tendency to drool. Newfie owners
acknowledge this cheerfully, proudly displaying paraphernalia with slogans such as "Newfoundland is
my name—slobber is my game" and "Spit happens." One club assures that "that's OK, because drool is
good for you."[2] Some breeders offer puppies which have been bred so that their jowls are shorter.
They do not hang down as far, and thus they don't drool as much as the common Newfoundland. They
are the so-called "dry-mouths".

Gander, a Newfoundland dog serving with Canadian infantry in Hong Kong in 1941 was posthumously
awarded the Dickin Medal in 2000. The medal was instituted in 1943 by Maria Dickin to honour the
work of animals in war and has become recognised as "the animals' Victoria Cross".

The Irish Setter, also known as the Red Setter, is a breed of gundog.


Appearance




                                     An Irish Setter after swimming

The coat is moderately long and silky and of a deep red color, and it requires maintenance. The
undercoat is abundant in winter weather. Irish Setters range in height from 25 to 27 inches (64-69 cm),
males weigh 60 to 70 pounds (27-32 kg) and females 53 to 64 pounds (24-29 kg). The FCI Breed
Standard for the Irish Setter stipulates males: 23 to 26.5 inches (58-67 cm), females: 21.5 to 24.5 inches
(55-62 cm).

Temperament
This happy, playful breed is known for its joie de vivre and thrives on activity. It is faster and has more
endurance than other setter breeds. In general, Irish Setters are friendly, enjoy human company, and
actively look for other dogs with which to play. They are excellent with children. Due to the breed's
need for frequent activity, this is an inappropriate dog for inactive families or apartment dwellers.
                                Irish setters need plenty of activity.

History
The breed was developed in Ireland in the 1700s from the Old Spanish Pointer, setting spaniels, and
early Scottish setters. Early Irish Setters were white with red blotches on their coats, but today the
Setter's coat is a rich mahogany color. The Irish Red and White Setter is more closely related to those
early Setters. Its name in Gaelic is Modder rhu or "red dog". Originally, the Irish Setter was bred for
hunting, specifically for setting or pointing upland gamebirds. They are similar to other members of the
setter family such as the English Setter and Gordon Setter. Today, the Irish Setter is more commonly
found as a companion and family pet.

Miscellaneous
Bus Éireann, the national bus company in the Republic of Ireland, uses the Red Setter as its corporate
logo.

                              Notes



The Neapolitan Mastiff is a large, ancient breed of dog that can be traced back to about 100 BC. This
dog is a massive, awe-inspiring dog breed often used as a guard and defender of owner and property.


Appearance
Neapolitan Mastiffs are characterized by loose skin over their entire bodies; abundant, hanging wrinkles
and folds on the head; and a voluminous dewlap. Coats can be blue, grey, black, brindle, or chocolate,
sometimes with white on the chest or feet. Ears usually are half pricked and can be cropped. It has a
large blocky head and a rolling gait.

Temperment
The Neapolitan Mastiff is a fearless protector when it needs to be but is affectionate with its family and
the family's friends; as a guarding breed it is quite wary around strangers but it will relax once it gets to
know the person in question. It does not bark excessively and indeed only barks when something
provokes it. As a breed the Neapolitan Mastiff can be stubborn, but it does not require repetitious
training--once it understands what its master wants, it will obey. It has a dominant attitude and must be
taught from puppyhood that its master is the boss, not the other way around. Males can be much more
aggressive and dominant than females. A female works best in a home with a family, as she is a bit more
docile and better with children. These dogs are, however, usually very loving with children, provided
they do not tease them. Males do not get along with other males, but the Neopolitan can get along well
with non-canine pets if raised with them from puppyhood.

The Neapolitan Mastiff is not a breed for everyone and not a dog for beginners. Children should be
taught to respect these dogs. Neapolitan Mastiffs should be well socialized at an early age to avoid over-
protectiveness. They will be quite protective even with extensive socialization. Additional protection
training is unnecessary because they are naturally guard dogs and have been for ages. Obedience
training is very important in this breed. The Neo is generally very tolerant of pain due to the breed's
early fighting background. Males often drool quite heavily. They tend to drool more in hot weather or
after drinking water.

History
The Neapolitan Mastiff is descendant of the Molossus, the mammoth war dogs of the Middle East, and
was frequently used in the Roman arenas pitted against lions, bears, and gladiators for entertainment. As
dogs of war, they fought alongside the Roman legions, and in this way they were spread throughout
Europe. Eventually the descendants of the Roman Molossian splintered into several different Mastiff
breeds: English Mastiff, Dogue de Bordeaux, Spanish Mastiff, St. Bernard, and Rottweiler.

In the 1940s, this breed was rediscovered near Naples in Italy, and is now beginning to make a
comeback. A Neapolitan Mastiff was featured in the Harry Potter movies as Hagrid's dog Fang.

                                            The Smooth Fox Terrier shows a typical perky terrier
expression.

The name Fox Terrier or Foxy refers primarily to two different breeds of dog, the Smooth Fox Terrier
and the Wire Fox Terrier, that were independently bred in England in the mid-19th century. The two
terrier breeds are very similar, with the only major difference being the coats. The Smooth Fox Terrier
has a smooth, flat, but hard and dense coat, whereas the Wire Fox Terrier coat should appear broken
with a dense, wiry texture.

In show circles, the terms fox terrier and foxy are only used for these two breeds, but in other
communities around the world, particularly rural and farming ares, these words are used for these breeds
and also to refer to mixed-breed dogs of fox terrier type, or to descendent breeds such as the Toy Fox
Terrier and Miniature Fox Terrier, which are similar to each other.


Origin
                                  Wire-haired Fox Terrier

The breeds were established to assist in fox hunting. Before their development, a hunt would be ruined
as soon as the fox reached its hole. The introduction of Fox Terriers into the hunting party solved the
problem. If the fox "went to ground" (reached and entered its lair), the terrier would be sent in after it.
This identified the major requirements for a Fox Terrier. Firstly, it had to have the stamina to run with
the Foxhounds. Secondly, it had to be small enough to follow a fox down its lair. And thirdly, it had to
be tough, as a cornered fox was likely to turn and try to fight off an intruder, so a foxy had to be able to
stand up to it.

The term Fox Terrier was generic until the latter part of the 19th Century. It referred to a group of dogs
of varying type which were bred for the hunt. These dogs were often called "foxies" regardless of type
or size. The first Fox Terrier, a dog called "Foiler" or "Old Foiler", was registered by the Kennel Club
circa 1875-6, and the breed began the process of standardization.

Refinement of breed types led to the assignment of new breed names to the ensuing breeds. A
differentiation was made between the Fox Terrier varieties, although the two breeds were shown under
the same breed standard until well into the 20th century. The process of selective breeding was
duplicated in other countries as emigrants took their dogs to other parts of the world.

Development of the Fox Terrier around the world
In the United States, fanciers of the Jack Russell Terrier were adamant that their dog, of a type created
by The Reverend Mr. John Russell, “The Sporting Parson”, was as much of a fox terrier as the smooth
or wirehaired varieties. They referred to those breeds as the Modern Fox Terriers. Some Jack Russell
owners preferred that their breed clubs remain unaffiliated, to preserve the working qualities of their fox
terrier.

The Toy Fox Terrier was developed by selected breeding from smaller Fox Terriers. The breed was
recognized by the United Kennel Club in 1936 and generated little controversy.

In Australia, a distinct type of Australian Fox Terrier was becoming recognizable during the same period
in which the fox terrier breed was being standardized. The miniature version of this new dog became
extremely popular. Smooth and Wirehair Fox Terriers are often referred to as Standard Fox Terriers in
Australia in an attempt to minimize confusion.

Today, there are many and varied breeds that are descended from or related to earlier fox terrier types.
These include the

    ●   Brazilian Terrier
    ●   Japanese Terrier
    ●   Miniature Fox Terrier
    ●   Ratonero Bodeguero Andaluz
    ●   Rat Terrier
    ●   Tenterfield Terrier.

The Smooth and Wirehair Fox Terriers are seldom used for hunting these days and are more often pets.
Their small size makes them appealing.

A Maltese is a small breed of white dog that does not shed.


Appearance




                                 Maltese Puppy

The Maltese is a dog belonging to the toy group that is covered from head to foot with a mantle of long,
silky, white hair. Adult Maltese range from roughly 3 to 10 lb (1.4 to 4.5 kg), though breed standards, as
a whole, call for weights between 4 and 8 lb (1.8 to 3.7 kg). There are variations depending on which
standard is being used; many, like the American Kennel Club, call for a weight that is ideally between 4
and 6 lb (1.8 to 2.7 kg), and no more than 7 lb (3.2 kg). The coat is straight and silky and lacks an
undercoat. The color is pure white and although cream or light lemon ears is permissible it is not
desirable. Some individuals may have curly or woolly hair, but this is outside the standard.
Characteristics include slightly rounded skulls,with a one (1) finger width dome. Also, a black nose that
is two(2)finger width long.The drop ears with long hair and very dark eyes, surrounded by darker skin
pigmentation that is called a "halo", giving Maltese their expressive look. The body is compact with the
length equaling the height. Their noses can fade and become pink or light brown in color. This is often
referred to as a "winter nose" and many times will become black again with increased exposure to the
sun.

Temperament
                                 This half-Poodle, half-Maltese is a popular hybrid of the Maltese
breed. This hybrid, commonly known as the Maltipoo, is bred for its good nature and companionship.

Maltese can be very energetic and are known for their occasional wild outbursts of physical activity,
bolting around at top speed with amazing agility; given this, they still do well for apartment dwellers.
They are relatively easy to train and enjoy a playful game of fetch. These intelligent dogs learn quickly,
and pick up new tricks and behaviours easily. Since they were bred specifically for companionship, they
do not do well being left alone for long hours.

The breed has a reputation for being good-natured, but may be intolerant of small children or other dogs.
They can be protective of their owner and will bark or may bite if animals or people infringe on their
territory or are perceived as a threat.

For all their diminutive size, Maltese seem to be without fear. In fact, many Maltese seem relatively
indifferent to creatures/objects larger than themselves (unless of course it is the owner). They are among
the gentlest mannered of all little dogs, yet they are lively and playful as well as vigorous. Because of
their size, Maltese dogs are not a good choice for families with small children because they can be easily
injured.

The Maltese is commonly bred with other breeds of dog to further express its tempermant and
intelligence.

Care
Maltese have hair, not fur and have little to no shedding if cared for properly. Like their relatives
Poodles and Bichon Frisé, they are considered to be largely hypoallergenic and many people who are
allergic to Dogs may not be allergic to the Maltese (See list of Hypoallergenic dog breeds). Regular
grooming is required to prevent their coats from matting. Many owners will keep their Maltese clipped
in a "puppy cut," a 1 - 2" all over trim that makes the dog resemble a puppy. Some owners who prefer
long hair will roll it in curlers to keep it from matting. Dark staining in the hair around the eyes ("tear
staining") can be a problem in this breed, and is mostly a function of how much the individual dog's eyes
water and the size of the tear ducts. If the face is kept dry and cleaned daily, the staining can be
minimized.
Health
The Maltese is generally a healthy breed with few inherent problems. Some problems seen are luxating
patella, White Shaker Dog Syndrome, portosystemic liver shunt and progressive retinal atrophy (PRA).
Average life span is 12-15 years.

History
As an aristocrat of the canine world, this ancient breed has been known by a variety of names throughout
the centuries. Originally called the Melitaie Dog, he has also been known as "Ye Ancient Dogge of
Malta", the Roman Ladies' Dog, the Comforter Dog, the Spaniel Gentle, the Bichon, the Shock Dog, the
Maltese Lion Dog and the Maltese Terrier. Sometime within the past century, he has come to simply be
known as the Maltese. The breed's history can be traced back many centuries. Some have placed its
origin at two or three thousand years ago and Darwin himself placed the origin of the breed at 6000 BC.1

The Maltese is thought to have been descended from a Spitz type dog found among the Swiss Lake
dwellers and bred down to obtain its small size. Although there is also some evidence that the breed
originated in Asia and is related to the Tibetan Terrier, the exact origin is unknown.2 Maltese are
generally associated with the Isle of Malta in the Mediterranean Sea. The dogs probably made their way
to Europe through the Middle East with the migration of nomadic tribes. The Isle of Malta (or Melitae as
it was then known) was a geographic center of early trade, and explorers undoubtedbly found ancesters
of the tiny, white dogs left there as barter for necessities and supplies. The dogs were favored by the
wealthy and royalty alike and were bred over time to specifically be a companion animal. Some royals
that purportedly owned Maltese were Mary Queen of Scots, Queen Elizabeth I, Queen Victoria,
Josephine Bonaparte and Marie Antoinette.

At the time of the Apostle Paul, Publius, the Roman governor of Malta, had a Maltese named Issa of
which he was very fond. In this connection the poet Marcus Valerius Martialis (Martial), born in A.D.
38 at Bilbilis in Spain, made this attachment famous in one of his celebrated epigrams:

       "Issa is more frolicsome than Catulla's sparrow.

       Issa is purer than a dove's kiss.

       Issa is gentler than a maiden.

       Issa is more precious than Indian gems...

       Lest the last days that she sees light
         should snatch her from him forever,

         Publius has had her picture painted."


It is said that the picture of the dog is so life-like, one cannot tell the dog from the picture.

During the Renaissance, the poet Ludovico Ariosto in a few lines of his literary masterpiece, Orlando
Furioso, describes a dog that can surely only be a Maltese.

         "The tiniest dog Nature has ever produced --

         Her coat of long hair, whiter than ermine,

         Her movements exquisitely graceful and

         Matchless elegance of appearance."


                (Vol.II Canto 43) 3

                            Notes



The Greyhound is a breed of dog used for hunting and racing. They are one of the fastest land
mammals; their combination of long, powerful legs, deep chests and aerodynamic build allows them to
reach speeds of up to 72 km/h (45 mph).

Appearance




                                Greyhound pup

Male dogs are usually 71 to 76 cm (28 to 30 inches) tall at the withers and weigh around 29 to 36 kg (65
to 90 pounds). Females tend to be smaller with shoulder heights ranging from 68 to 71 cm (27 to 28
inches) and weights from 27 to 31 kg (50 to 75 pounds). Greyhounds have very short hair, which is easy
to maintain. There are approximately thirty recognized color forms, of which variations of white,
brindle, fawn, black, red, blue, and grey can appear uniquely or in combination.

Temperament
Although greyhounds are extremely fast dogs, they are not high-energy dogs. They are sprinters, and
although they love running, do not require extensive exercise once they leave the track. Most are quiet,
gentle animals. Greyhounds are often referred to as "Forty-five mile an hour couch potatoes."

Greyhounds can make good pets because of their mild and affectionate character. They can get along
well with children and family pets (often including cats). Greyhounds are generally loyal, tractable dogs
with developed intellects, although their territorial instinct is weak and they make poor guard dogs.
Their talents include sighting and hunting. They do not have undercoats and therefore are less likely to
trigger people's dog allergies (greyhounds are sometimes incorrectly referred to as "hypoallergenic").
Most greyhounds that live as pets are adopted after they retire from racing.

Most companion greyhounds are kept on a leash because their hunting background has instilled a strong
desire to chase things. Greyhounds can live in an urban setting but require moderate exercise on a
regular basis. They enjoy walking and running outside.

An adult greyhound will stay healthy and happy with a daily walk of as little as 20 to 30 minutes.
However, as greyhounds have a body fat of around 16%, compared to an average of 25% in other
canines, overdoing their exercise can be detrimental to their health.




                                                      Greyhound in flight

History
Popularly, the breed's origin is believed to be traced to ancient Egypt, where a bas-relief depicting a
smooth-coated Saluki (Persian Greyhound) or Sloughi was found in a tomb built in 4000 BC. Analyses
of DNA reported in 2004, however, suggest that the greyhound is not closely related to these breeds, but
is a close relative to herding dogs. [1] [2]

Historically, these sight hounds have been used primarily for hunting in the open where their keen
eyesight is a distinct advantage. It is believed that they (or at least similarly-named dogs) were
introduced to England in the 5th and 6th centuries BC by the Celts during their invasions.

The name "greyhound" is generally believed to come from the Old English grighund. "Hund" is traced
to the modern "hound", but the meaning of "grig" is undetermined, other than in reference to dogs in Old
English and Norse. Its origin does not appear to have any common root with the modern word "grey" for
colour, and indeed the greyhound is seen with a wide variety of coats.

According to Pokorny's Indogermanisches Woerterbuch (p. 441-442) the English name "greyhound"
does not mean "a gray dog/hound", but simply "a fair dog". Subsequent words have been derived from
the indoeuropean root *g'her- 'shine, twinkle': Eng. "gray", Old High German "gris" 'grey, old', Old
Icelandic "griss" 'piglet, pig', Old Icld. "gryja" 'to dawn', "gryjandi" 'morning twilight', Old Irish "grian"
'sun', Old Church Slavonic "zorja" 'morning twilight, brightness'. The common sense of these words is
'to shine; bright'.

Until the early twentieth century, greyhounds were principally bred and trained for coursing. During the
early 1920s, modern greyhound racing was introduced into the United States and introduced into United
Kingdom and Ireland in 1926.

Welfare




                                  Photo finish of a Greyhound race in Tampa, Florida, USA on February
9, 1939

In the late 20th century several Greyhound adoption groups were formed. The early groups were formed
in large part out of a sense of concern about the treatment of the dogs while living on the track. These
groups began taking greyhounds from the racetracks when they could no longer compete and placing
them in adoptive homes. Previously, in the United States over 20,000 retired greyhounds a year were
killed; recent estimates still number in the thousands, with about 90% of National Greyhound
Association-registered animals either being adopted, or returned for breeding purposes (according to the
industry numbers upwards of 2000 dogs are still killed annually)[3].

Accidents and disease are also common killers among racing greyhounds. In 2005, an epidemic of
respiratory failure killed dozens of dogs and left over 1200 quarantined in the U.S., particularly in
Massachusetts, Colorado, Iowa and Rhode Island.

The vast majority of greyhounds are bred for racing, leading registered American Kennel Club dogs
about 150:1, and as such each dog is issued a Bertillon card, which measures 56 distinct identifying
traits, and the Bertillon number is tattooed on the dog's ear, so as to ensure that the dog who races is in
fact the dog it is claimed to be. However, not all National Greyhound Association registered dogs race.
There are several reasons why some greyhounds never race:

     ●   The dog is too slow.
     ●   The dog has physical defects.
     ●   The dog does not have the required temperament.
     ●   The dog is not raised in a country where racing is popular.
     ●   The dog is bred for showing instead of racing.

Most greyhounds finish racing between two and five years of age. Some retired racing greyhounds have
injuries that may follow them for the remainder of their lives.

Veterinary Care
Due to the unique physiology and anatomy of greyhounds, a veterinarian who understands the issues
relevant to the breed is generally needed when the dogs need treatment, particularly when anaesthesia is
required. Greyhounds demonstrate unusual blood chemistry, which can be misread by veterinarians not
familiar with the breed; this can result in an incorrect diagnosis. Greyhounds have much less fat than
other dogs, and therefore can not metabolize anesthesia as quickly. A female may have an elevated risk
of cancer if she was administered hormones during her racing career. Greyhounds have higher levels of
red blood cells than do other breeds. As red blood cells carry oxygen to the lungs, this characteristic help
the breed's speed. Veterinary blood services often use greyhounds as universal blood donors.

Miscellaneous

In the media

Simpson's Santa's Little Helper
      The most widely recognized greyhound in popular culture is the fictional character Santa's Little
      Helper from the Fox Broadcasting Company's animated series, The Simpsons.

         The character Santa's Little Helper exhibits many of the intellectual and behavioural
         characteristics of the typical greyhound as a pet. He is portrayed as affectionate, tolerant of other
         household pets (notably cats), loyal, and not overly active. His origins on the program stem from
         an episode in which Homer Simpson, after placing a losing bet on Santa's Little Helper in a
         greyhound race, discovers that because of his poor performance, his owner has discarded him to
        the streets to fend for himself.

        In keeping with the perception that The Simpson family comprises "losers" and "outcasts",
        Homer decides that Santa's Little Helper is too much like the rest of the family to not be a perfect
        addition.

        Santa's Little Helper has been a supporting character ever since, though he once nearly died due
        to a twisted bowel. Unlike real greyhounds, however, Santa's Little Helper is known to sit. Due to
        the peculiarities of greyhound anatomy, greyhounds never really "sit." Although they may
        assume the posture, they never put their full weight on their rear, instead putting it in muscle
        tension.

The Greyhound Lines bus company
      In keeping with their logo, which sports a racing greyhound, Greyhound occasionally airs
      television commercials starring a talking computer-generated greyhound. The greyhound in these
      commercial shorts is often noted for his dry, deadpan wit.

Anatomy

An additional peculiarity of greyhounds is that they have a hinged spine, which is unique in the animal
world. As a result, greyhounds have a small "divot" in their back, set just behind their shoulder blades.

The racing gait of the greyhound is a double suspension gallop, in which all four feet are off the ground
twice during each full stride.

Sports

    ●   The Greyhound is the mascot of the Assumption College sports teams.
    ●   The OHL hockey team in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada is called the Greyhounds.
    ●   There is an indoor football team based in West Virginia called the Ohio Valley Greyhounds.

Dogue de Bordeaux is a breed of dog that is strong, powerful, and imposing, as it was originally bred
for dog fighting and guarding.


Appearance
The height at the withers is typically 23 to 26 inches for show dogs and the weight of the male Dogues is
in excess of 100 pounds. Dogs standing 30 inches tall at the withers and weighing up to 145 pounds are
not unknown.

History
The Dogue de Bordeaux was known in France as early as the fourteenth century. Dog fighting was
popular in the nineteenth century, particularly in southern France in the region around Bordeaux. Hence,
the city lent its name to these large fighting dogs.

A uniform breed type of the Bordeaux Dog did not exist before about 1920. The French placed emphasis
on keeping the old breeding line pure. Black masks were considered an indication of the crossing in of
the Mastiff. As an important indication of purity of the breed, attention was paid to the leather-coloured
nose, light eyes, and red mask. Originally bred with huge anatomically incorrect heads; a pioneer for the
breed in Germany, Werner Preugschat once wrote:

       "What am I supposed to do with a dog that has a monstrous skull and is at most able to carry it
       from the food dish to its bed."

The Dogue de Bordeaux comes in two varieties, Dogues and Doguins, the former being a considerably
larger dog than the latter. Breeding of the Doguins has been seriously neglected in recent years and the
variety has dwindled to near nonexistence.

New initiatives will soon be required if the Bordeaux Dog can hope to flourish again both inside and
outside of France. It is hoped that the few remaining survivors of this interesting old breed will be
sufficient for its recovery.

                               Notes
A working dog breed that originated in eastern Siberia, the Siberian Husky is a medium-sized dog, 35
to 60 pounds (16 to 27 kg) in weight, 20 to 23.5 inches (51 to 60 cm) in height, originally bred by the
Chukchi tribes for use as a village dog, herding the reindeer, pulling sledges, and guarding the women
and children.

Appearance
Siberians have a dense double-layer coat that comes in a variety of colours and patterns, usually with
white feet and legs, facial markings, and tail tip. The most common colors are black and white, grey and
white, copper red and white, and pure white, though many individuals have brown, reddish, or biscuit
shadings and some are piebald spotted. Striking masks, spectacles, and other facial markings occur in
wide variety.

Eyes

Their eyes are brown, hazel, or blue. The light blue eye colour is characteristic but incompletely
dominant. The breed may have one eye brown or hazel and the other blue, or may have blue and another
colour mixed in the iris of one or both eyes; this latter trait is sometimes called "bi-eyed" by Siberian
enthusiasts. This might be the only breed for which different-colored eyes are allowed in the show ring.

Ears

Its ears are triangular, well-furred, and erect; its fox-like brush tail is carried in a sickle curve over the
back.

Coat

The Siberian Husky's coat consists of two layers, a dense, cashmere-like undercoat and a longer coarser
topcoat consisting of straight guard hairs. Siberians usually shed their undercoat once or twice a year,
producing prodigious quantities of fur; the process is commonly referred to as blowing their coat. Dogs
that live primarily indoors often shed year round, so the shedding is less profuse—but constant.
Therefore, an owner might have a Siberian that sheds lightly all year, or a Siberian that blows its
complete coat twice a year. A strong steel comb helps in removing the dense handfuls of hair that come
loose while the dog is blowing its coat. Otherwise, grooming is minimal; bathing is normally
unnecessary as the coat sheds dirt. Well and healthy Siberians have no odor.

Temperament
                                 2-year-old male

Popular as family pets and as show dogs due to their striking appearance and gentle temperament,
Siberians have certain drawbacks. Although normally quite tractable, affectionate and docile with
people, they have a strong hunting drive and will kill cats, rabbits, chickens, squirrels and other birds
and small animals; they have been known to savage sheep. They should be kept in secure enclosures as
they will not always come to call and will often disappear on long hunting trips; they cannot be allowed
to run loose. Siberians are also accomplished escape artists and diggers, so it is important to check
enclosures frequently for any potential escape routes. Siberians are trainable to a certain degree, but
patience is necessary. They are independent in nature and not given to blind obedience to every
command.




                                 Seven-week-old Siberian

Health
Siberians are normally rather healthy dogs, living typically from eleven to fifteen years of age. Health
issues in the breed are eye troubles (cataracts, glaucoma, and corneal dystrophy among others), allergies,
and cancer in older animals. Hip dysplasia occurs but is not a major concern in the breed. This breed
needs a high-quality diet with high levels of protein and fat, particularly when used for dogsledding.
That said, Siberian Huskies are rather fuel efficient dogs, consuming less food than other dogs of similar
size and activity level. The diet must be adjusted to their level of work and exercise; obesity can be a
problem for underexercised, overfed pets.

History
The Siberian Husky is widely believed to have originated exclusively with the Coastal Chukchi tribes of
the east-Siberian peninsula. There is evidence, however, that Siberian dogs were also imported from the
Koryak and Kamchadal tribes. Recent DNA analysis confirms that this is one of the oldest breeds of dog.
[1] Dogs from the Anadyr River and surrounding regions were imported into Alaska from 1908 (and for
the next two decades) during the gold rush for use as sleddogs, especially in the All-Alaska Sweepstakes
(AAS), a 408 mile (657 km) distance dogsled race from Nome to Candle and back. Smaller, faster and
more enduring than the 100 120 pound (45 to 54 kg) freighting dogs then in general use, they
immediately dominated the Nome Sweepstakes.

Leonhard Seppala, a Norwegian fisherman turned gold miner, became involved with Siberian dogs when
he was asked by his employer to train a group of females and pups for the 1914 AAS. After a poor start
his first year, Seppala dominated the races thereafter. In 1925 he was a key figure in the 1925 serum run
to Nome which delivered diphtheria serum from Nenana by dogsled after the city was stricken by an
epidemic. The Iditarod trail race commemorates this famous delivery. The following year two groups of
Seppala’s dogs toured the USA, starting a mania for sleddogs and dogsled racing, particularly in the
New England states.

In 1930 the last Siberians were exported as the Soviet government closed the borders of Siberia to
external trade. The same year saw recognition of the Siberian Husky by the American Kennel Club.
Nine years later the breed was first registered in Canada. Today’s registered Siberian Huskies are largely
the descendants of the 1930 Siberia imports and of Leonhard Seppala’s dogs.

Miscellaneous

Dogsled racing

Siberians are still used occasionally as sleddogs in dogsled racing but have been widely replaced by the
more popular Alaskan Husky and hound-type crossbreds that are specially bred and selected for speed
and have less heavy coats. Siberian Huskies were designed to pull a light load over long distances at a
medium pace, and simply can't keep up with their faster counterparts. Siberians are still popular in races
restricted to purebreds and are faster than other pure sleddogs breeds such as the Samoyed and Alaskan
Malamute. Today the breed tends to divide along lines of “racing” Siberians versus “show” Siberians.

Apart from dogsled racing, they are very popular for recreational mushing and are also used for skijoring
(one to three dogs pulling a skier) and European ski-pulka. A few owners use them for dog-packing and
hiking. They have also seen use as therapy dogs.

A pit bull is a member of any of a number of breeds of dogs developed from the Old English Bulldog.
Breeds recognized as pit bulls include the American Pit Bull Terrier and the American Staffordshire
Terrier, although the name is also often used to refer to other breeds of similar characteristics, such as
the American Bulldog and Staffordshire Bull Terrier, and mixed breeds that include any of these breeds.




                                             The American Pit Bull Terrier is one of several bull terrier
breeds.

The pit bull is a descendant of bull- and bear-baiting dogs. The dogs left in Europe were bred along
different lines, developing into a smaller, stockier dog. The dogs brought to America are larger, with
longer legs. In no way should the pit bull be confused with the Bull Terrier, which is a cross between a
Staffordshire Bull Terrier and the extinct English White Terrier.

Pit bulls were long considered, by some, to be an ideal family pet and are recommended to this day by
the American Kennel Club as an especially good dog for children. But, since the early 1990s, a series of
well-publicized attacks on humans by aggressive members of the breed occurred, making the ownership
of pit bulls controversial. This breed may be very aggressive towards other animals or dogs of the other
sex(the problem is worse in male dogs) but very human-friendly. As a result,it is difficult to keep more
than a pair wihout segregation.
Characteristics
Pit bulls are medium-sized (males range 45-85lbs, females 30-80lbs), solidly built, short-coated dogs
that require little grooming. They have an affectionate disposition, and are noted for their attachment to
their masters as well as for their confident and intelligent temperament.

Pit Bulls are extremely athletic and energetic dogs, and require a great deal of exercise if they are not to
become destructive. Although they can be short, they have extremely high muscle density and are
generally capable of executing a standing four-foot-vertical jump. Pit bulls have also been bred to have a
very high tolerance for pain.

Pit bulls were historically bred to display dominance aggression toward other dogs—a relic of the
breed's dog fighting past. A pit bull displaying the correct breed temperament is friendly towards
humans, and is generally a poor choice as a guard dog [1].

Supporters of pit bulls argue they can make good pets. Good breeding practices may help to minimize
agressive behavior. Most pit bull advocates recommend getting a pitbull as a puppy so the owner has
more control over the socialization process, and can more easily train it away from unacceptable
behaviors.

The American Temperament Test Society, Inc. (ATTS) breed statistics as of December 2004 show an
83.4% passing rate for the American Pit Bull Terrier and a 93.2% passing rate for the Staffordshire Bull
Terrier, as compared to an 81% average pass rate for all dog breeds. The testing process is not a direct
measure of aggression. Some of the tests used by ATTS may give a passing grade to aggression toward
humans considered appropriate for the situation, such as a stranger advancing toward the dog and
handler in an threatening manner. Other parts of the ATTS test battery gauge response to unfamiliar
situations such as walking on slippery surfaces or hearing nearby gunshots. Many veterenarians claim
that Pitbulls and Labrador retrievers are the easiest breeds to handle as they are least likely to snap
during the worst situations.

Many other common breeds look similar to the pit bull breeds to inexperienced eyes, and can be
confused for them. A few of these breeds are the Argentine Dogo, the English Bull Terrier, the
American Bulldog, and the Boxer. The Staffordshire Bull Terrier and the American Staffordshire Terrier
are considered to be seperate breeds in most countries (including England, Australia and New Zealand),
but in the U.S.A are considered to be pit bulls.Pitbulls come in a range of colors from fawn to brindle to
red.Bluetick,harlequin and tricolor pitbulls are very rare but not unknown.

The Pitbull is larger than its forebearer,the Staffordshire terrier and is taller and more athletic than the
lean Scottish staffordshire terrier. This is mainly because dogfighting was banned earlier in the UK and
smaller dogs became favourable for ratting,in the Us,however,larger dogs became more popular in the
dogfighting ring.Only in 1972 were American Pitbulls and Staffies considered seperate breeds from
English Staffordshires.

History
The exact origin of this breed is uncertain,although it has its root in the British,Irish Staffordshire
Terriers and possibly the now-extinct Blue-Paul (Scottish Staffordshire terrier). The ancestors of modern
pit bulls, English and French bulldogs, and other related breeds were powerful mastiffs bred for farm
work. Specifically, these dogs accompanied farmers into the fields to assist with bringing bulls in for
breeding, castration, or slaughter. The dogs, known generally as bulldogs, protected the farmer by
subduing the bull if it attempted to gore him. Typically a dog would do this by biting the bull on the
nose and holding on until the bull submitted. Because of the nature of their job, bulldogs were bred to
have powerful jaws, muscular bodies, and the resolve to hold onto a violently-struggling bull, even when
injured.

Eventually these dogs' purpose inspired the widespread practice of the bloody sports of bull-baiting and
bear-baiting. Bulldogs are believed to have been bred with terrier breeds to produce a more muscular,
compact, and agile dog for these competitions. The resulting dogs are known as bull-and-terrier breeds,
and modern examples include all pit bull-type dogs. In Elizabethan England, these spectacles were
popular forms of entertainment. However, in 1835, bull-baiting and bear-baiting were abolished by
Parliament as cruel, and the custom died out over the following years.




                                  United States propaganda poster used during World War I depicting a
pit bull

In its place the sport of dog-fighting gained popularity. Dogs were bred for specific traits useful in the
dog-fighting ring, refining the agility, gameness, and power already present in the bull-and-terrier
breeds. They were also bred to be intelligent and level-headed during fights and unaggressive toward
humans. Part of the standard for organized dog-fighting required that the match referee who is
unacquainted with the dog be able to enter the ring, pick up a dog while it was engaged in a fight, andget
the respective owner to carry it out of the ring without being bitten. Dogs that bit the referee were culled.
After a match,if an injured dog snapped at any passers-by thay were killed on the spot in an effort to
remove human-aggressive dogs from the gene-pool.

As a result, Victorian fighting dogs (Staffordshire Bull Terriers and, though less commonly used as
fighters, English Bull Terriers) generally had stable temperaments and were commonly kept in the home
by the gambling men who owned them.

During the mid-1800s, immigration to the United States from Ireland and England brought an influx of
these dogs to America,mainly Boston where they were bred to be larger and stockier, working as farm
dogs in the West as much as fighting dogs in the cities. The resulting breed, the American Staffordshire
Bull Terrier, also called the American Pit Bull Terrier, became known as an "all-American" dog. Pit bull
type dogs became popular as family pets for citizens who were not involved in dog-fighting or farming.
In the early 1900s they began to appear in films, one of the more famous examples being Pete the Pup
from the Our Gang shorts (later known as The Little Rascals).

During World War I the breed's widespread popularity led to its being featured on pro-U.S. propaganda
posters.

Safety and legal issues

Dog bite statistics

Of the 199 dog-attack fatalities in the USA between 1979 and 1996, dogs identified as pit bulls were
responsible for 60 attacks—just under a third. The next most-dangerous group was Rottweilers,
responsible for 29 attacks (statistics from the CDC). These statistics are tainted by the fact that the breed
recorded as responsible is taken from the reports of witnesses and is rarely confirmed by dog experts or
registration papers.

Because pit bull is an all-encompassing term used to describe several breeds of dogs, determining
whether a dog is a pit bull is often particularly difficult. A study[2] for the US Department of Health and
Human Services discusses some reasons why fatalities might be overstated for pit bulls, in large part
because most people (including experienced dog owners) often can't distinguish a pit bull from any other
stocky, broad-faced, or muscular dog. For additional discussions on this and dog-human aggression in
general, see dog attacks.

According to The Age, pit bull terriers have been responsible for four of the seven dog attacks in which
Australians have died between 1991 and 2002. The Endangered Dog Breeds Association of Australia
denies these figures, claiming that registered, purebred pit bull terriers have caused no known fatalities
in Australia. Most Australian state governments have introduced new legislation specific to pit bulls,
requiring pit bull owners to muzzle and leash their dogs at all times when in public.

Some people contend that pit bulls are especially likely to cause fatalities when they do attack, due to
their strong jaws and their tendency to clamp on to their victim when attacking. However although pit
bull terriers are indisputably powerful dogs, there is no scientific evidence showing them to have a
stronger bite than other large dog breed. In fact, when Dr. Brady Barr of National Geographic
(Dangerous Encounters: Bite Force, 8/18/2005) measured the bite forces of three dog breeds using a
computerised bite sleeve. The American Pit Bull Terrier generated the least amount of pressure of the 3
dogs tested (the other two dogs were a German Shepherd Dog and a Rottweiler).

Urban myths

There are many urban legends surrounding the pitbull terrier, mostly based on the idea that the dogs are
somehow physiologically different to other breeds of dog.

Many websites propagate the myth that pit bulls have a "locking jaw" mechanism, and that the dog
cannot let go once it has bitten. However, as stated by Dr. I. Brisbin (University of Georgia) "The few
studies which have been conducted of the structure of the skulls, mandibles and teeth of pit bulls show
that, in proportion to their size, their jaw structure and thus its inferred functional morphology, is no
different than that of any breed of dog. There is absolutely no evidence for the existence of any kind of
'locking mechanism' unique to the structure of the jaw and/or teeth of the American Pit Bull Terrier."
Furthermore, the pit bulls that compete successfully in protection sports such as Schutzhund obviously
do not display an inability to release their grips after biting, as releasing the decoy's sleeve on command
is an integral part of scoring the competition [3].

Another urban myth surrounding this breed states that pitbulls are the only type of dog that are not
affected by capsaicin-based dog-repellent sprays. In fact, many other dog breeds also display this
resistance to pepper spray when they are attacking. Documented cases include Bull Mastiffs, Rotweillers
and many German Shepherds (including Police K9s)[4]. In the words of two Police Officers, it is "not
unusual for pepper spray not to work on dogs"[5] and "just as OC spray doesn't work on all humans, it
won't work on all canines"[6].

It is also untrue that the pitbull is the only dog that will keep attacking after being sub-lethally shot.
Rotweillers, Mastiffs and German Shepherds have all exhibited this capacity - as, of course, have many
humans[7] [8].

Some more extreme myths hold that Bullets bounce off a pitbulls body which stray to far from the truth.
The strength of a pitbull is also greatly exaggerated in many myths.
Insurance discrimination

Many homeowner's insurance companies in the U.S. are reluctant to insure owners of dogs that are
considered to be a dangerous breed. The CDC estimates that 368,245 persons were treated in U.S.
hospitals for nonfatal dog bites in 2001, and that fully 2% of the U.S. population are attacked by dogs
per year. These attacks most often occur on the owner's property. While breed-specific statistics were
not collected in this particular study, the Pit Bull Terrier and Rottweiler in particular are often
considered to contribute the most to the serious injuries caused by dog attacks and are the most common
breeds that insurance companies will refuse to insure.

Some insurance companies have taken a compromise position, and will only insure Pit bull owners if
their dogs have achieved a Canine Good Citizen award [9].

Laws

In response to a number of well-publicized incidents involving pit bulls, some jurisdictions began
placing restrictions on the ownership of pit bulls, such as the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 in the UK, an
example of breed-specific legislation. Many jurisdictions have outlawed the possession of pit bulls,
either the pit bull breed specifically, or in addition to other breeds that are regarded as dangerous.

Recent pit bull mauling cases include the June 2005 attack on 11-year old Nicholas Faibish, who was
killed by his family's dog in San Francisco while his mother was away running errands. This case, and
others occurring shortly afterwards in the Bay Area, has led local and state politicians to consider ways
to control pit bulls.

The Canadian province province of Ontario, on August 29, 2005 enacted a ban on pit bulls. It was the
first province or state in North America to do so.[10] The breed can no longer be sold, bred, or imported
and all pit bull owners must leash and muzzle their pit bulls in public. A 60 day grace period has been
put in place to allow for owners to have their pit bulls spayed or neutered [11]. Also it left a period to
allow municipalities to adjust to the new law. Prior to the bills passage, the Ontario government cited
what it deemed the success of a pit bull bylaw passed by Winnipeg, Manitoba[12].

One American city to follow this lead is Denver, which recently passed legislation prohibiting citizens
from keeping "pit bull type" dogs after May 9, 2005. Over 260 pit bull type dogs have been collected
from their homes and euthanised since this date, resulting in widespread protest from dog owners and
animal rights lobby groups [13].

Debate

The extent to which banning a particular breed is effective in reducing dog bite fatalities is contested.
Some people maintain that pit bull attacks are directly attributable to irresponsible owners, rather than to
any inherent defect in the breed itself. Other people believe that the pit bull terrier is a breed that,
although not inherently dangerous, needs a particularly knowledgeable and committed handler and
should not be freely available to novice owners. Still others maintain that pit bulls as a breed are
invariably more unpredictable and dangerous than other dogs even when properly trained, and have no
place in society.

Pit bull terriers are said to be popular with irresponsible owners, who see these dogs as a symbol of
status or machismo. This type of owner may be less likely to socialize, train, or desex their pet. These
are all factors that have been shown to contribute to increased likelihood of dog aggression, and may
partially explain why pit bulls feature so heavily in dog attack statistics.

Some people argue that banning the pit bull will simply result in irresponsible dog owners seeking to
own other large breeds with similar temperaments (such as the Dobermann, Rottweiler or German
Shepherd Dog), resulting in an increased occurrence of dog bites from these breeds. It is possible that
the Pit Bull has a particular appeal to many irresponsible dog owners because of its smaller size. An
unruly pit bull can be restrained on a leash by an average adult, where a larger dog breed would easily
overpower the owner's restraint.

The Centers for Disease Control, which maintains the nation's database on fatal wounds inflicted by dog
bites, does not advocate breed-specific legislation, instead encouraging "Dangerous Dog" laws that focus
on individual dogs of any breed that have exhibited aggressive behavior.

In November 2002, the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that there was no genetic evidence that one
individual dog is more dangerous than another, simply because of its breed.

American Airlines banned "Rottweilers, Doberman Pinschers, American Staffordshire Terriers, Bull
Terriers, American Pit Bull Terriers, and any mixed breeds containing one or more of those breeds" in
August of 2002 following an incident involving an American Pit Bull Terrier puppy that escaped from
luggage into the cargo hold of an airliner, causing damage to the cargo hold. The American Kennel Club
lobbied the airline to lift the restriction, arguing that the incident was merely one of improper restrain,
and could have involved any dog breed. The restriction was lifted in May of 2003 after a compromise
was reached that requires portable dog carriers in the cargo hold to employ releasable cable ties on four
corners of the door of the carrier.

Dog fights
In the United States, pit bulls are the breed of choice for dog fights, due to their strength, courage and
dog-aggressive tendencies. Although dog fighting is illegal in the U.S., it is still practiced, and is usually
accompanied by gambling. Pit bulls are often brutalised and abused to make them "mean", and may be
terribly maimed or killed during the fight [14]. In the state of Virginia,it is illegal to be a spectator in a
dogfight.

People who train pit bulls to fight usually prepare them for fighting by having them pull weighted sleds
and run on specially designed treadmills. The term "game-bred" may be used as a code for a fight dog,
but sometimes merely refers to a dog that is very determined to complete a task - be it a race, weight
pull, or unfortunately even a fight.

Breeding human or dog aggressive pit bulls is sometimes associated with the hip hop culture, which
consider it a status symbol to own the toughest dog [15].

Dog-fighters are the minority among pit bull owners. Most people who own these breeds direct their
dogs' plentiful energy toward nonviolent athletic tasks. Some people train their pit bulls for dog agility.
Others involve their pit bulls in weight pulling competitions, obedience competitions or schutzhund. The
pit bull often excels at these sports. Out of the 17 dogs who have earned UKC "superdog" status (by
gaining championship titles in conformation, obedience, agility, and weightpull), nine have been pit
bulls. Unfortunately pit bulls are increasingly being prevented from participating in these events, due to
the introduction of local legislation requiring the breed to be muzzled and on leash at all times when in
public - with no exceptions for dog sports or obedience competitions.

Often much money is confiscated during a dogfight,often drugs are also involved.

A few centuries ago,it was common to Pit these dogs against Pumas and wolves. Pitting them against
boars is still carried out in some places.

Positive press
Although negative information about pit bulls is widespread, there are also many positive stories. Some
work in hospitals and care facilities as certified therapy dogs, many are well-loved family pets, and some
have even saved people's lives. There are many incidences of pit bull terriers being productively
employed by U.S. Customs [16], as police K9s [17] and as tracking K9s in various Search and Rescue
organisations [18].

The Dachshund is a short-legged, elongated dog breed of the hound family. The breed's name is
German and literally means "badger dog" (der Dachs - badger; der Hund - dog). The breed was
developed to scent, chase, hunt, and kill badgers and other hole-dwelling animals. Due to their long,
narrow build, they are sometimes referred to in the United States and elsewhere as "wiener dogs" or
"sausage dogs".

Appearance




                                    Black and tan Miniature smooth-haired dachshund

A full-sized Dachshund averages 12 to 24 lb (5 to 10 kg), while the Miniature variety typically weighs
less than 12 lb (5 kg). Modern Dachshunds are characterized by their crooked legs, loose skin and barrel-
like chest, attributes that were deliberately added to the breed to increase their ability to burrow into
tight spaces. They come in three coat varieties: Smooth, Longhaired and Wirehaired; the Wirehaired
variety is generally shorter in spine length than the other two. H. L. Mencken said that "A dachshund is a
half-dog high and a dog-and-a-half long," which is their main claim to fame.

Temperament
Dachshunds are loyal, playful fun dogs, known for their propensity to chase small animals and birds.
According to the American Kennel Club's breed standards, "the Dachshund is clever, lively and
courageous to the point of rashness, persevering in above and below ground work, with all the senses
well-developed. Any display of shyness is a serious fault."[1] Individuals which are indulged may
become snappy[2]. Coat type is often considered to be associated with characteristic temperaments; the
long-haired variety, for instance, is considered to be less excitable than the other types because it was
cross-bred with the Spaniel to obtain its characteristic long coat. Some who own long-haired
Dachshunds might disagree with this statement, however. Because of the breed's characteristic barrel-
like chest, the dachshund's lungs are unusually large, making for a sonorous bark.

Health
The breed is known to have spinal problems, due in part to an extremely long spinal column and short
rib cage. The risk of injury can be worsened by obesity, which places greater strain on the vertebrae. In
order to prevent injury, it is recommended that Dachshunds be discouraged from jumping and taking
stairs. It has become increasingly apparent that the occurrence and severity of these problems is largely
hereditary, and responsible breeders are working to eliminate this characteristic in the breed.

History




                                 Wire-haired Dachshund

Some have theorized that the early roots of the Dachshund go back to Ancient Egypt, where engravings
were made featuring short-legged hunting dogs. But in its modern incarnation, the Dachshund is a
creation of European breeders, and includes elements of German, French and English hounds and
terriers. Dachshunds have been kept by royal courts all over Europe, including that of Queen Victoria,
who was particularly enamored of the breed.

The first verifiable references to the Dachshund, originally named the "Tachs Kriecher" (badger crawler)
or "Tachs Krieger" (badger catcher), come from books written in the early 1700s. Prior to that, there
exist references to "badger dogs" and "hole dogs", but these likely refer to purposes rather than to
specific breeds. The original German Dachshunds were larger than the modern full-size variety,
weighing between 30 and 40 lb (14 to 18 kg), and originally came in straight-legged and crook-legged
varieties (the modern Dachshund is descended from the latter). Though the breed is famous for its use in
exterminating badgers, Dachshunds were also commonly used for rabbit and fox hunting, for locating
wounded deer, and in packs were known to hunt game as large as wild boar.
Dominant colors and patterns include Red and Black & Tan. Older traditional patterns such as piebald
and sable are recently gaining in popularity. Recently, other color and pattern combinations have been
developed; it is not uncommon to see Dachshunds with Brown & Tan, Chocolate & Tan, dapple, double
dapple, and even white coats. Unfortunately, some of these colors require extensive inbreeding to obtain;
double dapples are often born eyeless or with severely underdeveloped eyes. For this reason, the double
dapple coat is extremely disfavored among responsible breeders and owners.

According to kennel club standards, the Miniature variety differs from the full-size only by size and
weight.

Miscellaneous

Symbol of Germany

Dachshunds have traditionally been viewed as a symbol of Germany, despite their pan-European
heritage. During World War I the animals fell so far out of favor in England and the United States that
dachshunds were stoned to death on the street [3]. Many Americans began referring to Dachshunds as
"liberty pups", and political cartoonists commonly used the image of the Dachshund to ridicule
Germany. The stigma of the association was revived to a much reduced extent during World War II, and
it quickly faded away following the war's end. German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel was also known
for keeping Dachshunds.

The Dachshund for this association with Germany was chosen to be the first official mascot for 1972
Summer Olympics with the name "Waldi"

Dachshund Racing

One of the odder controversies that has recently arisen in North America is the presence of Dachshund
racing events.

This sport originated in a 1993 Miller Lite television commercial that listed odd possibilities for sports
(including luge bowling), and has grown immensely in popularity since. It was featured in a half-time
show for the San Francisco 49ers. You can see the commercial at the "Wiener Takes All" homepage (see
external links below).

While some compare the sport to that of English and later American Greyhound racing, others see it
having the possibility of harming the breed from strain placed on its spinal column. Others also see the
possibility for abuse of racing Dachshunds, as evidenced by the large number of Greyhounds put to
sleep every year once they have proven unsuitable for racing, and by those given up for adoption.

                              Notes



The Pomeranian is a breed of dog in the spitz family, named for the Pomerania region of Poland and
East Germany, and classed as a toy dog breed because of its small size.


Appearance




                                  Sable Pom's face

At an average of 3 to 7 lb (1.4 to 3.2 kg) according to AKC standards, the Pomeranian (Pom) is the most
diminutive of the northern breeds.

The head of the Pomeranian is wedge-shaped, making it somewhat foxy in appearance. The ears are
large and pointed. Its tail is characterstic of the breed and should be turned over the back and carried flat,
set high.

The Pom's coat is its glory, two coats, an undercoat and a top coat; the first is soft, thick, and fluffy; the
latter is a long, perfectly straight and glistening coat covering the whole body. The undercoat is shed
during warm weather conditions.

The AKC recognizes thirteen colors or color combinations: black, black & tan, blue, blue & tan,
chocolate, chocolate & tan, cream, cream sable, orange, orange sable, red, red sable, and sable. The
AKC also recognizes five "alternative" colors: Beaver, brindle, chocolate sable, white, and wolf sable.

At least one breed standard calls for a cobby, balanced dog. A cobby dog is a long or shorter than he is
tall; try to picture him as a circle in a square. A balanced Pomeranian fits together logically and in
proportion. For instance, a small, delicately boned Pom with a large head looks unbalanced because his
head type doesn't match his body type. A balanced Pom displays legs in proportion to his body: neither
so short as to make him appear dumpy nor so long as to make him look like he is walking on stilts.

The standard also calls for an expression that imparts great intelligence, showing that the Pom has an
alert character and that he behaves accordingly. The pom's alertness makes it a superb watchdog.

Temperament
The Pom is an active dog who is intelligent, courageous, and a loyal companion. The Pomeranian may
not interact well with small children, and due to its small size can suffer abuse from children.

Pomeranians have proven themselves to be excellent watchdogs by announcing intruders with loud,
sharp barks.

The Pomeranian easily adapts to life in the city, and is an excellent dog for country living with its strong
hunting instincts from its wild ancestors.

History
The Pomeranian originated from the sled dogs of Iceland and Lapland, which were eventually brought
into Europe. The Germans improved the coat and bred the dogs down for city living, but they were still
20 pounds or more when they reached England.




                                 An orange-sable Pomeranian

English breeders, through trial and error and Mendelian theories, are credited for reducing the dog's size
and developing the many colors. The Pomeranian of today is small due to selective breeding, but the
breed still retains the hardy disposition and thick coat typical of dogs in cold climates.

The Pomeranian became internationally popular when Queen Victoria returned from vacation in
Florence, Italy with a Pomeranian named Marco.
The closest relatives of the Pomeranian are the Norwegian Elkhound, the Samoyed, the Schipperke, and
the whole Spitz group.

Health
Pomeranians are generally a healthy, hardy, and long-lived breed—often, Poms live 15 or 16 years.

The teeth of the Pomeranian can be the cause of serious health concerns for the breed. The teeth must be
meticulously cared for through frequent cleaning to prevent the teeth from falling out at a rather early
age. Problems with the teeth can cause heart problems which may lead to an early death.

Pomeranians are known to have a higher likelihood of suffering from seizures either from idiopathic
epilepsy or hypoglycemia

Another common ailment is a dislocated patella.

The Briard is a large breed of dog, one of many herding breeds.




                            Black Briard

Appearance
The Briard can be any of several different solid colors or lighter colors with darker or light ears and face.
Briards stand 22 to 27 inches (58 to 69 cm) at the withers. Ear cropping has been common in the breed,
although more breeders are leaving the ears in their natural state since ear cropping is becoming illegal
in most European countries, including the Briard's land of origin, France. Their long coat requires an
extensive amount of grooming.

They were originally bred to herd as well as guard flocks of sheep. And they were often left to their own
devices in order to accomplish their assigned tasks. Which makes the Briard different from those breeds
that only guard and those that only herd. The breeds that just herd are often smaller in size, agile, and
swift of foot. Those breeds that just guard are usually larger and heavier.

The breed characteristics of the Briard, are of a medium sized, rugged, agile dog, having harsh coat and
double dew claws mounted low on each rear leg, resembling additional toes. Each double dew claw
should have bone substance and nail, giving the appearance of a wider rear foot. Bred for centuries to
herd, the additional digits on each rear foot give the Briard the ability of pivoting on one foot for quick
turns and complete turn arounds, which are necessary when herding and guarding their flocks.

He should be a well balanced animal, sound in body and mind, and of a size appropriate for both herding
and guarding without tiring. He was asked to keep his flock within a designated area by guarding the
perimeter, constantly keeping his flock within and keeping danger out. A large heavy type dog would
soon tire from the constant running, and may not to able to keep the flock together nor keep danger away.

Throughout history, the Briard has retained an appropriate balance of size and build that is required for
both herding and protection of their flocks. The size, not too large to tire during the task of herding, and
their build (structure), large enough to fend off predators such as fox and wolves.

Their Characteristics

The Briard is a very loyal and protective breed. Once they have bonded to their family members, they
will protect them at all cost. Said to be aloof with strangers, any and all new introductions should be on
their terms and not forced upon them. This may also include such items as furniture or the addition of a
new baby into the household. Show them that the new intrusion is friendly and free of conflict.
Something has changed within their world, and they must to taught that it is a good thing and not
harmful. They have proven to be a very good breed to have around children of all ages.

Being aloof with strangers, it is important that the Briard be introduced to several different individuals of
all ages and in all types of situations. Socialization starting at a very young age is mandatory. Take your
Briard puppy with you as often as possible, to as many different places as possible, and they will
develop into a well rounded animal. Pet stores, city parks and malls are a good place to start. Do not let
this section scare you away from the Briard breed. Just remember that the Briard has been bred for
centuries to herd and to protect their flocks. To them, their family is the flock and all strangers may
appear to be predators. So letting them know that the public in general are friendly and not harmful, will
help them establish a lifelong socialization pattern which will result in an outgoing and happy dog. And
this socialization with the public in general will not diminish their capacity for protecting and guarding
their family.

The Briard has a very good memory. Once a lesson is learned, good or bad, they will retain this
knowledge for a long time to come. Sometimes they may appear to be strong minded and stubborn, but,
these are a few of the Briard's characteristics. Remember. They were bred for centuries to think for
themselves and to act upon their conclusions. These are some of the traits that the Briard has retained
throughout history. Even if your Briard is a city dweller, they have a degree of herding ability within
them. If ever, during their lifetime, they are introduced to sheep, you will be amazed at the reaction from
your family pet. We have witnessed this several times, when a Briard from the city is taken to the
country to a herding event. Once the dog is placed with the sheep, you will not believe that this is the
same dog that you arrived with. Most Briards will automatically start doing what they were bred to do,
herd.

If your Briard has been socialized and has bonded to all family members, you will possess a loving
companion that will protect your family and property for their entire lifespan. They will return to you
and yours a love that can never be surpassed. A devotion, a love and commitment that we have never
witnessed prior to the Briard. Even the Labrador Retriever will not come close to the Briard. A person
can ignore a Labrador when sitting in the living room watching television. A Briard will NOT let you
ignore them. They will come and sit next to you and ask for a pat, pet or to be rubbed behind the ears.
You cannot ingore a Briard !
If you are looking for an obedient dog for top notch obedience, then I suggest the Labrador or a Sheltie.
If you are looking for a lifelong friend and companion, with a devotional love, that will protect your
family and love them until their very last breath, than the Briard is right for you. To several Briards,
obedience on a grand scale may show through, but, most of the time on their terms. A person can
actually sit and watch the Briard think out any given situation before they act upon it.

If you would like to own a dog that is very very smart, loyal, loving and protective, the Briard may be
the right breed for you. Sometimes a gentleman, but always a clown, the Briard definitely lives up to the
expression, "A Heart Wrapped in Fur".

                             Notes



West Highland White Terriers are a breed of dog known for their spirited personality and brilliant
white coat; their devotees often call them simply Westies. They are friendly, good with children, and
thrive on lots of attention. Like most terriers, they have plenty of attitude (some might say "spirit") for a
dog their size. This breed is commonly recognized because it is used as a mascot for Black & White (a
brand of Scotch whisky) and for Caesar brand dog food.

Appearance
They typically weigh about 15 to 22 pounds (7.5–10 kg) and their average height is 11 inches (28 cm) at
the shoulder. Their tails, short naturally, should never be docked and are held upright. They have a soft
undercoat and a rough outer coat, about 2" long, that requires regular grooming. Some Westies have
"brandy stains" on their backs and/or feet, but this is undesirable in show/breeding specimens.

Temperament




This breed, descended from working terriers, has a lot of energy, tenacity, and aggression towards its
prey, which was originally the fox and other, smaller animals such as squirrels. They need regular
exercise, and despite their small size they do not make good apartment pets. Their personality is more
excitable than even some other terriers. They are alert and consider themselves guard dogs, although
their size prevents them from providing any real intimidation. They are independent thinkers with no
small amount of self-esteem, and must be trained firmly from an early age. If not raised with other cats
and dogs from an early age, they may be aggressive towards such animals later in life.

Like all dogs, the Westie responds better to love and gentleness than to cruelty. As with most terriers,
harsh training methods are often met only with stubbornness.

Physical health




Westies' usually have issues with dry skin. Bathing a Westie too frequently only creates and/or enhances
problems with dry skin. Washing once a month or on a longer interval will keep the dog clean, but will
not generate issues with dry skin. Washing with a detergent-free, baby-oriented, or another soft skin
shampoo will help keep a Westie's skin hydrated.

Many of these dogs have skin allergies, and as a result they can be troubled by skin and fur disorders.
Flea bites can trigger a skin disease which can result in the dog losing fur from the affected area of its
body.

These dogs have two coats. The dense undercoat of short hairs, this is to keep the dog warm in cold
weather. If this undercoat falls out because of disease then the dog will need a dog coat to keep it warm.

The outer coat is less dense and contains longer hairs.

History
                                             Westie wearing the Clan Campbell tartan of the Duke of
Argyll (with a Kilted companion)

Westies are descended from Cairn Terriers, who occasionally whelped white puppies naturally, and
Scottish Terriers; who also occasionally produced white offspring. White offspring from other British
Terriers such as the Bedlington Terrier were occasionally introduced to the bloodline for desired
characteristics, but this practice generally stopped in the 1850s. Some sources credit Colonel Edward
Donald Malcolm and his kin of Poltalloch, in the Argyll region of Western Scotland as the originator of
this breed in the 1800s. Other sources credit the Duke of Argyll (Chieftan of Clan Campbell) as the
originator of the breed. It may have taken as long as a hundred years of selective breeding to produce all
the desired qualities. Their white coat made them highly visible when hunting on the Scottish moors and
easily distinguished them from their game. They also possess keen intelligence and a sturdy frame.
Originally the breed was known as Poltalloch Terriers, although they were also known as Roseneath
Terriers, White Roseneath Terriers, and at the end of the 19th century, briefly as a white variety of the
Scottish Terrier.

                                The Cardigan's ears (left) are somewhat larger than the Pembroke's.




                                The Cardigan Corgi's tail is never docked.




                                The Pembroke Corgi's tail is often docked, and its ears are smaller.

The Welsh Corgi (IPA: / kɔ(r) gi/) is a dog breed that originated in Wales. They are believed to be
descended from Swedish Vallhund dogs that came to Wales with the Vikings. Cor gi means "dwarf dog"
in Welsh (and the OED gives the Welsh plural corgwn as an alternative to corgis).

An average Welsh Corgi is around 10 to 12 in (250 to 300 mm) tall at the tallest point in the shoulders
and weighs approximately 30 lb (15 kg). Originally bred for herding sheep and cattle, Corgis are active
dogs, and considered very intelligent. They have proven themselves excellent companion animals and
are outstanding competitors in sheepdog trials and agility trials.
Welsh Corgis are generally recognized as two distinct breeds: the Cardigan and the Pembroke. For
example, beginning in 1934, the American Kennel Club recognized them as separate breeds. The
Cardigan is the larger of the two, with larger rounded ears and a foxy, flowing tail. The Pembroke
features rounded, pointed ears and is somewhat smaller in stature. The tails of Pembrokes are
traditionally docked to a flat-lying stub, making them appear tailless.The coats of both breeds come in a
variety of colors, although there are some differences between the breeds.

The Pembroke was made popular by Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, who keeps four at all
times, and remains the more common variety. It is also the breed of dog of the character Ein in the
popular anime, Cowboy Bebop.

For more details about each breed, see the breed-specific pages:

    ●   Welsh Corgi (Pembroke)
    ●   Welsh Corgi (Cardigan)

Corgis in movies and television
    ●   Little Dog Lost, a 1963 Disney movie, is centered on "Candy," who gets separated from his
        family, and must go on a journey to find them
    ●   "Edward", played by Bud, has a prominent role in the 1988 film The Accidental Tourist (Bud
        also appeared in the television show Dharma & Greg and the feature film Dave)
    ●   The 1991 motion picture Don't Tell Mom The Babysitter's Dead features "Elvis"
    ●   Bud and Cody, brothers, are the best buddies of the First Lady "Ellen Mitchell" (played by
        Sigourney Weaver) in the 1993 movie Dave

                                               Bird Dog
                                                                                  Back | Home | Up | Next


A bird dog is a gun dog used to hunt or retrieve birds.

Other uses:

    ●   A man who steals another man's girlfriend or date, as in The Everly Brothers's song "Bird Dog",
        possibly referring to slang terms for women as chicks and other bird-related terms.
    ●   The Cessna L-19 Bird Dog, an airplane named for its use, similar to that of bird dogs, in scouting
        the area (reconnassiance).
    ●   A referral fee, or "bird dog fee", is sometimes used in business. If Jake hires a company to
        perform some type of service and then recommends the company to Chester, who then hires the
        company and gives Jake as a reference, the company may give Jake a bird dog fee as a bonus for
        "retrieving" a new customer.
    ●   A regional baseball scout. "Bird dogs" are generally not team employees but instead are members
        of a network of contacts established by a full-time area scout, and earn fees by suggesting youth
        players worth watching to the team.
    ●   In athletics, especially football, a drill in which a specific movement or play is walked through on
        a step-by-step basis.

                                             A veterinary surgeon removes stitches from a cat's face
following minor surgery on an abcess.

In American and Canadian English, a veterinarian (from Latin veterinae, "draught animals") is an
animal doctor, a practitioner of veterinary medicine. The equivalent term in British English is
veterinary surgeon, and both terms are often shortened to vet. The word veterinarian was first used in
English by the doctor Sir Thomas Browne (1605–1682).

Perhaps the most popular depiction of this kind of doctor at work is in the autobiographical books by
James Herriot and the television adaptation, All Creatures Great and Small.Overview

While a veterinarian does hold a doctoral degree in veterinary medicine (in the United States and
Canada, at least), not all veterinarians enter clinical practice. Those that do still have a wide range of
options: companion animal or "pet" medicine (dogs, cats, rabbits, ferrets, etc), "exotic" animal medicine
(various rodents, sugar gliders, possums, hedgehogs, reptiles), reptile medicine, ratite medicine,
livestock medicine, equine medicine (sports or race track or show or rodeo, etc.), or laboratory animal
medicine, to name a few. Those who do not may enter a research field, studying an area of medical,
veterinary medical, or pharmacological research. Research veterinarians were the first to isolate
oncoviruses, Salmonella species, Brucella species, and various other pathogenic agents. They also
helped conquer malaria and yellow fever, solved the mystery of botulism, produced an anticoagulant
used to treat some people with heart disease, and defined and developed surgical techniques for humans,
such as hip-joint replacement and limb and organ transplants.

Like all physicians, veterinarians must make ethical judgments, such as whether or not to perform
debarking procedures. There is also ongoing discussion over the ethics of performing procedures such as
declawing cats and cropping the ears of dogs. In some countries, these procedures are illegal.
Regulatory medicine
Some veterinarians work in a field called regulatory medicine — ensuring the nation's food safety by
working with the USDA FSIS, or protecting us from imported exotic animal diseases by working for the
USDA APHIS. The emerging field of conservation medicine involves veterinarians even more directly
with human health care, providing a multidisciplinary approach to medical research that also involves
environmental scientists.

Education
More than 3800 veterinarians in the USA currently work at veterinary schools, teaching student vets
what they need to know to graduate — so teaching is another career path.




                                 A good veterinarian enjoys working with animals and their owners.

Admission into veterinary medical school is competitive. According to the US Department of Labor, 1
in 3 applicants was accepted into a veterinary program in 2002. Prerequisites for admission include the
undergraduate studies listed under veterinary medicine and extensive veterinary experience (typically
about 500 or more hours) in private practice or other veterinary environment. The average veterinary
medical student has an undergraduate GPA of 3.5 and a GRE score of approximately 1800.

There is some reciprocal international recognition of veterinary degrees. For example veterinarians with
degrees from the UK or New Zealand are immediately allowed to practice in Australia whereas vets
with degrees from other countries are usually required to pass a set of qualifying exams before being
allowed to practice. Australia currently has 5 Universities offering veterinary degrees - University of
Sydney, Murdoch University, Melbourne University, University of Queensland, and Charles Sturt
University. A sixth University is preparing for its first intake of vet students at the end of 2005 - James
Cook University


Government
Public health medicine is another option for veterinarians. Veterinarians in government and private
laboratories provide diagnostic and testing services. Some veterinarians serve as state epidemiologists,
directors of environmental health, and directors of state or city public health departments. Veterinarians
are also employed by the US Agriculture Research Service, Fish and Wildlife Service, Environmental
Protection Agency, National Library of Medicine, and National Institutes of Health. The military also
employs veterinarians in a number of capacities — caring for pets on military bases, caring for military
working animals, and controlling various arthropod-borne diseases or other such things.

                                            Coprophagia
                                                                                   Back | Home | Up | Next


Coprophagia is the consumption of feces, from the Greek copros (feces) and phagein (eat). Many
animal species have evolved to practice coprophagia; other species do not normally consume feces but
may do so under unusual conditions. Only in rare cases is it practiced by humans.

Evolved coprophagia




                                  Two butterflies feed on a small lump of feces lying on a rock.

Coprophagous insects consume and redigest the feces of large animals; these feces contain substantial
amounts of semi-digested food. (Herbivore digestive systems are especially inefficient.) Many species
exist, the most famous probably being the scarab, sacred in ancient Egypt, and the most ubiquitous being
the fly.

Pigs, like the above insects, will eat the feces of herbivores that leave a significant amount of
semidigested matter. In certain cultures it was common for poor families to collect horse feces to feed
their pigs. Pigs are also known to eat their own feces and even human feces as well. However,
domesticated pigs should not be allowed to eat any sort of feces, as this contributes to the risk of parasite
infection. Muslims cite this behavior as a prime reason why they do not eat pork.

Rabbits, cavies (guinea pigs) and related species do not have the complicated ruminant digestive system.
Instead they extract more nutrition from grass by giving their food a second pass through the gut. Soft
caecal pellets of partially digested food are excreted and generally consumed immediately. They also
produce normal droppings, which are not re-eaten.

Young elephants eat the feces of their mother to obtain the necessary bacteria for the proper digestion of
the vegetation found on the savannah. When they are born, their intestines do not contain these bacteria.
Without them, these elephants would be unable to get any nutritional value from plants.

Hamsters eat their own droppings; this is thought to be a source of vitamins B and K, produced by
bacteria in the gut. Apes have been observed eating horse droppings for the salt. Monkeys have been
observed to eat elephant droppings.

Cures for Animals

Several companies produce food additives that can be added to the troublesome animal's food to make
its feces taste excessively bad.

Theories on Dogs
Coprophagia is a behavior sometimes observed, with considerable disgust, by dog owners. Hofmeister,
Cumming, and Dhein (2001) write that this behavior in animals has not been well-researched, and they
are (as of this writing) preparing a study. In a preliminary online paper, they write that there are various
theories explaining why animals consume other animals' feces. According to various theories—none
proven or disproven—dogs might do this:

     ●   To get attention from their owners.
     ●   From anxiety, stress, or having been punished for bad behaviors.
     ●   From boredom.
     ●   In an attempt to clean up in crowded conditions.
     ●   When dogs observe their owners picking up feces, and imitate this behavior (allelomimetic
         behavior). This is highly improbable because the behaviour has also been observed in
         environments where owners never picked up the dog's (or other) feces.
     ●   Because puppies taste everything and discover that feces are edible and, perhaps, tasty, especially
         when fed a high fat content diet.
     ●   Because dogs are, by nature, scavengers, and this is within the range of scavenger behavior.
     ●   To prevent the scent from attracting predators, especially mother dogs eating their offsprings'
         feces.
     ●   Because the texture and temperature of fresh feces approximates that of regurgitated food, which
         is how canine mothers in the wild would provide solid food.
     ●   Because of the protein content of the feces (particularly cat feces), or over-feeding, leading to
         large concentrations of undigested matter in the feces.
     ●   Due to assorted health problems, including:
              ❍ Pancreatitis

              ❍ Intestinal infections

              ❍ Food allergies, creating mal-absorption

     ●   Because they are hungry, such as when eating routines are changed, food is withheld, or nutrients
         aren't properly absorbed.

Another theory proposes that carnivores sometimes eat the feces of their prey in order to ingest and
exude scents which camouflage their own.

The Australian Cattle Dog (ACD), also known as the Queensland Heeler, Blue Heeler, and Red
Heeler, is a herding dog developed in Australia for controlling cattle. It is a medium-sized dog with a lot
of energy and an independent streak.
Appearance




                                 One variant of Blue face markings

The Cattle Dog's coat comes in a variety of markings, sometimes quite striking. The basic coat colors are
blue and red speckle. For dog owners whose interest is primarily in their qualification for dog shows,
even markings are preferred over uneven markings, and large solid-color marks on the body are
undesirable. For owners who are more interested in their dogs' performance in activities such as herding
or dog sports, the breed's strong work ethic and intelligence are of more importance than the exact coat
markings.

The mask is one of the most distinctive features of an ACD. This mask consists of a darker red patch
over one or both eyes (for the red speckle coat color) or a black patch over one or both eyes (for the blue
coat color). These are called, respectively, single mask and double mask. ACDs without a mask are
called plain-faced. Any of these is correct according to the breed standard, and the only limitation is the
owner's preference.




                                 Red speckle coat color with undocked tail

Many Australian Cattle Dogs have a stripe of white hair in the center of the forehead, usually 1/2 inch to
1 inch by 2 inches to 3 inches (about 2 cm by 7 cm) called the Bentley Mark. This is similar in
appearance to the blaze markings sometimes found on horses. According to legend, a popular dog
owned by Tom Bentley passed on this distinctive mark to all Australian Cattle Dogs.
A female Australian Cattle Dog should measure about 17 to 19 inches (43 to 48 cm) at the withers. A
male Australian Cattle Dog should measure about 18 to 20 inches (46 to 51 cm) at the withers. An ACD
is a well-muscled, compact dog with a short, dense coat and a naturally long tail. An ACD in good
condition should weigh roughly 40 to 50 pounds (18 to 23 kg).

Some breeders dock ACD's tails. This is a controversial practice and, in some countries, is illegal or is
prohibited for dogs in the show ring. Docking Australian Cattle Dogs' tails is a practice peculiar to the
United States - ACD tails are not docked in their country of origin, Australia. This is not to be confused
with the Stumpy-tailed Cattle Dog, which is born with a naturally docked, or 'bobbed' tail; this animal
strongly resembles the ACD in colouring, but has a slightly taller, leaner conformation.

Temperament
Like many herding dogs, Cattle Dogs have high energy levels and active minds. They need plenty of
exercise and a job to do, such as participating in dog sports, learning tricks, or other activities that
engage their minds. Some individuals find repetitive training frustrating and dull, so owners should aim
to make training sessions varied and more exciting in order to keep their dog interested. Cattle Dogs
who do not receive the appropriate exercise and entertainment will invent their own, often destructive,
activities. These dogs are, by nature, timid or wary. They are naturally cautious, and grow more so as
they age. Their cautious nature towards strangers make them perfect guard dogs, when trained for this
task.

Cattle Dogs drive cattle by nipping at their heels, but they have also been known to herd other animals,
such as ducks or chickens without instruction when left to their own devices. When around people, their
instinct to herd is sometimes hard to suppress and they can nip at people to herd them. If these dogs will
be around children, they and their owners must have sufficient training to know how to manage or avoid
such situations.

Australian Cattle Dog activities
                                 ACDs need and enjoy any activity, such as diving and swimming.

Australian Cattle Dogs not only tolerate a high level of physical activity, they almost demand it. Like
many other herding dog breeds, they have active and fertile minds that turn mischievous if not properly
channeled. ACDs are highly intelligent and can be very bossy.


When not active, an ACD can be kept occupied with mental puzzles such as a Kong stuffed with treats
or a Buster Cube. Among the most popular activities for Australian Cattle Dogs is dog agility. While the
ACD is ideally suited for this work, since it is a herding breed and thus very reactive to the handler's
body language, some ACDs become easily frustrated at the repetition and routine necessary to hone
agility skills. As for many breeds, frequent brief training sessions are more effective than infrequent long
training sessions. For this reason, many handlers find training an ACD to be challenging. It is important
to always change the methods and exercises and not allow the dog or handler to get into a rut. ACDs
thrive on change and new experiences.




                                 An ACD finding a scent article as part of obedience competition.

Only a few ACDs, therefore, have excelled in obedience competition

For example, the American Kennel Club awards an "Obedience Trial Championship" (OTCh) to the dog-
and-handler team that defeats a large number of other teams in open competition. A handful of ACDs
have reached this level. While ACDs enjoy the challenge of obedience competition, such as retrieving a
scented article, the majority of ACDs are easily bored with precision drilling.

The Bouvier des Flandres is a dog breed originating in Flanders. They are used for general farm work
including cattle droving, sheep herding, cart pulling, and as guard dogs, police dogs, and security dogs,
as well as being kept as pets. It can be noted that usage of the French name (meaning, literally,
"Herdsman of Flanders") is contradictory with the Flemish origin of the breed; in Flemish, they are
known as Koehond, or cattle dog. Other names for the breed are Toucheur de Boeuf and Vuilbaard (dirty
beard).

Appearance
Their weight ranges from 80 to 125 pounds; they are powerfully built, with a thick double coat, which
can be fawn, black, grey brindle, or "pepper and salt" in colour.

History
The history of this dog is tied to war. During World War I, Bouviers were used by the French for war
efforts, from getting messages to the front to hauling equipment. By the end of the war, the Bouvier
population was severely depleted and in jeopardy of extinction. A group of dog enthusiasts from
Belgium stepped in and successfully bred the Bouviers back to healthy numbers.

In World War II, the Bouvier again faced extinction, but not because they were being used in war. Adolf
Hitler was deciding on a breed of guard dog for the Third Reich to use. Having heard of the Bouvier's
strengths and abilities, Hitler requested to meet this dog. When Hitler reached out his hand, the Bouvier
snapped at him, biting his hand. Hitler decreed that all Bouviers were to be killed on sight. Again, it was
the people of Belgium who successfully re-established the breed.

With the mechanization of even rural farms, few Bouviers are used for pulling carts or for cattle droving
or sheep herding any more. Today, they serve mainly as professional guard dogs or as family pets with
guardian as a sideline, duties for which their natural stability and good sense make them well suited.

Health
As a breed, they are not exceptionally long lived, seldom passing the age of ten years. Their deep chest
makes them one of the breeds disposed to develop the gastric torsion, volvulus, and bloat syndrome.

                             Notes



The Dobermann (alternatively spelled Doberman in North America) or Doberman Pinscher is a breed
of domestic dog. Dobermanns are commonly used as guard dogs, watch dogs, or police dogs, and have a
reputation as being a dog that is loyal and intelligent, is suitable for families with young children and are
trusting companion dogs.

Appearance
A Dobermann bitch's shoulder height is about 24 inches (61 cm) and weight is about 75 to 80 pounds
(34 to 36 kg), whereas the male stands about 26 or 27 inches (66 to 68 cm) at the shoulder and weighs
around 90 pounds (41 kg).

Dobermanns typically have a very deep, broad chest, a thick but fit body, and a generally muscular
build. However, in recent years some breeders have primarily bred, shown, and sold a much slimmer or
slender-looking Dobermann (as seen in the picture). This has become a popular body type among many
buyers, especially those who want to show their Dobies competitively. The traditional body type is still
more desirable to many casual owners and to those who want the dog for security reasons.

Color

Most people picture a Dobermann's color as the typical black with brown markings. However, the
existence of two different color genes in Dobermanns provides four different phenotypes in Dobermann
color. The traditional color, produced when both genes have the dominant allele, is commonly referred
to as black or black and tan, while the most common variation, due to one gene having the recessive
allele, produces what is called a red or red and tan Doberman in America and a "brown" Dobermann in
the rest of the world, which is primarily deep reddish-brown with tan markings.

The other gene having the recessive allele, while the first one retains the dominant, produces the blue
(grey) Dobermann, whereas the least likely combination of both color genes having recessive alleles
produces fawn, which is a light tan color, often called isabella.

In the 1970s, a fifth color of Dobermann, dubbed the white Dobermann, was born and she was
subsequently bred to her son who was also bred to his litter sisters. This tight inbreeding went on for
some time so certain breeders could "fix" the mutation, which has been widely marketed. Dobermanns
of this color possess a genetic mutation, which prevents its pigment proteins from being manufactured,
regardless of the genotypes of either of the two color genes; that is, it is an albino. Though many
potential Dobermann owners find the color beautiful, albino Dobermanns, like albinos of other species,
face increased risk of cancer and other diseases and should avoid sun exposure as much as possible. The
popularity of the white Dobermann has died down dramatically as the risks have become known, with
many people even calling for an end to the breeding and marketing of the white Dobermann, because
they perceive it as cruelty to the animal. Some countries have made the purposeful breeding of the white
Dobermann illegal, but breeders who care and take note of the ancestors can avoid breeding albinos as
they are all descended from the original bitch.

Tails

What may come as a surprise to people who are used to seeing Dobermann tails that are just a couple of
inches long, is that the Dobermann is actually born with a tail that is longer than that of most breeds of
dog. Typically, a Doberman Pinscher undergoes docking, a procedure in which the majority of its tail is
cut off within days after its birth. The rationale for this is that it is the "look" that the dog is supposed to
have, since it was the way Louis Dobermann originally envisioned the dog.

Aside from these more vain reasons of putting the animals through a procedure that many view as
inhumane, one practical reason for docking the tail is that it removes what would be a convenient
"handle" for a criminal or attacker to grab when the Dobermann is performing its guard or police work.
Another reason is that dogs with the type of tails that the Dobermann has (long with little hair or flesh
over the tail bones) have a very common occurrence of "broken tail". Broken tail may range from the
actual tail bones being broken to the more common skin injuries that are very difficult to heal because of
the difficulty of bandaging or protecting the tail. Broken tail is often a self inflicted injury caused by the
Dobermann enthusiastically wagging its long tail, regardless of the objects it is hitting with it.

Regardless of people's beliefs on this matter, few Dobermann purchasers have a choice on the length of
their Dobermann's tail; docking must be done soon after the dog's birth, which means that the breeder
nearly always makes the decision, before their dogs are even put on the market.

Ears




                                   Dobermann with natural ears.

This is not true, however, of Dobermann ear cropping, which should be done between 7 and 9 weeks,
though it can done up to six months or a year after the Dobermann's birth, and is therefore usually left up
to the discretion of the dog owner. Cropping done after 12 weeks has a high rate of failure in getting the
ears to stand. In larger and larger numbers, Dobermann owners are opting not to have their pet's ears
cropped, in a procedure that is believed to be extremely painful for the animal. The process involves
cutting off part of the animal's ears and then propping them up with posts or cups and tape bandages,
which allows the cartilage to develop into an upright position as the puppy grows. The puppy will still
have the ability to lay the ears back or down. The process can take a few weeks or may take months.
Because taping too tightly can cause blood flow problems, taping must be done by a veterinarian or
experienced breeder.

While there have been no studies that involved looking at cropped vs non-cropped dobermans, it is
believed that cropping dramatically reduces the occurrence of ear infections and hematomas (blood
blisters caused by damage to the ear tips commonly from hard shaking of the head).

Although the acts of ear cropping and tail shortening seem inhumane to some, the traditional
Dobermann has always been the one that has had both procedures. In some countries, docking and
cropping are now illegal, but in some breed shows Dobermanns are allowed to compete only if they
have the traditional look.

Temperament
Because of the Dobermann's typical use as a guard dog, and its often stereotyped role as such in movies,
many people are afraid of Dobermanns. However, Dobermanns are in general a loving and intelligent
breed. Although there is variation in temperament, an average Dobermann rarely attacks people, and
only when it feels that it, its property, or its family are in danger.

Health
An average, healthy Dobermann is expected to live around 12 years, with a majority of Dobermanns
dying between age 11 and 13. Common health problems are dialated cardiomyopathy, von Willebrands
disease (a bleeding disorder that can be tested for genetically), hypothyroidism, cancer, and in the blues
and fawns, alopecia.

History
Dobermanns were first bred in Germany around 1890 by Louis Dobermann. He was a tax collector who
needed a protection dog to guard him, so he set out to breed a new type of dog that, in his opinion,
would be the perfect combination of strength, loyalty, intelligence, and fierceness. Later, Otto Goeller
and Philip Gruening continued to develop the breed.

The breed is believed to have been created from several different breeds of dogs that had the
characteristics that Dobermann was looking for, including the Pinscher, the Rottweiler, the Thuringian
Shepherd Dog, the black Greyhound, the Great Dane, the Weimaraner, the German Shorthaired Pointer,
and the German Shepherd Dog. The exact ratios of mixing, and even the exact breeds that were used,
remains uncertain to this day, although many experts believe that the Dobermann is a combination of at
least four of these breeds. The single exception is the documented cross with the Greyhound. It is also
widely believed that the German Shepherd gene pool was the single largest contributor to the
Dobermann breed.

                                                                                         Home | Up | Next


Kennel cough or tracheobronchitis is a highly contagious canine illness characterized by inflammation
of the upper respiratory system. It can be caused by viral infections such as canine distemper, canine
adenovirus, or canine parainfluenza virus, or bacterial infections such as Bordetella bronchiseptica. It is
so named because the infection can spread quickly among dogs, such as in the close quarters of a kennel.

Infection
Both viral and bacterial causes of kennel cough are spread through the air by infected dogs sneezing and
coughing. It can also spread through contact with contaminated surfaces and through direct contact. It is
highly contagious. Exposure occurs in environments where there are other dogs in close proximity, such
as kennels, dog shows, and groomers. Symptoms begin usually 3 to 5 days after exposure. The disease
can progress to pneumonia.

Symptoms
Symptoms can include a harsh, dry cough, retching, or gagging, especially in response to light pressing
of the trachea. The presence of a fever varies from case to case. The disease can last from 10-20 days.
Diagnosis is made by seeing these symptoms and having a history of exposure.

Treatment and prevention
Antibiotics are given to treat any bacterial infection present. Cough suppressants are used if the cough is
not productive (nothing is being coughed up). The prognosis is good. Prevention is by vaccinating for
canine adenovirus, distemper, parainfluenza, and Bordetella. In kennels, the best prevention is to keep
all the cages disinfected.

Ectropion in dogs usually involves the lower eyelid. Often the condition has no symptoms, but tearing
and conjunctivitis may be seen. Breeds associated with ectropion include the cocker spaniel, the Saint
Bernard, the bloodhound, and the basset hound. It can also result from trauma or nerve damage.
Treatment (surgery) is only recommended if there is chronic conjunctivitis or if there is corneal damage.
A small part of the affected lid is removed and then the lid is sewn back together.

Entropion is a medical condition in which the eyelids fold inward. It is very uncomfortable, as the
eyelashes rub against the eyeball constantly. Entropion is usually caused by genetic factors and may be
congenital. Trachoma infection may cause scarring of the inner eyelid, which may cause entropion.

Symptoms of entropion include:

    ●   Redness and pain around the eye
    ●   Sensitivity to light and wind
    ●   Sagging skin around the eye
    ●   Excessive tearing
    ●   Decreased vision, especially if the cornea is damaged

Treatment is a simple surgery in which excess skin of the outer lids is removed. Prognosis is excellent if
surgery is performed before the cornea is damaged.

Causes
    ●   Congenital
    ●   Aging
    ●   Scarring
    ●   Spasm

Entropion in dogs
Entropion has been documented in most dog breeds, although there are some breeds (particularly
purebreds) that are more commonly affected than others. These include the Chow Chow, Shar Pei, St.
Bernard, Cocker Spaniel, Springer Spaniel, Labrador Retriever, Bull Mastiff, Great Dane, Irish Setter,
and Poodle. The condition is usually present by six months of age. Entropion can also occur secondary
to pain in the eye, scarring of the eyelid, or nerve damage. The upper or lower eyelid can be involved.
Upper lid entropion involves the eyelashes rubbing on the eye, but the lower lid usually has no
eyelashes, so hair rubs on the eye. Surgical correction is used in more severe cases. A strip of skin and
orbicularis oculi muscle are removed parallel to the affected portion of the lid and then the skin is
sutured. Shar Peis, who often are affected as young as two or three weeks old, respond well to temporary
eyelid tacking. The entropion is often corrected after three to four weeks, and the sutures are removed.

                                          Cherry Eye on an English Bulldog Puppy

Cherry eye is the term used to refer to canine nictitans gland prolapse, a common eye condition in
various dog breeds where the gland of the third eyelid prolapses and becomes visible. It appears as a red
mass in the inner corner of the eye, sometimes mistaken for a tumor. The condition generally occurs
before the age of two years. The eye becomes chronically inflamed and there is often a discharge if this
is not corrected. Because the gland is responsible for a large portion of the eye's tear production, the eye
can eventually suffer from dryness (keratoconjunctivitis sicca). Surgery is the usual treatment. Older
methods of cherry eye correction involved simply removing the gland, but it is a last-resort procedure
today (complemented with a lifetime of eyedrops if performed), as the gland's purpose was unknown
then. Modern methods of cherry eye correction involve repositioning of the gland to its normal location.
The success rate of this type of surgery is approximately 80% in most breeds.

Ocular Melanosis (OM) is a disease of the eye which in dogs is almost found exclusively in the Cairn
Terrier. Until recently it was known as pigmentary glaucoma. The disease is caused by an increase of
melanocytes in the iris, sclera, and surrounding structures. This infiltration of pigment can block the part
of the eye through which fluid drains. The increased fluid in the eye leads to increased pressure, which is
glaucoma. Humans can also have the disease, sometimes known as pigmentary dispersion syndrome.

Keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS), also called keratitis sicca, xerophthalmia, dry eye syndrome, or
simply dry eyes, is an eye disease caused by decreased tear production or increased tear film
evaporation commonly found in humans and small animals. Keratoconjunctivitis sicca is Latin and the
literal translation is "dryness of the cornea and conjunctiva".

The disease in humans
In humans, the typical symptoms of keratoconjunctivitis sicca are burning and a sandy-gritty eye
irritation that gets worse as the day goes on. The symptoms are often caused by a loss of water from the
tears that results in tears that are too "salty" or hypertonic. The best treatment strategies are designed to
rehydrate the tears and eye surface, and include hypotonic, electrolyte-balanced tears, punctal plugs, and
moist chamber spectacles. The inflammation that occurs in response to tears film hypertonicity can be
suppressed by mild topical steroids or immunosuppressants such as cyclosporine, but these treatments
have not been shown to help symptoms.

Keratoconjunctivitis sicca usually occurs in people who are otherwise healthy. It is more common with
older age, because tear production decreases with age. In rare cases, it can be associated with rheumatoid
arthritis, lupus erythematosus, Sjögren's syndrome and other similar diseases. It may also be caused by
thermal or chemical burns, or (in epidemic cases) by adenoviruses. A number of studies have found that
those with diabetes are more at risk for KCS[1] [2] [3].


The disease in dogs
Keratoconjunctivitis sicca is common in dogs. Most cases are caused by a genetic predisposition, but
chronic conjunctivitis, canine distemper, and drugs such as sulfasalazine and trimethoprim-sulfonamide
also cause the disease. Symptoms include eye redness, a yellow or greenish discharge, ulceration of the
cornea, pigmented cornea, and blood vessels on the cornea. Diagnosis is made by measuring tear
production with a Schirmer tear test. Less than 15 millimeters of tears produced in a minute is abnormal.

Tear replacers are a mainstay of treatment, preferably containing methylcellulose or carboxymethyl
cellulose. Cyclosporine stimulates tear production and acts as a suppressant on the immune-mediated
processes that cause the disease. Topical antibiotics and corticosteroids are sometimes used to treat
secondary infections and inflammation. A surgery known as parotid duct transposition is used in some
extreme cases where medical treatment has not helped. This redirects the duct from the parotid salivary
gland to the eye. Saliva replaces the tears. Dogs suffering from cherry eye should have the condition
corrected to help prevent this disease.

Dog skin disorders are probably the most crucial disorders that dog owners have to deal with. The dog's
skin and coat is an indicator for its general health. Skin disorders in dogs are indicated by itching, skin
rashes, or very dry skin.

Skin disorders can be long-lasting problems requiring persistent treatments by dog owners. Most dog
skin disorders are immune system related as: demodectic mange, eczema, scalp psoriasis, ringworm,
seborrheic dermatitis, yeast infection. Dog scabies is not immune-system related. Scabies mites spread
by direct contact with contaminated animals or items.

                                        Hemangiosarcoma
                                                                                   Back | Home | Up | Next


Hemangiosarcoma is a rapidly growing, highly invasive variety of cancer. It is a blood-fed sarcoma;
that is, blood vessels grow directly into the tumor and it is typically filled with blood. A frequent cause
of death is the rupturing of this tumor, causing the victim to rapidly bleed to death.

The phrase "angiosarcoma", when used without modifier, usually refers to hemangiosarcoma. However,
glomangiosarcoma (8710/3) and lymphangiosarcoma (9170/3) are distinct conditions.

Hemangiosarcoma in dogs
This cancer is somewhat common in dogs, and more so in certain breeds including German Shepherds
and Golden Retrievers. It occurs but is rare in cats. The dog often exhibits no symptoms until the tumor
has become very large and has metastasized. Owners often discover that the dog has hemangiosarcoma
when the dog collapses and dies.

The tumor most often appears on the spleen or the heart, although varieties also appear on the skin or in
other locations. It is the most common tumor of the heart, and occurs in the right atrium. Here it can
cause right-sided heart failure, arrhythmias, or pericardial effusion. Hemangiosarcoma of the spleen or
liver is the most common tumor to cause hemorrhage in the abdomen. Hemangiosarcoma of the skin
usually appears as a small red or bluish-black lump. It can also occur under the skin. It is suspected that
in the skin, hemangiosarcoma is caused by sun exposure. Other the sites the tumor may occur include
bone, the kidney, the bladder, muscle, the mouth, and the central nervous system.

Hemangiosarcoma can cause anemia, low platelet count, and disseminated intravascular coagulation
(DIC). Symptoms of splenic hemangiosarcoma include loss of appetite, arrhythmias, weight loss,
weakness, and lethargy. An enlarged abdomen is often seen due to hemorrhage or tumor growth.
Metastasis is most commonly to the lungs, liver, or brain.

Treatment includes chemotherapy and, where practical, removal of the tumor with the affected organ,
such as with a splenectomy. It is not clear how effective the treatment is; few if any studies have been
done, although a study involving splenectomies and chemotherapy was underway on the east coast of
the United States in 2003. Splenectomy alone gives an average survival time of two months.

Hemangiosarcoma on internal organs is usually fatal even with treatment, and usually within weeks or,
at best, months. In the skin, it can be cured in most cases with complete surgical removal.

Malignant histiocytosis is a hereditary disease found in the Bernese Mountain Dog characterized by
histiocytic infiltration of the lungs and lymph nodes. The liver, spleen, and central nervous system can
also be affected. Symptoms include cough, loss of appetite, weight loss, and depression. Diagnosis
requires a biopsy. Treatment with chemotherapy has been used with some success. Because of the rapid
progression of the disease, the prognosis is poor.

Lymphoma in animals is a malignant cancer originating from lymphocytes, which are an important
component of the immune system. Lymphoma also occurs in humans. The disease occurs in lymph
nodes, bone marrow, and organs such as the liver, spleen, eye, skin, and gastrointestinal system. It is
also known as lymphosarcoma.

Lymphoma in dogs
Lymphoma is one of the most common malignant tumors to occur in dogs. The cause is genetic, but
there also suspected environmental factors involved.

Commonly affected breeds

    ●   Boxer
    ●   Scottish Terrier
    ●   Basset Hound
    ●   Airedale Terrier
    ●   Chow Chow
    ●   German Shepherd Dog

    ●   Golden Retriever
Classification

The cancer is classified into low and high grade types. Classification is also based on location. The four
location types are multicentric, mediastinal, gastrointestinal, and extranodal (involving the kidney,
central nervous system, skin, heart, or eye). Multicentric lymphoma, the most common type, is found in
the lymph nodes, with or without involvement in the liver, spleen, or bone marrow. Mediastinal
lymphoma occurs in the lymph nodes in that area and possibly the thymus. Gastrointestinal lymphoma
occurs as either a solitary tumor or diffuse invasion of the stomach or intestines, with or without
involvement in the surrounding lymph nodes, liver or spleen. Classification is further based on
involvement of B-lymphocytes or T-lymphocytes.

Symptoms

General symptoms include depression, fever, weight loss, loss of appetite, and vomiting. Hypercalcemia
(high blood calcium levels) occurs in some cases of lymphoma, and can lead to the above symptoms
plus increased water drinking, increased urination, and arrhythmias.

Multicentric lymphoma presents as painless enlargement of the peripheral lymph nodes. This is seen in
areas such as under the jaw, the armpits, the groin, and behind the knees. Enlargement of the liver and
spleen causes the abdomen to distend. Mediastinal lymphoma can cause fluid to collect around the
lungs, leading to coughing and difficulty breathing. Hypercalcemia is most commonly associated with
this type. Gastrointestinal lymphoma causes vomiting, diarrhea, and melena (digested blood in the stool).

Lymphoma of the skin is an uncommon occurrence. An important type originating from T-lymphocytes
is mycosis fungoides. It can have a wide variety of appearances, from a single lump to large areas of
bruised, ulcerated, hairless skin.

Symptoms for lymphoma in other sites depend on the location. Central nervous system involvement can
cause seizures or paralysis. Eye involvement can lead to glaucoma, uveitis, bleeding within the eye,
retinal detachment, and blindness. Lymphoma in the bone marrow causes anemia, low platelet count,
and low white blood cell count.

Diagnosis

Biopsy of affected lymph nodes or organs confirm the diagnosis. X-rays, ultrasound, blood analysis,
amd bone marrow biopsy reveal other locations of the cancer. The stage of the disease is important to
treatment and prognosis.

    ●   Stage I - only one lymph node or lymphoid tissue in one organ involved.
    ●   Stage II - lymph nodes in only one area of the body involved.
    ●   Stage III - generalized lymph node involvement.
    ●   Stage IV - any of the above with liver or spleen involvement.
    ●   Stage V - any of the above with blood or bone marrow involvement.

Each stage is divided into those with systemic symptoms (loss of appetite, weight loss, etc.) and those
without.

Treatment

Complete cure is rare with lymphoma, but long remission times are possible with chemotherapy. With
effective protocols, average first remission times are 6 to 8 months. Second remissions are shorter and
harder to accomplish. Average survival is 9 to 12 months. The most common treatment is a combination
of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone, L-asparaginase, and doxorubicin. Other chemotherapy
drugs such as chlorambucil, lomustine (CCNU), cytosine arabinoside, and mitoxantrone are sometimes
used in the treatment of lymphoma by themselves or in substitution for other drugs. In most cases,
appropriate treatment protocols cause few side effects, but white blood cell counts must be monitored.

When cost is a factor, prednisone used alone can improve the symptoms dramatically, but it does not
significantly affect the survival rate. The average survival times of dogs treated with prednisone and
untreated dogs are both one to two months. Using prednisone alone can cause the cancer to become
resistant to other chemotherapy agents, so it should only be used if there is definitely no chance of
further treatment.

Prognosis

Lymphoma with a histologic high grade generally respond better to treatment. Dogs with B-lymphocyte
tumors have a longer survival time than T-lymphocyte tumors. Mediastinal lymphoma has a poorer
prognosis than other types. Otherwise, the stage of the disease is the best prognostic factor.

Lymphoma in cats
Lymphoma in young cats occurs most frequently following infection with feline leukemia virus (FeLV)
or to a lesser degree feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). These cats tend to have involvement of lymph
nodes, spine, or mediastinum. Cats with FeLV are 62 times more likely to develop lymphoma, and cats
with both FeLV and FIV are 77 times more likely. Older cats tend to have gastrointestinal lymphoma
without FeLV infection. The same forms of lymphoma that are found in dogs also occur in cats, but
gastrointestinal is the most common type. Lymphoma of the kidney is the most common kidney tumor in
cats, and lymphoma is also the most common heart tumor.

Symptoms

Symptoms for multicentric, mediastinal, and extranodal lymphoma are similar to dogs, except
hypercalcemia is rare. The most common sites for gastrointestinal lymphoma are, in decreasing
frequency, the small intestine, the stomach, the junction of the ileum, cecum, and colon, and the colon.
Symptoms include vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, loss of appetite, and melena. The tumor can also
cause life-threatening blockage of the intestine. Anemia is a common problem in all cats with
lymphoma. Lymphoma of the kidney presents as bilateral kidney enlargement and failure. Lymphoma of
the heart causes congestive heart failure, pericardial effusion, and arrhythmias.

Diagnosis is similar to dogs, except cats should be tested for FeLV and FIV.

Treatment and prognosis

Chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment for lymphoma in cats. Most of the drugs used in dogs are
used in cats, but the most common protocol uses cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone. The
white blood cell count must be monitored. Remission and survival times are comparable to dogs. Lower
stage lymphoma has a better prognosis. Multicentric lymphoma has a better reponse to treatment than
the gastrointestinal form, but infection with FeLV worsens the prognosis.

Lymphoma in ferrets
Lymphoma is common in ferrets and is the most common cancer in young ferrets. There is some
evidence that a retrovirus may play a role in the development of lymphoma like in cats. The most
commonly affected tissues are the lymph nodes, spleen, liver, intestine, mediastinum, bone marrow,
lung, and kidney.

In young ferrets, the disease progresses rapidly. Symptoms include loss of appetite, weight loss,
weakness, depression, difficulty breathing, and coughing. It can also masquerade as a chronic disease
such as an upper respiratory infection or gastrointestinal disease. In older ferrets, lymphoma is usually
chronic and can exhibit no symptoms for years. Symptoms seen are the same as in young ferrets, plus
splenomegaly, abdominal masses, and peripheral lymph node enlargement.

Diagnosis is through biopsy and x-rays. There may also be an increased lymphocyte count. Treatment
includes surgery for solitary tumors, splenectomy (when the spleen is very large), and chemotherapy.
The most common protocol uses prednisone, vincristine, and cyclophosphamide. Doxorubicin is used in
some cases. Chemotherapy in relatively healthy ferrets is tolerated very well, but possible side effects
include loss of appetite, depression, weakness, vomiting, and loss of whiskers. The white blood cell
count must be monitored. Prednisone used alone can work very well for weeks to months, but it may
cause resistance to other chemotherapy agents. Alternative treatments include vitamin C and Pau d'Arco
(a bark extract).

The prognosis for lymphoma in ferrets depends on the their health and the location of the cancer.
Lymphoma in the mediastinum, spleen, skin, and peripheral lymph nodes has the best prognosis, while
lymphoma in the intestine, liver, abdominal lymph nodes, and bone marrow has the worst.

Fibrosarcoma (fibroblastic sarcoma) is a malignant tumor derived from fibrous connective tissue and
characterized by immature proliferating fibroblasts or undifferentiated anaplastic spindle cells.

Pathology
The tumor may present different degrees of differentiation: low grade (differentiated), intermediate
malignancy and high malignancy (anaplastic). Depending on this differentiation, tumor cells may
resemble mature fibroblasts (spindle-shaped), secreting collagen, with rare mitoses. These cells are
arranged in short fascicles which split and merge, giving the appearance of "fish bone". Poorly
differentiated tumors consist in more atypical cells, pleomorphic, giant cells, multinucleated, numerous
atypical mitoses and reduced collagen production. Presence of immature blood vessels (sarcomatous
vessels lacking endothelial cells) favors the bloodstream metastasizing.

Fibrosarcoma in dogs and cats
Fibrosarcoma occurs most frequently in the the mouth in dogs. The tumor is locally invasive, and
reoccurs often following surgery. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy are also used in treatment.
Fibrosarcoma is also a rare bone tumor in dogs.

In cats, fibrosarcoma occurs on the skin. It also the most common vaccine-associated sarcoma.

                                                                                 Back | Home | Up | Next


Hyperthyroidism (or "overactive thyroid gland") is the clinical syndrome caused by an excess of
circulating free thyroxine (T4) or free triiodothyronine (T3), or both.

Causes
Major causes in humans are:

    ●   Graves' disease (the most common etiology with 70-80%)
    ●   Toxic thyroid adenoma
    ●   Toxic multinodular goitre

Other causes of hyperthyroxinemia (high blood levels of thyroid hormones) are not to be confused with
true hyperthyroidism and include subacute and other forms of thyroiditis (inflammation). Thyrotoxicosis
(symptoms caused by hyperthyroxinemia) can occur in both hyperthyroidism and thyroiditis. When it
causes acutely increased metabolism, it is sometimes called "thyroid storm".

Signs and symptoms
Major clinical features in humans are weight loss (often accompanied by a ravenous appetite), fatigue,
weakness, hyperactivity, irritability, apathy, depression, polyuria, and sweating. Additionally, patients
may present with a variety of symptoms such as palpitations and arrhythmias (notably atrial fibrillation),
dyspnea, infertility, loss of libido, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. In the elderly, these classical
symptoms may not be present and they may present only with fatigue and weight loss leading to
apathetic hyperthyroidism

Neurological manifestations are tremor, chorea, myopathy, and periodic paralysis. Stroke of
cardioembolic origin due to coexisting atrial fibrillation may be mentioned as one of the most serious
complications of hyperthyroidism.

As to other autoimmune disorders related with thyrotoxicosis, an association between thyroid disease
and myasthenia gravis has been well recognised. The thyroid disease, in this condition, is often an
autoimmune one and approximately 5% of patients with myasthenia gravis also have hyperthyroidism.
Myasthenia gravis rarely improves after thyroid treatment and relation between two entities is yet
unknown. Some very rare neurological manifestations that are reported to be dubiously associated with
thyrotoxicosis are pseudotumor cerebri, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and a Guillain-Barré-like
syndrome.

Diagnosis
A diagnosis is suspected through blood tests, by measuring the level of TSH (thyroid stimulating
hormone) in the blood. If TSH is low, there is likely to be increased production of T4 and/or T3.
Measuring specific antibodies, such as anti-TSH-receptor antibodies in Graves' disease, may contribute
to the diagnosis. In all patients with hyperthyroxinemia, scintigraphy is required in order to distinguish
true hyperthyroidism from thyroiditis.

Treatment
The major and generally accepted modalities for treatment of hyperthyroidism in humans are:

Surgery

Surgery (to remove the whole thyroid or a part of it) is not extensively used because most common
forms of hyperthyroidism are quite effectively treated by the radioactive iodine method. However, some
Graves' disease patients who cannot tolerate medicines for one reason or another or patients who refuse
radioiodine opt for surgical intervention. The procedure is relatively safe - some surgeons are even
treating partial thyroidectomy on an out-patient basis.

Radioiodine

In Radioiodine (treatment) therapy, radioactive iodine is given orally (either by pill or liquid) on a one-
time basis to ablate a hyperactive gland. The iodine given for ablative treatment is different from the
iodine used in a scan. Radioactive iodine is given after a routine iodine scan, and uptake of the iodine is
determined to confirm hyperthyroidism. The radioactive iodine is picked up by the active cells in the
thyroid and destroys them. Since iodine is only picked up by thyroid cells, the destruction is local, and
there are no widespread side effects with this therapy. Radioactive iodine ablation has been safely used
for over 50 years, and the only major reasons for not using it are pregnancy and breast-feeding.

Often, due to the difficulty of picking the correct dose, the treatment results in an opposite condition -
hypothyroidism. However, that is usually easily treated by the administration of levothyroxine, which is
a pure synthetic form of T4.

Thyrostatics

Thyrostatics are drugs that inhibit the production of thyroid hormones, such as methimazole
(Tapazole®) or PTU (propylthiouracil).

If too high a dose is used in pharmacological treatment, patients can develop symptoms of
hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism is also a very common result of surgery or radiation treatment as it is
difficult to gauge how much of the thyroid gland should be removed. Supplementation with
levothyroxine may be required in these cases.

Veterinary medicine
In veterinary medicine, hyperthyroidism is one of the most common endocrine conditions affecting older
domesticated cats. The disease has become significantly more common since the first reports of feline
hyperthyroidism in the 1970s. In cats, it is almost always caused by a benign thyroid adenoma.

The most common presenting symptoms are: rapid weight loss, rapid heart rate, vomiting, diarrhoea,
increased water consumption and increased urine production.

Surgery is not normally an option in feline hyperthyroidism. Radioiodine treatment or methimazole may
be used to control symptoms.

An animal control officer (also, more informally: dog catcher or dog warden or ) is an employee of,
or a contractor to, a municipality, charged with catching stray or loose dogs, cats, and sometimes other
animals, and bringing them to a compound or animal shelter, where the animals are held for a certain
time before being returned to their owners, put up for adoption, or euthanized. Animal control
departments are also responsible for investigating incidents of human contact with both wild and
domestic animals, such as bites. They usually work with Health Departments to ensure the health of
humans injured by animals.

Variations of the historical phrase "I wouldn't vote for him for dogcatcher" or "He couldn't run for
dogcatcher in this county" refers to an individual so poorly regarded that the individual in question is not
fit to be elected to even a trivial position of public trust. In actuality, this position is usually an appointed
one in localities that have a dedicated full-time animal control officer.

                                  Breed-Specific Legislation
                                                                                Back | Home | Up | Next


Breed-specific legislation (BSL) is any law, ordinance or policy which pertains to a specifically named
breed or breeds, but does not affect any others.

Some examples of BSL:

    ●   Restrictions on or the prohibition of ownership of American Pit Bull Terriers in some
        municipalities of the United States, Ontario, Canada and Queensland, Australia, and the Federal
        ban on importing them into Australia.
    ●   Restrictions on the availability of homeowners insurance for owners of many breeds, including
        American Pit Bull Terriers, Rottweilers, Dobermanns, Akitas, etc., in some areas of the United
        States.
    ●   Proposed legislation in some Australian states that would prohibit the breeding of any breed of
        dog not recognized by the Australian National Kennel Council, or restrict or prohibit the
        propagation of some breeds.
    ●   Bans on the transporting of some breeds by some airline carriers during the 1990s
    ●   Prohibition of ownership of the Welsh Corgi in some municipalities in Italy
    ●   A ban on the importing of the German Shepherd Dog into Australia for a large part of the 20th
        century
    ●   The requirement that Greyhounds wear muzzles in public in some Australian states


Pros and cons
Proponents of BSL usually cite the need to protect the public from dog breeds believed to have inherent
tendencies to aggressive behaviour. Others believe that BSL will help eliminate irresponsible dog
breeding, and thereby reduce the number of unwanted dogs, particularly mongrels.

Opponents of such legislation believe that instances of bad dog behaviour are an issue of irresponsible
human ownership rather than inherent dog nature. Some also believe that media sensationalism has
made the problem seem worse than it really is. They point out that some of these policies have been
randomly or illogically thought out, and are often implemented and enforced capriciously or
inconsistently. In their view, an alternative to Breed Specific Legislation might be the consistent
enforcement of existing dog laws, or the creation of new breed-wide regulations or requirements where
needed.
The owners of breeds not affiliated with all-breed clubs, and the owners of breeds in development are
concerned about BSL that affects breeding.

Recent developments
In September 2005 the government of the Australian state of Victoria announced proposed changes to
the Domestic (Feral and Nuisance) Animals Act 1994, to be implemented by the current session of the
Victorian parliament. The proposed laws include the mandatory desexing of any dog belonging to a
restricted breed, or any dog that is declared dangerous. The legislation follows laws of the 1990s
banning the importation of restricted breeds into Victoria; the new laws will in effect spell the end of the
existence of certain breeds in that state. Breeds affected by the ban include American Pit Bull Terriers
and Pit Bulls, (although it is not yet clear what other breeds may be covered by the appellation (Pit
Bull”), Japanese Tosas, Argentinean fighting dogs and Brazilian fighting dogs.

In Germany, four breeds may not be imported except for short term visits: Pitbull, American
Staffordshire Terrier, Bullterrier and Staffordshire Bullterrier. Breeding and possesion of particular dog
breeds is forbidden in some Federal States (Bundesländer). Three Länder (States) do not have breed-
specific legislation, the other 13 Länder have listed between 3 and 18 breeds. See http://de.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Rasseliste (in German language).

In Switzerland, breed-specific legislation is being discussed since December, 2005.

Diane Alexis Whipple (January 21, 1968-January 26, 2001) was killed by two Presa Canario dogs in
San Francisco in January, 2001.

The two owners of the dogs — Marjorie Knoller and her husband Robert Noel, both attorneys — were
sentenced to prison terms for manslaughter (a judge dropped a second-degree murder conviction against
Knoller, but a California state court of appeals reversed that ruling in May 2005; the California Supreme
Court in late July 2005 agreed that it will review this case).

Knoller, a small woman, failed to restrain her two large dogs when they attacked Whipple. Noel was not
present during the attack. Their convictions revolved around the accusation that they knew the dogs
were aggressive towards other people and did not take sufficient precautions with such large and
dangerous animals; whether they had actually trained the dogs to attack and fight remained unclear.
Allegations have been made that the two may have sexually abused the dogs, and the prosecution
contends that may have triggered the attack[1]. The judge wouldn't allow these claims into evidence. As
of early 2004, both Knoller and Noel have served their terms for the manslaughter conviction; Knoller is
out on bail while her conviction is under appeal.

The question of whether Whipple's female life partner could sue for damages caused considerable legal
complications which have yet to be resolved fully.

Before her fateful encounter with the dogs, the 33-year-old Whipple had been the lacrosse coach at Saint
Mary's College of California in Moraga, California.

Dog fighting is a violent fight between dogs. This blood sport is utilized for entertainment and creating
a revenue stream from stud fees, admission fees, and gambling.


Dog fighting breeds
       Main articles: History of dog fighting breeds

Many modern breeds were developed from these fighting dogs. Most of these dog breeds once bred for
fighting have now evolved into companion breeds.


Law
Dog fighting has been made illegal in many countries. Even though it is illegal, dog fighting still occurs
across the globe, often in connection with drug dealers and other criminals. The dogs used and bred for
this contribute to the negative image of pit bulls. To combat dog fighting and the designation of so-
called dangerous dog breeds, Breed Specific Legislation (BSL) has been passed in some countries and
many townships and municipalities.

History
Dog fighting has been documented in the recorded history of many different cultures, and is presumed to
have existed since the initial domestication of the species. Many breeds have been bred specifically for
the strength, attitude, and physical features that would make them better fighting dogs.
The sport was popular in many countries throughout history and continues to be practiced both legally
and illegally around the world.

Japan

Dog fighting began in Japan before the end of the Kamakura period. According to historical documents,
Hojo Takatoki, the 14th shikken (shogun's regent) of the Kamakura shogunate was known to be
obsessed with dog fighting, to the point where he allowed his samurai to pay taxes with dogs. At this
time, dog fighting was called inuawase (犬合わせ).

Dog fighting was considered a way for the Samurai to retain their aggressive edge during peaceful times.
Several daimyo, such as Chosokabe Motochika and Yamauchi Yodo, both from Tosa Province (present-
day Kochi Prefecture), were known to encourage dog fighting. Dog fighting was also popular in Akita
Prefecture, which is the origin of the Akita breed.

Dog fighting is still legal in Japan. However, increased awareness in animal welfare has made some
local governments, such as Tokyo, enact ordinances that effectively ban dog fighting. On the other hand,
dog fighting has become a tourist attraction in Kochi.

Currently, most fighting dogs in Japan are Tosa, which is a breed that was developed in Kochi.
However, some Japanese Pit bull owners are involved in dog fighting.

Pakistan

Contrary to popular belief dog fighting is illegal in Pakistan with law enforcement diligently enforcing
laws. In addition, it is neither legal to possess dog fighting material, such as videos, nor attend an event
that subjects an animal to any form of cruel treatment.

most of the dogfights are carried out in rural areas which heve little or no police intervention and
Dogfights may even be broadcasted on local TV.

United Kingdom

During the Roman reign there were pugnaces or war dogs in Britain, mostly used in battle but later used
for dog fighting contests in the amphitheatre. As early as 1154, in the reign of Henry II, bull-baiting and
bear-baiting with dogs was a popular amusement.

Dog fighting continued in London long after the Humane Act of 1835 made dog fighting, bull-, bear-,
and badger-baiting, and cock fighting illegal. However, the legislation covered only cruelty to domestic
and captive animals, not to wild ones.
Despite periodic dog-fight prosecutions, the illegal canine pit battles continued. Sporting journals of the
18th and 19th centuries show the Black Country and London as the main English dog fight centres of the
period. Dog fighting was also rife in many areas of Ireland.

Future
Dog fighting continues today, but as animal cruelty laws become increasingly prevalent, dog fighting
will most probably decrease. Fighting breeds are also increasingly subject to Breed Specific Legislation
that seeks to restrict the ownership of certain breeds.

On October 1, 2001, EU and other countries introduced the option for domestic animal owners to apply
for Pet passports under the Pets Travel Scheme (PETS for short), for pets returning from abroad to the
United Kingdom. This replaced the old system of 6 months compulsory quarantine for all domestic pets.

Under the scheme, the pets need to be injected with a microchip implant that meets ISOP specification
before being vaccinated, and certified rabies free through a blood test that is taken one month after the
vaccine has been given. If the blood test is negative the vaccination and sample must be re-applied. The
animal is permitted to enter the UK 6 months later without quarantine as long as it has been treated for
ticks, fleas and tapeworms between 24 and 48 hours before boarding the transport that will return the pet
to the UK.

The pet passport is a pink A4 sheet which contains the microchip number and certification that the dog
has a rabies vaccination, and needs to be signed by a veterinary surgeon who has LVI status. The
passport is not to be confused with the much smaller purple folder routinely issued by vets which
records the complete vaccination history of the pet.

The Pet passport alone be used to enter the UK, but it will not suffice to enter many countries. For
instance Guatemala, like almost every country, demands that all imported pets have a rabies vaccination,
but will not accept the Pet passport as proof of said vaccination. They need to see the proof of the rabies
in the purple folder.

The pet passport was originally suggested by the Official Monster Raving Loony Party.

                                                                                       Back | Home | Up


A rescue group or rescue organization takes unwanted or abused pets and attempts to find new, caring
homes for them. Most rescue groups are created by and run by volunteers, who take the animals into
their homes and care for them—including training, loving, playing, handling medical issues, and solving
behavior problems—until a suitable permanent home can be found.

Rescue groups exist for most types of pet—for example, rabbit rescue. For animals with many breed
types, many rescue groups specialize in specific breeds or groups of breeds. For example, for dogs, there
might be local Golden Retriever rescue groups, hunting dog rescue groups, large-dog rescue groups, and
generic dog rescue groups.

Animal shelters often work closely with rescue groups, because shelters who have difficulty placing
otherwise healthy and pet-worth animals would usually rather have the animal placed in a home than
euthanized; while the shelters might run out of room, rescue groups can often find more volunteers with
space in their homes for temporary placement.

In the UK, both shelter and rescue organisations are described using the blanket term 'rescue', whether
they have their own premises, buy in accommodation from commercial kennels, or operate a network of
foster homes.

Kennels that have a council contract to take in stray dogs are usually referred to as dog pounds. Some
dog pounds also carry out rescue and rehoming work and are effectively rescue groups that operate a
pound service. Some rescue groups work with pounds to move dogs to rescues. By law, a dog handed in
as a stray to a UK pound must be held for 7 days before it can be rehomed or euthanized.


Adopting through a rescue group
Most rescue groups have strict adoption procedures that can include completing an application to adopt,
checking a veterinary reference, conducting a phone interview, and conducting a home visit. Rescues are
all volunteer organizations and survive on donations. They charge an adoption fee, which might seem
high to some people; however, most rescue groups are staffed entirely by volunteers, who must travel to
pick up a dog in need, give it any medical care it may need, give it any training necessary, and feed it.
The adoption fee helps them to save another animal's life.

                                                                                 Back | Home | Up | Next


Animal shelters, or what used to be known as pounds or dog pounds, are either governmental or
private organizations that provide temporary homes for stray, surrendered, or abandoned pet animals.
They most often house dogs and cats. The animal is kept at the shelter until it is reclaimed by the owner,
adopted to a new owner, placed with another organization, or euthanized.

Unfortunately, resources are seldom adequate to support the large number of animals taken in by these
organizations. As a result, animals that are not claimed by their owners, or that have temperament or
health issues that cannot be corrected or treated within the resources of the organization, are often
euthanized. Shelters that receive a disproportionate number of animals compared to available adopters
may also euthanize animals because of space concerns.

A small number of shelters have chosen to be "no-kill" shelters, which support healthy and adoptable
pets for the remainder of their lives or until they are adopted. However, as funding is limited, the number
of animals that can be accepted by these organizations can be low, and some animals may not be
accepted because of behavior or health concerns. "No-kill" shelters often do euthanize if they receive
animals with these problems. There are no clear standards for assessing these issues, and so statistics
cited about how many "adoptable" animals are euthanized or adopted can be meaningless. A poorly
managed no-kill shelter may accept more animals than can be properly cared for and maintain animals in
crowded and unsanitary conditions in much the same way as an animal hoarder.

Some people obtain their pets from pet stores. Millions of these pets are taken to shelters or abandoned
when they get sick or are no longer wanted. Animal Welfare groups and volunteers are attempting to
change that point of view by educating owners and potential owners about the lifelong commitment
involved in adopting an animal, how to be a responsible pet owner, about the large number of adoptable
animals available at shelters, and about the often poor condition of pet shop pets.

Animal control agencies, or nonprofit organizations contracting for animal control duties, also enforce
animal-related ordinances. Some animal shelters also provide low-cost spaying and neutering surgeries
or veterinary care, behavior training or resources, "safe havens" for animals of abused spouses, or other
services.

By contrast animal sanctuaries will look after animals for the rest of their natural life, without
necessarily attempting to find them any other home. Some establishments combine the qualities of an
animal shelter with those of a sanctuary.
An animal shelter can be started by anyone who has the commitment, time and desire to help homeless
animals. There are many resources available to assist in establishing an animal shelter, sanctuary or
animal foster home. If an organization chooses to qualify for 501(c)(3) non-profit status, there are
certain criteria outlined by the Internal Revenue Service (United States) which must be met.
Additionally, running a non-profit animal shelter requires good business practices and skills. The best
method of determining if one has the capability to run an animal shelter is to volunteer their time at a
local Humane Society or shelter facility. These organizations can be found through local yellow pages or
a search on the Internet using your state or city name followed by "humane society" or "animal shelter".

                                          Companion Dogs
                                                                                    Back | Home | Up | Next


Companion dog usually describes a dog that does not work, providing only companionship as a pet,
rather than usefulness by doing specific tasks. Many of the toy dog breeds are used only for the pleasure
of their company, not as workers, but any dog can be a companion dog, and many working types such as
retrievers are enjoyed in North America primarily for their friendly nature as a family pet.




                                    The Pomeranian started out as a large, sled-type dog and was
downbred to become the small companion dog it is today.

Working vs. companion
Some people and breed groups argue that any dog of a working dog type is inherently a working dog,
while others say that only a dog being actively worked, either in a related field such as water trials for
retrievers or herding trials for herding dogs, or in some other field that requires training and discipline,
such as being service dogs or participating in dog agility, can be considered a working dog.

Dogs that have been chosen for traits that make a good pet are generally smaller breeds, and the tradition
of keeping pretty dogs for no purpose other than to be court decorations stems back thousands of years
to Chinese nobility. The Pekingese and the Pug are both examples of canines chosen for their ability to
be pets. In the case of the Pekingese, it was for their lion-like demeanor; for the Pugs, it was for their
"lucky" wrinkles and their monkey-like impish behavior.

Other dogs that appear to be strictly a decorative or entertaining toy type of dog originally had jobs, such
as the Lhasa Apso's job as a watch dog, or the delicate Yorkshire Terrier's exceptional ratting abilities
which made him a star.

Until the late 19th century, toy dogs were strictly the keep of the wealthy, especially royalty, where
small, charming dogs that did not work for their food were pure status symbols. Many, like the Maltese
and the King Charles Spaniel, were often used as gifts between royal houses as well, as a symbol of
good will. Small dogs like these got their name of lap dogs because the warm effect of a dog on one's
lap was considered beneficial to one's health and digestion. Indeed, the 15th century name for
companion and toy type dogs was "comforters".

In the late 19th century, some dogs were being bred for the combined purpose of being hearty and also
being a good companion to children and families, rather than to refined ladies and men, as was the
original task of the first companion dogs. Old breed types like the spaniels took over roles as housepets,
as well as new breeds like the Boston Terrier. Though dogs and children always had a certain attraction
to each other, there was an increased interest in the middle and even working classes for companion
dogs that would chum around with their youngsters. This increased throughout the 20th century, where a
dog breed's reputation as being a good family pet was a main barometer to their popularity.

Now in the 21st century, fewer and fewer dogs are being kept solely for the purpose of working. Indeed,
some breed groups for dogs like Golden Retrievers worry that they are becoming more show and
companion dogs than working dogs and are encouraging people to work with their pets rather than
simply keeping them for their good looks. There is a rising popularity for smaller companion breeds
again as well, and they are slowly overtaking the large, hearty sporting dogs in popularity in the United
States as people recognise the qualities of dogs created to solely be companions, not hunters or herders.

                                           Dog Adoption
                                                                                 Back | Home | Up | Next


Dog adoption usually refers to the process of taking ownership of—and responsibility for—a dog that a
previous owner has abandoned, discarded, no longer wants, or can no longer keep. Common sources for
adoptable dogs are

    ●   Animal shelters, also known as dog pounds
    ●   Rescue groups
    ●   Dogs found wandering loose that have no identification and remain unclaimed by any owner
    ●   Advertisements placed by individuals who are trying to find a new home for their own dog
    ●   Dogs that have been abused or neglected and have been confiscated from the offending owner

Dogs adopted from shelters are often referred to as shelter dogs or pound puppies; dogs adopted from
rescue organizations are often called rescue dogs (not to be confused with search and rescue dogs).

Dogs become available for adoption for a variety of reasons. Some of the more common:

    ●   Dog breeders. Breeders are a leading cause of overpopulation because they usually produce more
        dogs than they can sell and often produce dogs that do not fit the specification they were looking
        for in puppies.
    ●   Owner dies and no one in the family wants to (or can) keep the dog
    ●   Financial or living arrangements change drastically and people feel that they can no longer
        provide an appropriate home for the dog
    ●   Dog was purchased as a puppy at a store or from a box of adorable puppies at the side of the
        road, with little or no information provided; owners often discover that puppies are much more
        work than expected, or require more space or exercise than they are prepared to give
    ●   Dog leaves home for a variety of reasons, can't find its way home, and/or owner doesn't look for
        the dog
    ●   Severe health problems make it impossible to have a dog in the house or impossible for the
        owner to care for the dog
    ●   People become tired of caring for the dog, bored with the dog, or are unprepared to spend the
        time and effort required to train the dog
    ●   People leave the country; quarantine laws in some countries can be traumatic to dogs and owners,
        so the dogs are often left behind
    ●   Military personnel are deployed. (Many animals were surrendered to shelters located near
        military bases during Operfation Freedom in Afghanistan and the Iraqi war.)
People deal with their unwanted dogs in many ways. Some people have the dog euthanized (also known
as putting them down or putting them to sleep), no matter how young or healthy it is, although most
veterinarians do not consider this to be an ethical use of their resources. Other people simply abandon
the dog by the side of a road, often in the country, with the expectation that the dog will be able to take
care of itself or that a neighbor or passer-by will adopt the dog. More often, these dogs succumb to
hunger, weather, traffic, or common and treatable health problems. More responsibly, owners will take
the dog to a shelter, or call a rescue organization, where the dog will be cared for properly until a home
can be found. Homes cannot always be found, however, and euthanasia is often used for the excess
animals to make room for newer dogs.

The central issue facing dog adoption is whether a new owner can provide a safe, secure, permanent
home for dogs. Many shelters, pounds, and rescue organizations refuse to supply animals to people
whom they judge cannot supply the animal with a suitable home.

A new owner might also face training challenges with a dog who has been neglected or abused.

                                                       There are many varieties of dog food to choose
from.

Dog food is plant or animal material intended for consumption by dogs or other canids. Special dog
foods given as a reward, and not as a staple, are known as dog treats.

Some people make their own dog food or feed their dogs meals made from ingredients purchased in
grocery or health-food stores; many others rely on commercially manufactured dog food.

Homemade diets
There are many different recommendations on what diet is best for dogs. Some people argue that
commercial dog foods contain additives or poor-quality (or even dangerous) meat or ingredients that
dogs should not ingest or that certain commercial foods are not nutritionally sufficient for their dogs.
Different homemade diets are recommended by various experts, from "natural" diets consisting
primarily of raw meat, to vegetarian diets consisting only of nutritionally balanced vegetarian
ingredients, to mixtures consisting of ingredients such as brown rice, brown pasta, meats, eggs, and
vegetables.

Most dogs willingly eat vegetables, particularly if they are cooked, and many kinds of fruit, although
grapes and raisins are toxic to dogs.


Commercial dog food
By its water content, commercial dog food can be categorized into following types:
    ●   Dried
    ●   Semi-moist
    ●   Moist

The making of dog food

Dried pellet dog food, called kibble, is made in two different ways: extruding and baking. During
extruding, a mixture of raw materials is fed into an expander while pressurized steam or hot water is
added. When removed from the pressure, the pellets puff like popcorn. The pellets are allowed to dry,
then sprayed with vitamins, grease, or any other ingredients that are not heat-tolerant. The down side of
extruding is that the fats added after cooking often turn rancid and the vitamins may be destroyed by
heat during storage or shipping.

Dog treats are usually higher in grease or fats. These are usually designed to be held in a person's hand
without being messy, and are often designed in fanciful shapes and colors.

Contents

Most commercial dog foods are made from materials unusable or less desirable for human consumption.
These may include:

    ●   Meat by-products or digests
    ●   Meat-and-bone meals
    ●   Grain by-products
    ●   Restaurant grease
                                                       Dog treats are special dog foods given as a
reward, and not as a staple food source.

Special varieties

There are dog foods specially formulated to dogs that are allergic to wheat, corn, and/or chicken. These
foods usually contain lamb or fish meat. Some dog foods are designed for dogs with maladies such as
urinary tract infections, and some foods are tailored to the dietary needs of especially young or old dogs.
There also exist vegetarian dog foods marketed to owners who do not wish for their dogs to consume
meat products.

                                 A Greyhound

Greyhound adoption or Greyhound rescue programs focus on helping Greyhounds move from racing
—where they live in kennels on the track—to homes.


Background
Many Greyhounds are adopted as pets after they retire from racing. A few pups are adopted directly into
homes, most often due to injury at a young age. Others are euthanized due to injury or age that causes
them to be no longer profitable to their owners (often at 3 or 4 years old). A Greyhound can often live
over 10 years after retirement if given proper medical care; there have been cases of Greyhounds living
to be over 18 years old.

Currently, most Greyhound adoption programs are based in the United Kingdom, Australia, and the
United States. In other places in Europe, the groups often deal with dogs from a variety of sources; for
example, in Spain, ex-hunting dogs are often in need of rescuing along with Greyhounds.

Origins of the Greyhound adoption movement
The Greyhound adoption movement grew out of a concern by a few individuals about the treatment of
the dogs while racing. All early adoption groups opposed racing. David Wolf, the founder of the
National Greyhound adoption program (NGAP), is often credited with starting the movement. Wolf has
become a very controversial figure in the greyhound adoption community, and is one of the most
outspoken critics of the greyhound racing industry. Over time as the number of adoption groups has
grown, a deep ideological division regarding Greyhound racing has developed. The older groups are
generally opposed to any form of Greyhound racing for any purpose other than the enjoyment of the
dog. The tracks and owners have started many of the more recently formed groups; these groups (and
some others) have started to accept money from the tracks and tend not to advocate against greyhound
racing.

When Greyhound adoption first started in the United States, many people associated with racing argued
that Greyhounds did not make suitable pets. However, it has become clear that Greyhounds make
excellent companions.

Care by adoption groups

Medical care

Typically when a group or individual picks up a Greyhound from the racetrack they need a significant
amount of basic medical care:

    ●   Dental cleaning
    ●   Treatment for worms or other parasites
    ●   Spaying and neutering
    ●   Vaccinations such as rabies
    ●   A microchip implant to provide a record of ownership and identification
    ●   Ear cleaning to remove dirt from the tracks
    ●   Clipping nails, flea bath
    ●   Treatment of existing injuries, as appropriate

Living conditions

Greyhounds living with adoption groups generally receive one of two types of care: kennels or foster
homes. Several adoption groups use kennels, which are similar to those used by the tracks in the United
States. These kennels generally allow larger spaces for each dog, and the dogs are permitted much more
time in turn-out pens (outdoor runs for the dogs to play in). Other groups feel that the best way to
prepare the dogs for living in homes is to provide them with a home to live in. These groups place the
dog in a volunteer foster home. The adoption group generally pays for the veterinarian bills and food for
the dogs in their care, while allowing the foster "parents" to train the dog and provide its day-to-day
needs.

There is some debate within the adoption community about which technique is better. The trade off is
essentially quality of living situation vs. number of animals helped. It is generally accepted that by
having kennels, the group can handle a larger number of dogs more efficiently, while groups that have a
foster program can provide a better living situation for the dog more quickly.

Behavior of adopted greyhounds

Greyhounds that have been bred for performance on the track have been maintained under unique
circumstances. They are bred and raised from puppies for racing.

Racing greyhounds are often caged as much as 22 hours out of the day, and "turned out" for 1/2 hour or
so at a time. During this time, they are usually muzzled to reduce the chances of injury should there be
any aggressive behavior. While not violent, dogs that are successful at racing tend to be highly
competitive, and may challenge other dogs at any time. However, some animals may be very shy and
skittish. Additionally any dog that is part of a large pack may become more aggressive then it would be
individually.

As a result of these conditions, dogs that come off the track are very different from ordinary dogs.
Although usually well-socialized with other greyhounds, they may not understand other dogs. As the
lure used to train greyhounds for racing resembles a rabbit, it is not unknown for greyhounds to mistake
smaller dogs for a lure, causing them to set chase. As a result, muzzling of greyhounds is considered a
courtesy when there is the possibility of meeting other dogs. Further, greyhounds have very thin skin,
and may be easily harmed by biting or scratching from other greyhounds or (more commonly) other
dogs. As a result, interaction with other dogs should be performed with great care. Similarly, small
animals including cats may also be the subject of aggression by some greyhounds. Prior to adoption,
agencies generally screen greyhounds for this behavior before being "homed."

The combination of training and being caged (or "crated") much of their lives alters the behavior of
greyhounds in that many do not know how to play. Although virtually all greyhounds show interest in
squeaky toys (particularly furry ones) as a function of their lure training, only a select few will chase
balls with any great interest. Most will not immediately know how to play with other dogs. Greyhounds
retain a strong chase instinct, and will act upon any sort of motion--cats, rabbits, a leaf blowing across
the street, even shadows at night--with great interest, possibly for several weeks or months after leaving
the track. The instinct is rarely lost entirely, and as a result, a greyhound may bolt with no warning. With
an animal that can hit 45 miles an hour bolting can be a large problem as greyhounds are sight hounds,
and often will not be able to find the way home even if it tries.

As greyhounds are trained to spring from an enclosed box at the start of a race, the opening of a door or
gate is an invitation to bolt. Similarly, not restraining a greyhound while walking may cause the leash to
be pulled from the owner's hand at the appearance of a cat or other small animal. The greyhound can
achieve a velocity of 30 miles an hour in three strides, and with a weight usually around 60-85 pounds, it
may be difficult to adequately restrain a determined dog that decides to bolt.

At home, greyhounds may consider the house to be an extension of their crate, which they will usually
not voluntarily urinate or defecate in. As a result, housebreaking may be surprisingly easy. As with all
breeds, there are exceptions, and some greyhounds may be particularly difficult to housebreak. This
condition may be due to an urinary tract infection, a behavioral disorder, or anxiety on the part of the
animal. With work, most greyhounds can be conditioned to be housebroken.

Like any dog greyhounds vary widely in their temperament, behavior, levels of activity, and in virtually
all other aspects of their personality. Some retired racers seem to "collect" items, such as dolls, books,
clothes, or whatever they find around the house, and may hoard them in unlikely places. Racers may
also have certain behaviors, such as fearing ceiling fans, that often wear off after a few weeks or months.
Greyhounds will not immediately understand windows and glass doors, and may attempt to run through
them. Marking windows (usually with opaque tape) at an appropriate height will help prevent injury.

Retired greyhounds are very sensitive animals, and should never be physically punished.

Many owners also find that their greyhounds enjoy resting on beds and sofas.

Hypoallergenic is the characteristic of provoking fewer allergic reactions in allergy sufferers.
Hypoallergenic means to have a decreased tendency to cause allergies; hypo means less, not none.
Hypoallergenic pets still produce allergens, but because of their coat type or absence of fur, typically
produce less than others of the same species. People with severe allergies and asthma might still be
affected by a hypoallergenic pet.

There is no such thing as a nonallergenic pet.

Hypoallergenic pets
For allergy sufferers, a hypoallergenic pet might enable them to have a pet in their home, whereas most
dogs, cats, rabbits, and other fur-bearing animals can make their lives miserable. The proteins that cause
allergies are found not only in the animals' fur or hair but also in saliva, urine, mucous, and hair roots
and in the dander sloughed from the animals' skin.

Some dog breeds have been promoted as hypoallergenic, such as the Afghan Hound whose coat (hair)
does not shed and is the same pH as human hair creating no dander, Maltese, Bichon Frisé, Poodle, Soft-
Coated Wheaten Terrier, and the Schnauzer. The Goldendoodle or other Poodle hybrids might do well
for some who have allergies because they do not shed their hair. However, no canine is known to be
completely nonallergenic.

In October 2004, the Los Angeles company Allerca announced that within three years it will be able to
produce a hypoallergenic cat using genetic modification. At the same time, the company denied that it
will be able to do the same for dogs, because whereas cats have a single gene that produces the
allergenic protein, dogs have many allergenic proteins controlled by multiple genes.

Hypoallergenic dog breeds are those touted as being hypoallergenic; that is, provoking fewer allergic
reactions in allergy sufferers.

There are various coat types that are said to produce fewer allergens: single-coated dogs, who do not
have a thick undercoat; dogs whose coat continues to grow, like human hair, rather than shedding
regularly; and hairless dogs. These breeds usually shed less dander and hair and are, therefore,
considered hypoallergenic. However, even hairless dogs can produce enough dander to affect a highly
allergic person.

The following dog breeds are often called hypoallergenic:

Single-coated breeds

    ●   Basenji
    ●   Bedlington Terrier
    ●   Bichon Frisé
    ●   Bolognese (dog)
    ●   Chinese Crested (powder puff)
    ●   Coton de Tulear
    ●   Havanese
    ●   Irish Water Spaniel
    ●   Kerry Blue Terrier
    ●   Lowchen
    ●   Maltese
    ●   Poodles (all sizes)
    ●   Poodle hybrids
    ●   Portuguese Water Dog
    ●   Schnauzer (all sizes)
    ●   Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier

Hairless breeds;

    ●   American Hairless Terrier
    ●   Chinese Crested (hairless)
    ●   Mexican Hairless Dog (Xoloitzcuintli)
    ●   Peruvian Hairless Dog

A lap dog gets its name from its size; it is small enough to be held in the arms or lie comfortably on a
person's lap. Most lap dogs fall into the toy dog category.

Lap dogs have been used as pets, fashion accessories, and status symbols. Popular culture presents the
image of the spoiled or pampered ‘pooch’ who is the obnoxious companion of a spoiled or pampered
lady, but it is widely believed that the lap dog originally served a purpose; to provide warmth for
wealthy or fashionable European women. There are also lap dogs, among the terrier group, for example,
which were first developed for active work.

A few lap dogs were apparently bred solely as pets; the Japanese Terrier is among these.

Lap dog is also used jokingly to refer to a dog of any size who likes to climb onto people's laps for
affection.

The term is also sometimes used to describe a person who is very easily controlled, such as a "yes" man.

Lapdogs are referred to in a similé in The Frames' song Fitzcarraldo.

Rescue dog has various meanings:

    ●   A large dog that has been trained to physically rescue humans from disasters. Three notable
        breeds of rescue dog are the St. Bernard (which specializes in rescuing humans who have become
        trapped in snow in the Alps), the Newfoundland (which specializes in rescuing humans who have
        fallen off boats), and the Bernese Mountain Dog.

    ●   A search and rescue dog, who works with a handler to find missing persons or animals or to
        find and help dig out victims of disasters such as earthquakes. (See also search and rescue.)

    ●   A dog that has been rescued from possible euthanasia in an animal shelter or that has been
        rescued from an abusive or severely neglected home; usually these dogs are placed in new homes
        with new owners, possibly after evaluation and rehabilitation by rescue groups or foster homes.

A dog-show judge is a person that is qualified to judge dogs at a dog show. Depending upon the size of
the show, there might be one judge for all breeds and classes. At larger dog shows, there might be as
many as 10 judges working.

Usually a license as a Dog Judge is granted by either a Breed Association or a Kennel Club. The license
might either show the range of breeds that he or she is able to judge, or otherwise any exclusions. Judges
may study for a license to judge a dog group: (She is a terrier judge). A judge who has successfully
completed the requirements for judging all of the dog groups is known as an all-breeds judge.

Travelling judges
Historically, the dog judges of the English-speaking world had 'circuits' if they travelled out of their own
country. They would carry their license from their country of origin, and usually would be recognised
overseas.

Famous judges
Some judges who are regulars at the larger English or American dog shows become well-known and
gain respect from large audiences for their ability to recognise good examples of the breeds that they
judge.

                                           Best of Breed
                                                                                        Home | Up | Next


Best of Breed is the title given to the dog or bitch who has been judged the best representative specimen
of its breed at a dog show.

Dogs compete in a hierarchical fashion at each show, where winners at lower levels are gradually
combined to narrow the winners until the final round, where Best in Show is chosen.

Each breed is divided into classes based on sex and age. Dogs (males) are judged first, in their age
classes. Within one breed, there are puppies (dogs under a certain age), mature male dogs (subdivided by
age into junior, limit (or intermediate) and open); bitches (female dogs) have corresponding classes. At
some events, usually single-breed or novelty shows, there may be a baby puppy class (typically under
three months old) which is usually contested after the adult classes as a ploy to keep spectators
interested. Baby puppies are not eligible for Best of Breed and are judged largely on their ‘cuteness’
factor, as young puppies from many breeds look very much alike and their conformation is most likely
not yet evident.

The winners of all classes in each sex compete for Challenge (best) Dog and Challenge Bitch; the
individuals who will challenge each other for the accolade Best of Breed. The remaining class winners
are joined by the runner-up from the class from which the challenge winner was selected and there are
competitions for second place in each gender, called Reserve Challenge Dog and Reserve Challenge
Bitch. This is for fairness, as one class may contain a stronger field of specimens of the breed. If the
judge believes that this is the case, the Challenge Dog and Reserve Challenge Dog, for example, may
both be from the same class.

From the two finalists (Challenge Dog and Challenge Bitch) is selected Best of Breed. The runner-up is
deemed Best of Opposite Sex. There is then a run-off in which the second best individual in the gender
of the winner (the Reserve Challenge from the same gender as the BOB) is brought back to stand against
the Best of Opposite Sex (the Challenge who did not win) for the title of Runner-up to Best of Breed. So,
if for example the Best of Breed is the Challenge Bitch, the Runner-up to Best of Breed may be the
Challenge Dog or the Reserve Challenge Bitch if, in the judge’s opinion, the competing bitches were
superior to the competing dogs.

In some breeds, the males and females of the breed have decidedly different appearances, and it is often
the males who have the quintessential look of the breed (females may be smaller, have less ‘coat’ and
feminine or less pronounced features. The judge must set personal preference aside and decide
objectively whether the bitch is a better example of the female of the breed than the dog is an example of
the male.

In multi-breed and all-breed shows, the winners of all breeds within the kennel club's breed groupings
then compete for General Specials . So, for example, all the Terrier Group breed winners compete to
determine Best Terrier (sometimes called Best in Group). The group winners (in some countries
nicknamed ‘ The Magnificent Seven ’) go on to compete for Best in Show. In large shows, there are so
many competitors that General Specials must be held on a different day, for which the Best of Breed
winners must return.

The audience at a dog show is expected to be participatory and vocal, and often applaud the silkiest,
fluffiest or more popular breeds while ignorant of the breed requirements. Those who are owners and
breeders may cheer for a popular handler or a sympathetic favourite from a particular breeding kennel;
the judge is supposed to ignore all attempts to influence the decision.

The value of titled dogs and their progeny increases greatly with the attainment of a title. Because of the
subjective nature of judging and the politics involved in any judged competition, some breeders feel that
it is next to impossible for dogs in their chosen breed to win Best in Group or Best in Show. For these
reasons, Best of Breed is the often the most highly-coveted title among fanciers.

A champion dog most often refers to a dog who has earned the Champion title at conformation dog
shows, but it can also refer to a dog who has earned a Champion title in various dog sports.


Champion conformation dog
Conformation dog shows evaluate how well a dog conforms to the breed standards for its breed. Each
kennel club has its own criteria for establishing a Champion dog. At the championship level,
competition is extremely strong and dogs who win regularly are of the highest quality. To become a
Champion in the United Kingdom a show dog must have been awarded three Challenge Certificates
under different judges, with at least one of the certificates being awarded after the dog has reached the
age of twelve months. The United States Champions are gained under a points system with points
awarded in different fields: breed, obedience, field and herding.

Championship titles and registered names
A dog who has earned the Champion title for conformation is entitled to use the designation
"Champion" (or "Ch") in front of his name, for example, Ch. Emerald's Brightest Sparkle.

Show dogs have a registered name, that is, the name under which they are registered as a purebred with
the appropriate kennel club, and a call name, which is how their owners talk to them.

The registered name often refers directly or indirectly to the kennel where the dog was bred; kennel
clubs often require that the breeder's kennel prefix form the first part of the dog's registered name. See
registered name for a discussion of dogs' names.

Companion Dog (CD) refers to a title offered by the American Kennel Club for dog obedience. Other
kennel clubs also offer similar CD titles. To earn an AKC CD title, a dog must receive a qualifying score
in the Novice obedience class at three separate, AKC-licensed obedience trials, and by three different
judges.

Dogs that receive three qualifying scores competing in the more challenging Open class at three
different obedience trials, and by three different judges, can be awarded the AKC Companion Dog
Excellent (CDX) title.

The major kennel clubs divide the world's dog breeds into dog groups based on the type of work or
activity for which the dogs were bred, and to a lesser extent other characteristics such as their size and
temperament. The distinctions are not cut-and-dried; for example, hunting dogs are divided among the
Hound, Gundog and Terrier groups.

Dog groups vary from country to country but in general there are seven:

    ●   Gundog Group (Sporting Group in the AKC) - (includes retrievers, pointers, setters and spaniels)
    ●   Hound Group - (includes sighthounds and scenthounds)
    ●   Nonsporting Group
    ●   Terrier Group - (The FCI subdivides terriers, see FCI Terrier Group)
    ●   Toy Group
    ●   Utility Group (Not included in the AKC groups)
    ●   Working Group - (includes sled dogs and herding dogs. The American Kennel Club separates
        their herding dogs into a separate Herding Group.

Dog showmanship is a dog competition. Unlike most shows, showmanship depends much more on the
handler than on the dog. Although how well the dog is groomed, its temperament, its attentiveness, and
how well its gait is, also affect the score.

Equipment
Showmanship has specialized equipment, including the showmanship leash, which is a short leash used
to show the dog. Showmanship also requires grooming tools, to groom the dog. Before the dog is shown,
competitors usually bathe the dog and use a comb and scissors to trim the dog.

General Specials are dog competitions in which the Best of Breed winners return to compete for Best in
Group; these dog group winners then return to compete for the title Best in Show.

In large dog shows General Specials take place on a different day from the individual breed contests.

designation for purebred dog breeds that fit into no other grouping. These dogs come in all shapes, sizes,
and have many different temperaments. An example group member is the Dalmation.

A Novelty Show is a competition or display in which exhibits or specimens are in some novel; striking
or differing in some way from that which is usual for the type of competition.

For instance a novelty dog show might contain categories (classes) which are humorous, or for pets,
instead of or in addition to the conformation classes..

Scruffts is a competition, similar to that of a conformation show for purebred dogs, where mixed-breed
dogs of any parentage are allowed to compete. It is hosted by The Kennel Club of the United Kingdom
and is named after its world-famous annual show, Crufts.

At Scruffts, dogs compete for the titles of:

     ●   "Handsome dog": For dogs aged 6 months to 7 years
     ●   "Beautiful bitch": For bitches aged 6 months to 7 years
     ●   "Child's best friend": For dogs or bitches aged 6 months to 12 years, handled by a child aged 6 to
         16 years
     ●   "Golden Oldie": For dogs or bitches aged 8 to 12 years

Scruffts was designed for people or families who do not have, or cannot afford, a purebred dog and who
want to experience conformation competition with their dogs. It is said to help strengthen the bond
between dog and owner as well as to help people meet others with a similar interest in dogs. Just as
crossbreeds are not allowed to enter true conformation shows, purebred dogs are not welcome in
Scruffts, regardless of whether they are registered with The Kennel Club.

As Scruffts is just for fun and not a "true" or "serious" conformation, it only costs £1 per entry. Judges
cannot refer to a breed standard and therefore dogs are judged only on "Good Character", "Good
Health", and "Good temperament with both people and dogs". Rosettes are awarded to the 1st, 2nd, and
3rd positions in each class, and each dog or bitch that receives a 1st placement is eligible to compete in
the final at the end of the year.

A show is a judged event or display in the hobby of animal fancy or in the occupation of animal
husbandry.

Shows feature the best specimens of purebred animals in a locality or country. Prestigious shows or
those with large purses (prize money) to be won may attract exhibitors from around the world.

Typically, shows are an opportunity for breeders to feature their best breeding stock, so animals in a
show are usually entire, that is, the animal has not been spayed or neutered.

Animals compete for the title of Best of Breed, a distinction which can add significant value to a
breeder's lines. The top prize in a show is usually the title Best in Show or Best (or Supreme) Exhibit in
Show.

Animals typically "shown" include:

    ●   cats
    ●   cattle
    ●   dogs
    ●   guinea pigs (often called "cavies" when show animals)
    ●   horses
    ●   sheep
    ●   rats
    ●   mice
    ●   poultry

The Working Group is a kennel club designation for purebred dog breeds descended from dogs bred to
assist humans with their work. In general the group comprises herding dogs and sled dogs but also
search and rescue breeds. It is a large group containing some of the most intelligent and visually
appealing dog breeds, which has made them popular. This popularity can lead to their downfall as
family pets when purchased by those ignorant of the fact that most will need training and "work" in
order to fit into a family setting.

The American Kennel Club separates the Working Group into a separate Herding Group comprising
herding dogs and livestock guardian dogs.

Dog sports are activities that involve dogs.




                                  Training a retrieve in Schutzhund, a dog sport.

There is much discussion about what exactly defines a sport for dogs. Some issues:

     ●   If a human companion isn't actively involved, is it actually a sport? Take greyhound racing, for
         example, or hunting from, say, a duck blind, from which the dog retrieves the game.
     ●   Is any activity a sport? For example, a conformation show, where the handler and dog walk or
         trot around a ring for a judge to evaluate the dog's appearance and structure.

This list is intended only to represent anything that anyone is likely to refer to as a dog sport, not to
argue its validity as sport. Clearly, there are more sports to add to this list:

     ●   Agility
     ●   Bikejoring
     ●   Canicross
     ●   Carting
     ●   Dog packing
     ●   Earthdog trials (or go to ground trials; see American Working Terrier Association and List of

     ●   Field trials
     ●   Flyball
     ●   Frisbee dog
     ●   Musical freestyle
     ●   Mushing
     ●   Obedience training

The Terrier Group is a designation used by most all-breed dog registries (or Kennel clubs) for a group
of dog breeds consisting almost entirely of terriers. The list of dogs in this group is largely the same
across the major English-speaking Kennel clubs--AKC, ANKC, CKC, KC(UK), KUSA, UKC and
NZKC. The group consists of most, but not all, terrier breeds. In the case of the North American clubs, it
even contains a nonterrier.

The ANKC designates the Terrier Group as group 2, and the CKC as group 4.

The Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI) also has a Terrier Group, but further subdivides them
into sections based on size; see FCI Terrier Group.

The group is made up of the following breeds, (differences among clubs are noted in parentheses).

Protection sports are dog sports that test a dog's ability to protect himself and his handler. All
protection sports test the complete temperament of the dog, not just his protectiveness. The dog must be
safe for his handler and for the public. He must be able to control himself upon command. All protection
sports are modeled to some extent on the way dogs are used in police work. The grandfather of all
protection sports is Schutzhund.

                                                                Badger Baiting

Badger-baiting is a bloodsport involving the baiting of badgers.


Background
The badger is a quiet and harmless creature in its own domain; however, when threatened it can possess
invincible courage. Weighing up to thirty-five pounds when fully grown, badgers have an extraordinary
dangerous bite, which it is willing to use recklessly when threatened. Showing itself to be a dangerous
adversary for any dog made it a sought after participant for the fighting pit.

Drawing the badger
In order to use the badger's ability to defend itself to test the dog, artificial badger dens were built,
captured badgers were put in them and then the dog was set on the badger. The badger would be placed
in a box, which was furnished in imitation of it den and from there a tunnel led upward. The owner of
the badger puts his animal in the box. The timekeeper is equipped with a watch and the badger's owner
releases the dog for the fight. Whoever wants to pit his dog against the badger let it slide into the tunnel.
Usually the dog is seized immediately by the badger and the dog in turn grips the badger. Each bites,
tears and pulls the other with all their might. The owner quickly pulls out the dog by its tail with jaws
clamped obstinately onto the badger. The two are separated and the badger is returned to its den. Then
the dog is sent back into seize the badger and it again drawn out with the badger. This scene is repeated
over and over again. The more often a dog is able to seize the badger within a minute, so that both can
be pulled out together, the more it is up to the task and is considered game.

Entertainment
Drawing the badger soon became a very popular sideshow in the pit. It provided a new opportunity to
win or lose money by betting. Drawing the badger thus became a permanent part of the fight in the pit.
Baits were staged outside the pit in cellars or taverns, as an interesting attraction for the guests.

Badger Dogs
The primary dog used for badger-baiting is the Terrier. Specific dog breeds were developed for badger-
baiting, including but not limited too, the following: Airedale terrier, Bedlington Terrier, Blue Paul
Terrier, Daschund, Fox Terrier, Glen of Imaal Terrier, Kerry Blue Terrier, Portuguese Podengo,
Sealyham Terrier, Staffordshire Bull Terrier, Welsh Terrier, and Wheaten Terrier.


Teastas Mor
Strict Irish Kennel Club rules governed the Teastas Mor (certificate of gameness). It was considered that
the discipline ensured contests between dog and badger were fair. In the past, to become an Irish Kennel
Club terrier champion, it was necessary for a terrier to be in possession of a Teastas Mor. These
continued until the kennel ceased to license trials in 1968.

In addition, there were many other badger clubs; each had their own rules, which varied considerably.
Frequently, the badger was afforded little protection.

Bait noun or Baiting verb is the act to worry or torment a chained or confined animal by setting dogs
upon it for sport. The dogs attack with endeavour, bite and tear, with an objective to subdue the
opposing animal by incapacitating or killing it. Baiting is a blood sport utilized for entertainment and
gambling. It is illegal in most countries with laws being enforced with varying degrees of enthusiasm.

History
Baiting events recorded thoughout history are by no means isolated incidents. For instance, during the
middle ages, England was completely addicted to the bait as a pastime using a wide range of animals,
including, but not limited too: Donkeys, Horses, Leopards, Lions, Monkeys, Panthers, Polar bears and
Tigers, no animal was overlooked.

                                             Photo finish of a greyhound race in Tampa, Florida, USA
on February 9, 1939

Greyhound racing is the sport of racing greyhounds. The dogs chase a lure (an artificial hare or rabbit)
on a track until they arrive at the finish line. The one that arrives first is the winner.

History
Modern greyhound racing has its origins in coursing. The first recorded attempt at racing greyhounds on
a straight track was made beside the Welsh Harp reservoir, Hendon in 1876, but this experiment did not
develop. The sport emerged in its recognizable modern form, featuring circular or oval tracks, with the
invention of the mechanical or artificial hare 1912 by Owen Patrick Smith. O.P. Smith had altruistic
aims for the sport to stop the killing of the jack rabbits and see "greyhound race as we see horses". The
certificates system led way to parimutuel betting, as quarry and on-course gambling, in the United States
during the 1920s. In 1926, armed with the Smith patents and a hand shake, it was introduced to Britain
by an American, Charles Munn, in association with Major Lyne-Dixon, a key figure in coursing, and
Brigadier-General Critchley. The deal went sour with Smith never hearing from Munn again. Like the
American, International Greyhound Racing Association, the In.G.R.A. Munn and Critchley launched the
Greyhound Racing Association, and held the first British meeting at Manchester's Belle Vue. The sport
was successful in cities and town throughout the U.K. - by the end of 1927, there were forty tracks
operating. The sport was particularly attractive to predominantly male working-class audiences, for
whom the urban locations of the tracks and the evening times of the meetings were accessible, and to
patrons and owners from various social backgrounds. Betting has always been a key ingredient of
greyhound racing, both through on-course bookmakers and the totalisator, first introduced in 1930. Like
horse racing, it is popular to bet on the greyhound races as a form of parimutuel gambling.

In common with many other sports, greyhound racing enjoyed its highest attendances just after the
Second World War—for example, there were 34 million paying spectators in 1946. The sport
experienced a decline from the early 1960s, when the 1960 Betting and Gaming Act permitted off-
course cash betting, although sponsorship, limited television coverage, and the later abolition of on-
course betting tax have partially offset this decline.

Greyhound racing is undergoing a resurgence in popularity as more and more people discover it as both
a sport and a form of gambling.

Treatment of racing dogs

Living Conditions

In many of the countries where there are large greyhound race tracks with gambling, the dogs live in
kennels at or near the track or by their trainers.

In the United States, the kennels are indoor crates stacked two levels high, with the females usually kept
on the upper level, and males on the lower level. While the space allocated to each dog varies between
locations, typical crate size is 3-1/2 feet wide by 4 feet deep by 3 feet high. While living on the track
these dogs will spend most of their time in these kennels.

In several European countries (Belgium, Denmark, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany,
Hungary, Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland) greyhound racing is carried out by the owners of the dogs
without financial interest. This amateur form of the sport is also found in some countries, such as the
United States, where professional racing exists. In these countries the dogs often live as pets.

In Australia

In Australia live in kennels at night that meet stringent guidelines set by the The Greyhound Racing
Authorities in Australia, and by day many greyhounds are put into running yards or day yards to keep
them entertained and exercised. The aim is to keep greyhounds as fit, happy, and healthy as possible.
Greyhounds are checked for parasites, mulnurishment, or any other medical conditions by an on-course
vet before being able to compete.

The Greyhound Racing Authorities in Australia heavily observe and regulate greyhound welfare and
living conditions and all racing authorities in Australia finance Greyhound Adoption Groups, which
home dozens of greyhounds a month.

Medical Care

In places that allow gambling on Greyhound racing the owners often treat the dogs as short-term
investments. This often means that the care they receive is intended only to help them perform on the
track, not for their long-term health. Greyhound adoption groups frequently report that the dogs from the
tracks have tooth problems the cause of which is debated although it is likely related to either a low-
quality raw meat diet or damage to the gums from chewing on metal cage bars. The groups often also
find that the dogs carry tick-borne diseases and parasites due to the lack of proper preventative
treatments. Due to the dense living conditions in the kennels, the dogs require regular vaccination to
minimize outbreaks of diseases like kennel cough.

After the dogs are no longer able to race (generally, a greyhound's career will end by the age of three or
four), owners either keep the dog for breeding or dispose of the dog. They will sometimes have ex-
racing greyhounds euthanized if they do not want to go through the expense of finding the dogs homes.
The ratio of dogs killed to those adopted is greatly debated. There is much debate between the racing
industry and anti-racing activists about the quality of the dog's care making the exact details hard to
determine.

Recently, doping has also emerged as a problem in Greyhound racing. The racing industry is actively
working to prevent the spread of this practice; attempts are made to recover urine samples from all
greyhounds in a race, not just the winners. Greyhounds from which samples can not be obtained for a
certain number of consecutive races are subject to being ruled off the track. Violators are subject to
criminal penalties and loss of their racing licenses by state gaming commissions and a permanent ban
from the National Greyhound Association. The trainer of the greyhound is at all times the "absolute
insurer" of the condition of the animal. The trainer is responsible for any positive test regardless of how
the banned substance has entered the greyhound's system.

Several organizations, such as British Greyhounds Retired Database, Adopt-a-Greyhound and National
Greyhound Adoption Program, try to ensure that as many of the dogs as possible are adopted. Some of
these groups also advocate better treatment of the dogs while at the track and/or the end of racing for
profit. In recent years the racing industry has made significant progress in establishing programs for the
adoption of retired racers. In addition to actively cooperating with private adoption groups throughout
the country, many race tracks have established their own adoption programs at various tracks.

In recent years, several state governments in the United States have passed legislation to improve the
treatment of racing dogs in their juristiction.

In venues where greyhound racing does not involve gambling, the dogs are almost invariably pets and
are, therefore, generally well treated.

Canicross is the sport of cross-country running while hitched to a dog. It is popular in Europe.

(Canicross is related to the winter dog-powered sport of skijoring, wherein a skier is hitched to one to
three dogs.)

                                               Dog cart during Mardi Gras in New Orleans

Carting is the dog sport or activity of carting, in which a dog (usually a large breed) pulls a cart filled
with supplies, such as farm goods or firewood, but sometimes pulling people. Carting as a sport is also
known as dryland mushing and is practiced all around the world, often to keep winter sled dogs in
competition form during the off-season.

Sulky driving
A variety of carting is sulky driving, where a dog or dogs pulls a two-wheeled cart (sulky) with a
person riding in the sulky. This sport offers both exercise and discipline opportunities for energetic
breeds. Many working breeds are happier when given a job or task, and carting / sulky driving can be a
rewarding hobby for both dog and owner.

Dogs from 15 kg body weight and upwards are able to pull an adult and a sulky comfortably. The
general rule is that the total load (sulky and driver) should not exceed three times the weight of the dog
doing the pulling. If, for example, the sulky and driver totalled 150 kg, then the weight of the dog
pulling would need to be at least 50 kg. Smaller dogs may be used as long as the cart is of a type which
can handle multiple dog draft, and the combined weight of the dogs pulling is at least one third of the
load being pulled.

Dryland mushing
Dryland mushing is distinguished from sulky driving in that the cart, or dryland rig, is attached to the
dog in the same manner as a team to a sled. The cart has three or four wheels, with the driver either
sitting or standing, depending on the cart construction. The International Federation of Sled Dog Sports
sponsors one of the largest dryland mushing events in the world, the IFSS Dryland World Championship.

Coursing is the pursuit of game by dogs—chiefly Greyhounds—running by sight, not by scent.
Coursing was a common hunting technique practiced by nobility with Greyhounds and by commoners
with Lurchers.

A competitive version has been developed since the first set of English rules for coursing was drawn up
in the reign of Elizabeth I. The object is to test the dog, not to kill the hare, and today the dogs are often
muzzled. Hares are often owned and pursued on several occasions.

Dachshund (or "wiener dog") racing is a controversial, yet popular sporting event, primarily found in
North America. Typical races are either 25 or 50 yards in length, and are run on various surfaces. Many
race tracks across America host these events as fundraising or publicity events, and routinely draw the
venues' largest attendance numbers of the year.

The Dachshund Club of America opposes dachshund races, not only on the grounds that the breed has a
genetic predisposition to back injuries, but also because they are afraid that greyhound tracks will use
the events to attract potential customers to see a sport that many animal rights advocates condemn.

The de facto national championship of wiener dog racing is the Wienerschnitzel Wiener Nationals, held
in San Diego, California every December as part of the Holiday Bowl, however there are many other
venues that claim title to the true "national champion".

"Wiener Takes All" is a documentary film that chronicles two years of the Wiener Nationals circuit, as
well as wiener dog races from across the world.

                                                                                    Back | Home | Up | Next


Disc dog is the more generic name for what is commonly called frisbee dog. In disc dog competitions,
dogs and their human disc throwers compete in events such as distance catching and somewhat
choreographed freestyle catching.

The term disc is preferred because Frisbee is a trademarked name for a certain brand of flying disc.

History
The sport got its start in the early 1970s, paralleling the rise in popularity of frisbee sport. The definitive
moment came on August 4, 1974 when Alex Stein, a young college student from Ohio, jumped the fence
at a nationally broadcast baseball game between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Cincinnati Reds. He
had with him a couple of frisbees and an amazing dog named Ashley Whippet. Ashley astonished the
crowd with eight minutes of catching frisbees, running 35 mph and leaping 9 feet in the air to snag discs.
The stunt was so novel that the game was stopped and Joe Garagiola continued to announce the action
on the field. Finally, however, enough was enough, and Alex was escorted off the field. But the seed was
planted, and a new sport was born.

Alex worked with Irv Lander and Eldon McIntire to create a nationwide competition for people and their
dogs. It was a sport that is easy enough for anyone, and that celebrates the bond between handler and
dog. Even today, Alex and Eldon continue to contribute to the sport.

Ashley Whippet
Ashley Whippet, widely considered to be the greatest frisbee dog ever, went on to win 3 World
Championships, perform at the White House for a young Amy Carter, perform during the half-time at
Super Bowl XII, and even starred in an Academy Award-nominated short documentary entitled Floating
Free. Though many great dogs have come along since Ashley, he is still the standard by which all others
are measured.

Ashley's legacy lives on now, 30 years later, as the sport has become popular worldwide. People and
their dogs on at least four continents organize competitions and enjoy the simple joy of a disc in flight—
and that terrific rush (for the dogs) of the catch at the end!

Competitions
Competitions often feature the dynamic Freestyle event, consisting of short routines choreographed to
music with multiple discs in play, and the short-distance format event, in which teams earn points for
catches at varying distances.

Freestyle is a subjectively judged event, similar to Freestyle events like skateboard and snowboard half-
pipe, or Freestyle Footbag (Hacky sack). The team consists of one person (handler) and his or her dog.
Depending on the event, the length of a routine might be anywhere from one minute and 30 seconds all
the way to three minutes. Teams are judged in categories that include Canine Athleticism, Degree of
Difficulty, Showmanship, and so forth. Incredible flips, hyperfast multiple catches, and spectacular
vaults make freestyle a popular event with spectators, and it is regarded as the highest level of
competitive accomplishment.

Short Distance events go by many names: MiniDistance, Throw & Catch, Toss & Fetch, Distance/
Accuracy. The concept is generally the same: Teams are given 60 seconds to get as many catches as
possible on a field marked with increasingly longer distances. The distances generally don't exceed 50
meters for the longest catches. Points are assigned to catches based on the distance of the catch, and an
extra half point will be awarded for the dog being completely airborne for the catch. Only one disc is
used for these events.

Long Distance events are less common, but are still popular. They have a few different formats, but
generally, the longest catch wins the event.

Divisions in frisbee dog events are usually based on the skill and experience of the handler. Men and
women compete in the same divisions for all disciplines except Long Distance, which is usually split
into men's and women's events because it is a power event.

Though competitions generally take place in summer on nice, flat, grassy fields, winter frisbee on soft
snow is also popular in places.

Requirements to compete
Dogs of all kinds can play frisbee. In fact, many dogs from animal shelters and rescue groups excel at
frisbee. Even some World Champions were originally rescued from shelters. Many of the problems that
put dogs into shelters and rescue groups, such as hyperactivity, aggression, or destructive or neurotic
behavior, are often attributes that can be positively channeled into a sport like frisbee. To put it shortly,
these dogs simply need a consistent job to do. Many frisbee dogs also "cross-train" in other dog sports,
including dog agility, flyball, sheepdog trials, and obedience.

Part of the popularity of the sport is its accessibility. All that is necessary to enjoy it is a level grassy
playing area, a dog, and a frisbee. Also, a little imagination is an extra plus for Freestyle. It is estimated
that over one million dogs play frisbee in the United States alone, though only a small percentage
participate in organized competitions.

Popularity
Frisbee dogs are also popular attractions at sporting events as half-time entertainment. Going clear back
to Ashley and his 7th inning stretch performance in 1974, Frisbee dogs have performed at countless
football, basketball, baseball and soccer halftimes. They are many times found in amusement parks,
county fairs and pet festivals of all kinds. There are a very small handful of trainers who even make a
living doing these shows.

Frisbee dog clubs are the backbone of the sport. They organize and promote the sport on a local level,
and work with national organizations to run events. They offer people a way to learn more about the
sport if they are new, and are a great place for the more experienced competitors to give back. Frisbee
dog clubs are quite often active in local animal charities, helping to raise money and awareness for the
groups that exist to help others. Frisbee dog clubs can be found all over the United States, Europe, Asia,
and Australia. The first club was the Dallas Dog and Disc Club, founded in the mid-80s by Ron Ellis.

Teaching a dog to catch a frisbee
Not all dogs immediately understand the concept of chasing a frisbee thrown over their heads so that
they must turn to chase it and catch it. If a dog already knows how to catch, it can learn this new concept
if the disc is thrown at increasing heights, starting by throwing the disc straight to the dog from a short
distance, then gradually throwing the disc higher until it finally goes over the dog's head and he
instinctively follows the disc all the way around.

                                 Several dogs prior to a race

Dog racing is both a gambling event as well as a fund-raising event, depending on the breed and
location. "Dog racing" usually refers to Greyhound racing, which is the largest and most widespread
type of canine competition. In the United States, greyhound racing has been banned in all but a few
states, where its popularity is in decline as the typical dog track attendees grow older. In states where
greyhound races do occur, they are strictly regulated by the government because parimutuel gambling on
the races is allowed.

Other breeds of dogs race; however, these breeds typically race as part of local kennel club events, and
are not commercial ventures. Whippet races are fairly common in the United States, although the most
popular dog racing events are those of Dachshunds. Surprisingly, dachshund racing is not without its
controversy, and some animal rights activists, including the Dachshund Club of America, are trying to
ban the events.

                                                                                 Back | Home | Up | Next


Dog Scootering is a sport where one or more dogs pull a human riding an unmotorized scooter. It is
similar to mushing, which is done in the winter, but generally with fewer dogs and with a scooter instead
of a dogsled. The dogs wear the same harnesses that sled dogs wear, and are hooked to the scooter with
a gangline. The gangline usually incorporates a bungie to smooth out the shocks of speeding up and
takeoff. Most of the same commands are used, although dog scooterers tend to be more relaxed about
their commands, sometimes using "right" and "left" instead of "gee" and "haw", for example.

Scooter
The scooter is generally unmotorized, and has mountain-bike-style tires ranging from 16" to 26". These
aren't razor-type scooters, which would be dangerous in this sport. The scooters incorporate mountain-
bike-style brakes and have a large footboard to stand on and kick off from. The scooters are occasionally
called kick bikes because they are not yet largely marketed for the sport of dog scootering. Some of the
newer scooters also incorporate front shocks similar to mountain bikes to absorb bumbs better.

Location
While this can be an urban sport, done on sidewalks and paved trails, more dog scooters take the sport
off-road to mountain-bike trails and back-country roads, where a higher level of skill is needed. There is
also less chance of having to dodge people or vehicular traffic on these trails.

Benefits
Scootering provides exercise both for the dog and the rider. The dog gets exercise pulling the scooter but
people have to help push, especially up hills. Dogs that exercise regularly tend to be better behaved, as a
lot of bad behavior is due to boredom and lack of exercise. Behavior Problems
Most dogs take to this sport with little encouragement. They get to run as fast as they can and get to see
and visit new places. As dog scooters become more experienced, they tend to take their dog(s) and
scooter(s) with them to new trails. This can lead to a stronger bond between people and their dogs.

Activities




Dog scooterers get together for fun runs, where a number of dog scooterers run their dogs and scooters
on the same trails. Fun runs may be just a morning run, or can be a weekend-long activity with multiple
runs scheduled. This is still a maturing sport, and there are not yet formal dog races or other
competitions.

In December 2005, dog scooterers are putting on the first Dog Powered Sports relay, Dogs Across
America, where participants from around the country will choose one of the trails in their state and ride
it in relay style to cover the entire length.

Drag hunting is a sport in which a group of dogs (usually Beagles) chase a scent that has been laid
(dragged) over a terrain before the hunt. The scent, usually a combination of aniseed oils and possibly
animal meats, is dragged along the terrain by a volunteer for any distance up to several miles to a
designated finish line before the hounds are released at the start line by their owners. The hound first
crossing the finish line wins the race. A variation is that the hounds are followed by a group of
participants on horseback and, without a designated finish line, the hunt ends when the dogs catch up
with the volunteer.

Drag hunting is not a blood sport in that no animal is hunted or killed and as such may become more
popular in jurisdictions where blood sports, such as fox hunting, have been banned. In the United
Kingdom, where fox hunting was banned in February 2005, drag hunting has often been advocated as an
alternative sport by antihunting campaigners. It is also popular in areas where hunting in the traditional
sense could not exist, for example, it is possible (but sometimes unsafe) to drag hunt on land close to
busy roads as the scent is laid where it is safe for the hounds to go.

Drag hunting is a popular sport in South-West Ireland, particularly South Kerry and Cork.

Lure coursing is a sport for dogs that involves chasing a mechanically operated lure. Competition is
usually limited to dogs of purebred sight hound breeds.


Lure course
In lure coursing, dogs chase an artificial lure across a field, following a pattern that is meant to simulate
live coursing. A typical lure course is between 600 and 1000 yards (548 to 914 meters) long. The course
must have a minimum number of turns in order to simulate prey (the rabbit) changing direction in a
chase. The fields used are rarely fenced, however if a dog is lure focussed they will typically follow the
lure from start to finish and not run off course, unless they are "cheating" by trying to cut the lure off.

Qualifying to compete
In American Sighthound Field Association (ASFA) competitions, a dog must be Certified in order to
compete in the Open category of the breed. To certify, a dog must run clean (no faults) with another dog
of similar running style and be certified by a qualified ASFA judge. Dogs used for certification do not
have to be certified themselves, nor do they have to be a sighthound, and judges can certify two or three
hounds at the same time. In American Kennel Club (AKC) coursing, currently the dog must qualify to
compete by running a minimum of 600 yards with four turns twice, in two separate trials, under two
different qualified AKC judges. The dogs run alone, and once they complete both runs, they earn a
Junior Courser (JC) title.

Levels of competition
Dogs are coursed by breed and in groups of two or three, based on the number of dogs available for the
run. Dogs can run alone if there are no other dogs of the same breed entered, however their scores will
not qualify towards a title. Running order is detemined by a random draw, and is not based on size or
comparable ability. Open dogs of a breed are run together. Each dog runs twice during the trial. The first
run is the "preliminary". After all preliminaries have been run, the course is reversed for the second run,
called "finals". Dogs can compete in open stake, field champion stake (for dogs who have earned the
requisite points) or veteran stake (dogs over the age of six years). ASFA also has a Miscellaneous stake
for sighthounds recognized by the Federation Cynologique Internationale (FCI) which includes the
Cirneco dell'Etna, Peruvian Inca Orchid, Chart Polski, Galgo Espanol, and Magyar Agar. Once all
preliminaries and finals have been run, a Best of Breed is determined based on scores. There may be a
run-off between the Open and FCh hounds, or between any dogs of the same breed who have tied
scores. After the Best of Breed runs, the top dogs from each breed compete for Best in Field to
determine the best hound for the whole trial. In AKC trials, Italian Greyhounds are not permitted to
compete for Best In Field. This is because Italian Greyhounds might be mistaken as prey by the larger
sighthound breeds.

Judging
In ASFA trials, hounds recieve a numerical score based on speed (25), agility (25), endurance (20),
enthusiasm (15), and follow (15) for a maximum score of 100 points. "Follow" means following the
lure, not the other dogs. Once a dog receives a qualifying score of 100 points plus either two first
placements or one first and two second placements, they earn a Field Champion title (FC). In AKC trials
hounds are judged for overall ability (10), follow (10), speed (10), agility (10), and endurance (10) for a
maximum score of 50 points. Once a dog has achieved four qualifying runs (50 point runs) they earn a
Senior Courser title.

Because chasing things comes naturally to sighthounds, the dogs generally enjoy the sport. This is often
called prey drive, the inherent trait to chase moving prey, and sighthounds are mostly born with it,
similar to a Thoroughbred horse naturally wanting to run. It is also entertaining for spectators.

Sanctioning organizations
In the US, the AKC and ASFA are the two main sanctioning bodies. Participation is limited to purebred
sighthounds. This group includes:

    ●   Afghan Hounds
    ●   Basenjis
    ●   Borzois
    ●   Deerhounds
    ●   Greyhounds
    ●   Ibizan Hounds
    ●   Italian Greyhounds
    ●   Irish Wolfhounds
    ●   Pharaoh Hounds
    ●   Rhodesian Ridgebacks
    ●   Salukis
    ●   Sloughis
    ●   Whippets

Furthermore, other sighthounds such as the Cirneco dell'Etna, Portuguese Podengo, the hairless Peruvian
Inca Orchid, Azawakh or Tuareg Sloughi, the so-called "Silken Windhound", and the other FCI breeds
mentioned above are allowed to compete together in the ASFA miscellaneous class. Only AKC accepted
breeds can compete in AKC trials.

In Canada, lure coursing is sanctioned by the Canadian Kennel Club (CKC). In Canada, the sighthound
breeds do not include the Sloughi nor the Italian Greyhound, which as of 2005, is still considered a toy
breed by the CKC. There is an effort currently to get the IG included in Canadian lure coursing.

Mushing is a general term for a sport or transport method powered by dogs, and includes carting, pulka,
scootering, sled dog racing, skijoring, freighting, and weight pulling. More specifically, it implies the
use of one or more dogs to pull a sled on snow. The term is thought to come from the French word
marche, or go, run, the command to the team to commence pulling. "Mush!" is rarely used in modern
parlance, however; "Hike!" is more common in English. Mushing can be utilitarian, recreational, or
competitive.

Mushing as a sport is practiced worldwide, but primarily in North America and northern Europe. Racing
associations such as the International Federation of Sleddog Sports (IFSS) and the International Sled
Dog Racing Association (ISDRA) are working toward organizing the sport and in gaining Olympic
recognition for mushing.

Mushing for utilitarian purposes includes anything from hauling wood or delivering milk or the mail to
rural travel and equipment hauling. Dogs have been replaced by snowmobiles in many places.

Equipment
Equipment used in mushing includes at least a dog sled, harnesses for the dogs, and tuglines. Depending
on the kind of hitch system used, a gangline and necklines may also be used. Greenlandic hunters, for
example, use a fan hitch, in which each dog has a separate tugline attached to the sled. The dogs spread
out in a fan formation ahead of the sled as they run, and this gives them more room to maneuver over
rough ice or other obstacles. The fan hitch is used in treeless areas. The gangline, a single line to which
each dog is attached, usually in pairs, keeps the dogs in parallel ahead of the sled, and is better for
forested areas with narrow trails. This is also the typical harness hitch system used in races such as the
Iditarod and the North American Open. Booties, small sock-like coverings for the dog's feet, are used
where ice is sharp and granular or when the team is traveling a long distance, to protect the pads of the
foot.

Type of dog
Dogs used for mushing depend on the particular application: freighting dogs tend to be large and sturdy,
racing dogs light and speedy, with long legs. Breeds used for mushing include Alaskan Malamutes,
Siberian Huskies, Alaskan huskies, Eurohounds, German Shorthaired Pointers, Samoyeds, and
miscellaneous crossbreeds.
Dog team members
Dog team members are given titles according to their position in the team relative to the sled. These
include leaders or lead dogs, swing dogs, team dogs, and wheelers or wheel dogs.

Leaders may be unhitched (a loose or free leader) to find the trail for the rest of the team. Qualities for a
good lead dog are intelligence, initiative, common sense, and the ability to find a trail in bad conditions.
The lead dog steers the rest of the team and sets the pace.

Swing dogs or point dogs are directly behind the leader (one dog if the team is in single hitch). They
swing the rest of the team behind them in turns or curves on the trail. (Some mushers use the term swing
dog to denote a team dog.)

Team dogs are those between the wheelers and the swing dogs, and add power to the team. A small team
may not have dogs in this position. Alternately, the term may be used to describe any dog in a dog team.

Wheel dogs are those nearest the sled, and a good wheeler must have a relatively calm temperament so
as not to be startled by the sled moving just behind it.

                                                                                  Back | Home | Up | Next


Musical Canine Freestyle—also known as Musical Freestyle, Freestyle Dance, and Canine Freestyle—
is a modern dog sport that is a mixture of obedience, tricks, and dance that allows for creative interaction
between dogs and their owners.




                                     Musical Freestyle - A dog and handler perform in a musical
freestyle competition.

There are two types, Musical Freestyle and Freestyle Heeling (also known as Heelwork to Music), the
main difference being that Freestyle Heeling focuses on a dog's ability to stay in variations of the heel
position while the handler moves to music, whereas Musical Freestyle demands that the dog perform a
variety of tricks and other obedience talents, and places a greater focus on the trainer's dance abilities
and creativity.

History
                                 Freestyle Competitions - WCFO events offer divisions for
Heelwork-to-Music and Musical Freestyle.

Musical Freestyle started in many places almost simultaneously, and though it can safely be placed as
beginning around 1989, demonstrations of the talent of heeling to music were shown in Canada,
England, the United States, and the Netherlands within three years of each other, and independently. The
main unifying element among the groups was an interest in allowing more creative obedience
demonstrations and training, a love of music, and in many cases, inspiration from an equine sport called
Musical freestyle, which was a more creative and dynamic form of dressage.

The first musical freestyle group, Musical Canine Sports International, was founded in British
Columbia, Canada, in 1991. Soon, other groups in the United States and England followed. Each region
began developing its own style, with many American groups promoting more trick-based routines and
costumes, and English groups focusing more on heelwork and the dog and less on costumes and design.
Musical freestyle is becoming more frequently demonstrated on animal talent shows and as specialty
acts as well.

Currently, there are several organization regulating competitive freestyle, such as the World Canine
                         [1]                                     [2]
Freestyle Organization         and Canine Freestyle Federation         in North America, and Canine Freestyle GB
[3]                                           [4]
      and Pawfect K9 Freestyle Club (Japan)         internationally.

Competition
Competition rules vary from group to group, and from country to country, but most are based on a
variety of technical and artistic merit points. Regardless of the style of routine to be performed, all
routines are done free of training aids or leashes (except in some beginner categories). Competition can
be done as a single dog-and-handler team, as a pair of dogs and handlers, or as a full team of three or
more dogs and their handlers. Generally, for competition, there is one dog to a person.

In either type of competition, the choice of music and the way the routine reflects the music is important.
Routines that don't seem to follow the pattern of music, no matter how well executed, do not score well.

Exhibition freestyle is a no-holds-barred routine designed to demonstrate the full extent of creativity
and excitement that Musical freestyle can offer. Though highly entertaining and representing what most
people see on television or at events, it allows for moves, props, cues, and costumes that would not
always be allowed on the competition circuit.

Freestyle Heeling

In heelwork to music, the dog and trainer remain close to each other at all times, and sending the dog
away or doing distance work is not part of the routine. The dog should appear almost invisibly tethered
to his partner, although this is a tether that comes from training and loyalty. Pivots, moving diagonally,
backwards, forwards, or back to front are important to the routine, all of course to a suitable musical
theme. Jumping, weaving, rolling, passing through the trainer's legs and anything else 'not heeling' is not
allowed.

Musical Freestyle

In musical freestyle, heelwork can be combined with other moves such as leg weaving, sending the dog
away, moving together at a distance, and more dramatic tricks such as jumps, spins, bows, rolling over,
dancing in place, and other innovative actions where the dog plays off of the dance moves of their
partner are encouraged. A popular finishing trick for some routines is to have a smaller dog jump into
the trainer's arms or over his or her back.

Freestyle in the UK

In the UK, there are 4 stages of competition. Starters, Novice, Intermediate and Advanced and they often
have special classes such as Juniors and Pairs or groups, often to a selected theme. The marking is based
on Technical Merit and Artistic Interpretation. These categories are worth 10 marks each.

Freestyle for fun
Many people are surprised to learn that you do not need to know how to dance, to dance with your dog.
Moving together in a simple routine to music is a great way to put obedience training in action and keep
dogs entertained and interested in learning.
Teaching a dog to be able to work on both sides of the handler's body, not just the left side as in standard
obedience heeling, is the first step to doing freestyle. Simple moves like teaching the dog to back up as
the handler moves forward, to turn in place and to move sideways with the handler are the foundation of
any freestyle routine. The trainer selects a short musical piece, a minute or two, that reflects the dog's
attitude and pace in doing his moves (some dogs do better with a waltz, others suit rock and roll boogie),
and decides what moves would go best with the music. To start with, the trainer breaks the routine into
pieces with only two or three moves linked together, and the trainer and dog work harder, these pieces
are linked together.

The goal is to have fun; a handler or dog becoming stressed indicates that it's time to take a break. The
most important thing is that dog and human get to spend time together, not that the dog can do tricks for
friends.

Pulka is a Scandinavian sport or transport method using a dog hitched to a short, low-slung small sled or
pulk, which in turn is hitched to a skier. The sled is usually used to carry supplies such as a tent or food,
but sometimes a child or other person. In racing, the pulk is left empty.

                                              Schutzhund
                                                                                     Back | Home | Up | Next


Schutzhund is a dog sport that was developed in Germany in the early 1900s to test the breed-
worthiness of German Shepherd Dogs (GSD). An experienced person can look at a dog and determine
whether it looks and moves like a GSD. Schutzhund is designed to look into the heart and mind of a dog
and see whether it acts like a GSD. Schutzhund is a demanding test of the dog and few dogs that have
not been bred for it can pass a schutzhund test.

Traits of Schutzhund dogs
German Shepherd Dogs are working dogs. They should be suitable for a wide variety of tasks: police
work, bomb detection, search and rescue, and many others. The purpose of Schutzhund is to identify
dogs that have or do not have the character traits required for these demanding jobs. Some of those traits
are

     ●   Strong desire to work
     ●   Courage
     ●   Intelligence
     ●   Trainability
     ●   Strong bond to the handler
     ●   Perserverance

Schutzhund training tests these traits. It also tests physical traits such as strength, endurance, agility, and
scenting ability. The goal of Schutzhund is to illuminate the character of a dog through training.
Breeders can use this insight to determine how and whether to use the dog in producing the next
generation of working dogs.

History
The German Shepherd Dog was developed from working herding dogs around 1900 as an all-around
working dog. Within a few years it was clear that the dogs were losing their working ability. Schutzhund
was developed at this time to test the working ability of the dogs. Only GSDs that had passed a
schutzhund test were allowed to breed. This is true in Germany to this day. It is only by testing the
working ability of every generation that the strong working characteristics of the GSD have been
maintained. Dogs of any breed, even mixes, can compete in Schutzhund today, but the most common
breeds are GSDs, Belgian Malinois, Rottweilers, Doberman Pinschers, Dutch Shepherd Dogs, and the
like.

In response to political forces in Germany, in 2004 the SV and VDH made substantial changes to
Schutzhund. The VDH adopted the FCI rules that govern IPO titles, so that at least on paper the SV and
VDH gave up control of the sport to the FCI. The VDH changed the name of the titles from
"SchH" (Schutzhund) to "VPG" (Vielseitigkeitsprüfung für Gebrauchshunde which roughly translates
Versatility examination for working dogs). The SV has retained the "SchH" title names, but otherwise
conforms to the VDH/FCI rules.

Description
There are three schutzhund titles: Schutzhund 1 (SchH1), Schutzhund 2 (SchH2), and Schutzhund 3
(SchH3). SchH1 is the first title and SchH3 is the most advanced. Additionally, before a dog can
compete for a SchH1, he must pass a temperament test called a B. The B tests basic obedience, sureness
around strange people, strange dogs, traffic, and loud noises. A dog that exhibits fear or aggression
cannot pass the B and so cannot go on to schutzhund.

The Schutzhund test has changed over the years. Modern Schutzhund consists of three phases: tracking,
obedience, and protection. A dog must pass all three phases in one trial to be awarded a schutzhund title.
Each phase is judged on a 100-point scale. The minimum passing score is 70. At any time the judge may
dismiss a dog for showing poor temperament, including fear or aggression.

In the tracking phase, a track layer walks across a field, dropping several small articles along the way.
After a period of time, the dog is directed to follow the track. When the dog finds each article he
indicates it, usually by lying down with the article between his front paws. The dog is scored on how
intently and carefully he follows the track and indicates the articles. The length, complexity, and age of
the track varies for each title.

The obedience phase is done in a large field, with the dogs working in pairs. One dog is placed in a
down position on the side of the field and his handler leaves him while the other dog works in the field.
Then the dogs switch places. In the field, there are several heeling exercises, including heeling through a
group of people. There are two or three gunshots during the heeling to test the dog's reaction to loud
noises. There are one or two recalls, two or three retrieves, and a send out where the dog is directed to
run away from the handler straight and fast and then lie down on command. Obedience is judged on the
dog's accuracy and attitude. The dog must show enthusiasm. A dog that is uninterested or cowering
scores poorly.

In the protection phase, the judge has an assistant, called the "helper", who helps him test the dog's
courage and ability to be obedient under stress. The helper wears a heavily padded sleeve on one arm.
There are several blinds, placed where the helper can hide, on the field. The dog is directed to search the
blinds for the helper. When he finds the helper, he indicates this by barking. The dog must guard the
helper to prevent him from moving. There follows a series of exercises similar to police work where the
handler searches the helper and transports him to the judge. At specified points, the helper either attacks
the dog or the handler or attempts to escape. The dog must stop the attack or escape by biting the padded
sleeve. When the attack or escape stops, the dog is commanded to "out", or release the sleeve. The dog
must out or he is dismissed. At all times the dog must show the courage to engage the helper and the
temperament to be obedient in spite of the helper. Again, the dog must show enthusiasm. A dog that
shows fear, lack of control, or inappropriate aggression is dismissed.

Training
Schutzhund training, like the sport itself, has evolved over the years. The definitive description of
Schutzhund training in the first 50 years of the sport is Col. Conrad Most's Dog Training: A Manual,
1910 (English trans. 1954, ISBN 192924200X). By modern standards, Most's training is harsh or even
abusive. It is also structured, consistent, and in many ways conforms to more recent ideas on learning
theory. Over time, the more abusive techniques fell out of use and many trainers still follow Most's
program. In 1981, Helmut Raiser published Der Schutzhund (English trans. by Armin Winkler, 1999 (no
ISBN)), which radically changed Schutzhund protection training. In the US, the next great change in
Schutzhund training is marked by the 1991 publication of Schutzhund Theory & Training Methods
(ISBN 0876057318) by Susan Barwig and Stewart Hilliard. In recent years, a number of English-
language books have been published on Schutzhund training. Some of the more influential books are

    ●   Training the Competitive Working Dog by Tom Rose and Gary Patterson, 1985 (no ISBN)
    ●   Schutzhund Obedience: Training in Drive by Gottfreid Dildei and Sheila Booth, 1992 (no ISBN)
    ●   Advanced Schutzhund by Karen Duet and Ivan Balabanov, 1999 (ISBN 087605730X)

Any discussion of dog training books should mention Karen Pryor's books Lads Before the Wind, 1976
(ISBN 1890948047) and Don't Shoot the Dog, 1984 (ISBN 0553380397). Although Lads is about
dolphin training, not dog training, its influence on modern dog training cannot be overestimated. While
the majority of dog trainers and virtually all Schutzhund trainers do not use clickers, these books bridged
the gap between learning theory research and practical dog training. The ideas that they contain have had
enormous impact on Schutzhund training in the US.

A recent innovation in providing information on Schutzhund training is the development of video tapes
and DVDs. As with books, all videos and DVDs are not created equal. Viewers must exercise discretion
when considering the techniques shown in videos. Just because a technique appears in a video (or book)
does not mean that it is a good idea or that many Schutzhund trainers use it. There is a diversity of
opinion on how to train Schutzhund dogs. This is reflected in the many conflicting opinions presented in
the various videos. Two sources of videos are

    ●   Canine Training Systems
    ●   Leerburg Video
The best source of training information is a good Schutzhund club. The overwhelming majority of
Schutzhund training is done by owner/handlers at local clubs. In the US, most clubs are affiliated with
USA, DVG, or WDA. Schutzhund clubs tend to be small, 20 or so members, because there is a limit to
the number of dogs that can be trained in one session. Clubs often provide only limited formal assistance
with tracking and obedience. To a certain extent, the clubs exist to provide the specialized resources
needed to train the protection phase. However, a legitimate club will not permit a member to train only
protection. Usually the more experienced members are willing to help the novice with tracking and
obedience, though this is typically somewhat informal.

Another function of Schutzhund clubs is to identify dogs that should not be trained in Schutzhund.
Schutzhund is a challenging test of a dog's character, and not every dog, or even every GSD, is up to the
challenge. The training director of the club has a responsibily to the dog, handler, club, and society to
constantly evaluate every dog and to decline to train any dog with questionable character. Schutzhund
clubs regularly hold public trials, providing the opportunity for dogs to earn titles and for handlers to
assess their training progress. A tiny number of dedicated handlers have trained their dogs to title
readiness strictly from books and videos. This is unlikely to succeed in most cases. A good club should
be considered a necessity for Schutzhund training.

Organizations
Schutzhund is governed by a confusing number of organizations. The German Shepherd Dog Club of
Germany, the SV, is the most powerful influence on the sport. The VDH, the all breed kennel club of
Germany, is the body that sets the rules for Schutzhund for all breeds. The DVG is an all-breed dog
sport organization in Germany that organizes clubs and trials. The FCI, the international umbrella
organization for all things dog related, sets the rules for IPO titles. (IPO is the FCI name for sport
Schutzhund titles.) In 2004, the SV decided that they would follow the IPO rules, giving the FCI greater
influence over Schutzhund. Still, the SV has great influence in the FCI and is probably still the most
powerful influence on the sport.

The largest Schutzhund organization in the US is the United Schutzhund Clubs of America, called USA.
In spite of its name, USA is a German Shepherd Dog breed club, but sponsors all-breed Schutzhund
clubs and trials. The Working Dog Association is a branch of another GSD breed club, the German
Shepherd Dog Club of America, which also sponsors clubs and trials. There are a small number of DVG
clubs in the United States, various other breed organizations that are involved in Schutzhund, and the
American Working Dog Federation, which is an umbrella organization. This barely scratches the surface.

Schutzhund and society
Most police departments do not allow their working dogs to breed. This is also true of many other
organizations that use working dogs. The breeding stock for these working dogs is Schutzhund dogs.
Without Schutzhund, the working ability of GSDs and other working breeds would quickly deteriorate
and it would be difficult to find suitable dogs for police work, bomb detection, or search and rescue.
People do Schutzhund for fun, but they also know that they are giving back to society by developing the
next generation of working dogs.

A Sheepdog trial (or simply dog trial) is a competitive dog sport in which herding dog breeds move
sheep around a field, fences, gates, or enclosures as directed by their handlers. Such events are
particularly associated with hill farming areas, where sheep range widely on largely unfenced land.
These trials are popular in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, the USA, Australia, New Zealand and
other farming nations.

Some venues allow only dogs of known herding breeds to compete; others allow any dog that has been
trained to herd.

History
Sheep dog trials of some sort or another have probably occurred at agricultural fairs and shows for
centuries. The present form is thought to have developed originally in the "Borders" area between
England and Scotland, from which the Border Collie also comes. However, the sport's organising bodies
regard the first recorded sheepdog trials as those held in Bala, Wales, in 1873.

The sport was no doubt devised by shepherds keen to impress their friends with the skills of their
sheepdogs. A well-trained dog can fetch a high price, as can its puppies, and can perform amazing feats
of stockmanship.

Event types
There are several events, but the key element is the control of three to six sheep by one or two highly
trained dogs under the control of a single shepherd. Both time and obedience play a part, as competitors
are penalised if a sheep strays from the prescribed course.

One event consists of having the dog send three sheep up a steep hill through three or more gates. The
shepherd must stand at the bottom of the hill and direct the dog by whistling. The huntaway dog barks
loudly to push the sheep ahead up the hill.

Another popular event involves having the dog split six sheep into two groups of three and conducting
each group in turn to small pens through a defined course by heading dogs. The group not being led is
guarded by one of the two dogs, an eye-dog (from its ability to keep the sheep still by head movement
alone). This is more difficult than it sounds, as the sheep invariably try to stay together.
Popular media
Sheepdogs are interesting enough to watch that they have been featured on television and in film. In
New Zealand, The Dog Show was a popular television show until the late 1980s, screening just before
the weekend news. In the United Kingdom between 1975 and 1999, the BBC ran One Man and His Dog,
which had a large urban audience. The movie Babe, about a pig who wants to herd sheep, was based on
Dick King-Smith's book The Sheep Pig, about sheepdog trials in northern England.

Skijoring is a winter dog-powered sport popularized in North America and derived from the
Scandinavian sport of pulka. It involves from one to three dogs hitched directly to a human being on
skis. Variations of skijoring include snowboarding while hitched to a dog, and "grassjoring," skijoring
on grassy fields rather than snow.

In skijoring, the person wears a wide waistband with a clip for attaching a lead, which is attached to the
harness worn by the dog. Special quick-release hitches or hooks are available, used so that the skijorer
may unhook the dog's lead rapidly. The dog provides extra power to the skier, who typically uses cross-
country technique, and the pair work together to move through the landscape.

Tracking is a technique in which dogs are trained to locating certain objects, such as a downed bird.
Many bird and rabbit hunters train their dogs in tracking.

In dog sports, there are tracking competitions.

Weight pulling is a dog sport involving a dog pulling a cart or sled loaded with weight a short distance
across grass, carpet, or snow. Many breeds participate in this sport, with dogs being separated into
classes by weight. Sleddog and pit bull breeds excel within their respective weight classes, having been
historically bred to pull sleds and plows, respectively.

The dog is hitched to the sled with a specially constructed harness designed to spread the weight and
minimize the chance of injury.

Dog weight pulling competitions are sanctioned by various non-profit organizations. In North America
the International Sled Dog Racing Association has sanctioned contests in association with their races.
The International Weight Pulling Association was organized in 1984 to promote the heritage of the
working dog.

The Wiener Nationals are the United States national dachshund racing championships sponsored by
Wienerschnitzel. Regional qualifiers are held in the Southwestern United States (California, Texas,
Arizona, Nevada), with the final 8 Dachshunds racing for the national title every December in San
Diego as part of the Holiday Bowl.

The name Wiener Nationals is a spoof on the National Hot Rod Association's yearly drag racing event
called the WinterNationals held at Pomona California.

                                                                                 Back | Home | Up | Next


Obedience training involves training an animal, most often a dog, to obey basic control commands
such as sit, down, and heel.

There are almost as many methods of training as there are trainers, but over time the basic strategy has
shifted away from punishment or avoidance training (negative reinforcement) to positive reinforcement,
where the dog is rewarded for doing the correct thing during most phases of training rather than being
punished for not doing what the trainer wants.

History
Working dogs have always learned to obey commands related to the work that they historically
performed, such as when a sheepdog moves a flock of animals in response to a shepherd's whistled
directions, or a hunting dog searching for (or chasing down) quarry or leaving the treed quarry at the
hunter's command.

It has been only in more modern times, as the dog has become more of a companion than a hired servant
(paid in food and a dry place to lie down) who lived in the barn with other livestock, that obedience
training has become a separate and specific skill (for both the owner and the dog).

In the twentieth century, formalized dog training originated in military and police applications, and
many theories on how to train a dog came out of the same mentality that created boot camp for soldiers.

In the middle and late part of the century, however, more research into operant conditioning and positive
reinforcement occurred as wild animal shows became more popular-- Traditional methods of teaching
animals behavior (as with dogs) proved irrelevant when, for example, a trainer had to instruct a dolphin
or an orca. These aquatic mammal trainers used clickers (a small box that makes a loud click when
pushed on) to "mark" desired behavior, giving food as a reward. The improvements in training methods
spread gradually into the world of dog training. Every decade sees new methods and new attitudes reach
mainstream training classes.

Companion obedience
There are at least three levels of obedience training:
    ●   Basic behavior
    ●   Training for interaction with the community at large
    ●   Competitive obedience

At a basic level, owners want dogs with whom they can pleasantly share a house, a car, or a walk in the
park. Some dogs need only a minimum amount of training to learn to eliminate outside (be
housebroken), to sit, to lie down, or to come on command (obey a recall). Many other dogs prove more
challenging.

New dog owners might find training difficult because they expect dogs to think and act like humans, and
are surprised and baffled when the dogs don't (or they fail to make progress because they fail to realize
that the dogs don't).

Dogs who demonstrate the previously mentioned basic skills, as well as walking reasonably well on a
leash and a few other minor tasks, can be tested for and earn the American Kennel Club's (AKC) Canine
Good Citizen title.

Basic behavior
The following commands are commonly taught in basic obedience classes:

    ●   Come: This command, also referred to as the recall, is crucial. If the dog won't come when
        called, it can cause great difficulty for the handler and can place the dog in danger.
    ●   Sit: Sitting dogs are under the handler's direct control. It is common to precede other commands,
        such as the Stay command, with a sit command. Sit and Stay are used in conjunction with many
        other commands.
    ●   Stay: This command gives peace of mind. An owner can park her dog while doing something
        else.
    ●   Lie down or down: this command allows even greater control than sitting. Because even people
        without dogs are familiar with this command and use it when dogs are bothering them, the better
        the dog is at it, the better it can get along with strangers and visitors.
    ●   Go to bed or get in: Directs the dog to go to its bed or its crate and to remain there until released.
        The dog has freedom of movement in that location to stand up, turn around, or lie down, unlike
        when placed in a Stay. Useful to keep a dog out from underfoot and safe in a busy or complicated
        situation.
    ●   Drop or drop it: Dogs pick up all sorts of things, some of which they shouldn't have. A dog that
        drops anything on command, no matter how attractive (which to a dog can be rotten and smelly),
        is a dog under control that the owner can prevent from eating dangerous items or from destroying
        valued personal property.
    ●   Leave it: An adjunct to Drop, directing the dog to not touch an item. Also useful before the dog
        has picked anything up. Leave it is also used in conjunction with Take it.
    ●   Take it: The dog leaves a desired object, such as a toy or treat, untouched until given this
        command. This can protect an owner's, visitor's, or child's fingers.
    ●   Heel, Close, By me: The dog walks with its head directly next to the handler's leg and does not
        deviate until released.
    ●   Okay, Free, Break, or Release: Releases the dog from Stay, Heel, Sit, and so forth. Also a
        general release to play.

The specific command word is not important, although the preceding list covers some of the more
common words. Short, clear words that are easily understood by other humans are generally
recommended; that way, people will understand what a handler is telling his dog to do and other
handlers have a good chance of controlling someone else's dog if necessary. In fact, dogs can learn
commands in any language or other communications medium, including whistles, mouth sounds, hand
gestures, and so forth.

While dogs can be trained far beyond these rudiments, a dog that obeys these commands will be a
pleasure to keep and take out. Off-leash obedience is the hallmark of a well-trained dog.

Leash training

Leash training is another facet of training a dog which teaches them to walk on a leash without pulling
or jerking. There are many methods for doing this, such as simply turning and walking the other way
when the dog moves in front of the handler, or firmly grasping the leash at the collar and guiding the dog
into position beside the handler.

Today, many trainers advocate using a plain collar and leash for leash training rather than specialized
training collars, such as slip collars and prong collars. Both of these can potentially inflict damage to a
dog's neck and should not be used except in specific cases when recommended by, and supervised by, a
knowledgeable trainer. Historically, slip collars have been used as a matter of course, and some trainers
still recommend them for basic training on any dog; such collars should be used in a way that makes a
quick popping or zipping sound to startle the dog and are then quickly released, not to choke the dog or
to put tight pressure on the dog's neck. Advocates of plain-collar training encourage students to ask their
instructors to allow them to use plain collars, not slip collars; the techniques for training, however, are
slightly different and some instructors might not agree.

However, hard pulling even on a plain collar can damage a dog's neck, so during times when it is not
possible to work on training and the dog still pulls on the leash, owners can use a nose halter instead of a
collar; these are sold under brand names such as Gentle Leader and Halti. Even these must be used
carefully, not for harshly jerking a dog, as they can jerk a dog's head suddenly to the side.

Specialized common commands
There are a few commands that many domestic dogs learn, but that are not part of the basic repetoire.

    ●   Stop – a dog that will simply stop whatever it is doing and lie down on command no matter how
        far it is from its keeper is a dog that can be taken anywhere. Some handlers use the German word
        Platz(related to "place", i.e. stay in position.) for this action.
    ●   Back up – keepers of large dogs or dogs with a reputation for aggressiveness can make strangers
        more comfortable by teaching the dog to back up on command.
    ●   Growl – the inverse of backing up. Some owners teach non-aggressive dogs to growl on a subtle
        command – not the word growl, usually a small hand gesture – as a way of letting strangers know
        that you and your dog value being left alone.
    ●   Steady – keep near by. The dog can walk free, but not dash off. Train to this command with a
        long leash, calling out Steady when the leash is taut. Continue off leash.
    ●   Stand – dog stands still. Train from lying-down position by lifting under belly while repeating
        command. Useful for grooming. Many dogs are groomed frequently and need to stand quietly
        during the process.

Competitive obedience
For dog owners who enjoy competition and relish the opportunity to work as a highly tuned team with
their dogs, competitive obedience is available.

In competition, merely sitting, lying down, or walking on a leash are insufficient. The dog and handler
must perform the activities off leash and in a highly stylized and carefully defined manner. For example,
on a recall, the dog must come directly to the handler, without sniffing or veering to one side, and sit
straight in front of the handler, not at an angle or off to one side or the other.

Competition obedience exercises




                                 This Smooth Collie retrieves an obedience dumbbell made of wood;
others are made of metal.

A handler can choose her own commands, but the actions that the dog must perform are well defined. As
a dog progresses from novice to advanced competition, the requirements become more challenging and
the list of actions that he must perform becomes longer. Exercises in AKC competition are offered at
three levels: Novice, Open (intermediate), and Utility (advanced); a dog must complete the requirements
at each level before moving on the next. AKC exercises are:

    ●   Recall (Come)

        The handler leaves the dog in a sitting position at one side of the ring, walks to the opposite side,
        and turns to face the dog. On the judge's command, the handler calls or signals the dog to come.
        The dog must come directly to the handler at a brisk trot or gallop, and sit squarely in front, close
        enough that the handler can touch the dog's head without bending or stretching, but not between
        the handler's feet. On the judge's order, the handler commands or signals the dog to "finish". The
        dog must go briskly to heel position and sit squarely at heel.

    ●   Drop on Recall (Open class)

        The handler leaves the dog as in the Recall exercise. On the judge's command, the handler calls
        or signals the dog to come. The dog must come directly to the handler at a brisk trot or gallop.
        While the dog is coming in, the judge signals, and the handler commands or signals the dog to
        drop (lie down). The dog must immediately assume a completely down position. The dog must
        hold the position until commanded or signaled to come, then complete the exercise as in the
        Recall.

    ●   Heel

        Following commands of the judge, the dog and handler team walks a predetermined pattern that
        must include at least one left, one right, and one about turn, as well as a fast and a slow section,
        and at least one halt. During this entire exercise, the dog must maintain heel position, and sit
        quickly at heel whenever the handler stops. This exercise is performed twice in Novice class
        (once on lead and once off-lead), once in Open class, and once in the Utility class, as part of the
        Signal exercise.

    ●   Sit

        Sit is not an obedience exercise, but is a part of almost all of the other exercises. The dog must sit
        without any command (called an automatic sit) whenever the handler stops, and at the end of
        most of the exercises.

    ●   Long Sit and Long Down (Novice and Open Classes)

        These exercises are performed by groups of dogs in the ring at the same time. For the Novice
        Long Sit, the handlers command and/or signal their dogs to sit, then to stay. The handlers walk
        across the ring and stand facing their dogs. The dog must maintain the sit position without
        moving from its position, barking, or whining. After one minute, the judge orders the handlers to
    return, and they return to heel position by walking around their dogs. For the Novice Long Down,
    the handlers command and/or signal their dogs to down, and the dogs must assume the down
    position without assistance. The handlers command and/or signal their dogs to stay, and proceed
    as in the Long Sit, except that the judge waits three minutes before ordering them to return.

    The Open Long Sit and Long Down are done in the same manner, except that the handlers leave
    the ring in a single file and go completely out of the dogs' sight. They remain out of sight for
    three minutes for the Sit and five minutes for the Down.

●   Retrieve on the Flat (Open class)

    The handler stands with the dog sitting in heel position facing the open ring. On order from the
    judge, the handler commands and/or signals the dog to stay, then throws an approved dumbbell at
    least 20 feet. On the judge's order, the handler commands the dog to fetch. The dog must go
    straight to the dumbbell at a brisk trot or gallop, retrieve it, return directly to the handler, and sit
    in front as in the Novice Recall. The dog must not mouth or play with the dumbbell. Upon order
    from the judge, the handler gives the release command and takes the dumbbell. The judge then
    orders the handler to have the dog finish as in the Novice Recall.

●   Retrieve Over High Jump (Open class)

    This exercise is the same as the Retrieve on the flat, except that the handler starts by standing in
    front of a solid jump that is as high as the dog's shoulder height. The handler throws the dumbbell
    over the jump. The dog must jump over the jump, retrieve the dumbbell, and return by jumping
    over the jump again. The remainder of the exercise is the same as the Retrieve on the Flat.

●   Scent discrimination (Utility class)

    The handler presents the judge with an approved set of 5 numbered metal and 5 numbered leather
    articles. The judge selects one of each, placing them where the handler can reach them, and
    arranges the rest on the floor or ground approximately 20 feet from the handler, being certain to
    touch each article. At this point, the dog and handler turn so they are facing away from the
    articles, and the handler uses his hands to scent one of the selected articles. The judge takes the
    scented article without touching it, and places it with the other articles. On the judge's command
    the handler turns and sends the dog. The dog must go directly to the articles at a brisk trot or
    gallop, select the article that was scented by the handler, and retrieve it as in the Open Retrieve
    on the Flat. The exercise is then repeated using the other selected article.
                                 An ACD finding a scent article as part of obedience competition.

For example, in the scent article exercise, the dog searches for a dumbbell that has been scented by the
handler and placed within a pile of identical metal and leather dumbbells by an assistant. The dog must
find the correct article based only on its unique scent and retrieve it.

Dogs can earn obedience titles including an obedience championship. For example, the American
Kennel Club (AKC) awards an "Obedience Trial Championship" (OTCh) to the dog-and-handler team
that defeats a large number of other teams in open competition. In the United States, a purebred dog
recognized by the AKC can compete under AKC rules; dogs not recognized by the AKC can earn titles
in the United Kennel Club (UKC), Mixed Breed Dog Club of America (MBDCA), American Mixed
Breed Obedience Registry (AMBOR), or Australian Shepherd Club of America (ASCA).

Contrary to what one might expect, an obedience champion might not have excellent companion
obedience skills; the actions are so highly formalized for performance in the obedience ring that they do
not automatically translate to a dog who walks pleasantly on a leash, comes when called in the back
yard, or keeps his nose off the dinner table.

Obedience for Other Purposes
There are many reasons for training dogs beyond the level required for basic companionship. For
example, service dogs must obey their sit and down commands perfectly at all times, but they do not
have to conform to the rigid rules of competitive obedience.

Dogs competing in dog sports, such as flyball, agility or Schutzhund, must be trusted in an open field,
off leash and surrounded by other people, dogs, hamburgers, and frisbees. This requires more focused
attention on the owner and a better recall than that found in most household companion dogs, but again
it can be a different kind of training than that required for formal obedience.

Dog Intelligence and Training
Certain breeds, such as Border Collies and Golden Retrievers, are easier to train than others, such as
some hounds and sled dogs. Still, the Border Collie's high energy level can lead it to unwanted behavior
if its exercise and mental needs are not met, whereas the Golden Retriever can be somewhat more
relaxed. Dog intelligence is exhibited in many different ways, and a dog who might not be easy to train
might none-the-less be quite adept at figuring out how to open kitchen cabinets or to escape from the
yard. Novice dog owners need to consider a dog's trainability as well as its energy level, exercise
requirements, and other factors before choosing a new pet.

No breed is impossible to obedience train, but novice owners might find that training some breeds is
quite difficult. The capacity to learn basic obedience—and even complicated behavior—is inherent in all
dogs. Owners must simply be more patient, or creative, or both, with some breeds than with others.

Dogsled racing is a winter dog sport involving the timed competition of teams of sleddogs that pull a
sled, on the runners of which the dog driver or musher stands. The team completing the marked course
in the shortest time is adjudged the winner.

Generally the teams start one after another in equal time intervals, competing against the clock rather
than directly against one another. This is due to logistic considerations of getting teams of from 3 to 24
excited sleddogs to the starting line for a clean timed start. Mass starts where all of the dog teams start
together at the sound of a starting gun etc. are very popular in many parts of Canada. A mass start,
thought to be mass confusion by those who have never experienced the thrill is still the start method
preferred by the members of Ma-Mow-We-Tak, a Canadian sled dog association, according to a poll
taken in the spring of 2005. Dogsled races may be sprint races over relatively short distances of 4 to 25
miles, mid-distance races from 20 to 200 miles, or long-distance races of 200 to over 1000 miles. Sprint
races are frequently two or three-day events with heats run on successive days with the same dogs over
the same course. Mid-distance races are either heat races of 20 to 80 miles per day, or continuous races
of 100 to 200 miles usually. (These categories are informal and may overlap to a certain extent.)

Other modes of dogsled racing include freight races, in which a specified weight per dog is carried in
the sled, and stage races, in which participants run a different course each day, usually from a central
staging location.

Races are categorised not only by distance, but by the maximum number of dogs allowed in each team.
The most usual categories are three-dog, six-dog, and 12 dogs or more (called open or unlimited); some
races have four-dog, eight-dog and/or ten-dog classes instead of three and six.

Racing sleddogs wear individual harnesses to which individual tuglines are snapped, pulling from a loop
near the root of the tail. The dogs are hooked in pairs, their tuglines being attached in turn to a central
gangline. The lines usually include short necklines snapped to each dog’s collar, just to keep the dogs in
proper position. It is unusual ever to see more than 22 dogs hooked at once in a racing team, and that
number is usually seen only on the first day of the most highly competitive sprint events. Dogs may be
omitted from the teams on subsequent days, but none may be added. Many other rules apply, most of
which have been in effect since the beginning of organised dogsled racing in the city of Nome, Alaska,
in 1908.

                                                                                          Home | Up | Next


An alpha roll is a technique previously used in dog training to discipline a misbehaving dog. It consists
of flipping the dog onto his back and holding him in that position, sometimes by the throat. The theory is
that this teaches the dog that the trainer is the pack leader (or alpha animal).

This method is now known to be unsafe for both the trainer and the dog. Even the authors of the book
that originally introduced the idea have changed their position and no longer recommend it.

History
The alpha roll was first widely popularized by The Monks of New Skete, in the 1976 book "How To Be
Your Dog's Best Friend" (see reference below). The book itself is widely regarded as a classic in dog
training literature and highly recommended for people trying to better understand their dog. However,
the monks themselves later expressed regret that they had included the alpha roll technique in the book,
as it was often taken out of context and misused. In the original context, the alpha roll was only meant to
be used in the most serious cases and always in combination with positive reinforcement techniques.

Effects
It is now known that by nature, a dog will only forcibly flip another animal onto his back during a
serious fight back where the intent may be to kill the opponent (this should not to be confused with the
behaviour when a dog rolls over on his own to show submission). So in other words, when you perform
the alpha roll your dog will believe that you are trying to kill him. Many dogs, not only dominant or
aggressive ones, will instincively try to defend themselves, which can be very dangerous or even fatal to
the trainer.

It can also traumatize the dog, causing serious psychological disorders, and leading to further undesired
behaviour such as fear-biting or submissive urination. For aggressive and dominant dogs, it may
increase aggression rather than reduce it.

The alpha roll can also irreparably damage the relationship between the trainer and the dog.

Contemporary Use
Despite the dangers, a few trainers (rarely behaviourists) still use the alpha roll or recommend its use.
Even then, it is usually used only with the most dominant dogs to correct very serious transgressions. It
should never be used by inexperienced trainers, and never to correct undesired behaviour caused by the
dog's failure to understand your command. This will increase anxiety in the dog. Used in a controlled
way and coupled with praise and rewards when the dog changes his behaviour appropriately, it may
have some (often short-term) positive effect, but there are better and safer alternatives.

If the alpha roll appears to have any positive effect, it is usually due to the fear it instills in the dog rather
than establishing true dominance. An animal controlled by fear can become anxious, emotionally
unstable, and unpredictable. The dog will learn that using violence is acceptable behaviour and may
attack people or animals he percieves as being weak when you are not around.

Alternatives to alpha roll
If a dog is showing dominant behaviour and challenging his trainer, there are many safer and better ways
of dealing with the problem. Some of these are listed below. In the most serious cases, a canine
behaviourist should be consulted.

In nature, an alpha animal does not maintain its position by fear and violence. Instead, the subordinate
animals respect the leader for being firm but fair and making good decisions for the pack and naturally
follow. The key point is to reinforce your dominance over the dog using non-aggressive means that
emulate those seen by alpha animals in nature. These include, for example:

     ●   Making the dog wait for your command before allowing him to do a desired action. For example,
         letting him wait for a minute when he wants to go out instead of giving in immediately.

     ●   Eating your own food first before feeding the dog, and making the dog lie down while you eat
         rather than beg.

     ●   Walking through doors before the dog.

     ●   Praising and rewarding the dog when he shows submissive behaviour, e.g. rolling over on his
         back or licking you under your chin.

     ●   Follow through with your commands, by not letting it pass when the dog disobeys.

     ●   Being firm but fair when correcting bad behaviour. Always be consistent, to make sure the dog
         understands what behaviour is allowed and what is not.

     ●   Never give commands that are unsafe for your dog to obey. If the dog does not know he can trust
         you, he will not respect you as a leader.
If you are unable to cope with a dominant animal on your own, a dog behaviourist will usually be able to
help. There are also several books on dog psychology that may help you better understand the dog.

Animal communication is any behaviour on the part of one animal that has an effect on the current or
future behaviour of another animal. The study of animal communication, called zoosemiotics
(distinguishable from anthroposemiotics, the study of human communication) has played an important
part in the development of ethology, sociobiology, and the study of animal cognition.

Intraspecies vs. interspecies communication
The sender and receiver of a communication may be of the same species or of different species. The
majority of animal communication is intraspecific (between two or more individuals of the same
species). However, there are some important instances of interspecific communication. Also, the
possibility of interspecific communication, and the form it takes, is an important test of some theoretical
models of animal communication.

Interspecies communication

Prey to predator

If a prey animal moves or makes a noise in such a way that a predator can detect and capture it, that fits
the definition of "communication" given above. Nonetheless, we do not feel comfortable talking about it
as communication. Our discomfort suggests that we should modify the definition of communication in
some way, either by saying that communication should generally be to the adaptive advantage of the
communicator, or by saying that it involves something more than the inevitable consequence of the
animal going about its ordinary life.

There are however some actions of prey species that are clearly communications to actual or potential
predators. A good example is warning colouration: species such as wasps that are capable of harming
potential predators are often brightly coloured, and this modifies the behaviour of the predator, who
either instinctively or as the result of experience will avoid attacking such an animal. Some forms of
mimicry fall in the same category: for example hoverflies are coloured in the same way as wasps, and
although they are unable to sting, the strong avoidance of wasps by predators gives the hoverfly some
protection. There are also behavioral changes that act in a similar way to warning colouration. For
example, canines such as wolves and coyotes may adopt an aggressive posture, such as growling with
their teeth bared, to indicate they will fight if necessary, and rattlesnakes use their well-known rattle to
warn potential predators of their poisonous bite. Sometimes, a behavioral change and warning
colouration will be combined, as in certain species of amphibians which have a brightly coloured belly,
but on which the rest of their body is coloured to blend in with their surroundings. When confronted
with a potential threat, they show their belly, indicating that they are poisonous in some way.

A more controversial example of prey to predator communication is stotting, a highly noticeable form of
running shown by some antelopes such as Thomson's gazelle in the presence of a predator; it has been
argued that this demonstrates to the predator that the particular prey individual is fit and healthy and
therefore not worth pursuing.

Predator to prey

Some predators communicate to prey in ways that change their behaviour and make them easier to catch,
in effect deceiving them. A well-known example is the angler fish, which has a fleshy growth protruding
from its forehead and dangling in front of its jaws; smaller fishes try to take the lure, and in so doing are
perfectly placed for the angler fish to eat them.

Symbiotic species

Interspecies communication also occurs in various kinds of mutualism and symbiosis. For example, in
the cleaner fish/grouper system, groupers signal their availability for cleaning by adopting a particular
posture.

Human/animal communication

Various ways in which humans interpret the behaviour of domestic animals, or give commands to them,
fit the definition of interspecific communication. Depending on the context, they might be considered to
be predator to prey communication, or to reflect forms of commensalism. The recent experiments on
animal language are perhaps the most sophisticated attempt yet to establish human/animal
communication, though their relation to natural animal communication is uncertain.

Some people believe that it is possible for humans and animals to communicate through telepathy.

Intraspecies communication
The majority of animal communication, however, occurs within a single species, and this is the context
in which it has been most intensively studied.

Forms of communication

Most of the following forms of communication can also be used for interspecific communication.
The best known forms of communication involve the display of distinctive body parts, or distinctive
bodily movements; often these occur in combination, so a distinctive movement acts to reveal or
emphasise a distinctive body part. An example that was important in the history of ethology was the
parent Herring Gull's presentation of its bill to a chick in the nest. Like many gulls, the Herring Gull has
a brightly coloured bill, yellow with a red spot on the lower mandible near the tip. When it returns to the
nest with food, the parent stands over its chick and taps the bill on the ground in front of it; this elicits a
begging response from a hungry chick (pecking at the red spot), which stimulates the parent to
regurgitate food in front of it. The complete signal therefore involves a distinctive morphological feature
(body part), the red-spotted bill, and a distinctive movement (tapping towards the ground) which makes
the red spot highly visible to the chick. Investigations by Niko Tinbergen and his colleagues showed that
the red colour of the bill, and its high contrast, are crucial for eliciting the appropriate response from the
chick (It is unresolved whether this actually is an inborn behavior in all its complexity, or simply a
combination of generalized curiosity on part of the chick, and generalized parental/feeding instincts
acting together to produce a simple learning process via reward. Gull chicks peck at everything that is
brightly colored, mainly red, yellow, white or shining, high-contrast objects, but the parent's bill is the
only such object that will constantly yield food as a reward when pecked at. Accidental swallowing of
pieces of brightly colored plastic or glass is a common cause of mortality amongst gull chicks).

Another important forms of communication is bird song, usually performed mainly by males, though in
some species the sexes sing in alternation (this is called duetting and serves mainly purposes of
strengthening pair-bonding and repelling competitors). Bird song is just the best known case of vocal
communication; other instances include the warning cries of many monkeys, the territorial calls of
gibbons, and the mating calls of many species of frog.

Less obvious (except in a few cases) is olfactory communication. Many mammals, in particular, have
glands that generate distinctive and long-lasting smells, and have corresponding behaviours that leave
these smells in places where they have been. Often the scented substance is introduced into urine or
feces. Sometimes it is distributed through sweat, though this does not leave a semi-permanent mark as
scents deposited on the ground do. Some animals have glands on their bodies whose sole function
appears to be to deposit scent marks: for example Mongolian gerbils have a scent gland on their
stomachs, and a characteristic ventral rubbing action that deposits scent from it. Golden hamsters and
cats have scent glands on their flanks, and deposit scent by rubbing their sides against objects; cats also
have scent glands on their foreheads. Bees carry with them a pouch of material from the hive which they
release as they reenter, the smell of which indicates if they are a part of the hive and grants their safe
entry.

Functions of communication

While there are as many kinds of communication as there are kinds of social behaviour, a number of
functions have been studied in particular detail. They include:

     ●   agonistic interaction: everything to do with contests and aggression between individuals. Many
        species have distinctive threat displays that are made during competition over food, mates or
        territory; much bird song functions in this way. Often there is a matched submission display,
        which the threatened individual will make if it is acknowledging the social dominance of the
        threatener; this has the effect of terminating the aggressive episode and allowing the dominant
        animal unrestricted access to the resource in dispute. Some species also have affiliative displays
        which are made to indicate that a dominant animal accepts the presence of another
        courtship rituals: signals made by members of one sex to attract or maintain the attention of
        potential mate, or to cement a pair bond. These frequently involve the display of body parts, body
        postures (gazelles assume characteristic poses as a signal to initiate mating), or the emission of
        scents or calls, that are unique to the species, thus allowing the individuals to avoid mating with
        members of another species which would be infertile. Animals that form lasting pair bonds often
        have symmetrical displays that they make to each other: famous examples are the mutual
        presentation of weed by Great-Crested Grebes, studied by Julian Huxley, the triumph displays
        shown by many species of geese and penguins on their nest sites and the spectacular courtship
        displays by birds of paradise and manakins.

    ●   food-related signals: many animals make "food calls" that attract a mate, or offspring, or
        members of a social group generally to a food source. When parents are feeding offspring, the
        offspring often have begging responses (particularly when there are many offspring in a clutch or
        litter - this is well known in altricial songbirds, for example). Perhaps the most elaborate food-
        related signal is the dance language of honeybees studied by Karl von Frisch.
    ●   alarm calls: signals made in the presence of a threat from a predator, allowing all members of a
        social group (and often members of other species) to run for cover, become immobile, or gather
        into a group to reduce the risk of attack.
    ●   metacommunications: signals that modify the meaning of subsequent signals. The best known
        example is the play face in dogs, which signals that a subsequent aggressive signal is part of a
        play fight rather than a serious aggressive episode.

Evolution of communication

The importance of communication is clear from the fact that animals have evolved elaborate body parts
to facilitate it. They include some of the most striking structures in the animal kingdom, such as the
peacock's tail. Birdsong appears to have not just peripheral but also brain structures entirely devoted to
its production. But even the red spot on a herring gull's bill, and the modest but characteristic bowing
behaviour that displays it, require evolutionary explanation.

There are two aspects to the required explanation:

    ●   identifying a route by which an animal that lacked the relevant feature or behaviour could acquire
        it;
    ●   identifying the selective pressure that makes it adaptive for animals to develop structures that
        facilitate communication, emit communications, and respond to them.
Significant contributions to the first of these problems were made by Konrad Lorenz and other early
ethologists. By comparing related species within groups, they showed that movements and body parts
that in the primitive forms had no communicative function could be "captured" in a context where
communication would be functional for one or both partners, and could evolve into a more elaborate,
specialised form. For example, Desmond Morris showed in a study of grass finches that a beak-wiping
response occurred in a range of species, serving a preening function, but that in some species this had
been elaborated into a courtship signal.

The second problem has been more controversial. The early ethologists assumed that communication
occurred for the good of the species as a whole, but this would require a process of group selection
which is believed to be mathematically impossible in the evolution of sexually reproducing animals. It
was the fundamental insight of sociobiology that behaviours that benefited a whole group of animals
might emerge as a result of selection pressures acting solely on the individual. In the case of
communication, an important discussion by John R. Krebs and Richard Dawkins established hypotheses
for the evolution of such apparently altruistic or mutualistic communications as alarm calls and
courtship signals to emerge under individual selection. This led to the realisation that communication
might not always be "honest" (indeed, there are some obvious examples where it is not, as in mimicry).
The possibility of evolutionarily stable dishonest communication has been the subject of much
controversy, with Amotz Zahavi in particular arguing that it cannot exist in the long term.
Sociobiologists have also been concerned with the evolution of apparently excessive signalling
structures such as the peacock's tail; it is widely thought that these can only emerge as a result of sexual
selection, which can create a positive feedback process that leads to the rapid exaggeration of a
characteristic that confers an advantage in a competitive mate-selection situation.

Communication and understanding
Ethologists and sociobiologists have characteristically analysed animal communication in terms of more
or less automatic responses to stimuli, without raising the question of whether the animals concerned
understand the meaning of the signals they emit and receive. That is a key question in animal cognition.
There are some signalling systems that seem to demand a more advanced understanding. A much
discussed example is the use of alarm calls by vervet monkeys. Richard Seyfarth and Dorothy Cheney
showed that these animals emit different alarm calls in the presence of different predators (leopards,
eagles, and snakes), and the monkeys that hear the calls respond appropriately - but that this ability
develops over time, and also takes into account the experience of the individual emitting the call.
Metacommunication, discussed above, also seems to require a more sophisticated cognitive process.

Animal communication and human behaviour
Another controversial issue is the extent to which humans have behaviours that resemble animal
communication, or whether all such communication has disappeared as a result of our linguistic
capacity. Some of our bodily features - eyebrows, beards and moustaches, deep adult male voices,
perhaps female breasts - strongly resemble adaptations to producing signals. Ethologists such as
Iraneaus Eibl-Eibesfeldt have argued that facial gestures such as smiling, grimacing, and the eye-brow
flash on greeting are universal human communicative signals that can be related to corresponding
signals in other primates. Given the recency with which spoken language has emerged, it is likely that
human body language does include some more or less involuntary responses that have a similar origin to
the communication we see in other animals.

Humans also often seek to mimic animals' communicative signals in order to interact with the animals.
For example, cats have a mild affiliative response involving closing their eyes; humans often close their
eyes towards a pet cat to establish a tolerant relationship. Stroking, petting and rubbing pet animals are
all actions that probably work through their natural patterns of interspecific communication.

Animal communication and linguistics
For linguistics, the interest of animal communication systems lies in their similarities to and differences
from human language:

    1. Human languages are characterized for having a double articulation (in the characterization of
       French linguist André Martinet). It means that complex linguistic expressions can be broken
       down in meaningful elements (such as morphemes and words), which in turn are composed of
       smallest meaningless phonetic elements, or phonemes. Animal signals, however, do not exhibit
       this dual structure.
    2. Animal utterances are generally reflexes of external stimuli and thus are not produced
       intentionally. They cannot refer to matters removed in time and space (a possible exception is the
       information conveyed in honeybee dance language).
    3. Human language is learned, while animal communication systems are known largely by instinct.
    4. Human languages combine elements to produce new messages (a property known as creativity).
       This is not possible in animal communication systems.
    5. In contrast to human language, animal communication systems are not able to express conceptual
       generalizations.

In the hobbies of dog fancy and dog breeding, the term dog aggression describes canine-to-canine
antipathy.

Aggression itself is usually defined by canine behaviorists as "the intent to do harm". Many dogs will
show "displays of aggression" such as barking, growling, or snapping in the air without actually having
any aggressive intent.

Dog aggression is a common dog behavior, and can be seen in all breeds of dogs, although some dog
breeds have a predisposition to display such aggression. The breed standard usually spells out whether
dog aggression is common in the breed and to what degree it is allowed. Most of the terrier breeds and
the bull breeds have a higher likelihood of developing dog aggression. Individual dogs may or may not
display the level of aggression that their breed standard suggests.

Factors contributing to aggression

Factors contributing to the likelihood of the development of dog aggression include:

    ●   Breed predisposition
    ●   Living as part of a multidog household
    ●   Lack of proper exposure to other dogs during the critical socialization period
    ●   Early imprinting by an aggressive or nervous dam
    ●   Being raised as part of a large litter (more than 5 puppies)
    ●   A traumatic experience associated with other dogs, such as being attacked or having seen a fight
    ●   Lack of abundant resources (food, water, sex, etc.) in the environment
    ●   Thyroid malfunction or other medical conditions

Dog aggression does not usually become a serious behavior in most dogs until they reach the age of 1.5
years. Prior to that age, most dogs show only the seeds of developing aggression, such as fear and/or
nervousness around other dogs, displays of aggression only under certain circumstances (while on leash,
in the presence of food, in the presence of the owner, etc.), or most commonly, over-the-top play
behavior. Play behavior such as tackling, chasing, mouthing, nipping, pawing, and wrestling are all
normal canine behaviors that serve the evolutionary function of preparing the young dog for later
combat and hunting. Young dogs that engage in excessive amounts of these behaviors are much more
likely to develop dog aggression as they age.
Dog aggression should not be confused with human aggression, which is allowed in some breed
standards as well, as long as the aggression springs from a desire to defend the dog's owner or territory.

United States

The United States has the highest reported incidence of dog aggression problems of any country in the
world. One of the major contributing factors to the development of dog aggression is living as part of a
multidog (more than one) household. More than a third of dogs in the United States—a higher
percentage than any other country in the world—live as part of multidog households.

A dog trainer is a person involved in the training of dogs.

Professional "dog trainers" usually do not train the dogs, but actually train the owners how to train their
own dogs.

                                            Housebreaking
                                                                                     Back | Home | Up | Next


Housebreaking is the process of training a domesticated animal that lives with its human owners in a
house to urinate and defecate outdoors, or in a designated indoor area, rather than all over the house. The
pet owner's desire is to break the habit of eliminating in the house, hence the term. House-training or
sometimes even potty training are common synonyms for housebreaking. The term "housebreaking" is
most often applied to dogs, but it can also be used for cats, birds, ferrets, rabbits, or any other animal that
lives in a house.

Common Methods
One of the most popular methods of housebreaking dogs today is the use of crate training. Like most
animals, dogs instinctively try to avoid soiling their own dens. The crate training method makes use of
this instinct by confining the dog in an artificial "den" when it cannot be closely supervised. Because the
den instinct is common to all canids, this method of housebreaking is highly effective for all dog breeds
and even for wolf-dog hybrids.

The "crate" is most often a plastic dog carrier, although other kinds of small, comfortable enclosures can
be used. It must be large enough for the puppy to stand and turn around comfortably, but not much
bigger; if the crate is too large, the puppy will simply eliminate in one end and sleep in the other end,
defeating the purpose. As long as the crate is comfortable and the puppy is introduced to it gradually and
is taken out to receive plenty of attention every day, most puppies will not only grow accustomed to the
crate but actually become fond of it. Many dogs voluntarily continue sleeping in their crates long after
they have been fully house-trained and no longer require confinement.

The puppy must not be confined in the crate for long periods of time. Most puppies under the age of
about six months are incapable of waiting long periods of time for a chance to eliminate. If the puppy
repeatedly finds itself forced to eliminate in the crate, it will eventually lose the inhibition against soiling
its den entirely - making house-training much more difficult. The puppy must be taken outside to
eliminate at least once every two to four hours during the day. In addition, it will almost always need to
eliminate shortly after eating a meal or drinking water, after waking from sleep, after being removed
from its crate, and after play or exercise. The owners also closely observe the puppy's body language and
take it outside every time it shows signs of being ready to eliminate, such as squatting, walking in small
tight circles, or sniffing the ground as though searching for the ideal spot. They only use this body
language for a few seconds before they eliminate, so careful watch on the owner's part is needed.

If the owner catches the puppy in the process of urinating or defecating indoors, they make a sharp, loud
noise. The purpose of this is not to punish or frighten the puppy, but to startle it so that it will stop. The
owner then takes the puppy outside or wherever they want them to go to finish eliminating. Usually the
puppy is already done, but the owner should try to catch the puppy in the act. If he relieves itself, they
should praise it very much, to make going outside seem like a very good act to do.

In order to teach the puppy where to go, the owner always takes it outside through the same door. When
the puppy does eliminate outdoors in the correct spot, the owner praises it and offers a food treat. If the
puppy does not eliminate after 15 or 20 minutes outside, the owner should return it to its crate, and try
again later.

In the wild, all the dogs or wolves in a pack urinate and defecate in a designated area, away from the
den. Because of that instinct, with this training the puppy comes to understand that the designated area
for elimination is outside. The puppy will begin going to the door when it feels the urge to eliminate.
The owners watch for this behavior and, when they see it, praise the puppy and immediately let it
outside. Most puppies will spontaneously whine, bark or scratch at the door to get their owners' attention
if the door is not opened quickly; some owners even train the dog to ring a bell when it needs to relieve
itself. As the puppy grows older, it gains the ability to control its bowels and bladder for longer periods
of time, and becomes increasingly able to wait long periods without requiring confinement.

It is usually good to think of the amount of time a puppy can hold it as one hour per month of its age.
For example, if the puppy is 5 months old, then it can usually hold it in for 5 hours. This is true until the
puppy is 10 months old, when 10 hours is the maximum for any age. However, some breeds, especially
the basset hound and many of the toy breeds are harder to housebreak than others. If a puppy seems not
to be able to hold it very long (e.g. only 1 hour when they are 1 year old), then the puppy should be
examined for bladder problems by a vet.

Common Mistakes
Most experts advise against punishing dogs when they eliminate indoors, at least during the early part of
the housebreaking process. This is not because they believe all punishment is necessarily inhumane, but
because when it comes to housebreaking, punishment can very easily create more problems than it
solves. If a dog is punished for urinating or defecating, especially before it really understands where it is
supposed to eliminate, quite often it will simply learn not to eliminate when people are watching. It may
actually begin to avoid eliminating when its owners bring it outside. Then, when the dog is indoors, it
will look for an opportunity to hide and relieve itself, creating a mess in a place where the owners may
not find it until hours or even days later. This can make house-training much more difficult than it needs
to be.

Another extremely common mistake is for owners to punish a dog for eliminating in the house when
they have not actually caught the dog in the act. If the owner finds a mess on the floor and goes to find
the dog and scold it, the dog will believe it is being punished for whatever it was doing when the owner
found it. Dogs are totally incapable of associating the punishment with their eariler actions, even if their
owner drags them to the mess and points it out to them. Punishing a dog when it cannot understand what
the punishment is for only makes it confused and upset, possibly creating entirely new behavioral
problems.

One traditional method of punishment - rubbing the dog's nose in its own mess - is particularly counter-
productive. As noted above, dogs and wolves have a natural urge to eliminate where the rest of their
pack does. They locate the spot by scent; this is why dogs will generally spend some time sniffing the
ground before they relieve themselves. Thus, rubbing the dog's nose in its urine or feces actually
reinforces to the dog that it should continue eliminating in that particular spot.

Other Problems
Formerly housebroken dogs may develop problems with eliminating indoors due to emotional stress
from changes in the dog's schedule, or due to medical problems.

Some dogs, especially puppies, may urinate when extremely excited, such as when an owner comes
home after being gone all day. In this case, the dog genuinely cannot control the urination. Rather than
attempting to teach the dog not to urinate, the owner must focus on training the dog to stay calm and not
get excited enough to lose control. Dogs - again, especially puppies - also urinate to show extreme
submission to a more dominant pack member. This is an instinct, and cannot be trained away. Punishing
a dog for submissive urination only causes it to urinate more in a desperate attempt to appease the
punisher; if the cycle continues long enough, the confused and frightened dog may eventually begin to
display fear-induced aggression. The solution must involve training the dog to feel more secure, so that
it no longer feels the need to perform extreme submission displays.

Dogs may also begin urinating in the house to mark their territory, as a way of challenging for
dominance in the pack. Both male and female dogs may do this, even if they are spayed or neutered.
Again, this should not be understood as a housebreaking problem, but a dominance problem. The
solution must focus on teaching the dog to accept a subordinate position in the household. A
professional trainer or behaviourist should be contacted to solve this kind of problem.

The Intelligence of Dogs is a book by Stanley Coren.

Methodology
The author used "understanding of new commands" and "obey first command" as his standards of
intelligence. He surveyed dog trainers and compiled this list of dog intelligence.

    ●    1-10 Brightest Dogs
    ●   11-26 Excellent Working Dogs
    ●   27-39 Above Average Working Dogs
    ●   40-54 Average Working/Obedience Intelligence
    ●   55-69 Fair Working/Obedience Intelligence
    ●   70-79 Lowest Degree of Working/Obedience Intelligence


Criticism
Intelligence is a complex subject. A breed of dog that does not learn very quickly may have other talents.

It is important to remember that intelligence should not be judged only by the willingness to follow
obedience commands. The willingness or ability to be obedience trained may reflect a desire to please or
a dependence upon humans, as well as intelligence. Many long time livestock guardian breed owners
believe that working breeds such as the Great Pyrenees or the Kuvasz are not easily trained because they
do not see the point of such commands as “sit” or “down”. Hounds may also suffer from this type of
ranking; several rank in the bottom tier of this list (such as Beagles, Bloodhounds, and Basset Hounds).
These dogs are bred to have more of a "pack" mentality with other dogs and less reliance on a master's
direct commands. While they truly may not have the same kind of intelligence as a Border Collie, they
were not bred to learn and obey commands quickly, but to think for themselves while trailing game.

An obedience school is an institution that trains pets (particularly dogs) how to behave properly. When
puppies are young and in the first stages of training, they are often taken by their owners to obedience
schools. Most obedience schools are located in the United States. Training usually takes place in small
groups. In addition to training pets themselves, obedience schools also teach pet owners how to train,
praise, and scold their pets.

                                     Operant Conditioning
                                                                                 Back | Home | Up | Next


Operant conditioning, so named by psychologist B. F. Skinner, is the modification of behavior brought
about over time by the consequences of said behavior. The phrase operant conditioning differs from
Pavlovian conditioning in that while operant conditioning deals with voluntary behavior explained by its
consequences, Pavlovian conditioning deals with involuntary behavior triggered by its antecedents.

Operant conditioning, sometimes called instrumental conditioning or instrumental learning, was first
extensively studied by Edward L. Thorndike (1874-1949), who observed the behavior of cats trying to
escape from home-made puzzle boxes. When first constrained in the boxes, the cats took a long time to
escape. With experience, ineffective responses occurred less frequently and successful responses
occurred more frequently, enabling the cats to escape in less time over successive trials. In his Law of
Effect, Thorndike theorized that successful responses, those producing satisfying consequences, were
"stamped in" by the experience and thus occurred more frequently. Unsuccessful responses, those
producing annoying consequences, were stamped out and subsequently occurred less frequently. In
short, some consequences strengthened behavior and some consequences weakened behavior. B.F.
Skinner (1904-1990) built upon Thorndike's ideas to construct a more detailed theory of operant
conditioning based on reinforcement and punishment.

Reinforcement and punishment
Reinforcement and punishment, the core ideas of operant conditioning, are either positive (adding a
stimulus to an organism's environment), or negative (removing a stimulus from an organism's
environment). This creates a total of four basic consequences, with the addition of no consequence (i.e.
nothing happens). It's important to note that organisms are not reinforced or punished; behavior is
reinforced or punished.

    ●   Reinforcement is a consequence that causes a behavior to occur with greater frequency.
    ●   Punishment is a consequence that causes a behavior to occur with less frequency. According to
        Skinner's theory of operant conditioning, there are two methods of decreasing a behavior or
        response. These can be by punishment or extinction.

Four contexts of operant conditioning: Here the terms "positive" and "negative" are not used in their
popular sense, but rather: "positive" refers to addition, and "negative" refers to subtraction. What is
added or subtracted may be either reinforcement or punishment. Hence positive punishment is
sometimes a confusing term, as it denotes the addition of punishment (such as spanking or an electric
shock), a context that may seem very negative in the lay sense. The four situations are:
   1. Positive reinforcement occurs when a behavior (response) is followed by a pleasant stimulus
      that rewards it. In the Skinner box experiment, positive reinforcement is the rat pressing a lever
      and receiving a food reward.
   2. Negative reinforcement occurs when a behavior (response) is followed by an unpleasant
      stimulus being removed. In the Skinner box experiment, negative reinforcement is a loud noise
      continuously sounding inside the rat's cage until it presses the lever, when the noise ceases.
   3. Positive punishment an aversive stimulus, such as introducing a shock or loud noise.
   4. Negative punishment or Extinction removes a pleasant stimulus, such as taking away a child's
      toy. This occurs when a behavior (response) that had previously been followed by a pleasant
      stimulus is followed by no stimulus at all. In the Skinner box experiment, this is the rat pushing
      the lever and being rewarded with a food pellet several times, and then pushing the lever again
      and never receiving a food pellet again. Eventually the rat would learn that no food would come,
      and would cease pushing the lever.

Also:

            ❍   A type of learning in which a certain behavior (usually negative) is not done in an attempt
                to not receive a punishment is termed avoidance learning.

            ❍   One of the practical aspects of operant conditioning with relation to animal training is the
                use of shaping or Reinforcing successive approximations, as well as chaining.

Prey drive is the instinctive behavior of a carnivore to pursue and capture prey.

In dog training, prey drive can be used as an advantage because dogs with strong prey drive are also
willing to pursue moving objects such as toys, which can then be used to encourage certain kinds of
behavior, such as that of greyhound racing or the speed required in dog agility.

                                             Socialization
                                                                                   Back | Home | Up | Next


Socialization in the study of animal and human behavior is the process by which human beings or
animals learn to adopt the behavior patterns of the community in which they live. For both humans and
animals, this is typically thought to occur during the early stages of life, during which individuals
develop the skills and knowledge necessary to function within their culture and environment. However,
this also includes adult individuals moving into an environment significantly different from one(s) in
which they have previously lived and must thus learn a new set of behaviors.

Humans
Socialization is, in essence, learning (see Charon, 1987:63-69). Socialization refers to all learning
regardless of setting or age of the individual. In every group one has to learn the rules, expectations, and
knowledge of that group, whether the group is your family, the army, or the state (nation). Socialization
is the process whereby people acquire a social identity and learn the way of life within their society. All
of this amounts to the learning of culture.

For some psychologists -- especially those working in the psychodynamic tradition -- the most important
time when socialization occurs is between the ages of one and ten. Humans learn throughout their lives,
but this first ten years is arguably the most important time in determining the personality of persons
across their life span.

Forms of socialization

Sociologists may distinguish four kinds of socialization:

     ●   Reverse socialization
     ●   Developmental socialization
     ●   Primary socialization
     ●   Anticipatory socialization
     ●   Resocialization

Reverse socialization

deviation from the desired behaviours or enculturation esp. of the younger generations

Developmental socialization
Primary socialization

Primary socialization is the process whereby people learn the attitudes, values, and actions appropriate
to individuals as members of a particular culture. For example, some Inuits learn to enjoy eating the raw
intestines of birds and fish, while some Chinese people eat Carp's heads and the tripe (stomach tissue) of
pigs (Schaefer & Lamm, 1992: 98).

Anticipatory socialization

Anticipatory socialization refers to the processes of socialization in which a person "rehearses" for future
positions, occupations, and social relationships (See Appelbaum & Chambliss, 1997:76). Henslin
(2004:71) offers the example of a high school student who, upon hearing he had been accepted to a
university, began to wear college student-type clothes:

       "In his last semester of high school, Michael has received word that he has been accepted to
       State University. Soon he begins to dismiss high school activities as being "too high school," and
       begins to wear clothing styles and affect mannerisms that are characteristic of State University
       students. Michael is exhibiting signs of anticipatory socialization."

Resocialization

Resocialization refers to the process of discarding former behavior patterns and accepting new ones as
part of a transition in one's life. This occurs throughout the human life cycle (Schaefer & Lamm, 1992:
113). Resocialization can be an intense experience, with the individual experiencing a sharp break with
their past, and needing to learn and be exposed to radically different norms and values. An example
might be the experience of a young man or woman leaving home to join the Marines.

Agents of Socialization

Agents of socialization are people and/or groups that influence self concepts, emotions, attitudes and
behavior of a person. (Henslin, 1999:76-81)

    1. The Family. The family is the most important of the agents of socialization. Family is responsible
       for, among other things, determining one's attitudes toward religion and establishing career goals.
    2. The School. The school is the agency responsible for socializing groups of young people in
       particular skills and values in our society.
    3. Peer Groups. Peers refer to people who are roughly the same age and/or who share other social
       characteristics (e.g., students in a college class).
    4. The Mass Media.
    5. Other Agents: Religion, Work Place, The State.
Total Institutions

The term "total institutions" was coined in 1961 by Erving Goffman, designed to describe a society
which is socially isolated but still provides for all the needs of its members. Therefore, total institutions
have the ability to resocialize people either voluntarily or involuntarily. For example, the following
would be considered as total institutions: prisons, the military, mental hospitals and convents (Schaefer
& Lamm, 1992: 113).

Goffman lists four characteristics of such institutions:

     ●   All aspects of life are conducted in the same place and under the same single authority.
     ●   Each phase of a members daily activity is carried out in the immediate company of others. All
         members are treated a like and all members do the same thing together.
     ●   Daily activities are tightly scheduled. All activity is superimposed upon the individual by a
         system of explicit formal rules.
     ●   A single rational plan exists to fulfill the goals of the institution.

Products of socialization

Gender Socialization and Gender Roles

Henslin (1999:76) contends that "an important part of socialization is the learning of culturally defined
gender roles." Gender socialization refers to the learning of behavior and attitudes considered
appropriate for a given sex. Boys learn to be boys and girls learn to be girls. This "learning" happens by
way of many different agents of socialization. The family is certainly important in reinforcing gender
roles, but so are one’s friends, school, work and the mass media. Gender roles are reinforced through
"countless subtle and not so subtle ways" (1999:76).

Henslin (2004:66) suggests that the fact that parents let their preschool boys roam farther from home
than their preschool girls illustrates the how girls are socialized to be more dependent.

Other animals
The process of intentional socialization is central to training animals to be kept by humans in close
relationship with the human environment, including pets and working dogs.

Feral animals

Feral animals can be socialized with varying degrees of success. We also have feral children which are
those which are brought up in the wild and savage manner.They are not animals in this sense of
sociological cultural relativism.
Cats

For example, the cat returns readily to a feral state if it has not been socialized properly in its young life.
A feral cat usually fears humans. People often unknowingly own one and think it is merely "unfriendly."

These cats, if left to proliferate, often become "pests" in populated neighborhoods by decimating the bird
population and digging up people's yards. Feral cats are sometimes helpful when used in agriculture to
keep rodent and snake populations down. Such cats are often referred to as "barn" cats.

Socializing cats older than six months can be very difficult. It is often said that they cannot be
socialized. This is not true, but the process takes two to four years of diligent food bribes and handling,
and mostly on the cat's terms. Eventually the cat may be persuaded to be comfortable with humans and
the indoor environment.

Kittens learn to be feral either from their mothers or through bad experiences. They are more easily
socialized when under six months of age. Socializing is done by keeping them confined in a small room
(ie. bathroom) and handling them for 3 or more hours each day. There are three primary methods for
socialization, used individually or in combination. The first method is to simply hold and pet the cat, so
it learns that such activities are not uncomfortable. The second is to use food bribes. The final method is
to distract the cat with toys while handling them. The cat may then be gradually introduced to larger
spaces. It is not recommended to let the cat back outside because that may cause it to revert to its feral
state. The process of socialization often takes three weeks to three months for a kitten.

Animal shelters either foster feral kittens to be socialized or kill them outright. The feral adults are
usually killed or euthanized, due to the large time commitment, but some shelters and vets will spay or
neuter and vaccinate a feral cat and then return it to the wild.




                               Properly socialized dogs can interact with unfamiliar dogs of any size
and shape and understand how to communicate.

Dogs

In domesticated dogs, the process of socialization begins even before the puppy's eyes open.
Socialization refers to both its ability to interact acceptably with humans and its understanding of how to
communicate successfully with other dogs. If the mother is fearful of humans or of her environment, she
can pass along this fear to her puppies. For most dogs, however, a mother who interacts well with
humans is the best teacher that the puppies can have. In addition, puppies learn how to interact with
other dogs by their interaction with their mother and with other adult dogs in the house.

A mother's attitude and tolerance of her puppies will change as they grow older and become more active.
For this reason most experts today recommend leaving puppies with their mother until at least 8 to 10
weeks of age. This gives them a chance to experience a variety of interactions with their mother, and to
observe her behavior in a range of situations.

It is critical that human interaction takes place frequently and calmly from the time the puppies are born,
from simple, gentle handling to the mere presence of humans in the vicinity of the puppies, performing
everyday tasks and activities. As the puppies grow older, socialization occurs more readily the more
frequently they are exposed to other dogs, other people, and other situations.

Dogs who are well socialized from birth with both dogs and people are much less likely to be
aggressive, to suffer from fear-biting, or to interact undesirably with either species. They are more likely
to be calm and interested in even the most unusual situations.

Trophallaxis is the regurgitation of food by one animal for another. It is most highly developed in social
insects such as the ants, in which individual colony members store food in their crops and regularly
exchange it with other colony members and larvae to form a sort of "communal stomach" for the hive. It
is also used by some vertebrates, such as birds feeding their young.

Trophallaxis is also performed by members of the dog family. In the wild, a hunting dog will regurgitate
food gorged while far from its lair in order to feed its puppies. These puppies lick the face of the adult in
order to trigger trophallaxis. Domestic dogs are tame because of arrested development of their wild
tendencies and will treat certain humans, in particular their owner, as lifelong 'parents'. Therefore, when
a dog licks your face, it's manifesting a vestigial feeding instinct. Most human dog owners, however,
have not mastered the technique of performing trophallaxis when greeted by their pet, and nor do most
dog owners lick the faces of their pets in order to obtain food (although in extreme circumstances this
might be a useful survival tactic).

Trophallaxis serves as a means of communication, at least in bees.

A wardog is a dog trained for war. The dog has been used in wars since ancient times. They can be
trained to track with their acute sense of smell, to bring down infantry and even horses by biting into the
hamstrings of their targets.

The history of wardogs is long and detailed, stretching up to conflicts as recent as Vietnam. In ancient
times, this disrupted battlelines and frightened soldiers. Wardogs were used by England against the Celts
in Ireland and by many European forces, such as Spanish Conquistadors, in the New World.

A detection dog is a dog that is trained to and works at using his senses (almost always the sense of
smell) to detect unusual substances such as explosives or narcotics. Hunting dogs that search for game
and search dogs that search for missing humans are generally not considered detection dogs. There is
some overlap in cases like cadaver dogs that detect human remains.

Detection dogs have been trained to search for many substances including the following:

    ●   Agricultural produce
    ●   Crime Evidence
    ●   Drugs
    ●   Explosives
    ●   Human remains
    ●   Termites

A police dog is a dog that is trained specifically to assist police and similar law-enforcement personnel
with their work. They are also known in the United States as police K9s (a play on words; a homophone
for canine).

The term is also sometimes used in the common parlance of several countries to refer to any German
Shepherd Dog because of the long history of the use of the German Shepherd by the police and military;
in some nations German Shepherds are the only dogs used by those forces. In the post-industrial era
German Shepherds have often been depicted as police dogs in television, movies and police dog
memorials. This breed is often still used, as are Rottweilers and a few other breeds.
Chasing and holding
Most often, police dog refers to a dog who has been trained to guard their handler and to find, chase,
intimidate, and hold suspects who are attempting to elude the police. Modern police dogs are not vicious
animals; most are trained to enjoy their work, with chasing and grabbing introduced to them as tricks or
games that can be played only when the handler (a police officer) gives the appropriate command. The
dog's goal is not to bite; it is to grab and hold on at all costs until the handler gives the release command.
This means that the dog grabs hard, and a fleeing suspect can be bitten when attempting to avoid or fight
off a dog and the dog is attempting with full speed and energy to grab the suspect. Most handlers, if
possible, give the suspect a verbal warning that the dog will be set loose if they do not immediately halt,
and this is often sufficient deterrent that the dog is not needed.

Some police K9 units prefer to start with a pursue and bark tactic, where the dog barks to alert the
handler to his whereabouts and to intimidate the suspect and keep him from running until the police
arrive. In this case, the dog usually grabs and holds only when the suspect does not hold still after the
dog's very verbal warning. Others feel that the bark first, bite later strategy is not effective and prefer to
always use the chase and hold strategy.

Most of these dogs live in their handlers' homes and interact with their family and friends on a regular
basis to ensure that they remain social and pleasant animals. This does not mean that it is acceptable to
approach a police dog to pet it or play with it while it is on duty.

A police dog and handler train and work as a team, because they must trust each other and understand
each other completely when working in stressful, even dangerous, and often rapidly changing situations.
Police K9 teams have been accused of using excessive force in some cases, so it is critical that the
human be able to manage a difficult situation wisely, to use his trained dog only as appropriate, and to
be able to control the dog completely so that the dog can be called off instantly when the situation
warrants.

In recognition of the valuable role these animals play in police duties and the dangers they face, there
have been a number of measures to ensure their protection. These include outfitting dogs with
bulletproof vests to protect them from guns and some areas have passed laws that make attacking a
police dog a felony.

In the United States, police dogs (which are almost always German Shepherds) are usually trained in
Germany and so usually understand commands in German. This might also be an asset in that the
criminal being chased doesn't know what the dog is going to do (German isn't frequently understood in
the U.S.).

Other law-enforcement uses
Law enforcement also uses dogs for tracking suspects or finding missing persons, or for detecting drugs
or explosives. Bloodhounds are often used for the former, although most breeds have an outstanding
sense of smell and can be trained to follow scent trails or to detect certain kinds of odors.

Some dogs, called cadaver dogs, are trained in detecting the odor of decomposing bodies. Dogs' noses
are so sensitive that they are even capable of detecting bodies that are under running water.

For some sniffer dogs in environments where it is perceived that a criminal may attempt to kill the dog
to prevent detection, a bodyguard dog is assigned with the sniffer to intimidate and, if necessary, attack
anyone who would attack the sniffer.

Bulldog is a collective name for various breeds of dog.


Baiting sports
The bloodsport of baiting animals has occurred since antiquity, most famously in the Roman Colosseum;
however, in later centuries, it is most associated with the English, who pursued it with utmost
earnestness, which was barely known elsewhere in the world. For over six hundred years the pastime
flourished, reaching the peak of its popularity during the sixteenth century. The various animal types
involved in the bait resulted in the breed specialization and basic anatomical forms of fighting dogs,
which we still see today.

Old English Bulldog
The first historical traces of bull-baiting occur in the time of the regency of King John. Enraged steers,
specially bred for their aggressive nature, were used to test the keenness of dogs. A collar around the
bull's neck was fastened to a thick rope about three to five metres long, attached to a hook, then fastened
to an embedded stake that turned, allowing the bull to watch its antagonizer.

The dog's goal in the attack was to pin and mercilessly hold onto the bull's nose, which is its most
sensitive spot. If the dog gripped tightly, the bull became virtually helpless. To avoid this attack,
experienced fighting bulls lowered their heads as much as possible in the direction of the attacking dog,
protecting their noses and meeting the attacker with only their horns, tossing the dog into the air. The
dog reciprocated by staying low to the ground as it crept towards the bull. These tactics resulted in a
specialized breed in the form of the now-extinct original Old English Bulldog. This breed was extremely
compact, broad, and muscular. A particular characteristic of the breed was the lower jaw that projected
considerably in front of the upper jaw, which made possible the strong, vice-like grip. The nose was
deeply set, which allowed the dog to get enough air as it gripped the bull. The contemporary recreation
of the breed is called the Olde Englishe Bulldogge.


English Bulldog
The English Bulldog of today is a far cry from its ancestor, which made its name by excelling in
arranged combat. This breed of bulldog may be a fine animal to own for its sweet disposition, but it has
maintained nothing of the tenacity, speed, and agility that were the definitive characteristics of the Old
English Bulldog.

Rat-baiting is a bloodsport involving the baiting of rats in a pit.


History
In 1835, the Parliament of the United Kingdom implemented an Act called the Humane Act, which
prohibited the baiting of some animals such as the bull, bear and other large animals. However, rat
baiting was not enforced and ratting competitions came to the forefront as a gambling sport.

Atmosphere
Wentworth Day a follower of the sport of rat baiting, described his experience and atmosphere at one of
the last old rat pits in London during those times.

       "This was a rather dirty, small place, in the middle of the Cambridge Circus, London. You went
       down a rotten wooden stair and entered a large, underground cellar, which was created by
       combining the cellars of two houses. The cellar was full of smoke, stench of rats, dogs and dirty
       human beings as well. The stale smell of flat beer was almost overpowering. Gas lights
       illuminated the centre of the cellar, a ring enclosed by wood barriers, similar to a small Roman
       circus arena and wooden bleachers, arranged one over the other, rose stepwise above it nearly
       to the ceiling. This was the pit for dog fights, cock fights and rat killing. A hundred rats were put
       in it, large wagers went back and forth on whose dog could kill the most rats within a minute.
       The dogs worked in exemplary fashion, a grip, a toss and it was all over for the rat. With
       especially skilful dogs, two dead rats flew through the air at the same time..."

Rules




                                     Rat Baiting Competition

The officials included a referee and timekeeper. The pit was either covered above with wire mesh or
additional security devices were installed on the walls to prevent the rats from escaping.

There was a weight handicap for each dog. The competing dog had to kill as many rats as the number of
pounds the dog weighed, within a specific preset time. The prescribed number of rats was released and
the dog was put in the ring. The clock started the moment the dog touched the ground. When the dog
seized the last rat, his owner grabbed it and the clock stopped.

Rats that were thought still to be alive were laid out on the table in a circle before the referee. The
referee then struck the animals three times on the tail with a stick. If a rat managed to crawl out of the
circle, it was considered to be alive. The dog had to go back in the ring with these rats and kill them. The
new time was added to the original time.

A combination of the quickest time, the number of rats and the dog's weight decided the victory. A rate
of five seconds per rat killed was considered quite satisfactory; fifteen rats in a minute was an excellent
result.

Consider catching, lifting, biting-to-death and dropping a rat within four seconds and seizing the next
one while the first is falling to the ground. In addition, the cornered rats will attack and can deliver a
very painful bite. It was not uncommon to see a ratter left with only one eye in its retirement.

Rat-catcher
Before the contest could begin there was a requirement for the capture of potentially thousands of rats.
The rat-catcher, would be called upon to fulfill this requirement. A famous rat-catcher from Victorian
England was Jack Black.

Technique
Rat killing is a very specialized art. For this purpose you needed not only a brave dog, which did not shy
away from rat bites, but one of especially great speed. The true rat killer bites once, drops the rat, bites
again, drops again and so on.

Some dogs shake the caught rat to prevent it from biting. A dog that wastes its time with shaking has
absolutely no chance of winning a rat killing contest, which is decided chiefly on time. The successful
rat killer seizes the rat between head and shoulder, which prevents the rat from biting and kills the rat
immediately with a sharp bite.

Breeds
The ratting dogs were typically Terrier breeds, which included, but not limited too, the Bull and Terrier,
Bull Terrier, Fox Terrier, Jack Russell Terrier, Rat Terrier, Manchester Terrier and Staffordshire Bull
Terrier. The degree of care used in breeding these ratters is clear in their pedigree with good breeding
leading to increased business opportunities. Successful breeders were highly regarded and famous in
those times.

Billy




                                     Billy, the celebrated Rat Killing Dog, London, Circa 1823

A celebrated Bull and Terrier named "Billy" weighing approximately 26 pounds, had a proud fighting
history and the pedigree reflects the build-up over a period of years. The dog was owned by Charles
Dew and was bred by the famous breeder James Yardington. On the paternal side is "Old Billy" from the
kennel of John Tattersal from Woollen under Edge, Gloucestershire and was descended from the best
line of all Old English Bulldogs. On the maternal side, is "Yardington's Sal" descended from the Curley
line. The pedigree of all these dogs can be traced back more than forty years and there are numerous old
accounts about them.

The October 1822, edition of The Sporting Magazine provided descriptions of two rat pit matches with
Billy, quoted as follows:

       "Thursday night, Oct. 24, at a quarter before eight o'clock, the lovers of rat-killing enjoyed a
       feast of delight in a prodigious raticide at the Cockpit, Westminster. The place was crowded. The
       famous dog Billy, of rat-killing notoriety, 26 lbs. weight, was wagered, for twenty sovereigns, to
       kill one hundred rats in twelve minutes. The rats were turned out loose at once in a 12-feet
       square, and the floor whitened, so that the rats might be visible to all. The set-to began, and Billy
       exerted himself to the utmost. At four minutes and three quarters, as the hero's head was covered
       with gore, he was removed from the pit, and his chaps being washed, he lapped some water to
       cool his throat. Again he entered the arena, and in vain did the unfortunate victims labour to
       obtain security by climbing against the sides of the pit, or by crouching beneath the hero. By twos
       and threes they were caught, and soon their mangled corpses proved the valour of the victor.
       Some of the flying enemy, more valiant than the rest, endeavoured by seizing this Quinhus
       Flestrum of heroic dogs by the ears, to procure a respite, or to sell their life as dearly as
       possible; but his grand paw soon swept off the buzzers, and consigned them to their fate. At seven
       minutes and a quarter, or according to another watch, for there were two umpires and two
       watches, at seven minutes and seventeen seconds, the victor relinquished the glorious pursuit, for
       all his foes lay slaughtered on the ensanguined plain. Billy was then caressed and fondled by
       many; the dog is estimated by amateurs as a most dextrous animal; he is, unfortunately, what the
       French Monsieurs call borg-ne, that is, blind of an eye.-This precious organ was lost to him some
       time since by the intrepidity of an inimical rat, which as he had not seized it in a proper place,
       turned round on its murderer, and reprived him by one bite of the privilege of seeing with two
       eyes in future. The dog BILLY, of rat-killing notoriety, on the evening of the 13th instant, again
       exhibited his surprising dexterity; he was wagered to kill one hundred rats within twelve minutes;
       but six minutes and twenty five seconds only elapsed, when every rat lay stretched on the gory
       plain, without the least symptom of life appearing.' Billy was decorated with a silver collar, and a
       number of ribband bows, and was led off amidst the applauses of the persons assembled."

Billy's best competition results are as follows:

   Date    Rats Killed       Time          Time per Rat
1820-??-??          20 1 minute, 11 seconds 4.6 seconds
1822-09-03        100 8 minutes, 45 seconds 5.2 seconds
1822-10-24        100 7 minutes, 17 seconds 4.4 seconds
1822-11-13        100 6 minutes, 25 seconds 3.4 seconds
1823-04-22        100 5 minutes, 30 seconds 3.3 seconds * Record
1823-08-05        120 8 minutes, 20 seconds 4.1 seconds
Billy's career was crowned on April 22, 1823, when a world record was set with a hundred rats killed in
five-and-a-half minutes. This record stood until 1862 when it was claimed by another ratter named
"Jacko". Billy continued in the rat pit until old age reportedly with only one eye and two teeth remaining.

Jacko

According to the Sporting Chronicle Annual, the world record in rat killing is held by a black and tan
Bull Terrier named "Jacko" weighing about thirteen pounds and owned by Jemmy Shaw. Jacko had the
following contest results:

   Date    Rats Killed          Time          Time per Rat
1861-08-08          25    1 minute, 28 seconds 3.5 seconds
1862-07-29          60 2 minutes, 42 seconds 2.7 seconds * Record
1862-05-01        100 5 minutes, 28 seconds 3.3 seconds * Record
1862-06-10        200 14 minutes, 37 seconds 4.4 seconds
1862-05-01       1000 in less than 100 minutes 6.0 seconds

Jacko set two world records, the first on July 29, 1862, with a killing time of 2.7 seconds per rat and the
second on May 1, 1862, with his fight against one hundred rats, where Jacko worked two seconds faster
than the previous world record holder "Billy". The feat of killing 1,000 rats took place over a ten-week
period, with one hundred rats being killed each week ending on May 1, 1862.

Decline
The last public competition took place in Leicester in 1912. The owner was prosecuted, fined and had to
give a promise to the court that he would never again promote such entertainment. Toward the latter half
of Queen Victoria's reign, a more humane attitude to the canine race gradually emerged, with her
Majesty's love of animals setting the example. Baiting sports diminished in popularity and the exhibition
of dogs slowly replaced the attractions of the dog pit.

                                                                                  Back | Home | Up | Next




                                     The Bichon Frisé, the most recognised Bichon group member

Bichon is the name for a group of related toy dogs. They vary in size and type, but all have tails curled
over their back, long hair that doesn't readily shed, short snouts, drop ears, and expressive faces with
large, dark eyes. They were all bred to be amiable companion dogs and have a friendly, alert
temperament.

The Bichon Frisé is also simply called Bichon in North America.


History
The Bichons are descended from the ancient ancestors of the Poodle, the Barbet, a water spaniel. From
this, the Barbichon, a small curly coated water spaniel and another name for this family, was created.
The Bichons are a Mediterranean breed, generally named for the region from where they originated. The
original breeds were the Bichon Tenerife, from the Canary Islands; the Bichon Maltais, or Maltese; and
the Bichon Bolognese, or simply Bolognese. There is argument on whether the Tenerife is the original
stock for all Bichons, or whether the Maltese (which seems to be an old type found on the islands before
even the Barbet was known) is the progenitor of the Bichons, through its breeding with the Barbets.
Ultimately, most of the modern Bichon breeds have developed by introducing a variety of dogs to the
Barbichon type, creating a family with recognisable characteristics in both temperament and type but no
single distinct progenitor.

The Bichons were the court dogs of medieval Europe, especially finding favour in France, Italy and
Spain. The French word bichonner, which means to pamper or doll up, derives from the be-ribboned and
lavish lifestyles of the Bichon of Henry III of France, who was carried in a little basket wherever the
King went.
Types
The Maltese is undoubtedly ancient, and dogs of its type, with long hair and dropped ears, were
described in Roman times on the island of Malta. In earlier imagery of the breed, it is shown with wavy
fur, more typical to the Bichons, and its relatively reciently that a totally smooth coated Maltese was the
final type. It has also steadily retained its popularity throughout the centuries, unlike any other Bichon,
most of which became very rare at least once in their history as fashions and governments changed.

The Bolognese was already being developed as a toy dog as early as the 11th century in Bologna, Italy.
A favorite gift between courts, the little dog traveled to places like Spain, Belgium, France, Russia (as a
gift to Catherine the Great!) and Austria.




                                             Bichon Frisé at play.

The modern Bichon Frisé was created by combining the now extinct Tenerife with the poodles and
barbets of the day to produce a tightly curled, rather that wavy, coated Bichon, hence the full name,
Bichon a poil Frisé. The Tenerife also traveled to Reunion Island to develop the now extinct Coton de
Reunion, which then traveled to nearby Madagascar and became the Coton de Tulear. The Bichon
Havanais, or Havanese, seems to have been descended from a variety of small, Bichon-type dogs that
traveled with Spanish and Italian sailors to Cuba. They were possibly bred with a now extinct poodle
type from South America to produce a wavy coat which was also silky, but it may be that they simply
expressed a wavy coat trait through a random chance of genetics.

The Löwchen is an enigma. Though classically considered a Mediterranian Bichon dog, research into
the origins of the dog show it may not have passed through the Mediterranian at all to travel to its
current originating countries of Germany and the Netherlands. It is possible that the breed had some
Bichon blood, or that it's simply a terrier type from Tibet with no connections at all to the Bichons. It
does have a typical friendly Bichon temperament, though!

Behind the Iron Curtain, specifically Russian Bichons were developed. After the retreat of Napoleon's
army, left behind Bichons, primarily the Bolognese and Bichon Frisé, were bred into a unique breed
called the Franzuskaya Bolonka. After World War II, the French Bolonka was then bred with poodles
and silky terriers such as the Yorkshire Terrier to produce a small dog with a multi-coloured, long, wavy
coat, called the Tsvetnaya Bolonka, or Multicoloured Bichon. Until recently, these breeds were unknown
outside of Germany and Russia.

The Modern Bichons
It may be hard to believe now, but almost all Bichons, even the very popular Frisé, went through a
period in the 1800's where they were hardly fancied at all. Breeds like the Havanese and Bolognese are
still recovering from this, and even more common Bichons like the Löwchen and Bichon Frisé were
almost extinct at the beginning of the 20th century. Court dogs were not very well regarded in Europe at
the turn of the last century, and many Bichon types are now extinct due to this neglect.

But Bichons are seeing a second renaissance with popularity they haven't seen the likes of since the last
Renaissance. The Bichon family of dogs were all selected for the same reason, to be small, charming
companion dogs with even temperments and playful attitudes.

Over a thousand years of dedicated breeding to making a friendly, playful and affectionate dog for court
is finding new use for the needs of a house pet. More and more, dog owners are interested in companion
type dogs that have good all around temperaments, and there is an increased desire for small dogs which
won't be yappy, stand-offish, nervous or aggressive, all traits the Bichons should not have if properly
bred.

                                 A Black and Tan Coonhound with a typical soulful expression

A Coonhound is a type of scent hound and a member of the hound group.

Coonhounds are an American style of hunting dog that was developed for the unique quarry and
working conditions found in the United States.

In the colonial period, foxhounds were imported for the popular sport of foxhunting. Various breeds of
foxhounds and other hunting hounds were brought in from England, Ireland, and France, making up the
initial composition of the dogs that were later to be called Virginia Hounds.

Foxhounds were found to be inadequate for hunting animals that didn't "go to ground", but instead took
to the treetops to escape, such as raccoons, oppossums, bobcats and even larger prey like cougars and
bears. They were often confused or unable to hold the scent when this occurred, and would mill about.

Treeing dogs were developed, chosen for a keen sense of smell, the ability to track, chase and corner any
manner of animal independent of human commands, and, most importantly, to follow an animal both on
the ground and when they take to the trees. A good coonhound will bark and keep their prey treed until
the hunters arrive. Bloodhounds specifically were added to many coonhound lines to enhance their
ability to track. Some dogs have webbed toes to deal with the rivers and swamps so common in their
hunting grounds.

Coonhounds can be hunted individually, or as a pack. Generally, hunters don't chase their quarry along
with the hounds, unlike organized foxhunting, but wait and listen to the distinctive baying to determine
if a coon or other animal has been treed. Besides raccoons, coonhounds are excellent at handing all
manner of prey if trained properly.

Besides hunting, Coonhounds are wonderful family dogs that are known to be good with children. They
also make good watchdogs with an impressive loud bark.

There are several individual breeds of Coonhound:

    ●   American English Coonhound
    ●   Black and Tan Coonhound
    ●   Bluetick Coonhound
    ●   English Coonhound
    ●   Plott Hound
    ●   Redbone Coonhound
    ●   Treeing Walker Coonhound

Cur refers to a dog, usually of mixed ancestry. In common usage, the term is often derogatory.
However, Curs are also a category of hunting dog breeds developed in the United States, usually not
recognized as show dogs but developed solely for their hunting ability. As a result, most of the cur
breeds are types rather than breeds—that is, one of these dogs can be recognized as a certain type of Cur
but the appearance standard is extremely flexible, enough so that a complete breed appearance standard
is difficult to create. However, several kennel clubs register various cur breeds based on their ancestry
(bloodlines), and several lines are recognized within each breed. The United Kennel Club has an active
registration program and competition hunting program for these dogs.

Examples of curs include:

    ●   Black Mouth Cur
    ●   Leopard Cur
    ●   Mountain Cur
    ●   Stephens Cur
    ●   Treeing Cur

                                            Farm Collie
                                                                                 Back | Home | Up | Next


The old farm collie was not a dog breed in the modern sense of having an organized breed club and
registry. It was a North American landrace descended primarily from the old working collie landrace of
Great Britain. Photo evidence from the 1800s and early 1900s indicates that the North American old
farm collie was quite variable in type, probably showing the whole phenotypic range from Roman cattle
dog type to herding spitz type. Some individuals may have shown the influence of other types as well,
such as setter, retriever, or greyhound. Individual family lines may have been quite uniform in type, and
perhaps in many geographical areas certain types became fixed due to popularity of certain family lines,
or simply due to the population being somewhat isolated by distance or other geographical barriers.

The decline of the old farm collie landrace apparently began with the rise of formal kennel club
registries and the subsequent creation of the modern idea of pure breeds. By the early 1900s, some
people were worried about the future of the old farm collie. Other breeds such as the trial-bred Border
Collie and show-bred Rough Collie were popular and seemed to be replacing the old farm collie. In
addition, farmers may have used individuals from these and other registered breeds to upgrade existing
old farm collie stock, as was commonly practiced in livestock breeding.

At least two pure breeds were developed from the old North American farm collie landrace during the
early decades of the 20th century: the English Shepherd and the Australian Shepherd. After World War
II, agriculture in North America began changing rapidly. The old farm collie as the common stock dog
across North America seems to have disappeared between the 1940s and 1960s.

                         An English Foxhound lying in the grass

A foxhound is a large hunting hound. Foxhounds hunt in packs and, like all scent hounds, have a strong
sense of smell. They are used in hunts for foxes, hence the name. When out hunting they are followed
usually on horseback and will travel several miles to catch their target. These dogs have strong natural
instincts to hunt and are energetic and active.

There are two breeds of foxhound, each often called simply Foxhound in their native countries:

    ●   American Foxhound
    ●   English Foxhound

                          saluki x greyhound longdog

A longdog is a crossbreed between two sighthound breeds.

Differing slightly from the Lurcher, the longdog is a sighthound to sighthound crossbreed. Common
longdog crosses are saluki cross greyhound and scottish deerhound cross greyhound. These dogs are
generally bred for the same purposes as the Lurcher.

The Lurcher is not a dog breed, but rather a type of dog native to the British Isles. It is a hearty
crossbred sighthound which is generally a cross between a sighthound and another sort of dog - usually a
Pastoral breed or Terrier. Collie crosses have always been very popular. Lurchers can be crossed several
times. There is no set type, so they can be as small as a Whippet or as large as an Scottish Deerhound;
but most are chosen for a size that is around the size of a Greyhound, and a distinct sighthound form is
preferred.

Generally, the aim of the cross was to produce a sighthound with brains, a canny animal suitable for the
original purpose of the Lurcher, poaching. Developed in the middle ages in Great Britain, the Lurcher
was created because only nobility were allowed to have purebred sighthounds like Irish Wolfhounds,
Scottish Deerhounds, Greyhounds, and Whippets whereas crosses, or curs, had no such perceived value.
Similarly, nobility owned most land and commoners were not allowed to hunt game on crown land or
other noble estates. It was important that the lurcher did not resemble too closely a sighthound, as the
penalties for owning (and if you owned one then by default you were a poacher) a sighthound were high.
The original lurchers therefore were generally heavier coated dogs who could herd sheep as well as
bring home a rabbit or hare for the pot. Roma, more commonly known as Romany Gypsies, were
instrumental in developing the Lurcher type, and the word Lurcher is believed to derive from a Romani
word 'Lur' meaning thief.

The Lurcher has as many varied uses as types can be crossbred, but generally they are used as a hunting
dog which can chase and kill their prey. Most Lurchers today are used for general pest control, ie rabbits
with or without the use of ferrets or the lamp, foxs, they have also been successfully used on Deer and
hare in the past. The only truly sport use of the lurcher (ie has no pest control value) is hare coursing
however most hare coursing dogs are pure greyhound. The Lurcher is best used in open ground although
different crosses suit different terrains. Lure coursing and dog racing is also popular in areas with little
available hunting or for people who dislike hunting. The modern Lurcher is growing from its old image
of disrepute to heights of popularity as an exceptional family dog, and many groups have been founded
to rehome Lurchers in pet households.

A pastoral breed is any dog breed bred to work livestock.

Dogs bred to work livestock are pastoral breeds. There is some overlap into Herding Breeds but a
pastoral breed may not be a herder. Pastoral covers dogs who traditionally were used to drive animals to
market, such as the Bearded Collie and the Old English Sheepdog. These dogs can do some herding too,
and working bearded collies today are still good herders, however they are not the swift speedy, handler
dependant animal like the Border Collie, or the Belgian Shepherds, they work much more independantly
of their handlers.

In some countries pastoral breeds were used to live out with the flocks and guard them from predators
like the wolf. The Old English Sheepdog used to perform this function in the UK.

These consist of various types:

    ●   Herding dogs, such as the swift, handler-dependant dogs such as the Border Collie or the Belgian
        Shepherd
    ●   Drovers, who traditionally were used to drive animals to market, such as the Bearded Collie and
        the Old English Sheepdog
    ●   Livestock guardian dogs, who often live with the flocks and guard them from predators like the
        wolf. The Old English Sheepdog used to perform this function in the UK.

A Poodle hybrid is a cross (hybrid) between a Poodle and some other breed of dog. Poodle hybrids
have become very popular as pets. They play a big role in the current designer dog trend. The Poodle's
nonshedding coat is the usual impetus behind such experimentation, where potential pet owners are
looking for a nonshedding version of a breed for health or hygenic reasons. Some of these crosses have
been developed deliberately, while others have happened accidentally.

A breed cross is not a recognized breed, although some breeders promote them as such. They do not
have predictable size, appearance, temperament, or health like purebred dogs. Some Poodle crosses do
shed, and they can cause allergic reactions. The generation of hybridization might make a difference,
too. It is possible that first-generation hybrids are less likely to carry the genetic weaknesses of either
breed, but second-generation hybrids might begin to suffer from inbreeding problems as do some
purebred dogs.

Names for hybrids
None of the following hybrids have been recognized as breeds, but many people who sell such dogs give
them invented names to enhance their marketability. The crosses are usually with the appropriately sized
Poodle for the size of the second breed; for example, Cockapoos are usually Miniature Poodle mixes.

Name                      Mixed with
Bichon-Poo, Bicha-Poo Bichon Frise
Cavadoodle, Cavoodle Cavalier King Charles Spaniel
Cockapoo, Spoodle        Cocker Spaniel
Goldendoodle             Golden Retriever
Labradoodle              Labrador Retriever
Lhasa-Poo                Lhasa Apso
Maltipoo                 Maltese
Pekeapoo                 Pekingese
Pomapoo                  Pomeranian
Schnoodle                Miniature or Standard Schnauzer
La Schnoodle             Labrador with Schnoodle
Scottiepoo               Scottish Terrier
Shepardoodles            German Shepherd Dog
Shih-poo                 Shih Tzu
Westiepoo                West Highland White Terrier
Yorkiepoo                Yorkshire Terrier

In fact, any crossbreed with a poodle is usually given a "...poo" or "oodle..." based name, although most
of these are fanciful concoctions by individual owners, such as pooter or perrier for a poodle-terrier
mix, and are not part of the mainstream.

The Redbone Hound, also known as the Redbone Coonhound, is a treeing and trailing dog used for

In early America, hunters had a red hound that was used for treeing and hunting game which they called
Redbone. The ancestors of the Redbone Hound are thought to have been Foxhounds which were later
crossed with the Blood Hound by a then well known Fox hunter and breeder named George F.L.
Birdsong in Georgia,USA in the 1840s. Birdsong bought the pack from Dr. Thomas Henry and began
selective breeding to retain the original red color and abilities that produced the modern day Redbone
Hound.

                                Miniature Schnauzer

A Schnauzer is a German type of dog. The name comes from the German word for moustache because
of the dogs' distinctively furry noses. Kennel clubs generally subdivide these dogs into three breeds by
size:

    ●   Miniature Schnauzer
    ●   Standard Schnauzer
    ●   Giant Schnauzer

Though derived from a common ancestor and sharing certain physical attributes and personality traits—
notably intelligence, a friendly personality, and a mischievous sense of humor—the three breeds are
separate types of dogs.

The Black Russian Terrier is also sometimes known as the Russian Bear Schnauzer.

                                The standard poodle is a type of water dog

Water dogs are a type of gun dog and count among their number some of the oldest dog breeds. As the
name implies, water dogs were bred to flush and retrieve game from water. Strong swimming desire is
distinctive within the various breeds.

The ancestors of modern water dogs originated in the Mediterranean and other parts of Europe over
2000 years ago.

Water dogs have curly, sometimes corded coats which are somewhat waterproof. Most water dog breeds
are highly intelligent and easy to train with a strong desire to be in company with people.

The following breeds are considered water dogs (listed in alphabetical order):

    ●   American Water Spaniel
    ●   Barbet
    ●   Chesapeake Bay Retriever
    ●   Curly Coated Retriever
    ●   Epagneul Pont-Audemer
    ●   Irish Water Spaniel

An attack dog is a dog trained to attack, and possibly kill, living creatures. This may be done for a
number of reasons:

    ●   A dog may be trained to attack other dogs to participate in dog fighting.
    ●   A guard dog may be trained to attack humans to increase their effectiveness. The German
        Shepherd Dog is an example of a breed often used as a guard dog, as they are intelligent and
        easily trained. For these reasons they are also the dog most commonly used by police forces.
    ●   A hunting dog or war dog may be trained as an attack dog to incapacitate prey or enemies
        without assistance from humans. Some examples of hunting dogs are the Irish Wolfhound and
        Russian Wolfhound (Borzoi). However, many other breeds of dog have been trained for hunting.

In most modern nations, the practice of training attack dogs for any purpose has been made illegal, due
in part to the danger of an escaped attack dog killing innocent people.

Freighting refers to the hauling of cargo, historically, using a dog team to mush goods cross-country.
During the North American gold rushes, such as the Klondike Gold Rush, dogs were valuable draft
animals, going where horses could not and withstanding harsher weather.

Dog teams were commonly used for transportation, and in Canada and Alaska were used to deliver the
mail during the winter. Large teams of sturdy dogs were required to haul the heavy loads. With the
advent of air mail in the 1920s, freighting by dog team became outmoded, and gradually the mail runs
became fewer until the last regular mail freighting route in Canada was shut down in the 1960s.

Shipping point destination is where the supplier pays for the transport cost.

The use of dogs in search and rescue (SAR) is a valuable component in responding to law enforcement
requests for missing persons. Dedicated handlers and hard working, well-trained dogs are required in
efforts to be an effective portion of the SAR team.

There are many types of search and rescue dogs, including disaster dogs, wilderness airscent dogs,
wilderness or urban tracking and trailing dogs, and human remains detection or cadaver dogs.

Disaster dogs detect live human scent during the aftermath of terrorist attacks, earthquakes, hurricanes
and other natural and man-made disasters. In the USA, many disaster dogs are trained by their handlers
to participate in the Federal Emergency Management Agency K9 program.




                                                 Tracking dogs follow ground scent

Wilderness airscent dogs detect live human scent that is borne on wind currents to help locate their
victims. They typically work off-lead and cover large areas of terrain in search of human scent. The dogs
alert their handler once they have located a victim and lead the handler back to the victim's location.

Wilderness or urban tracking/trailing dogs follow the trail where a specific person has walked. They
usually work on-lead, keeping their noses low to the ground. These dogs require the use of a scent article
from the person for which they are searching.
Human Remains Detection (HRD) or cadaver dogs are used to locate the remains of deceased victims.
These dogs typically work off-lead and may be used to search for entire bodies or individual pieces of a
body, including blood, bones, teeth, hair, and tissue. They work similarly to airscent dogs in that they
use the air currents to locate scent. The dog will alert the handler once it has located human remains.

Therapy Dog refers to a dog trained to provide affection and comfort to people in hospitals, retirement
homes, nursing homes, mental institutions, schools, and stressful situations such as disaster areas.

The concept of a therapy dog is often attributed to Elaine Smith, an American who worked as a
registered nurse for a time in England. Smith noticed how well patients responded to visits by a certain
chaplain and his canine companion, a Golden Retriever. Upon returning to the United States in 1976,
Smith started a program for training dogs to visit institutions. Over the years other health care
professionals have noticed the therapeutic effect of animal companionship, such as relieving stress,
lowering blood pressure, and raising spirits, and the demand for therapy dogs continues to grow. In
recent years, therapy dogs have been enlisted to help children overcome speech and emotional disorders.
The concept has widened to include other species, specifically therapy cats, therapy rabbits, and therapy
birds.

Therapy dogs come in all sizes and breeds. The most important aspect of a therapy dog is temperament.
A good therapy dog must be friendly, patient, confident, at ease in all situations, and gentle. Therapy
dogs must enjoy human contact and be content to be petted and handled, sometimes clumsily.

A therapy dog's primary job is to allow unfamiliar people to make physical contact with him and to
enjoy that contact. Children in particular enjoy hugging animals; adults usually enjoy simply petting the
dog. The dog might need to be lifted onto, or climb onto, an invalid's lap or bed and sit or lie
comfortably there. Many dogs add to the visiting experience by performing small tricks for their
audiences or by playing carefully structured games.

It is important to note that therapy dogs are not service dogs. Service dogs directly assist humans, and
have a legal right to accompany their owners. Therapy dogs do not provide direct assistance, do not have
legal rights to travel everywhere, and must be invited by institutions. Most institutions have rigorous
requirements for therapy dogs.

Many organizations provide testing and accreditation for therapy dogs. Most require that a dog pass the
equivalent of the AKC's Canine Good Citizen test, and then add further requirements specific to the
environments in which the dogs will be working. Typical tests might ensure that a dog can handle
sudden loud or strange noises, can walk on assorted unfamiliar surfaces comfortably, are not frightened
by people with canes, wheelchairs, or unusual styles of walking or moving, get along well with children
and with the elderly, and so on.

                                                                                          Back | Home | Up


Treeing is a method of hunting where dogs are used to force animals that naturally climb up into trees,
where they can be shot by hunters. Particularly used with coonhunting, treeing dogs are selected for the
instinct to not cease barking at an animal after it has escaped into a tree. The linguistic idiom, "Barking
up the wrong tree" comes from this practice.

This method of hunting is also used for cougar and black bear. The dogs are trained to harass but not
directly attack the quarry, however it is not unheard of for the quarry to kill some of the dogs or for the
dogs to kill the quarry. Usually the quarry will climb a tree to escape the dogs after a period of chase and
harassment. Traditionally the dogs were followed on foot by hunters listening to their barks, however
some hunters now use radio direction finding equipment to follow the pack.

Treeing is also sometimes performed without the intention of killing the quarry for scientific purposes
(such as radio-tagging) or recreational purposes. It is especially useful for cougars, which are
notoriously stealthy and difficult to capture without the aid of dogs.

Military animals are creatures that have been employed by humankind for use in warfare. They are a
specific application of working animals. Generally these animals are domesticated creatures, such as the
dog or horse; more exotic animals such as the elephant, pig, and even the spider have also seen use
during wartime. Animals have even been awarded medals for their courage in battle.

Transport and hauling
The horse has been the most widely-used animal throughout the recorded history of warfare. Early
mounts could be used to pull the chariot or to carry lightly armored skirmishing forces. With the
appearance of heavier mounts and the invention of the stirrup, the horse-mounted cavalry became the
dominant military arm in Europe for several centuries. The combination of the horse-mounted warrior
armed with a bow made the Mongol army the most powerful military force of its time.

With the appearance of modern ranged weapons and motorized vehicles, the use of the horse for military
purposes fell into decline. However the horse was still used extensively by the German army during
World War II for transporting supplies and equipment, including artillery. The U.S. Army also used
pack horses during the war.

While elephants are not considered domesticable, they can be trained to serve as mounts, or for moving
heavy loads. Sanskrit hymns record their use for military purposes as early as 1,100 B.C. A group of
elephants was notably employed by Hannibal during the Punic Wars. They were employed as recently as
World War II by both the Japanese and Allies. Elephants could perform the work of machines in
locations where vehicles could not penetrate, so they found considerable use in the Burma theater. For
more information on the military utilization of elephants, see war elephant.

Other

    ●   Camels have typically seen use as mounts in arid regions. They are better able to traverse sandy
        deserts than horses, and require far less water. Camels were employed in both world wars.

    ●   Mules were used by the U.S. Army during World War II to carry supplies and equipment over
        difficult terrain. These pack animals that are innately patient, cautious, and hardy; mules could
         carry heavy loads of supplies where Jeeps and even pack horses could not travel. Mules were
         used in North Africa, Burma, the Philippines, and in Italy.

     ●   During the Second World War, over 100,000 reindeer were used by Finland to tow sleds. They
         were employed during raids, for carrying wounded to hospitals, and for bringing supplies to the
         troops.

     ●   Oxen have occasionally been used in war as improvised beasts of burden.

Pigeons & War
Homing pigeons have seen use since the time of the French Revolution for carrying messages. They
were employed for a similar purpose during the first world war. In WWII, experiments were performed
in the use of the pigeon for guiding missiles, known as Project Pigeon. The pigeon was placed inside so
that they could see out through a window. They were trained to peck at controls to the left or right,
depending on the location of a target shape. See also: War pigeon.

Other specialized functions
Dogs were used by the ancient Greeks for war purposes, and they were undoubtedly used much earlier
in history. During their conquest of Latin America, conquistadores used Mastiffs to kill Indian warriors
in the Caribbean, Mexico and Peru. More recently, canines with explosives strapped to their backs saw
use during World War II in the Soviet Army as anti-tank weapons. In other armies, they were used for
detecting mines. They were trained to spot trip wires, as well as mines and other booby traps. They were
also employed for sentry duty, and to spot snipers or hidden enemy forces. Some dogs also saw use as
messengers.

Beginning in the Cold War era, research has been done into the uses of many species of marine
mammals for military purposes. The U.S. Navy Marine Mammal Program uses dolphins and sea lions
for underwater sentry duty, mine clearance, and object recovery. On land, the Gambian giant pouched
rat has been used with considerable success in demining, as its keen sense of smell helps in the
identification of explosives and its small size prevents it from triggering mines.

Pliny the Elder wrote about the use of pigs against elephants. As he relates it, elephants became scared
by the squeal of a pig and would panic, bringing disaster to any soldiers who stood in their path of flight.

At the beginning of the War in Iraq, The Goverment of Congo proposed the idea of trained monkeys to
                                           [citation needed]
clear minefields by running across them.
During the Second World War, spiders were employed by the Allies to spin silk for use in cross-hairs on
                                             [citation needed]
bomb scopes and other optical instruments.

Also during the Second World War, the United States came up with the idea of a "bat bomb" using the
Mexican Free-tailed Bat as a delivery system for incendiaries which the Americans would use to burn
down the Japanese homes and districts. It was hoped that after dropping this bomb, that the bats would
be released to fly into attics and other dark places in the Japanese cities. After a set period of time the
incindaries would go off and burn down whatever buildings the bats had roosted in. They even went as
far as to attach the incindiararies to the bats themselves before the program was halted because of the
first atomic bomb test. They never saw operational service.

                           Notes



The Kelpie is an Australian breed of sheep dog that has proven very successful at herding sheep in
Australia and in the mountainous areas of New Zealand. They are medium-sized dogs and come in a
variety of colors. Kelpies have been exported throughout the world and are used for herding sheep,
cattle, goats, ducks, and other livestock.

The breed has split over time into the Australian Kelpie and the working Kelpie. The Australian is the
variety that is seen at dog shows.

Appearance
The Kelpie's short double coat has a thick undercoat and a weather-resistent outer coat. The coat comes
in seven colors: black, chocolate, red, smokey blue, fawn, black and tan (from dark brown to a light
cream), and red and tan -- in the 'Australian' the colour should be solid; the 'working' can have the
colours either solid or with tan, and occasionally with small white markings. Different kennel clubs'
breed standards have preferences for certain colours, so what is acceptable for show dogs in some
venues might not be acceptable in others. The colour has no relationship to the dog's working ability, so
ranchers looking for capable working dogs usually disregard the dog's colour.

Kelpies stand between 17 and 23 inches (43-58.5 cm) at the withers and generally weigh from 24 to 45
lbs (11 to 30 kg).

Temperament
They are clever, loyal, and friendly and typically have an abundunce of energy. A working Kelpie often
works sixty kilometers (37 miles) and upwards in extremes of climates and conditions. They are
renowned for running along the backs of sheep when moving them through chutes.

Health
Kelpies are a hardy breed with few health problems. For more information concerning the healthissues
in this breed, click on this link: [1]


History
Some people claim that Kelpies have some Dingo blood. One possible reason for this belief is that, in
areas where it is illegal to keep dingoes as pets, some dingo owners register their animals as Kelpies or
Kelpie crosses. Another support for this belief is that the Kelpies seem to be immune to the poison of
Australian ticks (a tick from the New South Wales coast can kill a healthy Alsatian dog ). Similar
immunity display the dingoes. However, the breed is most likely a cross between Scottish sheepdogs and
smooth-haired collies of the past.

Breed standards
As is the case with many breeds of dogs that are still used for their original purposes, breed standards
vary depending on whether the registry is more interested in a dog who performs his job superbly or a
dog whose appearance meets an ideal standard. It is possible for a dog to do both, but his options for
competition in dog shows might be limited depending on his ancestry and on the opinions of the various
kennel clubs or breed clubs involved.

For example, in Australia, there are two separate registries for Kelpies. The Working Kelpie Council [2]
encourages breeding for herding ability, and allows a wider variety of coat colors than does the
Australian National Kennel Council, which encourages breeding for a certain appearance and limits
dogs to certain colors, apparently promoting solid colors over others.

As another example, in the United States, the Kelpie was recognized as a breed by the American Kennel
Club for a while, but currently the AKC (which promotes standards based on the dog's appearance) does
not recognize the breed, and the North American Australian Kelpie Registry[3], which promotes the dog
as a working breed, does not appear to want the breed to be promoted by the AKC.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

0. PREAMBLE

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document
"free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with
or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves
for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative works of the document must
themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a
copyleft license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software
needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that
the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual
work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this
License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the
copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated
herein. The "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as "you". You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in
a way requiring permission under copyright law.

A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it,
either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language.

A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals
exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.
(Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related
matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.

The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of
Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section
does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The
Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections
then there are none.

The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover
Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose
specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or
(for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an
otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or
discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if
used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input
format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image
formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools
are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some
word processors for output purposes only.
The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed
to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which
do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of
the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ
or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ
stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements", "Dedications",
"Endorsements", or "History".) To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.

The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License
applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty
Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.

2. VERBATIM COPYING

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially,
provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the
Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this
License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the
copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you
distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies.

3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document,
numbering more than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front
cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you
as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with
changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed
(as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either
include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each
Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to
download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus
accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy
(directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing
any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
Document.

4. MODIFICATIONS

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2
and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the
Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the
Modified Version:




     ●   A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and
         from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
         of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
         that version gives permission.
     ●   B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of
         the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of
         the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from
         this requirement.
     ●   C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher.
     ●   D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
     ●   E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright
         notices.
     ●   F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission
         to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum
         below.
     ●   G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts
         given in the Document's license notice.
     ●   H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
     ●   I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least
         the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If
        there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,
        and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the
        Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.
    ●   J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent
        copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous
        versions it was based on. These may be placed in the "History" section. You may omit a network
        location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the
        original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
    ●   K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications", Preserve the Title of the
        section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
        acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.
    ●   L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles.
        Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
    ●   M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements". Such a section may not be included in the
        Modified Version.
    ●   N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any
        Invariant Section.
    ●   O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary
Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or
all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the
Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your
Modified Version by various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been
approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a
Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any
one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you
may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their
names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms
defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of
your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant
Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in
parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique
number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license
notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History" in the various original documents,
forming one section Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements",
and any sections Entitled "Dedications". You must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this
License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying
of each of the documents in all other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this
License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License
in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or
works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what
the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the
Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the
Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.

8. TRANSLATION

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document
under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission
from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in
addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this
License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you
also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and
disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or
a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", or "History", the
requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.

9. TERMINATION

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided for
under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void,
and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received
copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation
License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a
particular numbered version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been
published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software
Foundation.

                 This breed of dog is extinct

The Alaunt is a now extinct Molosser dog breed. A number of modern breeds are believed directly
descended from the Alaunt.

Appearance
The original alaunt is thought to have resembled a Central Asian Ovcharka. They were large, short
coated mountain dogs of varying type.

History of the Breed
The Alaunt was bred and formed by the Alani tribes, the Kavkaz nomads of Sarmatian Indo-Iranian
ancestry, who were known as superb warriors, herdsmen and breeders of horses and dogs. The Alans
bred their dogs for work and had developed different strains within the breed for specific duties. As far
as is known, the Alaunt's primary ancestors were native dogs such as the Gampr and the Alabai of the
Caucasus and Central Asia, and the shorthaired hounds of India and Persia.

In the 370s, Hun invasions divided the Alani into the Eastern and Western Alans. The Eastern Alani
tribes merged with the Albanians, Ossetians, Serbs and other nations, introducing their dogs into the
bloodlines of many Balkan breeds, such as the Illyrian Mountain Dog, Metchkar, Qen Ghedje,
Hellenikos Poimenikos and other Molossers of the region. Some believe that the white-coloured Alaunts
were the direct ancestors of Greek and Albanian breeds, which in turn influenced all other white dogs in
the Balkans. The Western Alans joined the Vandals on their raids through Europe and by the 410s, their
fierce dogs were influencing many breeds in France, Spain, Portugal, England and other countries,
spreading the use of the "alaunt" name, which became synonymous with a type of a working dog, rather
than a specific breed. Through breeding with various scenthounds and sighthounds, the Alaunt became a
valued large game hunting dog, existing in a variety of types, dictated by regional preferences.
In France, Alaunts were separated into three main categories, based on physical appearance and the
duties they performed. The lightest type was the Alaunt Gentil, a greyhound-like dog, which eventually
became assimilated into the local hunting breeds with the Alaunt Veantre. The heavier mastiff variety,
known as the Alaunt de Boucherie, was crucial is the development of the fighting and baiting dogs of
France. The process was repeated in other countries, such as England and Spain, where Alaunts crosses
produced mastiffs and bulldogs, which in return influenced nearly every European guarding, baiting and
fighting breed.

Modern Relatives
Alaunt fanciers are developing of new breeds based on Alaunt bloodlines, such as the New Alaunt, Dogo
Belgrado, Abraxas bulldog and the American Alaunt. While its origins are strongly rooted in the ancient
mountain dogs of the East, the Alaunt may be regarded as one of the original bulldog breeds.

The English Black and Tan Terrier is a now-extinct terrier dog breed. It is believed to have existed in
the British Isles through the 18th Century and may have been more of a type than an actual breed. There
were probably rough and smooth-coated varieties. The Black and Tan Terrier is believed to be among
the progenitors of the fox terriers.

Blue Paul Terrier is an extinct breed of dog.


Appearance
The Blue Paul Terrier resembled our contemporary pit dogs. They had a smooth coat and were
powerfully built. They weighed about 20kg and measured up to 50cm at the withers. The head was
large; the forehead was flat, muscle short and square, large and broad but not receding like that of the
Bulldog. The jaws and teeth were even with no overchanging flews. They had a slight dip between the
eyes, which were dark hazel and not sunken, prominent, nor showing haw. The ears were small, thin, set
on high, and invariably cropped, and the face was not wrinkled. The eyebrows contracted or knit. The
facial expression of the Blue Paul has never been seen in any other breed and can frequently be
recognized in mixed-breed dogs. The body was round and well ribbed up, its back short, broad, and
muscular but not roached, and its chest deep and wide. The tail was set low and devoid of fringe, rather
drooping and never rising above the back. The dog stood straight and firmly on its legs. Its forelegs were
stout and muscular, showing no curve. The hind legs were very thick and strong, with well-developed
muscles. The colour was dark blue as can be seen in Greyhounds; however, they sometimes produced
brindles or reds, which were known as red smuts in Scotland.

History
No one seems to have full knowledge as to how the Blue Pauls were bred or from where they originally
came. There was a story that Paul Jones, the pirate, brought them from abroad and landed some when he
visited his native town of Kirkcudbright about 1770. The gypsies around the Kin Tilloch district kept
Blue Pauls, which they fought for their own amusement. They were game to the death and could suffer
much punishment. They were expert and tricky in their fighting tactics, which made them great favorites
with those who indulged in this sport. They maintained that the breed originally came from the
Galloway coast, which lends support to the Paul Jones legend. The first dogs to arrive in the United
States with the English immigrants in the mid-19th century were the Blue Paul Terrier and the
Staffordshire Bull Terrier.


Breeding
With his excellent fighting skills, the Blue Paul was introduced as part of Staffordshire Bull Terrier
breeding in the early 19th century and the blue colouring has appeared in Staffords ever since, in
particular, the Blue Staffordshire Bull Terrier.It has also appeared in Pitbulls and a bluetick coloration
also appears due to inbreeding.

The Cordoba Fighting Dog is a breed of dog that is now extinct. The Cordoba was a crossbreed of
Mastiff, Bull Terrier, and Old English Bulldog.It became extinct around 1940s when the Dogo
Argentino became more popular.


History
The Cordoba Fighting Dog originated in Cordoba, Argentina. The breed had such strong gameness
toward other dogs that the males and females would rather fight than mate. In addition, many members
of this breed died in the dog fighting pits and it became replaced by the more efficient Dogo Argentino,
contributing to the breed's extinction.

The Cordoba was the base breed used for the Dogo Argentino. The breeding program started with 12
bitches deemed "The Nucleus" by Dr. Nores,the breed Founder. This breed was capable of hunting in a
small pack of a male and female, otherwise they were more likely to turn on their packmates. The Dogo
Argentino was more efficient than its predecessor in the dogfighting ring and hunting large game,
mainly wild boar, peccary, jaguar, and pumas in the Pampas.

The White English Terrier is an extinct breed of dog, one of many terrier breeds.


Appearance




                                     English White Terrier with Black and Tan Terrier

The White English Terrier colour was an intensely brilliant white and its eyes very black and sparkling,
with the oblique shape being preferred. Nearly all the 'purely' white animals were deaf and were only
redeemed from the infirmity by the nose, or a few scattered and so invisible hairs.

The following is the description laid down by the White English Terrier Club:

    ●   HEAD–Narrow, long and level, almost flat skull, without cheek muscles, wedge-shaped, well
        filled up under the eyes, tapering to the nose, and not lippy.
    ●   EYES–Small and black, set fairly close together, and oblong in shape.
    ●   NOSE–Perfectly black.
    ●   EARS–Cropped and standing perfectly erect.
    ●   NECK AND SHOULDERS–The neck should be fairly long and tapering from the shoulders to
         the head, with sloping shoulders, the neck being free from throatiness, and slightly arched at the
         occiput.
    ●    CHEST–Narrow and deep. BODY–Short and curving upwards at the loins, sprung out behind the
         shoulders, back slightly arched at loins, and falling again at the joining of the tail to the same
         height as the shoulders.
    ●    LEGS–Perfectly straight and well under the body, moderate in bone, and of proportionate length.
    ●    FEET–Feet nicely arched, with toes set well together, and more inclined to be round than hare-
         footed.
    ●    TAIL–Moderate length, and set on where the arch of the back ends, thick where it joins the body,
         tapering to a point, and not carried higher than the back.
    ●    COAT–Close, hard, short, and glossy.
    ●    COLOUR–Pure white, coloured marking to disqualify.
    ●    CONDITION–Flesh and muscles to be hard and firm.
    ●    WEIGHT–From 12 lb. to 20 lb.

Silvio

Alfred Benjamin, owned a male White English Terrier, named 'Silvio' (b. 1876). It was well-shown and
considered a prime specimen of the breed. In 1877 Silvio won dog shows at Bath, Royal Agricultural
Hall, Darlington, Alexandra Palace and in 1878 at Wolverhampton. Silvio weighed nineteen pounds
with the following measurements:

History
Mr. White, of Clapham, first brought the breed into qualified prominence it once enjoyed, as he was a
large winner in these classes at early dog shows. Outside the dog shows, the English White Terrier was
used for hunting. It was a progenitor of the Fox Terrier and the Bull Terrier, among other breeds, and
became extinct around the year 1900. It is similar to the Manchester Terrier.

CHAPTER XXIX

THE WHITE ENGLISH TERRIER

This dog, one would think, ought, by the dignified title which he bears, to be considered a representative
national terrier, forming a fourth in the distinctively British quartette whose other members are the
Scottish, the Irish, and the Welsh Terriers. Possibly in the early days when Pearson and Roocroft bred
him to perfection it was hoped and intended that he should become a breed typical of England. He is still
the only terrier who owns the national name, but he has long ago yielded pride of place to the Fox-
terrier, and it is the case that the best specimens of his race are bred north of the border, while, instead of
being the most popular dog in the land, he is actually one of the most neglected and the most seldom
seen. At the Kennel Club Show of 1909 there was not a single specimen of the breed on view, nor was
one to be found at the recent shows at Edinburgh, Birmingham, Manchester, or Islington, nor at the
National Terrier Show at Westminster. It is a pity that so smart and beautiful a dog should be suffered to
fall into such absolute neglect. One wonders what the reason of it can be. Possibly it is that the belief
still prevails that he is of delicate constitution, and is not gifted with a great amount of intelligence or
sagacity; there is no doubt, however, that a potent factor in hastening the decline is to be found in the
edict against cropping. Neither the White Terrier nor the Manchester Terrier has since been anything
like so popular as they both were before April, 1898, when the Kennel Club passed the law that dogs’
ears must not be cropped.

Writers on canine history, and Mr. Rawdon Lee among the number, tell us that the English White
Terrier is a comparatively new breed, and that there is no evidence to show where he originally sprang
from, who produced him, or for what reason he was introduced. His existence as a distinct breed is dated
back no longer than forty years. This is about the accepted age of most of our named English terriers.
Half a century ago, before the institution of properly organised dog shows drew particular attention to
the differentiation of breeds, the generic term “terrier” without distinction was applied to all “earth
dogs,” and the consideration of colour and size was the only common rule observed in breeding. But it
would not be difficult to prove that a white terrier resembling the one now under notice existed in
England as a separate variety many generations anterior to the period usually assigned to its recognition.

In the National Portrait Gallery there is a portrait of Mary of Modena, Queen Consort of James II.,
painted in 1670 by William Wissing, who has introduced at the Queen’s side a terrier that is
undoubtedly of this type. The dog has slight brown or brindle markings on the back, as many English
White Terriers have, and it is to be presumed that it is of the breed from which this variety is descended.

Apart from colour there is not a great difference between the White English Terrier and the Manchester
Black and Tan. But although they are of similar shape and partake much of the same general character,
yet there is the distinction that in the black and tan the conservation of type is stronger and more
noticeable than in the white, in which the correct shape and action are difficult to obtain. It ought
naturally to be easier to breed a pure white dog from white parents than to breed correctly marked and
well tanned puppies from perfect black and tans; but the efforts of many breeders do not seem to support
such a theory in connection with the English Terrier, whose litters frequently show the blemish of a spot
of brindle or russet. These spots usually appear behind the ears or on the neck, and are of course a
disfigurement on a dog whose coat to be perfect should be of an intense and brilliant white. It appears to
be equally difficult to breed one which, while having the desired purity of colour, is also perfect in shape
and terrier character. It is to be noted, too, that many otherwise good specimens are deaf–a fault which
seriously militates against the dog’s possibilities as a companion or as a watch.

Birmingham and Manchester were the localities in which the English Terrier was most popular forty
years ago, but it was Mr. Frederick White, of Clapham, who bred all the best of the white variety and
who made it popular in the neighbourhood of London. His terriers were of a strain founded by a dog
named King Dick, and in 1863 he exhibited a notable team in Laddie, Fly, Teddie, and Nettle. Mr. S. E.
Shirley, M. P., was attracted to the breed, and possessed many good examples, as also did the Rev. J. W.
Mellor and Mr. J. H. Murchison. Mr. Alfred Benjamin’s Silvio was a prominent dog in 1877.

Silvio was bred by Mr. James Roocroft, of Bolton, who owned a large kennel of this variety of terrier,
and who joined with his townsman, Joe Walker, and with Bill Pearson in raising the breed to popularity
in Lancashire. Bill Pearson was the breeder of Tim, who was considered the best terrier of his time, a
dog of 14 lb., with a brilliant white coat, the darkest of eyes, and a perfect black nose.

It is apparent that the Whippet was largely used as a cross with the English Terrier, which may account
to a great extent for the decline of terrier character in the breed. Wiser breeders had recourse to the more
closely allied Bull-terrier; Mr. Shirley’s prize winning Purity was by Tim out of a Bull-terrier bitch, and
there is no doubt that whatever stamina remains in the breed has been supported by this cross.

                 This breed of dog is extinct

The Molossus was an ancient, extinct breed of dog that is commonly considered to be the ancestor of
today's Mastiff-type dogs and of many other modern breeds. Mastiff-type dogs are often referred to as
Molossus dogs or Molossers. It is one of the best-known breeds of Greco-Roman antiquity; however, its
physical characteristics and function are debated. Though the Molossus breed no longer exists in its
original form, it is noted as being instrumental in the development of modern breeds such as the St.
Bernard, Rottweiler, and Bernese Mountain Dog.


Controversy
Some scholars contend that the Molossus was a dog used by the Greeks for fighting. They describe it as
having a wide, short muzzle and a heavy dewlap (similar to modern Mastiff breeds) that was used to
fight tigers, lions, elephants, and men in battle. They consider the Molossus a forefather of the
Neopolitan Mastiff.

Others argue that it was primarily a lightweight dog used for hunting and herding with physical
characteristics more akin to Greyhounds or possibly the versatile Catahoula Leopard Dog.

Most scholars agree the Molossus originated with the Molossi people in the mountainous regions of
northwest Greece and Southern Albania before the Common Era.

                 This breed of dog is extinct

The Old English Bulldog is for all intents and purposes an extinct breed of dog.


Appearance
The Old English Bulldog was extremely compact, broad and muscular as reflected in the well-known
depiction "Crib and Rosa." The average height was approximately 16 inches they weighed about 45
pounds. A particular characteristic of the breed was the lower jaw that projected considerably in front of
the upper jaw, which made possible a strong, vice-like grip. The nose was deeply set, which allowed the
dog to get enough air as it gripped the bull.

History
                                                        Wasp, Child and Billy

The English blood sport of bull-baiting allowed for a specialized breed in the form of the Old English
Bulldog. The main locations in London for these exhibitions were Westminster Pit, Bear Garden and
Old Conduit Fields.

Historians are fairly confident that the Old English Bulldog is derived from ancient war dogs, such as,
the old Mastiff or Alaunt. Others believe that the true origin of the breed is not entirely clear. One safe
theory is that the Bulldog was first developed in the British Isles and was originally bred for the sole
purpose of bull-baiting.

In England, the passage of the Humane Act of 1835 caused a decline of bull-baiting and dog fighting
leading to a lack of interest in perpetuating the Old English Bulldog. Three dogs from the Duke of
Hamilton's strain of Old English Bulldog, 'Wasp, Child, and Billy,' were famously depicted in a painting
and recognized as some of the last known members of the breed before they became extinct.

Two other recognized members of the breed 'Crib and Rosa' can be seen in a painting of that period,
with Rosa being considered to represent perfection in the shape, make, and size of the ideal type of Old
English Bulldog; however, being deficient in wrinkles about the head and neck and in substance of bone
in the limbs.

Despite the laws making dog fighting illegal the activity continued for many years. Breeders determined
a cross between the Old English Bulldog and Terrier created a superior fighting dog with increased
quickness and dexterity. This new breed of dog called the Bull and Terrier and precurser to the Bull
Terrier and Pit Bull Terrier accelerated the extinction of the Old English Bulldog.


Reincarnations
Several breeders are attempting to recreate this extinct breed with some success. However, it should be
noted that these recreations are not the Old English Bulldog, as the genetics from this breed are extinct.

Wilkinson Bulldog
        Main articles: Wilkinson Bulldog

Lolly Wilkinson of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada, has been breeding a strain of Bulldog
referred to as the Wilkinson Bulldog, for many years that is similar to the Old English Bulldog. Due to
the small number of bulldogs and the potential for inbreeding it is of questionable quality. In addition,
the breed is not recognized by any major kennels.Its form is most similar to the old English Bulldog
hence its alternate name-Original English Bulldog. Although the Wilkinsons claim that it is a healthy
breed and suffers few genetic diseases. Whether this breed will gain worldwide popularity and more
people accept that this is the real Bulldog,remains to be seen.

Olde English Bulldogge

        Main articles: Olde English Bulldogge

The contemporary recreation of the breed is called the Olde English Bulldogge. A well-researched line-
breeding program, with the aim of recreating the Old English Bulldog, was started in the 1970s. This
modern day version with its similar physical abilities does not include the violent temperament of the
Old English Bulldog. This recreation was done by inter breeding the healthiest bulldogs, Bullmastiffs
and Pitbulls.

Others

There are several other recreations but none have become popular, including but not limited too, Dorset
Thyme Bulldog, Victorian Bulldog and Renaissance Bulldog.

English Bulldog
Often confused with the Old English Bulldog, the English Bulldog may be a fine animal to own for its
sweet disposition, but it has maintained nothing of the tenacity, speed, and agility that were the
definitive characteristics of the Old English Bulldog.

The St. John's Water Dog, also called the St. John’s Dog, was a dog breed from Newfoundland. Little
is known of the breeds that went into its creation. There may have been "greater" and "lesser" versions.

This breed is the ancestor of the modern Retrievers; including the Flat Coated Retriever, Golden
Retriever, Labrador Retriever, and the Newfoundland.

The smaller Newfoundlands, which were exported from Canada to England, were also known as St.
John's dogs. These dogs were cross-bred with other breeds to creat the Retrievers. The larger of these
dogs evolved into the big and gentle Newfoundlands as we know them today.

The Talbot Hound was a snow white hunting dog in Great Britain that was of such large stature with
such keen smell that it was credited with being capable of bringing down a white stag in the midst of
winter. Upon the romance of such a notion the symbol of a Talbot's Head was awarded as crests to
princes of Germanic origin (for example, the prince Haruson Y Gogledd, Harrison of the North) whose
predicatums were recognised by The King of England.

The Affenpinscher is a terrier-like toy breed of dog.


Appearance
Weighing 7 to 8 pounds (3-4 kg) and not exceeding 10.25 inches (26-27 cm) in height at the withers, the
Affenpinscher has bushy eyebrows, shaggy hair, and a monkey-like appearance. The coat is medium
long and is harsh and wiry in texture. The FCI breed standards specifies that the coat must be black, but
the AKC also allows gray, silver, red, black and tan, and beige; other clubs have their own lists of
acceptable colours, with black always being the preference.

Temperament
Affenpinschers have an appearance that some associate with terriers. They are different from terriers,
however, in that they are actually part of the pinscher-schnauzer subgroup of group 2 in the FCI
classification so often get along with other dogs and pets. They are active, adventurous, curious, and
stubborn, but they are also fun-loving and playful. The breed is confident, lively, affectionate towards
family members and also very protective of them. This loyal little dog enjoys being with its family. It
needs consistent, firm training because some can be quite difficult to housebreak. The training should be
varied because the dog can easily become bored.

Affenpinschers are somewhat territorial when it comes to their toys and food, so they are not
recommended for very small children. This dog is mostly quiet but can become very excited if attacked
or threatened and shows no fear toward any aggressor. It is best suited for a family who likes a show and
has a sense of humor.

Health
The breed can be expected to live about 14-15 years. It is one of the healthiest breeds, with no known
genetic health problems.

History
The breed is European in origin and dates back to the seventeenth century. Its name is derived from the
German affe ("ape", "monkey") and pinscher ("terrier"). The breed predates and is ancestral to the
Griffon Bruxellois (Brussels Griffon) and Belgian Griffon. Dogs of the Affenpinscher type have been
known since about 1600 but these were somewhat larger, about 12 to 13 inches, and came in colors of
gray, black, fawn, black and tan, gray and tan, and even red. White feet and chest were also common.
The breed was created to be a ratter, working to remove rodents from kitchens, granaries, and stables.

The Africanis is a South Africa dog breed. It is believed to be of ancient origin, directly descended from
sight and pariah dogs of ancient Africa, introduced into the Nile Valley from the Levant. The Swahili
name for the breed is umbwa wa ki-shenzi or "traditional dog". Africanis is also an umbrella name for all
the aboriginal dogs in southern Africa.

Appearance
The Africanis is a short-coated, medium-sized dog, well-muscled and slightly longer than tall. It can be
of any colour. The Africanis has over the years been shaped by Africa for Africa. Its beauty is embodied
in the simplicity and functionality of its body. It is slenderly built, agile, supple, and capable of great
speed.

Temperament
The Africanis is well disposed without being obtrusive: a friendly dog showing watchful territorial
behaviour. The breed is independent and territorial, but highly trainable.

       It is my experience that the Africanis is a marvellous pet and house dog. Guided by its instinct of
       subservience it will steal your heart before you realise it.
              - Johan Gallant, President of the Africanis Society of Southern Africa (September 9th,
              2005).

Health
The Africanis needs neither pampering nor special food. It is consistently healthy and has, over the
years, developed a natural resistance against internal and external parasites.

History
There is ample evidence that no canine domestication took place in Africa and that the traditional
African dog is a descendant of dogs that had been domesticated in the East and came to Africa. Their
earliest presence has been established in Egypt and dated at 4700 BC. Archaeological records show that,
from then on, the dog spread rapidly along the Nile into Sudan and even beyond. At the same time,
migrations, trade, and transhumance took it deep into the Sahara. By 2000 BC, this moving frontier
stopped for a long period. Meanwhile, throughout the Egyptian dynasties, the breeding of swift and
slender sight hounds together with a variety of common dogs became very popular.

For thousands of years, the aboriginal Stone Age San (Bushman) populations in Southern Africa hunted
without the help of dogs. Although the Khoikhoi brought domestic sheep along a western migratory
route to the Cape of Good Hope just before the Christian era, there is no conclusive evidence that dogs
were part of their party.

The domestic dog first arrived in Southern Africa with the migration of the Early Iron Age Bantu
speaking people. Dogs of Nilotic origin consecutively joined the Early and also Later Iron Age
migrations. It is generally accepted that these migrations travelled along the Central Rift and the
Lacustrine region. They followed tsetse-free corridors through Zambia and Zimbabwe to reach
Botswana and finally South Africa. The earliest evidence for the presence of a domestic dog in South
Africa has been established by Dr. Ina Plug, deputy director of the Transvaal Museum. The remains
were found near the Botswana border and dated at 570 AD. By 650 AD the presence of the house dog is
established in the Lower Thukela valley. By 800 AD it is part of a Khoisan settlement in Cape St.
Francis, indicating that contact and trade between Bantu and Khoisan had been established.

For hundreds of years this exclusive primitive canine gene pool adapted to various conditions of the
Southern African landscape and, through natural selection, evolved into ecotypes all belonging to the
same landrace. It is sometimes argued that dogs brought by the Arab trade, Eastern seafarers, and
Portuguese explorers might, over the years, have "contaminated" the traditional African dog. In other
opinions, these chances are scant. Exotic canine influences became more likely after the colonisation of
Transkei and Zululand during the 19th century.
The true Africanis is still found today in tribal areas where people maintain their traditional lifestyle.
The fast-changing South Africa and the impact that this causes on rural societies, together with a certain
disdain for the traditional dog and the status that the ownership of an exotic breed provides, poses an
increasing threat to the continuation of the aboriginal Africanis. The Africanis Society of Southern
Africa was founded to conserve this ancient gene pool. Conserving the Africanis as a land race stands
for conserving biodiversity.

Today, the Africanis is recognized by the Kennel Union of Southern Africa (KUSA) as an emerging
breed.

The Aidi or Chien de l'Atlas is a Moroccan dog breed used as a flock guard, protecting herds of sheep
and goats. It also possesses hunting capabilities and good scenting ability. In its native Morocco it is
often paired in hunting with the Sloughi, which chases down prey that the Aidi has located by scent.
Appearance
Standing 21 to 25 inches (53-63.5 cm) in height and weighing around 55 pounds (25 kg), the Aidi's lean,
muscular body is protected by a coarse, thick, weather-resistant coat with a heavy plumed tail. The head
is bear-like and in proportion to the rest of the body. The breed has a tapered muzzle with a black or
brown nose that usually matches the coat. Their jaws are strong with tight black or brown lips. The
medium-sized ears are tipped forward and drop slightly. The eyes are medium, with a dark colour and
dark rims. Coat colours are white, black, black and white, pale red, and tawny.


Temperament
The breed is energetic and highly protective and is said to make an outstanding watchdog. It is a
powerful dog that is also agile, alert, and ready for action. As a sensitive breed, the dog should receive
kindly, yet firm training.

History
The Aidi is recognized as coming from Morocco, probably originating in the Sahara. The dog has never
worked as a sheepdog even though the 1963 standard was published under the name Atlas Sheepdog;
this was corrected in 1969.

The Airedale Terrier (often shortened to "Airedale") is a large and versatile terrier dog breed
originating from the Aire Dale in Yorkshire, England, in the UK. It is often called the "King of Terriers"
because it is the largest of the terrier breeds, 50 to 70 pounds (23-32 kg). The Airedale was bred
originally to hunt otters. It was also called a "Waterside Terrier" because of this connection to hunting
otters.

Appearance

Coat

Like many terriers, it has a 'broken' coat, which requires regular hand stripping to maintain the coat and
distinctive square terrier shape. A broken coat is a harsh, wiry topcoat with a soft, fur-like undercoat.
Broken-coated breeds do not shed their coats as much as smooth coated breeds, and are therefore less
likely to cause allergic reactions in people prone to dog allergies.

Stripping is the correct process for grooming an Airedale, using a small serrated edged knife to pull out
loose hair from the dog's coat. Airedales who aren't being shown are often clipped with electric clippers.
This process, while easier on the dog and the groomer, softens the coat and fades the color, and
sometimes causes skin allegies for the dog. This is because the loose hair that would normally moult is
cut, so the roots remain within the hair follicles.




                                  This Airedale's tail is natural (undocked).

The correct coat color is a black saddle, with a tan head, ears and legs; or a dark grizzle saddle (black
mixed with gray and white). Both are acceptable in the AKC breed standard.

Tail

The Airedale's tail is usually docked (surgically shortened) within five days of birth, but this is not a
requirement of breed standard authorities. However, to show an Airedale in the United States, the tail is
expected to be docked.

Mouth

Airedales generally have black gums, a condition that would indicate asphyxiation in many other dog
breeds. Additionally, Airedales' teeth are the largest among Terriers.

Temperament
The Airedale can also be used as a working dog and also as a hunter and retriever. However, it is
typically an independent (stubborn), strong-minded dog with a great sense of humour. For those who can
laugh along with their Airedale, patience will be rewarded as they have been known to reach great
heights in competitive obedience, dog agility, and Schutzhund. The Airedale is also a reliable and
protective family pet.

Health
The Airedale is relatively free of inherited diseases except for hip dysplasia in some lines. Airedales,
like most Terriers, have a propensity towards dermatitis. Allergies, dietary imbalances, and under/over-
productive thyroid glands are main causes for the Airedales' itchy skin. Dogs of this breed usually live
for around twelve years, but have been known to last until the age of seventeen.

History
In the mid 19th Century, working class Great Britains created the Airedale Terrier by crossing the old
english rough coated Black and Tan Terrier with the Otterhound. The result was an intelligent, hardy
dog adept in the water, on land, at work, or with the family; their goal to create an all-purpose dog was
fulfilled. In 1886, the Kennel Club of England formally recognized the Airedale Terrier breed. 1
The Airedale was extensively used in World War One to carry messages to soldiers behind enemy lines
and occupying the trenches. They were also used extensively by the Red Cross to find wounded soldiers
on the battlefield. Their courage and stalwart character in the face of danger was legendary; there are
numerous tales of airedales delivering their messages despite terrible injury.

Before the adoption of the German Shepherd as the dog of choice for law enforcement and search and
rescue work, the Airedale terrier often filled this role.

Post-WW1, the Airedales' popularity rapidly increased thanks to stories of their bravery on the
battlefield and also because Presidents Theodore Roosevelt, Calvin Coolidge, and Warren Harding
owned Airedale Terriers. 1949 marked the peak of the Airedales' popularity, ranked 20th out of 110
breeds by the American Kennel Club. The breed has since slipped to 50th out of 146.

The Akbash Dog is native to western Turkey in the region known as the Akbash, and it is primarily
used as a Livestock guardian dog. The name comes from the Turkish word meaning white head.


Appearance
It is a large dog, weighing between 90 to 130 pounds (41 to 59 kg), averaging 90 pounds for the female
and 120 (54 kg) for the male, but it is leaner than other Turkish guard dog breeds, and has a distinct
white coat, long legs, and feathered curved tail. It possesses characteristics of both mastiffs and sight
hounds. The breed is often referred to as a sheep dog, but it does not herd its charges. Instead, it is
designed to live with the flock and act as a guardian.

The Akbash was combined with the Kangal to create the Anatolian Shepherd Dog.


Temperament
The Akbash is not shy. When used as a guard dog, it is not extremely personable with humans, although
the breed is not by nature hostile. The Akbash can be used as a companion dog as well as a working
breed, and if trained appropriately can be extremely personable with any creature no matter the size or
age. The Akbash has been bred to be independent and dogs of this breed might think that they know
better than their owners during training. The Akbash is a relatively low-energy breed. Because it is in
their nature to lie with the flocks they guard most of the day, they do not require tremendous endurance
and little energy. That does not mean, however, that they can be happily confined to small spaces. It is
still very much a working breed and is happiest when given a task to complete. These dogs are known
for their intelligence, bravery, independence and loyalty.
Health
Cases of hip dysplasia and Osteochondritis dessicans (OCD) have occurred with this dog; however, the
breed as a whole does not seem to be afflicted with these conditions nearly as often as many other large,
rapidly growing breeds. Akbash dogs, like many large breeds, can be expected to live 10 to 11 years.

History
The origins of the breed are not well understood but it is known to be an ancient pure breed. The Akbash
Dog is the Turkish equivalent of other white guardian breeds found in and around the northern
Mediterranean Basin. Unlike those breeds, only the Akbash Dog has its unique combination of Mastiff
and sighthound qualities. This breed was developed 3000 years ago, probably by shepherds who
purposely bred for white-colored guarding sheepdogs, perhaps to tell them apart from predators.

The Alapaha Blue Blood Bulldog (ABBB) or Otto is an American rare dog breed, developed in the
Alapaha River region of Southern Georgia.

Appearance
Displaying an unexaggerated and natural bulldog type, the Alapaha is nevertheless a sturdy, well-
developed, and muscular breed. Descriptions of its size vary greatly, calling for males anywhere from 55
to 130 pounds (25 to 59 kg) standing 19 to 26 inches (48 to 73.5 cm) at the withers, females smaller at
50 to 90 pounds (22.5 to 41 cm). Ears and tail are natural, with no cropping or docking. Colors of the
Alapaha are varied, typically white or different shades of black, grey, red, fawn, brindle, brown,
buckskin, or mahogany, always with white markings; some dogs are piebald spotted.

Temperament
The ABBB is described as trainable, dutiful, and responsible, with impressive capabilities as a guardian
of family and property, but aggressive only in defense of these. They are friendly and relaxed until the
need arises to defend their own.
History
The breed was developed by the Lane family of Rebecca, Georgia, in a sustained effort over many
decades to preserve the "plantation dog" of south Georgia from extinction. Detractors say that the ABBB
is identical to the American Bulldog and that nothing distinctive is found in the Otto. Alapaha owners
appear to disagree and photos seem to indicate a fairly distinct type.

Health

Miscellaneous
The breed is quite rare with a population of living dogs probably around two hundred. Primary registry
for the breed is the Animal Research Foundation in Quinlan, Texas.

The Alaskan Klee Kai is a northern breed of dog in the spitz family. The term "Klee Kai" was derived
from Eskimo words meaning "Small Dog". The breed was developed to create a companion sized
version of the Siberian Husky, resulting in an energetic, intelligent, apartment-sized dog with an
appearance that reflects it's northern heritage.

History
The breed was developed in Wasilla, Alaska during the mid-1970s by Linda S. Spurlin after she
observed the result of an accidental mating of an Alaskan Husky and a small dog. The breed was
developed with Siberian and Alaskan Huskies using Schipperke and American Eskimo Dog to bring
down the size without dwarfism. Originally called the "Klee Kai," the breed split into "Alaskan Klee
Kai" and "Klee Kai" for political reasons in 1995. The breed consolidated under the new name in 2002.

The Alaskan Malamute is a large northern dog breed originally developed for use as a sleddog.


Appearance
Their breed standard calls for a weight of 75 to 85 pounds (34-38.5 kg) and a height of 23 to 25 inches
(58-63.5 cm) but much heavier individuals (120 to 140 pounds) are commonly seen. The coat is a dense
double northern dog coat, somewhat harsher than that of the Siberian Husky. The usual colours are
various shades of grey and white, sable and white, black and white, red and white, or pure white. The
physical build of the Malamute is compact with heavy boning. In this context 'compact' means that their
height to length ratio is fairly even, unlike dogs like Great Danes which are longer and lankier in their
ratios.

Malamutes are easily distinguished from Huskies by eye color; Malamute eyes are always brown,
whereas Huskies may have one or two blue eyes.

Characteristics
Although still in use as sleddogs for recreational mushing, most Malamutes today are kept as family pets
or show dogs. They are unable to compete successfully even in long-distance dogsled racing against
smaller and faster breeds and their working usefulness is limited to freighting.

The Malamute is one of the most "unaltered" of breeds, retaining its original form and function.
Responsible breeders will want to preserve this heritage of the Malamute's working abilities. They are a
widely regarded as handsome, affectionate toward humans, intelligent, resourceful, and hardworking.

While they may bark like other dog breeds, Malamutes normally tend to "talk" by vocalizing a "woo
woo" sound. They may howl like wolves or coyotes when feeling excited, sad, or lonely.

Temperament and behavior
                                    Malamutes need plenty of exercise.

Understanding Malamute behavior requires understanding life in an aboriginal Arctic village.

Malamutes were originally bred to think and act independently for the sake of protecting the sled team.
Hazardous and unpredictable Arctic trail conditions rewarded the ability of a Malamute to rely on its
own senses and, when necessary, override the sled driver's judgment and commands. As such, the breed
is notorious for displaying a highly independent streak that manifests itself as stubbornness. Malamutes
are sometimes downright insubordinate toward their human handlers and may ignore commands,
particularly when young.

At the same time, Arctic life required that Malamutes be bred to behave as consummate members of the
sled team, family, and village community. As such, they are usually very affectionate to members of
their own pack - both human and dog members alike. A Malamute may talk in glee in greeting a
returning family or pack member after a period of separation, and howl in protest when it feels ignored,
neglected, or excluded from group activities. Also, Malamutes are usually friendly to other humans
outside their own pack, often demanding their attention and affection as well. The Malamute's
gregariousness and tendency to openly, unreservedly give affection make them highly attractive to many
dog owners; these same qualities make a Malamute a poor guard dog.

The harsh conditions for which Malamutes were bred rewarded a strong prey drive, as food was
occasionally scarce. Consequently, Malamutes may instinctively attack animals such as house cats,
squirrels, rabbits, chickens, quail, and even deer (however, many households enjoy harmonious, mixed
"packs" of cats and Malamutes). Historic competition for food is also a reason why Malamutes may
regard dogs outside their own pack or team with disdain or hostility.

Malamutes dug for food when required, and digging is now a common way in which Malamutes deal
with boredom. It is not uncommon to see a Malamute digging madly in pursuit of a mouse, mole, or
gopher. Malamutes may also dig to escape a fenced yard, and have been known to dig escape tunnels
underneath houses. The Malamute tendency to dig can be frustrating to owners who also maintain yards
or gardens; one owner has wryly described Malamutes as being "enthusiastic but unskilled gardeners".

Owing to the Malamute's independent nature, physical strength, and its high levels of energy and
intelligence, most experts on the breed advise that Malamutes not be adopted by people who:
    ●   are inexperienced in training dogs
    ●   lack the time, energy, and space to exercise them, or
    ●   lack the patience and stamina to repeatedly engage in contests of willpower with a large,
        powerful animal without becoming angry.

Health
Health issues in the Malamute are hip dysplasia, inherited polyneuropathy, chrondo displacia and the
usual northern-breed eye problems (particularly cataract and progressive retinal atrophy).

While Malamutes have been successfully raised in places such as Arizona, their dense coats generally
make them unsuited for hot climates. When the weather gets hot, they—even more than other dogs—
need plenty of water and shade. Also, being a winterised breed they will grow a winter coat and
subsequently, come spring, shed it again. Mixed with sheeps wool their thick, heavy hairs can be spun
into a garment of unusual warmth.

History
The Malamute is a descendant of dogs of the Mahlemuit tribe of upper western Alaska.

For a brief period during the Gold Rush, the Malamute and other sled dogs became extremly valuable to
recently landed prospectors and settlers, and were frequently crossbred with imported breeds. This was
often a misguided attempt to improve the type, or to make up for how few true Malamutes were up for
sale. This genetic dilution seems to have had no long standing effect on the modern Malamute, and
recent DNA analysis shows that Malamutes are one of the oldest breeds of dog, genetically distinct from
other dog breeds. [1].

The Malamute dog has had a distinguished history; aiding Admiral Richard Byrd to the South Pole, and
the miners who came to Alaska during the Gold Rush of 1896. This dog was never destined to be a
racing sled dog; instead, it was used for heavy freighting, pulling thousands of pounds of supplies to
villages and camps.

                             Notes



The Alaskan husky is not so much a breed of dog as it is a type or a category. It falls short of being a
breed in that there is no preferred type and no restriction as to ancestry; it is defined only by its purpose,
which is that of a highly efficient sled dog. That said, dog drivers usually distinguish between the
Alaskan husky and “hound crosses”, so perhaps there is informal recognition that the Alaskan husky is
expected to display a degree of northern dog type.

The Alaskan is the sled dog of choice for world-class dogsled racing competition. None of the purebred
northern breeds can match it for sheer racing speed. Demanding speed-racing events such as the
Fairbanks (Alaska) Open North American Championship and the Anchorage Fur Rendezvous are
invariably won by teams of Alaskan huskies, or of Alaskans crossed with hounds or gundogs. Hounds
are valued for their toughness and endurance. Winning speeds often average more than 19 miles per
hour over three days' racing at 20 to 30 miles each day. On the rare occasion when purebred teams are
entered in such races, they nearly always finish last.

Alaskan huskies that fulfill the demanding performance standards of world-class dogsled racing can be
extremely valuable. A top-level racing lead dog can bring $10,000-15,000. Conversely, dogs that fail to
perform effectively are worth nothing, and the high levels of culling practiced in many kennels are
strongly condemned with animal rights activists.
Appearance
The Alaskan husky is basically a mixed-breed dog, in which northern or ancestry, such as the Siberian
Husky or the traditional Alaskan village dog, predominates. Many other breeds have contributed to its
genetic makeup, from staghound and foxhound to greyhound and Dobermann, which accounts for the
Alaskan's great variability of appearance.

Alaskan huskies (at least those used for speed racing) are moderate in size, averaging perhaps 46 to 50
pounds for males and 38 to 42 pounds for females. They often resemble racing strains of the Siberian
Husky breed (which is undeniably a major component of the Alaskan husky genetic mix) but are usually
taller and leggier with more pronounced tuck-up.

Colour and markings are a matter of total indifference to racing drivers; hence the husky may be of any
possible canine colour and any pattern of markings. Eyes may be of any colour and, as in the Siberian
Husky, are often light blue. Coats are almost always short to medium in length, never long, and usually
less dense than the coats of northern purebreds; coat length is governed by the need for effective heat
dissipation while racing.

In very cold conditions, Alaskans often race in “dog coats” or belly protectors. Particularly in long
distance races, these dogs often require “dog booties” to protect their feet from abrasion and cracking.
Thus the considerations of hardiness and climate resistance prevalent in breeds such as the Siberian
Husky and Canadian Inuit Dog are subordinated in the Alaskan husky to the overriding consideration of
functional capability. The Alaskan huskies lack the dense coat required to keep them warm, and they are
not as hardy as Siberians, often requiring extra care on the trails. Andre Nadeau says this is the reason
his Siberians did so well in the 1998 Yukon Quest, where he led nearly the whole race until being passed
by a team of Alaskan huskies.

Temperament
Dogs are bred for stamina, strength, speed, and endurance. It is essential for a sled dog to want to work.
And for dogs meeting many new people, the dogs must not be aggressive towards people. (Source:
personal communication, Paul Reid, owner of Chocpaw Expeditions in Ontario)

Alaskan huskies are very popular as pets in Alaska, where they are relatively easy to obtain from
professional dogsled racers. Puppies judged to be unfit for racing are regularly culled, and as a result
they are often available free to any good home. Older dogs which have outlived their usefulness as
racing dogs make excellent pets for people willing to exercise them regularly. Older ex-racers tend to be
very alert and well behaved, as well as somewhat less energetic than their younger counterparts.
Young huskies make good pets if given plenty of space to run and play, but their high demand for
exercise and activity makes them a poor choice for urban residents. In the Alaskan cities of Anchorage
and Fairbanks the large number of trails and extensive open space make it easy to ensure plenty of free
running; in contrast the relative lack of large open areas in Juneau makes them somewhat more difficult
to exercise.

If multiple huskies are kept in the same lot they tend to be very vocal, howling and barking at each other
and any other dogs in the vicinity. In crowded neighborhoods this can be a very irritating nuisance to
neighbors, especially other dog owners. They are also accomplished diggers, and will tunnel underneath
fences and houses to hunt burrowing animals and to escape their enclosures.

Huskies make extremely poor household dogs. They shed heavily during the spring and are extremely
active, running in circles inside a house when bored or cramped. If left alone inside a dwelling for long
periods they will tear things apart out of boredom. They also enjoy hunting small animals which can be a
nuisance if rats or mice are in the walls or basement, since the husky will constantly scratch and tear at
the walls and floors.

In Alaska they are occasionally killed by wild moose in the winter, since moose will enter human areas
in search of winter browse of willows and mountain ash. True to their wolf ancestors, huskies tend not to
back down from such encounters, and an angry moose can easily stomp and kick several dogs causing
severe injuries. Professional dogsled racers always surround their lots with very high fences to prevent
moose from causing havoc.

Health
The Alaskan Husky generally lives for a period of 16-23 years.

History
The most common Mix-breed that makes up the Alaskan Husky line, is that of a Siberian Husky &
Alaskan Malamute. Both are strong and hearty northern breed dogs, with thousand of years of breeding
and history in the north country.

Future of the husky
Various attempts have been made in the past to organise breeders of Alaskan huskies and to establish a
registry for these dogs; such attempts have never received significant support. Although husky kennels
tend to be large, with many kennels harbouring over a hundred dogs, and the breed population arguably
in excess of one hundred thousand, this canine variety remains an informal and unregistered category of
dog.

The Alpine Dachsbracke, known in its native country of Austria as Alpenlandische Dachsbracke, is a
small scenthound, bred to track deer as well as boar, hare, and fox. This dog breed contains the blood of
very old strains of hounds as well as that of the Dachshund. It once was a favorite of German royalty.


Appearance
This small dog has a slight resemblance to a Dachshund, with short legs and a long body. The coat is
short and smooth except for the tail and neck.

Valid colors are black and tan, brown, or red with or without black.

It weighs from 15 to 18 kg (33 to 40 lb) and stands from 34 to 42 cm (13 to 16 in) at the withers.


Temperament
Used effectively to hunt wounded deer, this breed could work even in harsh terrain. It makes a good
companion, although it is primarily a hunter and therefore is kept mostly by hunters.

                           Notes



The American Bulldog is a breed of working dog developed for catching livestock and for protecting
property.
Appearance
The American Bulldog is a stocky, strong-looking dog. Its coat is short and either white or white with
patches. There are generally considered to be two types of American Bulldog, the Johnson type and the
Scott type. These are named after the breeders who were influential in developing them, John D.
Johnson and Allen Scott. The Johnson type is a larger dog with a shorter muzzle than the Scott type.
However, many modern American Bulldogs are a combination of the two types. Generally speaking,
American Bulldogs weigh between 27 to 54 kg (60 to 100 lb) and are 52 to 70 cm (20 to 28 inches) at
the withers.

Confusion with other breeds

There are two distinct strains of American Bulldogs, Classic (Johnson, Bully) and Standard (Scott,
Performance) which is often mistaken for its second cousin the American Pit Bull Terrier because of its
appearance, and for its much smaller European relatives because of its name, the American Bulldog is
different from any of these. The American Bulldog is massive in comparison to the French Bulldog or
English Bulldog and were never bred to be lap dogs (and they can't even fit onto one.) The Standard
American Bulldog does resemble the pit bull type breeds on many points, such as being muscular dogs
that can be all white or white with patches. However, the pit bull's head is in the shape of a wedge
coming to a more rounded point at the muzzle, whereas an American Bulldog's is box-shaped. The
American Bulldog's ears are also typically uncropped, it is heavier and a little bulkier.


Temperament




                                 American bulldogs can make great family dogs despite their reputation.

An American Bulldog is typically a happy, friendly and assertive dog that is at ease with its family and
fine with strangers as they get to know the stranger in question. They are quite fond of children but
sometimes do not know their own strength, thus they should be supervised with small children. They
bond strongly with their master and family but, because of strong guarding instincts and a somewhat
dominant attitude, they need a firm but fair hand; they should be socialized and obedience trained early
to expose them to other dogs and people and to ensure they can be controlled around company as they
get older (and much larger.) They need room to expend their energy and so do best in a home with a
backyard; they can be stubborn with training though once they are trained they tend to obey their
masters faithfully. They are not always well behaved towards cats and smaller pets, but correct
socialisation at an early age can greatly increase the chances of them accepting these animals.

History
In England during the 17th and 18th centuries, the now extinct Old English Bulldog's were used on
farms to catch and hold escaped livestock and also as butcher's dogs; it was believed then that sending a
dog out after a bull would tenderize the meat. This eventually led to the bloodsport of bull-baiting,
popular with the poor and rural areas for both entertainment as a bloodsport and the potential for
gambling. These practices extended not only to the British Isles but also to the colonies she accquired
during this time, including what is now the United States and in particular the South; many of the settlers
brought their dogs with them to help around the farm, hunt in the woods, and to gamble.

In 1835, the sport of bull-baiting was outlawed in the United Kingdom and over time the English
Bulldog became the more compact and complacent version known today, but the much more athletic
American strain continued on much the same in the rural South even as its popularity declined in favor
of other breeds. By World War Two the breed was near extinction until John Johnson and Allen Scott
scoured the backroads of the South looking for the best specimens to revive the breed.

Today

Due to a fallout between Johnson and Scott,both of them later went their separate ways and developed 2
slightly different versions of the American bulldog. Today the American Bulldog is safe from extinction
and is enjoying a healthy increase in popularity both as a working dog and as a loving family pet. In the
South and West they are used as "hog dogs" (dogs used in the catching of escaped pigs and/or hunting
razorbacks) and are also used in tracking, driving cattle, and weight pulling.

Housebreaking
American bulldog puppies can be relatively difficult to housebreak. Their stubborn nature makes
discipline seem useless, but it is important to be persistent. Make sure to completely deodorize old
'mistake' spots or the puppy will want to eliminate in the same area again.
Miscellaneous
During the 1990s Walt Disney Productions released the Homeward Bound series which featured an
American Bulldog named Chance.

In 2004, the same company released a film called Cheaper by the Dozen, where the family pet is an
American Bulldog.

                            Notes



The American Cocker Spaniel evolved in the United States from spaniels imported from Great Britain.
By the 1930s the American variety had become so different from its English ancestors that it was given
separate breed status.

Appearance
American Cockers weigh 24 to 28 pounds (11 to 12.75 kg) and stand 15 inches (38 cm) maximum
height. They come in three major color varieties: black, ASCOB (Any Solid Color Other than Black)
and particolor. The other solid colours are chocolate, red, buff, and sable. Particolor dogs are all of the
above colors and white. Black and tan, chocolate and tan, and tricolor (white, black and tan) are also
common. Roan (black and white or red and white hairs interminged) occurs rarely. The domed head,
large dark expressive eyes, short deep muzzle, and abrupt stop are characteristic breed points. The coat
is flowing, long, silky and abundant. The long, luxuriantly feathered ears are a striking breed feature.
Some cockers bred for hunting tend to have shorter coats and a longer muzzles than pet or show cockers.

Temperament

                                 3 Month Old Cocker Pup
Their temperament is typically happy, trusting, and intelligent. The ideal cocker temperament is merry,
outgoing and very willing to please. They tend to be "softer" dogs who do not do well with rough or
harsh training.

However, their popularity also led to considerable bad breeding in an attempt to keep up with the
demand, and some lines contain dogs who tend to be fearful or dominant. Submissive urination and
resource guarding also occur in some lines. As with all puppies, owners are advised to choose their
breeder carefully.

Health
Cocker Spaniels are susceptible to a variety of maladies, particularly infections affecting their ears and,
in some cases, their eyes. As a result, they may require more medical attention than some other breeds.
Common eye problems in cockers include Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA), glaucoma and cataracts.
The American Spaniel Club recommends annual eye exams by a veterinary ophthalmologist for all dogs
used for breeding. Auto-immune problems in cockers include auto-immune hemolytic anemia (AIHA)
and ear inflammations. Less common are luxating patellas and hip dysplasia. Dogs used for breeding can
be checked for both of these conditions, and dogs free of hip dysplasia can be certified by the
Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA).

History
The name cocker comes from the fact that the breed originally hunted woodcock. In the United States
the breed is registered under the name "Cocker Spaniel", as is the English Cocker Spaniel in the UK,
which can cause confusion between these two breeds. By the 1930s the American variety had become so
different from its English ancestors that it was given separate breed status. Originally a gun dog, the
Cocker now fulfills the position of family pet or show dog most often and is rarely seen hunting. Some
lines are still bred for fieldwork, and a small movement works to preserve the hunting abilities of the
breed. He can be a faithful and responsible children's companion. Cockers have been a highly popular
American breed since the 1940s, occupying the top position in number of American Kennel Club
registrations from 1940-1952. The breed declined a bit in popularity and then resurged to #1 in
registrations from 1984-1990. In the last fifteen years the breed's popularity has declined. The cocker
spaniel was 15th in AKC registrations for 2004, down from 14th in 2003.

The American Eskimo Dog is a breed of companion dog originating in the United States of America
(probably in New York City) in the twentieth century. The breed was formerly called a German Spitz or
an "American Eskimo Spitz". It is a member of the Spitz family of dogs. It achieved a high degree of
popularity in the 1930s and 1940s in the U.S. as a circus performer. The American Kennel Club
recognized the breed in 1994 and set the current standard for the breed. The United Kennel Club had
recognized the breed long before 1994, and there is no difference between the two breed standards.

Appearance




                                  American Eskimo Dogs are always ready to play.

The standard for the American Eskimo Dog calls for them to be white or white & cream, with brown
eyes (blue eyes, such as those found on the Siberian Husky, are a disqualification and a sign of poor
health or breeding), and a compact body. The dog's length should be only slightly greater than its height
at the shoulder. The muzzle is long and lupine (in contrast to the muzzles of Pomeranians). The ears are
held erect and alert, and the tail should be feathered and curled on the dog's back. These dogs look very
much like smaller versions of the Samoyed, to which they are related, and come in three standard sizes.
The toy is from 9 to 12 inches (23 to 30 cm) at the withers; the miniature is from 12 to 15 inches (33 to
38 cm); the standard is from fifteen inches up to and including nineteen inches (39 to 48 cm).

The Eskie, as with all Nordic breeds, has erect, triangular ears ("prick ears"), a tail that flips onto the
dog's back in a spiral, and two coats of fur: an inner, downy coat, and an outer coat of guard hairs that
act as weather protection.

Temperament
American Eskimos were bred to be companion dogs, not just the family dog to put outside when they
bother their owners. They thrive on being a part of their human family. Eskies love their families, and a
well-socialized dog is more of a pleasure to own. Eskies are easily trained and very intelligent, as well as
being strong-willed and independent. At home, Eskies make excellent watchdogs, barking to announce
the presence of strangers. The Eskie can be protective of its home and family, but it shouldn't threaten to
attack or bite a person.

Many people find the puppies of American Eskimo Dogs to be very cute and purchase this breed as a
puppy without doing sufficient research, such as discovering the longevity and needs of this breed. This
breed can take longer to mature than other breeds, and Eskies can behave more like puppies than like
adults for up to two years, when they finally start to mature and grow their adult coats. They are also an
extremely intelligent dog and need to be stimulated. When their intelligence is not stimulated or they are
ignored, they can develop behavior issues. Owners can avoid this problem by socializing their Eskie
through obedience training or participating in dog sports, such as dog agility, flyball, or dancing.


Health
The breed lives on average between 12 and 13 years, although some individuals might as long as 20
years or longer.

History
The American Eskimo Dog, or "Eskie" as it is often called, is most likely derived from the German
Spitz, the Finnish Spitz, the Pomeranian, the Keeshond, and possibly the Samoyed, although the latter is
not universally accepted. The Spitz family of Nordic dogs is one of the least altered by human
husbandry and reflects most nearly the prototypical dog, from which stock all others have been derived.
Archeology suggests that Neolithic dogs living with humans would today pass for spitzes.

Miscellaneous




                                    Like many light-colored dogs, the fur beneath the eyes can become
stained if not regularly cleaned.
Grooming

Eskies have a long, dense coat and need regular grooming. This means brushing them once a week, or
more often if necessary. They shed, but it can be maintained with regular brushing. They "blow" their
coats twice a year, once in May or June to shed their winter undercoat and once in November or
December to shed their summer coat. Many Eskie owners use an undercoat rake, a tool available at most
pet stores, for grooming.

Eskies have drier skin than most other dogs and do not usually smell doggy. Because of their dry skin,
they need to be bathed only every two or three months, unless they soil their coat with large amounts of
dirt or substances with strong odors. Regular brushing maintains a clean coat in most cases. Eskies are
very clean about themselves and constantly groom themselves.

All dogs' teeth should be brushed once a week. Pet stores carry a variety of dog toothbrushes, from
fingertop to electric.

Breed-specific rescue

Because so many people purchase "cute" puppies and then discover that they do not want an active,
intelligent dog with a heavily shedding coat, many of this breed end up at the animal shelter or otherwise
up for adoption. There are many breed-specific rescue groups that are more than willing to give advice
on training or curbing behavioral issues.

                            Notes



The American Foxhound is cousin to the English Foxhound. They are scent hounds, bred to hunt by
scent.

Appearance
The American foxhound is about 21-25 inches tall to the withers, and weighs anywhere between 65-75
pounds. Its legs are very long and straight-boned. The foxhound’s chest is rather narrow. It has a long
muzzle, and a large, domed skull. The ears are wide and low-set. The eyes are hazel or brown, and are
large and wide-set. The coat is short and rough.

Temperament
The American Foxhound is sweet, kind, loyal, and loving at home. On the hunt, however, the foxhound
is a warrior. Once a scent is picked up, the foxhound will follow it, neglectful of commands.

Health
This breed is not generally a breed that carries genetic disorders. Do not overfeed these dogs, as they
easily gain weight. A minor health risk in American Foxhounds is thrombocytopathy, or platelet disease.

The breed's lifespan is generally 10-13 years.

History
In 1650, Robert Brooke sailed to Crown Colony in America with his pack of hunting dogs, which were
the root of several strains of American Hounds. These dogs remained in the Brooke’s family for nearly
300 years.

George Washington received French Foxhounds as a gift from Lafayette. He bred his dogs with that of
Brooke’s, creating the present day American Foxhound.

The new breed was originally used for hunting Indians. Later, they became great hunters of wild
animals, and that is how most are used still today.
Exercise
The American Foxhound is a very energetic breed. It needs plenty of exercise, a fairly long walk
followed by fetch.

The American Hairless Terrier was formerly a variant type of Rat Terrier. As of January 1, 2004 the
American Hairless Terrier has been deemed a separate terrier breed.


History
Reputedly, the breed started when one hairless puppy appeared in one Rat Terrier litter in the state of
Louisiana, United States, in 1972. Edwin and Willie Scott, the owners, liked the bitch's look and
temperament, and upon maturity bred her hoping to reproduce the hairless quality. They were eventually
successful; a litter produced in 1981 provided the foundation stock of the breed. A handful of dedicated
breeders began diligently working together to promote and protect the breed, forming the American
Hairless Terrier Association,Inc., the Provisional Parent Club for the breed within the United Kennel
Club, Inc. Since its formation, the breed has expanded to a worldwide status with AHTs in many
European countries.

                             Notes



There are at least two lines of dogs competing for the breed name American Mastiff; neither is
recognized by any major English-language kennel club.

One line is the dry-mouthed American Mastiff, developed by the Flying W Farms kennel by crossing the
English Mastiff with an Anatolian Shepherd. This resulted in a breed that looks exactly like the English
mastiff but without the drooling that is common in the English Mastiff. This American Mastiff loves
children and are devoted to their families. These are loyal and calm dogs. They are generally
nonaggressive except when their family is threatened. In those instances they become the fierce and
courageous guard dogs that they are.

The second line is sometimes called the Panja American Mastiff, developed by the Panja kennel.

Both lines are very new with not much breed history, making them ineligible for registration in most
breed registries; registries with relaxed requirements may recognize a new breed with minimal history,
such as the Continental Kennel Club's recognition of the Flying W Farms line. Some critics claim that
these are simply crossbred dogs or variants on the standard English Mastiff. It is not clear which line, if
either, will ultimately become a solid breed known as the American Mastiff.

The American Staffordshire Terrier is a breed of dog. These dogs are related to, and were bred to be a
show strain of the American Pit Bull Terrier. American Staffordshire Terriers were first recognized by
the American Kennel Club in 1936. The visual difference between American pit Bull Terriers and
staffies is that you will never find a staffie with a red nose but APBT's come with red and black noses.
To differentiate between blacknose APBT's and Staffies is the white part of the eye should not be visible
on the staffie but it should be visible on the APBT, the only way for the difference to be in effect is that
the dog has to be looking perfectly straight.

                            Notes



The American Staghound is a type of sighthound that is used in hunting to track a variety of game.
Although they have been bred for many years, Staghound is not currently recognized as a dog breed.


Appearance
This is a working dog with long legs, strong muscles and a deep chest. They have excellent eyesight and
above average scent ability to aid in tracking game. They have three recognized coat types, the shag,
slick and broken. They are known to be comparable to the greyhound in speed, but have greater
endurance.

They range in height from 24-30in. (61-77cm.) and weigh between 45-90lbs. (20-41kg.) The females are
slightly smaller in size than the males.

They are known to experience torsion bloat if exercised shortly after eating, but carry no other genetic
health problems. Typical life span is 12-14 years.

Temperament
Staghounds are very calm and affectionate, making wonderful companion dogs in addition to their
tracking abilities. Even with their great size, they are not often trained as watchdogs. They have a high
prey drive and may consider any other animal to be quarry.

They require a great deal of area to run and exercise in, so are not suitable for apartment living. Daily
exercise is necessary to maintain their health and burn off their excess energy.

History
The current American Staghound is a result of unknown breeding between Scottish Deerhound,
greyhound and several other breeds. The staghound appeared with its current characteristics in the
1700s. They were originally bred to hunt predators such as the wolf and coyote. General George Custer
used a staghound in 1846 as part of his hunting pack.

The American Water Spaniel is a gundog breed little known outside North America.
Appearance




                                     American Water Spaniel at work

Weighing 25 to 45 pounds (11-20 kg) and standing 15 to 18 inches (36-46 cm) in height, he has a curly
to marcel coat that is dense and well-suited to resist cold water and inclement weather. The coat's color
is liver, brown, or chocolate. The American Water Spaniel (AWS) should have a rocker-shaped tail and
be somewhat compact in size with well-proportioned features that give the dog an air of balance. Its
head should be broad and spaniel-like with no topknot.

History
The American Water Spaniel originated around the mid-1800s but its true origin is a mystery. Most
experts have come to accept that it was likely developed in the Fox River and Wolf River valleys of
Wisconsin. There is no documentation as to the specific breeds that were used to develop the AWS. Doc
Pfeifer, the man credited with obtaining recognition for the breed in the 1920s, believed that the AWS
was developed by crossing extinct English Water Spaniel and the Field Spaniel. Others have disputed
this claim and it is currently accepted that the breeds involved in the development of the American
Water Spaniel include the English Water Spaniel, Field Spaniel, Curly Coated Retriever, Irish Water
Spaniel, and possibly the Chesapeake Bay Retriever.

The American Water Spaniel was developed as a hunting dog in the market hunting days of America's
history. Hunters needed a dog that could function on land as well as in the marsh and that could easily fit
into a canoe or skiff without taking up much room. The AWS fit the bill and most breed historians note
that Midwest market hunters made wide use of this dog. The AWS was not formally recognized as a
purebred dog until the United Kennel Club did so in 1920, followed by the Field Dog Stud Book in
1938, and finally by the American Kennel Club in 1940.

Having reached its peak of popularity probably sometime in the 1920s and 1930s, the AWS has become
the "Forgotten American" at many times in its history. Still, with the tenacity of spirit that exemplifies
this little brown dog, the breed's enthusiasts have managed to maintain a reasonable population that is
not likely to disappear from the scene any time soon.

Temperament
An American original, this flushing spaniel also doubles as a competent retriever. Like many of the
spaniel breeds, he hunts both feather and fur with equal enthusiasm. Friendly, intelligent, and often
willing to please, this little brown dog has many of the common spaniel characteristics.

The AWS has a mind of its own at times and reaches peak performance with the owner that is dedicated
to teaching the dog just what is expected of it. The breed takes well to training and especially excels at
training that offers some variety rather than rote training drills. Harsh training techniques do not work
for the majority of AWS. In fact, such techniques often cause a dog to become shy or even bite out of
fear. This is a breed for the trainer that is consistent and fair when dealing with the dog.

American Water Spaniels do not have to hunt to be happy. They make fine companion animals and,
because of their size, they fit well in today’s cramped quarters. However, the breed does need exercise
and training to mature into that loving friend that people look for. To avoid possessiveness, excessive
barking, and a willingness to take over the household, novice owners should attend a local obedience
class and set aside daily play time for their companion.

Health
While there is no one health issue that plagues the American Water Spaniel, neither is it free of health
concerns. A variety of problems have cropped up from time to time in the breed including cardiac
abnormalities, cancer, hip dysplasia, diabetes, allergies, hypothyroidism, follicular dystrophy, epilepsy,
and cataracts. All AWS used for breeding should receive health clearances from the Orthopedic
Foundation for Animals for hips, heart, and hypothyroidism as well as an eye clearance from the Canine
Eye Registration Foundation. All reputable breeders offer and supply the puppy buyer with a written
health guarantee covering these more common health concerns.

The Anatolian Shepherd Dog is an ancient breed of dog developed in Anatolia (central Turkey) for
guarding flocks of sheep from wolves, bears, and jackals.

Appearance
The coat can be any color. The Anatolian is a muscular breed, with thick neck, broad head, and sturdy
body. Its lips are somewhat pendulous and it has triangular drop ears. It stands 27 to 32 inches (69 to 81
cm) at the withers and weighs between 80 and 150 pounds (36 to 68 kg), with bitches on the smaller side
and males on the larger side.

Temperament
The Anatolian was developed to be independent and forceful, responsible on its own for guarding its
master's sheep. These traits make it more challenging as a pet; owners of dogs of this breed must
determinedly socialize the dogs to turn them into appropriate companions. They are intelligent and can
learn quickly but might choose not to obey; this is not generally a dog for a beginning or shy owner.
They become very protective of other animals in the household, and will treat them as their "herd".

Health
The Anatolian is somewhat more long-lived than some giant breeds of dogs, with a life expectancy of 10
or 11 years. They reach full maturity, like many large breeds, at around 4 years. They are very sensitive
to processed dog food tending to develop allergic reactions very easily. This can be avoided by feeding
them a diet of lamb and rice.

History
The breed's ancestors most likely migrated to the area now known as Turkey about 1000 AD with
Turkic-speaking people, although it is probable that dogs similar to this existed at least 6,000 years ago
in Mesopotamia. Over the centuries, slight regional variations began to develop, although the dogs were
collectively known as coban kopegi. In the 1970s, breeders began focusing on specific regions and
working on developing standard breeds for each of the regions; the Anatolian is one of those breeds,
coming from central Turkey.
                                 Anatolian Shepherd Dogs are one of the larger breeds; this 7-month-old
Anatolian might not yet be full size.

excels in obedience competitions and Schutzhund.

                           Notes



The Argentine Dogo (Dogo Argentino in Spanish; also known as the Argentinian Mastiff) is a large,
white, muscular dog that was developed in Argentina for big game hunting.


Appearance (UKC)
The Argentine Dogo is a large, white, short-coated dog with a smooth, muscular body, displaying both
power and athletic ability. The length of body is just slightly longer than tall, but bitches may be
somewhat longer in body than dogs. The length of the front leg (measured from point of elbow to the
ground) is approximately equal to one-half of the dog's height at the withers. The head is powerful with
a broad, slightly domed skull and a powerful muzzle that is slightly higher at the nose than the stop,
when viewed in profile. Ears may be cropped, or hang naturally, close to the skull. The relatively short
tail is set low, thick at the base and tapers to a point. The Argentine Dogo should be evaluated as a
hunting dog, and exaggerations or faults should be penalized in proportion to how much they interfere
with the dog's ability to work.

History
In the 1920s in Argentina, Antonio Nores Martinez started breeding a dog intended to not only be a pet
and family guardian, but also a hunting dog capable of taking on big game such as wild boar,peccary
and even jaguars and cougars.

Martinez picked the Cordoba Fighting Dog to be the base for the breed. The breed is extinct today but
was described as a large and ferocious dog that was both a great hunter and fighter. It is believed that the
Cordoba Fighting Dog was developed from Spanish Mastiff, Bull Terrier, Old English Bulldog, and
early Boxer stock.

With 12 Cordoba Fighting Dog bitches as the base, he then crossed :

    ●   Great Dane -For its height (Only harlequins were used)
    ●   Boxer-For the gentle disposition
    ●   English Pointer-For his sharp nose
    ●   Bull Terrier-For its tenacity
    ●   Bulldog
    ●   Great Pyrenees-For its white coat
    ●   Spanish Mastiff-for its quota of power
    ●   Dogue de Bordeaux-For its powerful jaw
    ●   Irish Wolfhound-For its hunting ability and Stamina

He preferred white dogs for hunting as it could easily be seen during the hunt. As a result,only harlequin
Great Danes, white boxers, and white pointers were used. Four Irish Wolfhounds were imported from
the U.S, all of which were descended from show champions. Great Pyrenees also had to be imported
specimens. Some Dogos appear with a black patch on the eye,this is due to Patched bull terriers being
used in breeding.

Martinez kept improving the breed via selective breeding to introduce the traits that were desired. The
first standard for the breed was written in 1928. This is the only molosser breed whose ancestry is
known properly.
Miscellaneous

Working

Argentine Dogos are very accomplished hunters, and are widely used today, mainly in South America.
They are considered to be a working dog, not only for hunting but also as a tracker, as a guard dog, and
for general police work including narcotics detection. They are even occasionally used as a seeing-eye
dog. In Latin America,this is the most popular breed. In Cuba,this is the most popular breed.




                                          Some Dogo Argentino's such as this pup have a black patch on
the eye due to Bull Terrier ancestry.Only a patch on the eye is allowed

Fighting

Dogfighters have picked up on the dogs' capability as a fierce fighter. Dog fighting is forbidden in
Argentina as well as many other countries. Dogos can have an aggressive temperament if not socialized
at an early age, particularly with another dog of the same sex. Argentine Dogos are banned in both
Australia and Great Britain. The dog is one of the four restricted species of dog specifically mentioned
in the United Kingdom's Dangerous Dogs Act 1991.

Movies

        Carlos Sorín's 2005 film "Bombón (el Perro)" 2005, set in Patagonia, finds an unemployed man
        have his luck change after being given a dogo for a good turn, and a fine specimen is shown at
        home and on exhibition.

The French Artois Hound is a dog breed. The dogs are hunters and need exercise and much room to run
around.

They resemble Beagles, but are much larger. The dogs are very powerful, and have extremely muscular
bodies. The dog was nearly extinct at the beginning of the 20th Century, but minimal efforts have
brought the dog back for now. However, they are quite rare at this point.

The Australian Bulldog, also known as the Aussie Bulldog, is a developing dog breed from Australia.
Selective breeding was begun in the 1990s by breeders who wished to create a dog with the look of a
British Bulldog without that breed's inherent health problems. There were two independent breeding
programs, one by Noel and Tina Green (the JAG line) and a separate program by Pip Nobes (the Nobes
Australian Bulldog). These breeders have joined with others and are now coordinating their efforts under
the auspices of the United Aussie Bulldog Association (formed in 2003).

The Australian Silky Terrier is an Australian breed of dog. It is classed in the Toy group in its country
of origin and some other countries, but is classed as a terrier in Europe.


Appearance
The average Australian Silky Terrier is about ten inches at the withers, and weighs about ten pounds. Its
head is longer than that of the Yorkshire Terrier but shorter than that of the Australian Terrier. The coat
is five to six inches long with a silky texture.

Temperament
Notwithstanding that this breed is in the toy group, the Australian National Kennel Council breed
standard specifies that the Australian Silky "should display Terrier characteristics, embodying keen
alertness, activity and soundness".

History
The Silky is generally believed to have developed by crossing the Yorkshire Terrier with the Australian
Terrier in Sydney in the 1890s, but breed historians point out that the Australian Terrier was itself still a
developing breed at the time of the Silky's emergence, and, since no early records were kept (as is the
case with so many dog breeds) it is likely that other crosses occurred as well. There were also breeding
experiments with these crosses in the state of Victoria; it is suggested that Australian and Silky Terriers
were first exhibited at the Melbourne Royal in 1872 as "Broken-coated Terriers, Black and Tan",
however, the breed is not mentioned in The Dog of Australia, Walter Beilby's 1987 book.

Certainly it is documented that whatever the outcrossing, puppies evidencing rough and silky coats
appeared in the same litters at the turn of the 20th Century. The Australian Terrier, Harsh or Silky
coated, was first exhibited at the Sydney Royal Easter Show in 1902.

Different breed standards appeared in the 1920s; in or about 1924 the Kennel Club requested a
designation of Australian Terrier, Hard Coat and Australian Terrier, Soft Coat but the breeders rejected
the proposal.

Before puppies were registered on the Stud Books, a judge was required to inspect litters to determine
which puppies were to be registered as Sydney Silkies, which were Australian Terriers and which were
Yorkshire Terriers.

20th Century canine council legislation brought an end to the crossbreeding; eventually Silky puppies
were intrabred and the breed was stabilized.

The official name for the breed in Australia became the Australian Silky Terrier in 1955. The breed club
was established in 1959.

The Australian Terrier is a small breed of dog in the terrier family.


Appearance
The Australian Terrier stands around 10 inches (25 cm) high at the withers and weighs around 14
pounds (7 kg). It is a low-set dog; the length of its body is longer than its height at the withers. The
Aussie has a high-set tail that is customarily docked.

The head of the Australian Terrier is elongated, with a slight stop and pricked ears. The ANKC breed
standard describes the dog's look as "hard bitten" and "rugged". The eyes are small, dark, and oval and
must have a keen terrier expression. The leather of the nose runs up to the bridge of the muzzle, which is
described as "strong".

The dog's coat is rough or harsh to the touch, with a soft undercoat and a distinctive ruff around the
neck. The breed standard specifies that it should be untrimmed, but some prefer to neaten the dog for the
showring. Acceptable colours are shades of blue or grey with tan face markings, or red.


Temperament
The Aussie should have the personality of a working terrier; its even disposition makes it suitable for a
companion dog.


History
The Australian Terrier was the first native-bred Australian dog to be shown, and the first to be
recognized overseas. Its origins are uncertain, but its immediate ancestor was without doubt developed
in the United Kingdom in the early 1800s from the precursors of today's British and Scottish terriers.
Some of these breeds are now extinct, but the Aussie likely has a mixed ancestry comprising the same
dog types that produced today's Dandie Dinmont, Manchester, Irish, and Cairn terriers.

A new rough-coated terrier was evident in Australia by the late middle-nineteenth century; the
selectively-bred terrier was used for rodent and snake control, as a watchdog, and occasionally for sheep
herding.

The first Broken-coated Terriers were exhibited in Melbourne in 1868 and the Australian Rough-Coated
Terrier Club was founded in Melbourne in 1887. The breed was exhibited as the Australian Terrier,
Rough-Coated in 1899.

Official breed status was granted in the UK in 1933 and in the US in 1960.

                          Notes
The Azawakh is a sight hound dog breed from Africa.


Appearance
Rangy, leggy, lean, and elegant, the Azawakh is extremely high-stationed, taller than it is long. Its back
length should be 90 percent of its leg length to withers (shoulder blades). It has a deep chest, which
should not go below the elbows, and a high tuck/waist.

The breed weighs from 33 to 55 pounds (15-25 kg); its height is 24 to 29 inches (60-74 cm). The coat is
very short and almost absent on the belly. Its bone structure shows clearly through the skin and
musculature. Its muscles lie quite flat, unlike the Greyhound, and in this respect it is closer to the Saluki.

Colours permitted by the FCI breed standard are clear sand to dark fawn/brown, red and brindle (with or
without a dark mask), with white bib, tail tip, and white on all feet (which can be tips of toes to high
stockings). Currently, white stockings that go above the elbow joint are considered disqualifying
features in France, as is a white collar or half collar. Many other colours occur in Africa such as black,
blue fawn (that is, with a lilac cast), grizzle, and blue. The Azawakh in its native land also comes in
particolour. Blue brindle is also found in about 0.5% of the population; this is a normal recessive gene
which again does not meet current FCI standards. The Azawakh’s light, supple, elastic gait is a notable
breed characteristic, as is a 'bouncy gallop'.

Azawakhs need to be well socialised from an early age and should be challenged with new situations.

They are a combination of a sprinter (though not as fast as a Greyhound) and a long distance runner (like
a Saluki). Therefore they need a good to high level of exercise and should have regular runs off lead in
large enclosed areas to run off steam.

Temperament
It manages to balance a close bond with its owner with a strong, almost feline independence. Attentive,
distant, reserved with strangers, the Azawakh is gentle and affectionate with those she accepts.

History
Bred by the Tuareg nomads of the Sahara and sub-Saharan Sahel in the countries of Mali, Niger, and
Burkina Faso, the breed is used there as a guard dog and to hunt gazelle and hare at speeds up to 40
miles per hour. Unlike some other Afro-Asian sighthounds it is more of a pack hunter and they bump
down the quarry with hindquarters when it has been tired out. The Sloughi, by comparison, is more of an
independent lone hunter and has a high hunting instinct.
They are relatively uncommon in Europe and North America but there is a growing band of devotees. It
is not a 'doggy' dog, being very feline in temperamanet and therefore not a good pet for mainstream
owners. However, well socialised and trained, they can be good with cats, children, and strangers. The
breed is not yet registered by CKC or AKC (but is recorded in AKC’s Foundation Stock Service); it is
registered with UKC, ARBA and others.

                            Notes



Bandog is derived from early English and refers to a ferocious large type of dog that was bound by a
chain until it was released at night in order to guard property. The fact that the modern day Bandog is
also large, can be ferocious, and is composed of some Mastiff and some Bulldog, as was the original
Bandog, is all that the Bandog of old and the modern Bandog have in common.

Appearance
The Bandog is a large dog ranging in weight from about 100 to 150 lbs and roughly 26 inches at the
withers.


History
In the early 1970s the late veterinarian, John Swinford D.V.M., began a breeding program, which was
ultimately to produce the greatest of all protection dogs. Though breeders of Bandogs today disagree on
just what breeds went into Swinford's original breeding scheme, the consensus is that it was 50 percent
American Pit Bull Terrier and 50 percent "very large dog". Unfortunately, Swinford died at an early age
and his Bandog was never perfected or recognized as a purebred.

Current breeding

Contemporary Bandogs are bred with different types of dogs, including American Pit Bull Terrier with
either a Mastiff, Neapolitan Mastiff, or Bull Mastiff. Whichever breeding plan is employed, it is
necessary to cross the American Pit Bull Terrier to one of these Mastiffs each time that a litter of
Bandogs is desired.

The obvious question that arises is: why don't breeders simply cross Bandogs with other Bandogs?

The answer is that, at this stage of Bandog development, when one crosses a Bandog to a Bandog, one
does not get a Bandog. Bandogs do not breed true yet and it seems that Bandog breeders are far from
having perfected a purebred dog.

Future

The hope is that the breeding of these dogs will finally be perfected; however, the dog is being bred by
many breeders who range from the very serious and knowledgeable to the very amateurish and
inexperienced, sometimes called backyard breeders. Therefore, a purchaser of a Bandog must do a good
deal of investigation to avoid the risk of buying a puppy that will grow to become the last thing wanted
in a pet.

Miscellaneous

Pit dog

Bandogs are occasionaly used fighting dogs. When a fight between a Pit Bull Terrier and a Bandog
occurs, the Bandog typically dominates the first 10 minutes of the fight as the Pit Bull is overpowered by
the much larger Bandog. If the Pit Bull remains able to continue, it normally reverses the tables with its
better endurance. Some argue that this shows that a 45- to 50-pound Pit Bull is the ideal size for fighting.
Pitbull Neo mixes or Pitbull Tosa mixes are prefferred because thay are more able breeds than the larger,
clumsier English mastiffs.

Guard dog

The non-dogfighter who is in the market for a great family dog that will be an intruder's nightmare can
consider the Bandog.

The Barbet is a medium-sized French gundog.


Appearance
The breed stands 18 to 22 inches (46-56 cm) in height and weighs 33 to 55 pounds (15 to 25 kg). The
Barbet is a prototypic water dog, with a long, woolly coat that is curly or wavy. Colours of the breed are
black, chestnut, fawn, grey, and white, with or without markings; mixed colours are common.

Temperament
The Barbet’s personality is described as companionable, gay, obedient and intelligent. He is a capable
retriever for waterfowl hunting and a faithful companion.
History
The Barbet is thought to be the original source of the various water dog breeds (Poodle, Portuguese
Water Dog, American Water Spaniel, and so on). His actual origin is lost in antiquity but probably stems
from corded herding stock and perhaps griffon hounds. The breed is little known outside of France.

A breed club in the USA is affiliated with the Club des Chiens d'Eau in France and offers a US-based
registry service. The United Kennel Club also registers the breed.

                              Notes



The Bearded Collie or beardie is the traditional dog of the Scottish shepherd.


History
It is difficult to distinguish between fact and legend in looking at the history of a breed, but it is believed
that in the 17th Century the Polish Lowland Sheepdog was bred into the local Scottish dogs, to give the
typical appearance of the working strain of beardie, and that in the 20th Century Old English Sheepdog
may have been bred in to produce the longer coat of the typical show beardie.

The Beardie nearly became extinct; the modern Beardies all originate from the Bothkennar kennel
owned by Mrs Wilison, who began breeding from a small number of remaining working-type Beardies.

The breed became more and more popular over the last half of the 20th century, in part propelled by a
Bearded Collie, "Potterdale Classic at Moonhill", winning Best in Show at Crufts in 1989. The Bearded
Collie Club celebrated its Golden Jubilee year in 2005; where "Bumbleridge Original Oka" (Bred by Sue
Nichols-Ward, Owned by Sue Unsworth & Andy Miller)won the "Most Handsome Bearded Collie"
event.

Working life

The Bearded Collie was used to herd both sheep and cattle. As such it is essentially a working dog, bred
to be hardy and reliable, able to stand up to the harshest conditions, and the toughest sheep. The working
bearded collie became less common in the last few decades and might have died out, but thanks to the
efforts of a relatively few shepherds such as Tom Muirhead and breeders like Brian Plummer the breed
has survived and is becoming more popular. It has been exported to Australia and the United States, and
finds favour among those looking for an independent and intelligent sheep dog. The beardie gained its
epithet of the 'bouncing beardie' because dogs would work in thick undergrowth on the hill, and would
bounce to catch sight of the sheep.

Kazimierz Grabski, a Polish merchant, traded a shipment of grain for sheep in Scotland in 1514, and
brought six Polish Lowland Sheepdogs to move the sheep. A Scottish shepherd was so impressed with
the herding ability of the dogs that he traded a ram and two ewes for a dog and two bitches. These dogs
were bred with the local Scottish dogs to produce the Scottish herding dogs, most obviously the Bearded
Collie. Others believe that the sheep- and guarddog Komondor also was involved in the breed of the
dogs as they appeared when they arrived in Scotland first time.
What everybody seem to agree upon, is that Mrs Willison founded today's breed with the brown bitch
Jeannie of Bothkennar. Jeannie should have been an Old English Sheepdog, but by mistake Mrs
Willison received a Bearded Collie instead. She got so fascinated by the dog, that she wanted to start
breeding. The story goes that she were looking for a mate for her Jeannie, and found him one day she
was walking along the beach! A man was on the edge of emigrating from Scotland, so Mrs Willison
became the owner of the grey Bailie of Bothkennar, as the story goes. These two dogs are what we today
refer to as the founders of the breed as we know it today.

The Beauceron is a herding dog breed from France. He is also known as the Berger de Beauce, the Bas
Rouge, or the French Shorthaired Shepherd.

Appearance
This breed stands 24 to 27.5 inches (61-70 cm) in height and weighs 66 to 85 pounds (30-38.5 kg). His
standard colouring is black and tan, black, or harlequin; other colours (tawny, grey, and grey/black) once
prevalent are now banned by the breed standard. The coat is short, close and smooth, except on legs, tail
and flanks where there is a slight fringe.

Temperament
This muscular and energetic breed is described as intelligent, calm, aloof, and very protective of children.

History
The regional names are misleading since the breed really does not come from Beauce but from Brie;
however, the Briard claimed that regional name first. Although quite different in appearance, both
breeds stem from similar ancestral stock.

Working life

A very versatile breed, the Bas Rouge (“Red Stocking”) was once used to hunt wild boar. It served in
both World Wars as a messenger dog, a supply transport dog, and in detection of mines and rescue of the
wounded. In addition, the Beauceron has strong herding traits and capability.

The Bedlington Terrier is a breed of dog. It is one of many breeds of terrier and is named after the
mining town of Bedlington, Northumberland in North East England.

Appearance
The Bedlington Terrier is often described as looking like a lamb, probably because it has fur with a linty
texture. This is a nonshedding coat. Born blue, sandy, or liver, all as solid colours or with tan markings,
these colours become paler when the dog becomes an adult.

The head is wedge-shaped with sparkling eyes. Although it looks meek when reclining on the couch, the
Bedlington Terrier is argumentative and every inch a terrier when aroused. His body shape is unusual for
a terrier, being somewhat like a Greyhound or Whippet in construction, which enables him to gallop at
great speed. However, his front legs are constructed differently from coursing hounds in that his front
legs are closer together at the feet than at the elbows. This enables him to turn or pivot quickly when
chasing quarry at high speed. At a trot, the Bedlington moves with a 'mincing' gait, picking its feet up in
what appears to be a dainty manner.

History
The original name of this breed of dog was the Rothbury Terrier after a town, like Bedlington, in
Northumberland. The Rothbury Terriers were bred by gypsies in the Rothbury Forest near the border
with Scotland. The Bedlington Terrier, which was first shown in Bedlington in 1870, is likely to have
come from the Rothbury Terrier. Unlike other Terriers, the Bedlington's quarry—hare and rabbits—
lived above ground, which is why a galloping or coursing breed was useful. In addition, this breed was
used for dog fighting at one time.

The first Bedlington Terrier club was formed in 1877.

The Bergamasco is a breed of dog with its origins in the Italian Alps, where it was originally used as a
herding dog.


Appearance
The breed's most distinctive feature is the unusual matted coat which is a normal and healthy
characteristic of the breed. Bergamascos are born with short, smooth fur, which slowly develops the
characteristic mats as the dog grows. In adulthood the mats may reach as low as the dog's paws.

The Berger Blanc Suise, more commonly known as the White German Shepherd was often
considered a mutation of the German Shepherd Dog, until recently when it was finally considered a
separate breed after years of campaigning from White Shepherd enthusiasts. Currently, this breed is only
recognised by the FCI and the UKC, but more efforts are being made to give the breed worldwide
recognition as a separate and distinct breed from the GSD.

Appearance
The Berger Blanc Suisse is descended from the German Shepherd Dog, and has nearly the same
standard, excepting the colour of its coat. To differentiate the Dog from an albino, each member of the
breed should have dark eyes and nails and black pigmentation on the: lips, eyelids, pads of the feet and
nose. Black, blue or gray skin is preferable.

                            Notes



The Bernese Mountain Dog (also called Berner Sennenhund or Bouvier Bernois) is a versatile cattle-
herding or farm dog originating in the canton of Berne in Switzerland.


Appearance
A tri-colored dog of medium size, the “Berner” (as his friends often call him) stands 23 to 27.5 inches
(58-70 cm) at the withers; breed standards for this breed normally specify no weight, but the usual range
is 70 to 110 pounds (32-50 kg). The breed is instantly recognised by its distinctive tricolour pattern:
body, neck, legs, cranium and ears black; cheeks, stockings and eyespots rich tan, toes, chest, muzzle,
tail tip and blaze between the eyes white. The pattern is rigid and varies only slightly in the amount of
white. A perfectly-marked individual gives the impression of a white “Swiss cross” on the chest, when
viewed from the front in sitting position. The eyes are an expressive dark brown.

Grooming

The Bernese coat is slightly rough in outline, but not at all harsh in texture. The undercoat is fairly
dense; the coat is quite dirt and weather resistant. A good brushing every week or two is sufficient to
keep it in fine shape, except when the undercoat is being shed; then daily combing is in order for the
duration of the shed.

Temperament
Berners are outdoor dogs at heart, though well-behaved in the house; they need activity and exercise, but
do not have a great deal of endurance. They can move with amazing bursts of speed for their size when
motivated; stray cats and similar intruders must beware of the Berner!

The Berner temperament is a strong point of the breed. Affectionate, loyal, faithful, stable and
intelligent, Bernese Mountain Dogs make wonderful family pets. They are very trainable provided the
owner is patient and consistent in training; Berners need time to think things through. Although the
breed is stable in temperament, patient and loving, a Berner who has really lost his temper is a fearsome
thing; given cause for attack they are swift, powerful and efficient. It is said that the breed is descended
from the molossus war dogs of the Roman legions; anyone who has witnessed an angry Berner will have
no trouble believing that story.




                                              Female and male Bernese Mountain Dogs

Health
The breed’s genetic base is somewhat narrow, so hereditary diseases and inbreeding depression are
major issues. Several kinds of cancer (malignant histiocytosis, mastocytoma, lymphosarcoma,
fibrosarcoma, osteosarcoma) commonly affect Berners; hip dysplasia, elbow dysplasia, osteoarthritis,
plus autoimmune and kidney problems are other major health issues for the breed. Many litters contain
stillborn young, a major indicator of inbreeding depression.

Although slow to mature, the Berner is not particularly long-lived. The Swiss say, “three years a young
dog, three years a good dog, and three years an old dog.” Today even nine years may be slightly
optimistic; certainly a ten-year-old Berner is a very old one. In fact, surveys around the world show that
the average lifespan is seven years, primarily as a result of the prevalent occurrence of cancers.

History
The breed originated in Swiss farm villages where it was used as a cowherd, a draught dog to haul carts
containing milk cans and farm goods, and a flock guardian. It nearly disappeared in the late 1800s but
was rescued around the turn of the century by a determined Swiss cynologist, Herr Franz Schertenleib.

                             Notes



A Bichon Frisé (French, literally Curly lap dog; often spelled Bichon Frise in English) is a small dog
that is the size of a large domestic cat. They are popular pets, similar to poodles. The Bichon Frisé is the
best known member of the bichon family of dogs.


Appearance




Bichons weigh between 7 and 18 lb (3 to 8 kg) and stand 9 to 12 inches (23 to 30 cm) at the withers.
They have curly, soft, white fur that must be groomed regularly and carefully to maintain a neat
appearance and avoid matting. Professional grooming is recommended to achieve your best looking
Bichon. Their tails are usually left longer in length, and carried curled over their backs. Black eyes,
nose, and lips provide a striking contrast to the all-white fur. Often times, Bichons appear to be smiling.

Bichons do not shed their fur, as a result these dogs are one of the hypoallergenic dog breeds popular to
people with allergies. Though they are not nonallergenic, it is still possible to have an allergic reaction to
a dog of this breed, it is simply less likely than it would be with some other breeds.

Temperament
Bichons are intelligent little dogs and demonstrate an inquisitive personality. They are very energetic
and enjoy going for long walks, climbing on furniture, and chewing bones. However, Bichons are most
comfortable being close to their owners regardless of the activity, and enjoy lounging as lap dogs.
Bichons are easily housebroken using the crate method, but males tend to be a bit easier to train than
females. They may become territorial, and sometimes jealous of attention given to other household
animals, but generally get along well with other dogs (particularly other Bichons). Bichons are
extremely friendly dogs and are easily excited when encountering people. There is a mutual fondness
between Bichons and children, and therefore they make great pets for families. The Bichon Frise
exhibits a trait called the "Bichon Buzz" - suddenly the Bichon will put its ears back, start growling and
run feverishly around in obstacle-course fashion for a few moments.
Health
Although many all-white breeds suffer from a variety of ailments including ear infections and skin
problems, Bichons have, for the most part, escaped these problems. Bichons live an average of 12 to 14
years.

Care must be taken to keep the face of a Bichon Frisé clean and trimmed, as eye discharge and mucus
tend to accumulate in the fur that grows in front of their eyes. Bichons do not tolerate the heat well. It is
not unusual for members of this breed to have problems with luxating patellas and cataracts.


History




                                                 An unbrushed bichon frise.

The breed has existed since the Middle Ages. Its exact origins are uncertain, although it is fairly clear
that they originated in the Mediterranean region. Sailors had transported it to the island of Tenerife by
the 14th century. They were further bred as lap dogs for the French royalty and were a court favorite by
the 15th century. The dogs ended up on the streets during the French Revolution, where they were
caught and trained to be circus dogs.

They are a versatile, intelligent, and hardy dog despite popular use as a companion animal and lap dog;
farmers in Norway have recently used the Bichon for rounding up sheep, which is not a commonly
mentioned breed use.

The Biewer is a rare breed of toy dog.


History
The breed is seldom found outside Germany, its country of origin. The breed was first imported into the
USA in 2003.

Breed recognition

Biewer fanciers are working towards recognition of the breed in the United States. The IABCA was a
member of the German organization who had approved the Biewer in Germany, so the first Biewer
puppy was shown in the US in June of 2003. The first Best In Show for the Biewer in the USA took
place in November of 2003.

A National Breed Club was formed for the Biewer in the USA in 2003 and is known as the American
Biewer Club (ABC). This club was the first club formed in the USA to support the breed as it was
originally bred for using the original Biewer lines. The ABC abides by the German Breed standard and
supports the original German Biewer Club.

As a very new breed, there remains some controversy over whether the Biewer is a completely separate
breed or is simply a colour variation of the Yorkshire Terrier. The Biewer is not currently recognized by
any of the major international kennel clubs.

a guard dog. It is rare outside its native country and is just starting to be recognized elsewhere; for
example, it is one of the AKC's most-recently recognized breeds, gaining full status in July of 2004.

Appearance
Male Black Terriers are bigger and more massive than bitches; the male stands 25-29 inches (64-74 cm)
at the withers compared to the bitch's 25-28 inches (64-72 cm) with a tolerance of 1.3 inches (3 cm) or
more if the dog is well proportioned. The breed weighs 80 to 143 pounds (36-65 kg)

The Black and Tan Coonhound is a breed of dog bred to hunt raccoon. They are also widely used for
hunting bear and cougar.

Appearance
The breed standard for Black & Tan Coonhounds is as follows:

    ●   Eyes are hazel to brown
    ●   Ears extend past the tip of the nose
    ●   Their black and tan markings are similar to the Doberman Pinscher and the Rottweiler but have
        key distinguishing differences from these breeds. The most prominent are the long tails and ears,
        and their loud, baying bark.

    ●   23 to 27 inches (58 to 68 cm) at the shoulder
    ●   8 to 10 inches (20 to 25 cm) head (back of skull to tip of nose)
    ●   65 to 100 (29 to 45 kg) pounds
    ●   Males are typically larger and heavier boned than females.

History
In 1945, the Black & Tan became the only one of the six varieties of Coonhound to be recognized in the
Hound Group by the American Kennel Club. The Redbone Coonhound and the Plott Hound have since
been recognized in the Miscellaneous Class. The other three varieties of Coonhound are the Bluetick
Coonhound, the English Coonhound, and the Treeing Walker Coonhound.

The Bluetick Coonhound is a breed of dog. They are a type of coonhound and are typically bred in
Louisiana.
History
The origins of this breed can be traced back to the Bleu Gascogne French hounds. The breed was first
registered in the United Kennel Club in 1946 as a separate breed, but originally fell under the English
Foxhound and Coonhound. The breed is also recognised by the Australian National Kennel Council and
the New Zealand Kennel Club. Breeders have started the process of obtaining recognition from the
American Kennel Club.

Appearance
Preferred color of the Bluetick is a dark blue, thickly mottled body, spotted by various shaped black
spots on back, ears and sides. Preference running to more blue than black on body. Head with black
predominant, also ears. Tan dots over eyes and on cheeks with a dark red ticking on feet and lower legs
below body line, on chest and below tail. Red may be eliminated as to the desire of the breeder, as well
as the tan head coloring and amount of black on body. A majority of blue mottled body preferred to
lighter ticking over the body. The amount of blue ticking should control over the amount of white in the
body coat. Off colors not allowed.

Miscellaneous
A Bluetick Coonhound named "Smokey" is the official athletic mascot of the University of Tennessee.

   Listed as an "emerging breed" by the Kennel Union of
                     Southern Africa.

A Boerboel is a large, mastiff type dog breed from South Africa. The word boerboel is Afrikaans for
"farmer's dog".

"They are obedient, intelligent, self-assured and bred to have an extremely strong guard-dog instinct.
Perhaps surprisingly, this does not make the dog a vicious unsociable animal, because the Boerboel was
in constant proximity to the farmers and their children, a badly behaved or aggressive dog was
unacceptable and would, perhaps rather harshly, have been put down. This very selective and practical
breeding ethic has created a loving pet with an even temperament that is happiest in a family
environment for which he can put his protective instincts into action when required."¹


Appearance
The ideal height for male Boerboels is from 64 to 70 cm (24 to 27 inches) at the withers. The height for
bitches is usually 59 to 65 cm (23 to 26 inches).

Temperament
Boerboels are intelligent, reliable, and obedient, with a strong watchdog instinct. They are self-assured
and fearless, but responsive to the needs of the family.

A Borderjack is the crossbred product of a Border Collie and a Jack Russell Terrier. These intelligent,
high- energy dogs are often bred for use as height dogs in the dog sport of flyball. In flyball, the shortest
dog on the team determines the jump height. The best Borderjacks combine the speed, intelligence,
intensity and focus of the Border collie with the size, smarts and tenacity of the Jack Russell. They are
definitely not stay at home dogs. A Borderjack requires the stimulation of training for its mental health
and intense daily exercise to provide and outlet for its apparently boundless energy.

                            Notes



The Borzoi is a breed of dog also called the Russian Wolfhound. They have medium-length, slightly
curly hair and are similar in shape to Greyhounds. They are a member of the sighthound family.


Appearance
Borzois can come in almost any color or color combination. Their coat is silky, flat and should never be
wooly. This breed is a large variety with males reaching in excess of 100 pounds (45 kg). Males should
stand at least 28 inches while females shouldn't be less than 26 inches.

Temperament
The Borzoi is an intelligent, active dog. They are gentle with people and have good manners but
sometimes are nervous around children. Although it is brutal against wolves, the Borzoi is a brave dog
that will try to dominate many other breeds, but lacks the body weight and the strength to combat a
mastiff or similar hefty breed. Even now, young Borzois at play sometimes spontaneously join forces
against another dog, seizing it by the neck and holding it immobile.

Health
The most common health problems are progressive retinal atrophy and gastric torsion. Life expectancy
is 10 to 12 years.

History
Tradition says that they were brought to Russia by Kublai Khan. Although this might be true, the
original Borzoi stock was crossed with different Russian herding dogs, which explains the breed's ability
to deal with wolves—this was an important part of a herding dog's work in the past, when wolves were
more common.

Borzois were popular with the Tsars before the 1917 revolution, and for a long time Borzois could not
be purchased but only given as gifts from the Tsar. The most famous breeder was the Russian Grand
Duke Nikolai Nikolaievich, (son of Nicholas I of Russia), who bred hundreds of Borzois at Perchino, his
private kennel. During Tsarist times, several varieties of wolfhounds were bred; however, after the
revolution, many of the Tsarist breeds were neglected.
During that time, Russians also performed "hunting tests", to show that Borzois could actually hold a
wolf until the hunter arrived. The wolf hunt itself was organized with riding hunters and Foxhounds on
the Russian steppe. When the wolf was sighted, the hunter would release a pair of Borzois. The Borzois
would charge the wolf, attack its neck from both sides, and hold it until the hunter arrived. The classical
killing was by the human hunter with a knife.

The Bosnian Tornjak is a dog breed native to central Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is a mountain sheep
dog, found specifically in the Travnik region. It is part of the "Tornjak" race of dogs, which is split into
the Croatian Tornjak and the Bosnian Tornjak. The Bosnian Tornjak typically has stronger bones, and a
better highlighted difference between the sexes.

                             Notes



The Boston Terrier is a breed of dog originating in the United States of America.


Appearance
Boston Terriers are typically small, compactly built, well proportioned, dogs with erect ears, short tails,
and a short muzzle that should be free of wrinkles. Boston terriers can weigh from 10 to 25 lb, typically
in the vicinity of 15 lb. The breed is known for its gentle, alert, and intelligent expression.

The Boston Terrier is characteristically marked with white in proportion to either black, brindle, seal, or
a combination of the three. Seal is a color specifically used to describe Boston Terriers and is defined as
a black color with red highlights when viewed in the sun or bright light. Ideally white should cover its
chest, muzzle, band around the neck, half way up the forelegs, up to the hocks on the rear legs, and a
white blaze between but not touching the eyes. In the show ring, symmetrical markings are preferred.
Due to the Boston Terrier's markings resembling formal wear, in addition to its refined and pleasant
personality, the breed is commonly referred to as the "American Gentleman."

Frequently, variations on the standard are seen depending on the ancestry of the individual dog. At
various times, the English Bulldog, English Mastiff, Staffordshire Bull Terrier, and French Bulldog—
among other breeds—have been crossbred with Boston Terrier lines to minimize inbreeding in what is
necessarily a small gene pool.

Temperament
                                 Young Boston Terrier pup with black coat and white markings

Bred for companionship, the modern Boston Terrier can be gentle, alert, and well-mannered; however
they may be difficult to potty train in the beginning. They're known to be quite rambunctious, with a
sense of humor. Some Bostons enjoy having another one for companionship. Both females and males
generally bark only when necessary. Having been bred as a companion dog, they enjoy being around
people, and if properly socialized get along well with children, other canines, and non-canine pets.
Boston Terriers can be very cuddly, while others are more independent. Some Boston Terriers have an
excitable or dominant temperament that requires special training and handling by the owner. Some are
aggressive towards other dogs and some dogs are just attached to one person. Boston Terriers do not
typically realize that they are small animals and are not afraid to confront larger dogs or other animals.

Health
Several health issues are of concern in the Boston Terrier: cataracts (both juvenile and adult type),
cherry eye, luxating patellas, deafness, heart murmur, and allergies. Curvature of the back, called
roaching, might be caused by patella problems with the rear legs, which in turn causes the dog to lean
forward onto the forelegs. This might also just be a structural fault with little consequence to the dog.
Many Bostons cannot tolerate excessive heat and humidity due to the shortened muzzle, so hot weather
brings the danger of heat exhaustion.

History
The Boston Terrier breed originated around 1870, when Robert C. Hooper of Boston purchased a dog
known as Hooper's Judge, a cross between an English Bulldog and a white English Terrier. The English
White Terrier as a breed is currently thought to be extinct. In 1893, the American Kennel Club (AKC)
admitted the Boston Terrier breed and gave the club membership status—making it the first American
breed to be recognized.

Miscellaneous
Rhett the Boston Terrier is the well-known mascot of Boston University.

In 1979, the state legislature recognized the Boston Terrier as the state dog of Massachusetts.

                            Notes



Boxers are a breed of stocky, medium-sized, short-haired dog with a smooth fawn or brindled coat and
square-jawed muzzle. Boxers have very strong jaws and a powerful bite.

History
The ancestors of this breed were the German Bullenbeisser, a dog of Mastiff decent, and the English
Bulldog. The Bullenbeisser had been working as a hunting dog for centuries, employed in the pursuit of
bear, wild boar, and deer. Its task was to seize the prey and hold it until the hunters arrived. In later
years, faster dogs were favoured and the Bullenbeisser grew smaller and was then called the Brabanter.

In the late 19th century, the Brabanter was crossed with an English Bulldog to start the line that would
become the modern Boxer. In 1894, three Germans by the name of Roberth, Konig, and Hopner decided
to stabilise the breed and put it on exhibition at a dog show. This was done in Munich in 1895, and the
next year they founded the first Boxer Club.

The breed was introduced to other parts of Europe in the late 1800s and to the United States around the
turn of the century. The American Kennel Club (AKC) recognised the first Boxer champion in 1915.

During World War I, the Boxer was co-opted for military work, acting as a valuable messenger dog,
pack-carrier, attack dog, and guard dog.

It was not until after World War II that the Boxer became popular around the world. Boxer mascots,
taken home by returning soldiers, introduced the dog to a much wider audience and it soon became a
favourite as a companion animal, as a show dog, and as a guard dog.

The name "Boxer" is supposedly derived from this breed of dog beginning a fight by standing on its two
hind legs and "boxing" with its two front paws.

Appearance
                   Three-month-old fawn Boxer puppy with uncropped ears

An adult boxer typically weighs between 25 and 32 kg (55 and 70 lb). Adult male boxers are between 57
and 63 cm (23 to 25 in.) tall at the withers; adult female are between 53 and 60 cm (21 to 23 ½ in.).
Cropping of the tail remains popular, although cropping the ears is now prohibited in most European
breed standards and is slowly becoming banned in many other countries.

In color, boxers are typically either fawn or brindled with a white underbelly and white on the front or
all four feet. The whiteness, called 'flashiness,' often extends onto the shoulders or face. Conversely,
some brindled boxers are so dark as to appear black. In the UK, fawn boxers are typically richer in color
and are called "Red".

Some boxers are entirely white. Contraty to popular opinion, white boxers are neither albino (lacking
pigment in the skin and eyes), nor rare. Some studies indicate that as many as 25% of all boxers are
white.

Boxers have a severe underbite, and as a result, their lower row of teeth can get caught in their jowls.

Temperament

                                 A one-year-old brindle and a 2-month-old fawn Boxer.

The character of the Boxer is of the greatest importance and demands the most careful attention. He is
renowned from olden times for his great love and faithfulness to his master and household, his alertness,
and fearless courage as a defender and protector. The Boxer is docile but distrustful of strangers. He is
bright and friendly in play but brave and determined when roused. His intelligence and willing
tractability, his modesty, and cleanliness make him a highly desirable family dog and cheerful
companion. He is the soul of honesty and loyalty. He is never false or treacherous even in his old age.

Boxers are a bright, energetic and playful breed and tend to be very good with children. It's best if
obedience training is started early since they also have a strong personality and therefore can be harder
to train when older. It is also equally true that Boxers have a very long puppyhood and adolescence.
They are not considered fully mature until age three, one of the longest times in dogdom, and thus need
the early training to keep their high energy from wearing the owner out. Boxers have unfairly earned a
slight reputation of being 'headstrong'; no doubt due to some poorly obedience-trained examples of
Boxers.

Attitude to:

Owners: Affectionate, devoted.
Children: Playful, exuberant (may be too much for very young children).
Other Pets: Good if raised with them.
Strangers: Protective of their family, Friendly if well socialised.
Unfamiliar Dogs: Can be problematic unless well socialised.
(Bailey 231)

Health
       Main articles: Dog health

Boxers can develop "cancers, progressive retinal atrophy, torsion (bloat), epilepsy, bleeding disorders,
intestinal problems" (Bailey 37), heart murmurs and ailments of the joints, such as arthritis and hip
dysplasia, although most good breeders test their breeding stock before breeding and the incidence is
slowly decreasing. White boxers have a tendency to develop deafness at a rate much higher than other
boxers. Some studies indicate 30-40% of all white boxers are deaf in one or both ears. Since white
boxers are not albinos but simply have a white coat, they have no added risk of skin cancer as compared
to other boxers.

Uses

Boxers are friendly, lively companions that are often used as family dogs, although they are also used as
guard dogs. They also sometimes appear at dog agility trials and flyball. Before dog fighting was made
illegal, Boxers were often used in dog fights. These strong and intelligent animals have even been
sometimes used as guide dogs for the blind and police dogs in K9 units in place of the typical German
Shepherd.

                           Notes



The Boykin Spaniel is a medium sized breed of dog and a member of the Spaniel family. It is the state
dog of South Carolina and its original purpose was to flush and retrieve game. In New York City, the
Boykin is particularly rare, and with its natural cockatoo/bouffant hair style, leading in time to bangs
over the eyes, it is always the centre of attention.

Appearance
Slightly larger than the English Cocker Spaniel (about 17 inches high and a weight over 30 pounds) with
more feathering, its coat colour comes only in liver. Traditionally, its tail is cropped at the age of three
days, to stop wagging during hunting.

History
The name comes from Mr. Whitt Boykin, who lived near Spartanburg, South Carolina, and who was its
first trainer. But the dog was originally found in 1911, outside a Methodist church after service. Looking
terribly bedraggled, he was named "Dumpy", but showed some aptitude for hunting, which the breed
still does.

It was apparently bred (with a dog named Singo) with its brown coat for camouflage.

Temperament
The breed is a definite working dog with ideal retriever instincts, enthusiasm, and endurance. The
personality is ever-bright, it easily substitutes ball retrieving for turkey retrieving, and will swim with
agility in any aquatic environment.

It is excellent with children (better, some say, than its cousin Cocker Spaniel) and is an instinctive
swimmer.

The Brazilian Terrier is one of only two breed of dog developed in Brazil. It is one of several terriers
probably descended from the combining of the Fox Terrier with other small breeds.


Appearance
This terrier stands between 14-16 inches at the withers. Its appearance is typical of dogs descended from
fox terrier types: the short coat is tri-colour (white with markings in two other colours; permissible
colours are black, tan, brown and blue). The skull is flat and wedge-shaped, with folded ears. The tail
may be docked or natural.


Temperament
Brazilian Terriers are alert, intelligent and playful with stronger than average hunting instincts. They
should not be left alone with small animals. They must be kept active and occupied, becoming
destructive or restless if bored.

                             Notes



The Brittany is a breed of gun dog that is primarily bred for bird hunting. Although the dog is often
referred to as a spaniel, the breed's working characteristics are more akin to a pointer or setter.


Appearance
Brittanys are mostly white with orange or liver spots. Individuals can have spots in combinations of
these colors. Some individuals also have black spots but this is contrary to breed standard. The coat is of
moderate length, dense, flat, or wavy, with slight feathering on the ears and legs. Too much feathering is
undesirable as it impedes the dog’s work in thick brush. The breed standard calls for a dog weighing
between 30 and 40 pounds (13 to 18 kg) and standing 17½ to 20½ inches (44 to 52 cm). The dog is
squareish when viewed from the side, with shoulder height equaling body length (from withers to base
of tail). Show dogs have their tails docked in some countries. The tails of working or companion dogs
are rarely left long.

Temperament
The breed is noted for being easy to train, sensitive, and sweet-natured. Many enthusiasts agree that it
takes little more than a stern look or cross word to chastise a Brittany. As a consequence, care must be
taken during training so as not to break the dog’s spirit. Brittanys are excellent with children but they are
an exuberant breed and if not well supervised may accidentally harm a small child. A Brittany may also
consider the family cat to be 'game', but note that a Brittany wants to 'retrieve' the cat, not harm it.
Brittanys get along well with other dogs and enjoy working with other dogs as a team. Many Brittany
enthusiats encourage new Brittany owners to be a two dog family. The dogs are active and require
frequent exercise and room to run. As pets Brittanys are first-rate companion dogs but they do need
plenty of exercise. Their outgoing nature makes them poor candidates for protectors, however a Brittany
will always alert their owner when someone be it friend or foe approaches the front door!

History
As the name implies, Brittanys were developed in the Brittany province of France in the 1800s.

Training, method of work

Brittanys are happiest when hunting but make no mistake, Brittanys are excellent companion dogs and
can be wonderful family pets. See the related sections in the gun dog article for details.

The Bull Terrier (Miniature) is exactly what the name suggests, a Bull Terrier in miniature. This breed
of dog was developed using selective breeding from the larger breed.

In the early 1900s, the difference between the breeds was determined by the dog's weight. However, this
led to Miniature Bull Terriers becoming so small and fine that they looked more like a Chihuahua than a
Bull Terrier. So, in the 1970s, the weight limit was replaced with a height limit of under fourteen inches.

 Progenitor to the Bull Terrier and Staffordshire Bull Terrier

Bull and Terrier is a breed of dog.


History
The Bull and Terrier is a cross between the Old English Bulldog and the Old English Terrier. The
anatomy of the Bull and Terrier is the result of selective breeding for the purpose of dog fighting and
baiting.

Dog fighting

The Old English Bulldog was bred for bull-baiting. Its life depended on "Go Low, Pin and Hold". Such a
breed was unsuitable for fighting other dogs in the pit. Once an Old English Bulldog got a good grip,
there would be little left for the spectators to see, except for two dogs gripping each other, closing their
jaws tighter and tighter.

Required were quick attacks, new grips, and tricks, which made up the drama of a dog fight that
appealed to spectators, gamblers, and dog owners. The introduction of English Terrier blood provided
longer legs, fiery temperament, and speed, which provided entertaining fights.

The crossing of bulldog and terrier produced a dog that no longer belonged to either foundation breed.
The new breed was called the Bull and Terrier. With attributes such as ferociousness, aggressiveness,
and intelligence, there were few fighting tasks it could not perform better than other breeds of those
times.

Progenitor

In 1835, with the banning of baiting the breed was placed in jeopardy of extinction; however, while bull-
baiting and bear-baiting laws were enforced, dog fighting flourished, so the Bull and Terrier lived on.
Around 1860, the Bull and Terrier breed split into two branches, the pure white Bull Terrier and the
coloured forms that lived on for another seventy years in the dog pit until they finally were recognized
as a legitimate dog breed called the Staffordshire Bull Terrier.


Famous Bull and Terriers

Billy




                            Billy

A celebrated Bull and Terrier named "Billy", weighing approximately 26 pounds, had a proud rat-baiting
career crowned on April 22, 1823, when a world record was set with a hundred rats killed in five-and-a-
half minutes.

Dustman




                           Dustman

In 1812, Sporting Magazine described "Dustman" as a very famous and talented fighting dog, which
represented the optimal Bull and Terrier type.

Trusty




                           Trusty

According to accounts in the Sporting Magazine from the year 1804, a Bull and Terrier named "Trusty"
was just as famous throughout England as the Emperor Napoleon. Trusty went undefeated in one
hundred and four dog fights.

                            Notes



The Bullmastiff is a powerful dog, said to be a cross between the Mastiff and the Bulldog. Originally
bred to find and immobilise poachers, the breed has proved its value as a family pet.

Appearance
This breed resembles the Boerboel and English Mastiff or a larger version of the Boxer. It is powerfully
built and symmetrical, showing great strength, but not cumbersome; it is sound and active.

Size

The Bullmastiff is a relatively large dog. The American Bullmastiff Association standard calls for dogs
to be between 25 and 27 in (635 and 686 mm) tall at the withers and between 110 and 130 lb (50 and 60
kg) though current judging trends often favour a dog slightly larger than this. Bitches are to be between
23 and 26 in (600 to 650 mm) tall and 100 to 120 lb (45 to 55 kg). Some dams make good mothers, but
elective Caesarian sections are common, and most breeding is quite costly as a result. An average litter
size is about six, but as few as one and as many as ten are not unheard of.

Colour

Any shade of brindle, fawn, or red is allowed as long as the colour is pure and clear. The fawn is a light
tan or blond color, while the red is a richer, red-brown. This can range from a deep red to a light red
merging with the fawn sometimes described as a red-fawn. A slight white marking on the chest is
permissible, but other white markings are undesirable. A black muzzle is essential, toning off towards
the eyes, with dark markings around eyes contributing to the expression.

History

Working life

With its handsome, powerful appearance and superb speed coupled with strength and endurance, it can
overtake and capture intruders without mauling them. These traits make the Bullmastiff appear to be an
excellent choice for a guard dog; however, a stubborn streak makes the animal somewhat resistant to
obedience training and they can be overly protective of its human family. Due to this, the breed has been
overtaken by others, more popular as guard dogs. Bred to sneak up on poachers, the Bullmastiff often
barks much less than other breeds, but when they bark they will make your head turn, as it is dark and
hollow sounding. The Bullmastiff was recognised as a pure-bred dog in 1924 by the English Kennel
Club. In October, 1933, The American Kennel Club recognised the Bullmastiff. The foundation
breeding was 60% Mastiff and 40% Bulldog (which was more like the American Bulldog not the short
English Bulldog of today).

Dog attacks

This dog was popularized by the media in Canada in the late 1990s as being the breed of dog in a string
of (unrelated) dog attacks against children. The proposal to ban the breed in Canada started a small
uprising and the measure ultimately failed.

Bullmastiffs are sometimes crossbred with Pit Bulls for strength.The offspring are known as
Pitbuulmastiffs and nowadays,purebred pitbullmastiffs are available. Bullmastiffs are also crossed with
Rottweilers to improve trainability.

Bully Kutta is a breed of dog.


Appearance
Bully Kutta males reach a height of 30 to 42 inches and 30 to 36 inches for bitches. They weigh between
150 to 170 pounds and can reach upwards of 200 pounds.

Temperament
Due to the nature of the work these dogs are bred to perform, they are known to be human aggressive
and difficult to handle, but with proper socialization from an early stage they can become superb
protectors and guardians.

History
The Bully Kutta was developed during the British Colonial rule in India for sporting purposes. It is
mostly found today in areas belonging to Pakistan. Though in the past it has been used by criminal gangs
for dog fighting, which is illegal in Pakistan, the majority are pets or used as guard dogs.

                             Notes



The Cairn Terrier is a breed of dog of the terrier category. It is one of the oldest terriers, originating in
the Scottish Highlands, used for hunting burrowing prey among the cairns.

Appearance
Cairns stand between 9 and 13 inches (23-33 cm) at the withers and weigh 13 to 18 pounds (6 to 8 kg).
European Cairns tend to be larger than American Cairns and, because puppy mills do not care about
breed standards, many Cairns available today are much smaller or much larger than the breed standard.
Cairns that have had puppy-mill backgrounds can weigh as little as 7 pounds or as much as 27 pounds.

The Cairn Terrier has a harsh, weather-resistant outer coat that can be cream, wheaten, red, sandy, gray,
or brindled in any of these colors. Pure black, black and tan, and white are not permitted by many kennel
clubs. While registration of white Cairns was once permitted, after 1917 the American Kennel Club
required them to be registered as West Highland White Terriers. A notable characteristic of Cairns is
that brindled Cairns frequently change color throughout their lifetime. It is not uncommon for a brindled
Cairn to become progressively more black or silver as it ages. The Cairn is double-coated, with a soft,
dense undercoat and a harsh outer coat. A well-groomed Cairn has a rough-and-ready appearance, free
of artifice or exaggeration.

Temperament
Cairn Terriers are intelligent, strong, loyal and fearless. Like most terriers, they are stubborn and strong-
willed, and love to dig after real or imagined prey. Cairn Terriers have a strong prey instinct and will
need comprehensive training. However, they are highly intelligent and, although very willful, can be
trained. Although it is often said that they are disobiedient, this is not the case provided correct training
is applied. They are excellent with children and make wonderful family dogs. These are working dogs
and are still used as such in parts of Scotland. Like most terriers, they require large amounts of exercise.

Health
These dogs are generally healthy but many have allergies. Often the allergies take the form of skin
conditions. Corn is often the culprit, so an owner of a Cairn Terrier should routinely try to avoid feeding
foods and treats that contain corn. Even if the Cairn does not show symptoms of corn allergy, because
corn allergies are so prevalent and can show up at any time in the life of the dog, it is recommended to
avoid corn even with a healthy dog.
This breed also suffers more than usual from dislocated kneecaps and inherited eye diseases. Ocular
Melanosis (OM) is an eye disease that is found almost exclusively in Cairns.

Health problems are more common with US strains. UK Cairns tend to be less highly bred and less
susceptible to most of the listed problems.

Miscellaneous
The dog named Toto in the 1939 screen adaptation of The Wizard of Oz is a Cairn Terrier.

The Canaan Dog is a breed of dog that has existed in the Middle East for centuries.


Appearance
The Canaan Dog comes in more colors than almost all other registered breeds. Its shape, body type, and
size can vary widely, but the dogs are generally of medium size and often black and white. Other
possible colors include tan, golden, or cream. Their bodies are generally lean with a distinctive shape.

Males are distinctly masculine with coarse hair, while bitches are expected to be feminine, without over
refinement.

Measurements

    ●   Height: 19-24 inches (48-61 cm)
    ●   Weight: 37-57 pounds (16-25 kg)

Temperament
Canaan Dogs make good house pets. When treated kindly, the dogs work hard and are not aggressive.
Extremely intelligent and good at problem solving, these dogs are very useful even in today's society.
The breed is loyal and loving.

History
The Canaan Dog began in ancient times as a pariah dog in Israel. This dog is one of the oldest, dating
back to biblical times.

The Canaan Dog was the guard and herd dog of the ancient Israelites, guarding their camps and flocks.
They were plentiful in the region until the dispersion of the Israelites by the Romans more than 2,000
years ago. As the Hebrew population dropped, the majority of the dogs sought refuge in the Negev
Desert, a natural reservoir of Israeli wildlife. Avoiding extinction, they remained undomesticated for the
most part, although some lived with the Bedouins and earned their keep by guarding the herds and
camps. Some were also guards for the Druze on Mount Carmel.

They survived this way until Dr. Rudolphina Menzel came up with the idea to use these intelligent
scavenger dogs mainly found in the desert, as guard dogs for the scattered Jewish settlements. She
initiated a selective breeding program to produce the breed known today as the Canaan Dog.

Canaan Dogs in the U.S.

On September 7, 1965, Ursula Berkowitz of Oxnard, California, imported the first four Canaan Dogs
with the idea of establishing the breed in the United States. The Canaan Dog Club of America was
formed the same year, and stud book records were kept from these first reports.

In June 1989, the Canaan Dog entered the American Kennel Club Miscellaneous Class and dogs were
registered in the AKC Stud Book as of June 1, 1997. The dogs began competing in conformation on
August 12, 1997.

The Canadian Eskimo Dog, otherwise known as the "Qimmiq", is a larger breed of Arctic dog
commonly found pulling sleds for their Inuit counterparts. However, as snowmobiles tend to be faster
and more efficient, the Canadian Eskimo Dog is now a rare breed.

                            Notes



The Cane Corso is an Italian breed used mainly as a guard dog. The dog is a large mastiff-type dog
breed.


Appearance
Breed standards are still developing internationally, and they vary somewhat among different breed
clubs. For example, the FCI standard calls for a height at the withers from 58 to 68 cm (22.8 to 26.7
inches), with bitches in the lower ranges and males in the higher ranges, whereas the AKC affiliated club
(International Cane Corso Federation) calls for 24.4-26.8 inches (62 to 68 cm).[1] Similarly, different
organizations call for weights in various ranges from 36-63.5 kg (80 to 140 pounds).
Its ears are naturally dropped forward, but many breeders crop them short and close to the head so that
the remaining stubs stand upright.

Temperament
This breed can be naturally aggressive with strangers unless well socialized from an early age. The
Corso's ancestors were bred as guard dogs and fighters, so proper training is a requirement or the dog
may become a threat to those around him. The Corso will not run from a fight, he will not back down
from a challenge, and he will also show a reserved attitude towards strangers.

History
Sixteenth-century breeders in Sicily recreated this breed in an attempt to match the ancient, now-extinct,
herding breed Cane di Macellaio. It was used as a drover to move herds of cattle, and it might have been
used in dog fighting.

The Cardigan Welsh Corgi (IPA: / kɔ(r) gi/) is one of two separate dog breeds known as Welsh Corgis
that originated in Wales.

Appearance
The Cardigan is a long, low dog with upright ears and a fox-like appearance. Unlike the similar but
unrelated Pembroke Corgi, the Cardigan's tail is never docked. Cardigans can be any shade of red, sable,
or brindle; they can also be black with or without tan brindle or blue merle (black and gray or marbled)
with or without tan or brindle. They usually have white on the neck, chest, legs, muzzle, underneath, tip
of the tail, and as a blaze on the head. An average Cardigan is around 10.5 to 12.5 inches (260 to 315
mm) tall at the withers and weighs from 30 to 38 lb. (13.6 to 17.2 kg) for the male and 25 to 34 lb. (11.3
to 15.4 kg) for the bitch.

Temperament
Originally bred for herding sheep and cattle, they have proven themselves as excellent companion
animals and are outstanding competitors in sheepdog trials and dog agility. Cardigan Welsh Corgis were
bred long and low to make sure that any kicks by cattle would travel safetly over the dogs without
touching them. Like most herding breeds, Cardigans are highly intelligent, active, athletic dogs.
Affectionately known as "a big dog in a small package," Cardigans are affectionate, devoted companions
that can also be alert and responsible guardians.

History
They are believed to be either descended from dogs brought by the Celts from continental Europe or
Swedish Vallhund dogs that came to Wales with the Vikings. The phrase "cor gi" translates to "dwarf
dog" in Welsh. They were highly valued for their herding, working and guarding skills, as well as their
companionship. A corgi's talents could help determine its owner's economic status.

The Catalan Sheepdog is a breed of Catalan pyrenean dog used as sheepdog. The breed is very rare in
the United States, mostly being breed in Europe, especially Spain, Finland, Germany, and Sweden.

Appearance
Catalan Sheepdogs range in size from 18 to 20 in (46 to 51 cm) in height and 45 to 60 lb (20 to 27 kg) in
weight for males, with females being smaller. Their coat is long and either flat or slightly wavy, and can
be from fawn to dark sable and light to dark grey.

Temperament
They are apparently so clever that they guard sheep without needing the instructions of the farmer.
Health
Catalan Sheepdogs are prone to hip dysplasia. Their average life span is 12 to 14 years.

Caucasian ovcharka or Caucasian Shepherd Dog is a breed of dog that is popular in Russia, Georgia,
and other countries where shepherds need serious protection for their flocks and properties.

Appearance
A well-bred Caucasian Shepherd Dog should be a healthy, strongly-boned, muscular and even-tempered
Moloss, but some of today's bloodlines are prone to hip dysplasia, obesity and too soft, as well as overly-
vicious temperaments. The ears of the Kavkaskaya Ovtcharka have traditionally been cropped, although
a large number of modern dogs can be seen unaltered. Even though many coat-types and beautiful
colours exist, the preferred Show-types are the long-coated grey dogs with some white markings
allowed. No black or black-n-tan dogs are accepted for Show, but do exist. The height ranges anywhere
from 23 to 34 inches among working specimens, but most modern dogs are around 28 inches tall.

Temperament
Powerful and massive, the Kavkaz Volkodav can prove to be a serious problem for an inexperienced
owner, because it respects and obeys only those dominant members of the family that it deems superiour
to itself. They are generally good with children, but will not see them as their masters. The great
Kavkazec develops a strong bond with its owner, but will rarely be completely submissive and blindly
follow orders, for this is truly a thinking dog, which relies primarily on its own instincts, sometimes
even disregarding its master's directions in certain situations. A breed with a very quick reaction time
and lightning-fast protection reflexes, it has even been unfairly described by some as somewhat of a
"loose cannon". Still, with proper care, handling and training, this is a well-behaved and obedient family
companion.

History
                                 Caucasian Ovcharka

Located between the Black Sea on the West and the Caspian Sea on the East, the Kavkaz (Caucasus)
mountain range of Eastern Europe represents a true melting pot of various cultures due to a number of
nations calling it their home through the ages. Today these influences are still strong and a rich source of
cultural wealth of the region, as well as numerous political conflicts. Encompassing the territories of
Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Kabardino-Balkaria, Daghestan, Ossetia, Turkey, Chechnya, Ingushetia
and, Iran, the Caucasus mountains are also home to one of the oldest living Molossers, the magnificient
Caucasian Shepherd Dog. In reality the term "Caucasian Dog" should stand for a group of breeds and
not for a single breed or a favoured variant. There is a great variety of types among the Caucasian dogs
depending on their home region, but due to the ignorance of many Westerners and strong national
appetite of Russian and pro-Russian dog fanciers worldwide, a single type bearing a misleading name is
being favored in the show rings and literature, at the expence of truth and other breed variants. The
exotic-sounding misnomer Ovcharka is very popular in the West, thanks to the efforts of the Russian
Kennel Club, even though it simply translates to "Sheepdog, Shepherd or Shepherd Dog", making it very
unpopular and often insulting among the non-Russian nationals of Caucasian and dog enthusiasts.
Considered a Russian breed, the Caucasian Ovtcharka is a part of the Troika, a threesome of recognized
Russian sheepdogs, the other two being the bearded South-Russian Sheepdog and the controversial
Central Asian Shepherd Dog.

In order to understand the issues concerning the Caucasian Shepherd Dog, a short historic overview is in
order. Although its first official Western Show-Ring appearance was in the 1930's in Germany, the
Caucasian Shepherd Dog has existed since ancient times and, like many Eastern Molossers, was
introduced to the bloodlines of many of today's World breeds throughout history. The Armenian Plateau
was one of the earliest cradles of civilization and the first appearance of dogs of this type is closely
linked to that area. The Armenian Gamprs are seen as a variant of the Caucasian Shepherd Dog, and
while that may be the case, it is also important to note that the Gampr comes in two distinct varieties,
both of which are believed to be much older than the modern Caucasian and Central-Asian Sheepdogs.
Some believe that the Caucasian Shepherd Dog was a result of crossing the mountain Gampyrs with the
spitz-type dogs in ancient times, but this theory, although not without merit, is understandably not very
popular.

Most blame for the confusion surrounding the Caucasian Shepherd Dog should be placed on the Soviet
concept, which was famous for erasing facts and re-writing histories of regions under its rule. Even
though it was officially non-nationalist, the Soviet regime was obviously pro-Russian, which was
manifested through forcing Russian language and cultural ideas on many non-Russian nations it
controlled. It should be noted that the Russian introduction to the Kavkaz came in 1859, which goes
against the theories claiming the ancient Caucasian Shepherd Dog as an indigenous Russian breed. In
this respect, the Turks could lay more claim on the breed, seing how they ruled the region before the
Soviets did and are known to had used Caucasian dogs as guardians for their camps and forts as far back
as the 1700's. The same case could be made for pre-Turkish rulers of the area, but this could turn into
into a vicious circle of "who came first?", further complicating the issue. Politics and nationalism should
never mix with dog-culture, but unfortunately they do and oftentimes have terrible consequences for the
breed.

When Russians started importing Caucasus dogs to Moscow, they separated them into two types, the
mountain dogs receiving the name Trans-Caucasian Ovtcharka after the Trans-Caucasus region,
consisting of Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan, while the shorter-haired and lighter-built type steppe
dogs were named the "Caucasian Ovcharka". Because of the immense variation in sizes and
temperaments within the two "official" types, the Soviets started a standardization programme which
resulted in an official standard change in the 1970's, when the Russian Kynological Federation made the
decision to promote a single type, under the name of "Caucasian Ovtcharka", abandoning their earlier
definitions. They agreed that the "best" type is the Georgian bear type, as favoured by Stalin. The
Russian-favored Georgian type is actually a hybrid, created by crossing the Nagazi and Mt.Kazbek
variants, both of which still exist in Georgia. The strong influence of some Central Asian bloodlines
shouldn't be ignored. Modern incarnation of the Russian show type also has some St. Bernard,
Sarplaninac, Leonberger, and Moscow Watchdog blood running through its veins, courtesy of ambitious
Soviet breeders trying to create a more agreable personality and colours in their "Ovtcharka". When the
Soviet military was developing the Moscow Watchdog in the post WW2 years, they imported Armenian
and Azerbaijan mountain dogs and crossed them with St.Bernards, resulting in an excellent service dog,
but also in a demise of certain bloodlines of Caucasian dogs. During the Cold War, the Caucasian
Shepherd Dog was a breed commonly seen wherever the Soviet Army was stationed, famously used as
patrol dogs guarding the Berlin Wall. Many of these working strains have been crossed with German
Shepherd Dogs over the years, affecting both the GSD and the CO breed. After the fall of the Wall, over
7000 of these dogs are believed to had been disbanded and left behind, where they were adopted by
many German families and dog enthusiasts, becoming one of the building blocks for the modern
Caucasian Ovtcharka, along with the Russian show type. Because military bloodlines come in a variety
of colours, sizes and temperaments, they aren't favoured among some modern Russian breeders who are
pushing for a single type, the aforementioned bear variant of the Georgian dogs, preferred in shades of
wolf-grey colours.

Modern times
The main Russian bloodlines can be traced to Moscow, Ekaterinburg, Tambov, Orenburg,
Magnitogorsk, Cheljabinsk, Novosibirsk, Donetsk, Lugansk, Ivanovo, Perm, Nizhny Novgorod, and St.
Petersburg, even though there are many different Caucasian strains still found in the Caucasus
mountains. In recent years, the term "Aboriginal" is being used to describe older, non-show mountain
bloodlines, but this is very misleading and often used as a trendy marketing ploy by some breeders.

Even though most dogs in the Caucasus are working hybrids between various types, there are still some
distinguishing characteristics among regional variants. For instance:

    ●   The Georgian dogs are divided into the large, longhaired and often multicoloured Mkinvartsveri
        Kazbek type and the slightly smaller wolf-grey Nagazi dogs of medium-length coat with longer
        muzzles, but there is also a separate breed known as Tushetian Nagazi or Georgian Caucasian
        Sheepdog in Georgia, which represents the original Georgian population of the breed, with the
        pure white dogs being the most valued.
    ●   Daghestan dogs are tall, wide-headed and athletic, always short-haired and multicoloured.
    ●   Astrakhan type is found in the Kabardino-Balkarian region and is believed to be a cross between
        the Russian show type and the old Circassian and Kazbek dogs, but Balkarian Molossers are also
        rooted in the Sarmatian Mastiff.

    ●   The Turkish Caucasus dogs are divided into 4 types, those being the Garban, the Akhaltsihnske
        type, the Circassian variant and the Kars Dog.
    ●   The large, short-muzzled, shorthaired fawn, brown, red, with or without white markings and
        extremely vicious Garban (Gorban) was developed from the Kars and the Kangal, as well as
        other Turkish dogs being crossed with the Armenian and Kazbek types.
             ❍ The Akhaltsihnske type was then created from the Garban crosses with the Georgian

                Nagazi variant and possibly Turkish Akbash, resulting in longhaired, lightly built solid-
                coloured white, fawn and grey dogs. The Circassian variant is believed to be a result of
                crossing the Kangals with the Cherkes dogs introduced to Turkey after the Russian-
                Circassian wars.
             ❍ The Kars Dog is a variety closely associated with the Kars province of modern Turkey

                and is today seen as a separate breed. The Armenian Gamprs are usually slightly smaller
                than the Georgian dogs and are shorter-necked and more squarely built, also allowing for
                a great variety of colours, even brown or black.

    ●   The Azerbaijan Volkodav variant also comes in two types, with the longhaired mountain and
        short-coated steppe dogs both being smaller than Georgian and Armenian types, always having
        black masks.
    ●   A result of matings between the dogs of southern Kavkaz with the Sage Mazandarani and the
        Kars Dog of Turkey, the Iranian Sage Ghafghazi is a lean, powerful and richly coated mastiff,
        used as a caravan protector of the Shahsavan nomads, who have been breeding it since the 17th
        century. These Iranian Caucasians come in a variety of colours, both solid and bicoloured.
    ●   There is also a rare shorthaired Kavkaz mastiff, known as the North-Caucasian Volkodav, which
        is on its way to receive a separate breed recognition.
It should be noted that even the legendary Alaunt, the breed considered to be the key progenitor of all
bulldogge breeds, is also originally descended from this Caucasian stock of mountain dogs.

As mentioned above, most working Caucasian dogs are hybrids between established types, as well as
some lines of the Central Asian dogs, in effect making the Russian show type appear to be a superiourly-
bred dog in the eyes of the West. This is of course due to in part to the main difference between the
Eastern and Western ways; the dogs being bred strictly for work in the East and primarily for show and
companion life in the West. The fighting strains of the Caucasian Ovcharka can contain blood of some
European breeds too, from certain mastiffs to even Pit Bull Terriers and Bandogges, but these crosses
are a minority in the breed. The Caucasian Molossers were used for centuries to protect properties, guard
livestock, kill wolves, hunt bears and for many other duties, but today and especialy in the West, they're
most commonly employed as companion animals and watchdogs. Most prized as an aggressive property
guardian, the mighty Caucasian Ovcharka is an intimidating and committed protector with no equal. The
Caucasian Shepherd Dog is generally a low activity dog, seemingly lethargic when not working, but
extremely agile and convincing when it feels its family is threatened. Although certain strains are more
vicious than others, all Caucasians are very territorial and fairly dog-aggressive, needing early and
careful broad socialization, as well as firm, but never forceful handling. This wonderful ancient breed
makes a good family dog, but it isn't the same thing as a Newfoundland, a Bernese or a St.Bernard and
potential owners should be aware of the breed's history and temperament before deciding to tackle the
task of raising a Caucasian Shepherd Dog.

                            Notes



The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel is a small breed of dog usually considered one of the toy dog
breeds.

Appearance
The breed has four recognized colors: Blenheim (rich chestnut on pearly white background), Tricolor
(black and white with tan markings), Black and Tan (black with tan markings), and Ruby (rich red all
over).

Temperament
The breed is highly affectionate, and some have called the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel "the ultimate
lap dog". However, Cavaliers require a great deal of human companionship and do not tolerate well
being left alone for long periods of time. Most dogs of the breed are extremely patient and eager to
please. As such, dogs of the breed are usually good with children and other dogs.

History




                                The Blenheim's coat features rich chestnut markings on a pearly white
background.

For many centuries, small breeds of spaniels have been popular in the United Kingdom. In the eleventh
century, in the reign of King Canute, it was illegal to hunt with any dog that could not fit through a
gauge that was eleven inches in diameter. Hence, the "birth" of the Toy Spaniel in the United Kingdom.
Some centuries later, Toy Spaniels became popular as pets, especially as pets of the royal family. In fact,
the King Charles Spaniel was so named because a Blenheim-coated spaniel was the children's pet in the
household of Charles I. King Charles II went so far as to issue a decree that the King Charles Spaniel
could not be forbidden entrance to any public place, including the Houses of Parliament. Such spaniels
can be seen in many paintings of the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. These early spaniels had longer,
pointier snouts and thinner-boned limbs than today's.

Over time, the toy spaniels were replaced in popularity by short-snouted, dome-headed dogs of asian
descent, such as the Pug and Japanese Chin. The King Charles Spaniel was bred with these dogs,
resulting in the similar-shaped head of today's breed. The King Charles Spaniel remained popular at
Blenheim Palace, home to the Dukes of Marlborough, where the brown and white version was the most
popular - resulting in the name Blenheim for that color combination.

In the beginning of the 1900s, an American named Roswell Eldrige offered twenty-five pounds as a
prize for any King Charles Spaniel "of the old-fashioned type" with a longer nose, flat skull, and a
lozenge (spot) in the middle of the crown of the head, sometimes called "the kiss of Buddha". So, the
breed was developed by selective breeding of short-snouted King Charles Spaniels. The result was a dog
that resembled the boyhood pet of the future Charles II of England ("Cavalier King Charles"), whence
the breed derives its name.

Two breed clubs are found in the United States: the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Club (CKCSC) USA
and the American Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Club. The latter club is the breed club of the American
Kennel Club.

Health
The breed suffers from a number of congenital defects, including:

Mitral Valve Disease

Virtually all Cavaliers suffer from mitral valve disease, causing progressively worsening heart murmurs
leading to heart failure. This condition can begin to emerge at an early age, and is present in many
Cavalier King Charles Spaniels by 5 years of age. It is extremely rare for a 10 year old Cavalier not to
have at least a slight heart murmur. Responsible breeders are attempting to breed only from dogs that
exhibit a later onset of this disease.

Syringomyelia

Syringomyelia is a condition affecting the brain and spine, causing symptoms ranging from mild
discomfort to severe pain and partial paralysis. Although symptoms of syringomyelia can present at any
age, they typically appear between 6 months and 3 years of age. Symptoms include sensitivity around
the head, neck or shoulders, often indicated by a dog whimpering or frequently scratching at the area of
his neck or shoulder. Scratching is often unilateral -- restricted to one side of the body. Scratching
motions are frequently performed without actually making physical contact with the body. The
scratching behavior appears involuntary and the dog frequently scratches while walking -- without
stopping -- in a way that is very atypical of normal scratching. Scratching typical of SM is usually worse
when the dog is wearing a collar or being walked on leash or when the dog is excited.

Not all dogs with SM show scratching behavior. Not all dogs who show scratching behavior appear to
suffer pain. If onset is at an early age, the first sign may be rapidly appearing scoliosis. If the problem is
severe, there is likely to be poor proprioception (awareness of body position), especially with regard to
the forelimbs. Clumsiness and falling results from this problem.

A vet should be asked to rule out primary secretory otitis media (glue ear) before assuming that a
Cavalier has SM. PSOM can present with similar symptoms but is much easier and cheaper to treat. It's
not known how frequently PSOM (or SM) occurs in Cavaliers.

Luxating patella

Cavaliers, like most other small breeds, are occasionally subject to a genetic defect of the femur called
luxating patella. This condition allows the kneecap to slip out of place. This condition is most often
observed when a puppy is 4 to 6 months old. In the most serious cases, surgery may be indicated. A
great many commercially-produced Cavaliers require patella surgery after being surrendered to rescue or
taken in from puppy mills. The proportion of Cavaliers in a typical rescue group who require patella
surgery is about one-third to one-half.

Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca

Another common defect among Cavaliers is keratoconjunctivitis sicca, colloquially known as "dry eye".
The usual cause of this condition is an autoimmune reaction against the dog's tear ducts, reducing the
production of tears. The condition requires continual treatment and if untreated may result in partial or
total blindness.

Miscellaneous

Puppy Mills

The recent increasing popularity of the breed has led to breeding of the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel in
puppy mills and an upsurge in the number of Cavaliers sold in pet stores

The Cesky Terrier is a small terrier originating in Czechoslovakia. The name is pronounced Chess-kee
(after its Czech name Český teriér, literally Czech Terrier.

Appearance
The Cesky Terrier, also called the Bohemian Terrier, is a short-legged, moderately long, terrier. It looks
similar to a Sealyham Terrier. The Cesky Terrier has a long head, bushy beard, mustache, and eyebrows.
The body is solid, but not heavy. The Cesky Terrier is agile and robust. The wavy, silky coat usually
comes in various shades of gray-blue with tan, gray, white, or yellow furnishings or light coffee, though
puppies are born black. The coat lightens between birth and two years of age.

The Cesky Terrier's eyes are brown in gray-blue dogs and yellow in brown dogs. The noses and lips of
blue-gray dogs are black; for brown dogs it is liver. The ears are triangular, folding forward close to the
head. The head is long, but not too wide, with a well-defined stop.

Temperament
This is a sweet and happy dog that is good with children and tends to be less dog-aggressive than some
other terrier breeds. Patient and brave, they are loyal, obedient, and courageous dogs. They are
intelligent and more trainable than many other terriers. They are easy to handle. They love people,
especially children, and are fairly friendly with strangers, but like most terriers, it is feisty, stubborn, and
fearless.

History
The Cesky Terrier exists due to the efforts of a Czech breeder, František Horák. The Cesky is a
relatively new breed, first recognized by the FCI in 1963. They are a mixture of Sealyham Terriers and
Scottish Terriers, possibly with other terriers added. The Dandie Dinmont is thought by some to be one
of these other terriers. The Cesky's original purpose was to hunt vermin in their dens, especially rats and
foxes.

Exercise
The Cesky Terrier is energetic and enjoys running and playing through a wooded area or open
countryside. They also enjoy a long walk on the lead.


Health
This breed occasionally suffers from the Scottie Cramp, a minor problem causing awkward movement,
but that is not painful or life threatening.

                             Notes



The Chinese Crested Dog is a smaller (10-13 lbs) breed of dog known for its unusual appearance. It a
member of the toy dog group, and is available in two types: The Hairless and the Powderpuff.


Appearance




                                  Powderpuff Chinese Crested

At first glance, the Hairless and Powderpuff varieties of Chinese Crested Dogs appear to be two
different breeds. The Hairless is the more popular variety, known for its lack of a fur coat. Instead, it has
a soft, humanlike skin that is unusual to the touch, though it has tufts of fur on its paws ("socks") and tail
("plume") and long, wavy hair on its head ("crest"). Fur on the muzzle, known as a beard, is not
uncommon. The hairless variety can vary in amount of body hair. A true hairless has very little to no
body hair. Many of the dogs seen in the show ring are actually a "moderate" or "hairy" hairless that is
shaved down. The difference between a vary hairy hairless and a "puff" is that the hairless has a single
coat, often with hairless parts on the body, while the puff has a thick double coat. The skin of the
Hairless comes in a variety of colours, ranging from a pale flesh to black, and is often mottled. Hairless
Cresteds often lack a full set of teeth.

The Powderpuff shares the crest and build of the Hairless, but in addition has a full coat of long hair.
The look of the Powderpuff varies, according to how it is groomed. When its fur is completely grown
out on its face, it strongly resembles a terrier; however, the Powderpuff is usually shaved around the
snout as a standard cut. Its fur is incredibly soft, and shedding is minimal. Due to its coat type, the
Powderpuff or Hairless are considered good pets for allergy sufferers.

Temperament
                                 Dark-skinned Chinese Crested

Chinese Cresteds are affectionate, energetic, and playful. They are known to be great family pets, and
have endearing personalities. They are known to be great with respectful children. Some are known
"singers", while others are known to "smile". They are generally happy lap dogs with candid
personalities.

Health
The Hairless is susceptible to acne and sunburn. Maintenance of the skin is similar to maintaining
human skin—moisturising cream can keep the skin from becoming too dry, and in fair-skinned Cresteds,
if one lives in a warm climate where there is a lot of sun (Australia, Spain, and so on) one should apply
sunscreen to the dog's skin.

Overall, if one is prepared to give proper maintenance, attention, and care, a Chinese Crested can,
barring accident or illness, live up to fifteen years.

History
Though associated with China since the 13th century, many believe it was originally brought there from
Africa and others believe that it might be a cross of the Chihuahua and Mexican Hairless Dog, the latter
of which it resembles.

The Chinese Crested was officially recognised by the UK Kennel Club in 1981 and by the American
Kennel Club in 1991.

Miscellaneous
The Hairless allele is a dominant (and homozygous lethal) trait; while the Powderpuff allele (the wild
type) acts as a simple recessive trait to it. Embryos that receive 2 copies of the Hairless allele will never
develop into puppies. Thus all Chinese crested carry at least one copy of the Powderpuff allele.

The Powderpuff trait cannot be bred out because it is carried by all Chinese Cresteds (even the hairless
ones). All Hairless Chinese crested have the ability to produce Powderpuff puppies; even when they are
bred to another hairless.

The Chinook is a rare sleddog type or variety developed in the New England region of the USA in the
early 20th century.

Appearance
Standing 21 to 27 inches (53-69 cm) in height at the withers and weighing 55 to 90 pounds (25-41 kg),
the Chinook is balanced and muscular. The medium-length double coat is “tawny” in colour, with darker
shadings on muzzle and ears; white dogs are not allowed, nor are other colours. Eyes are brown to
amber in colour. Ear carriage is variable, but dropped is preferred and the head more strongly
rectangular than other sleddog breeds. The tail is a well-furred saber and not the usual brush or plume of
Arctic breeds. Overall, the Chinook seems to owe more to mastiff than to spitz ancestry.


Temperament
The breed is described as calm, nonaggressive and friendly, though sometimes reserved with strangers.
They are inherently gentle with children.

Health
Health issues in Chinooks are epilepsy, canine hip dysplasia, and eye defects.


History
The Chinook owes its existence to one man, Arthur Walden of Wonalancet, New Hampshire. The breed
derives principally from one male ancestor born in 1917, named “Chinook,” who was Walden’s lead dog
and stud. Chinook derived from a crossbreeding of husky stock from the Peary North Pole expedition
with a large, tawny Mastiff-like male. Photos of “Chinook” show a drop-eared dog with a broad Mastiff
head and muzzle. Walden’s leader was bred to Belgian Sheepdogs, German Shepherd Dogs, Canadian
Eskimo Dogs and perhaps other breeds; the progeny were bred back to him to set the desired type and
was apparently a strong reproducer of his own traits. Arthur Walden was an experienced dog driver with
years of experience in the Yukon; he was lead driver and trainer on the 1929 Byrd antarctic expedition.
He is credited with bringing sleddog sport to New England and with founding the New England Sled
Dog Club in 1924. The 12-year old “Chinook” was lost on the Byrd expedition.

Control of the core breeding stock passed from Walden to Mrs. Julia Lombard and from her to Perry
Greene in the late 1930s. Greene, a noted outdoorsman, bred Chinooks in Waldboro, Maine, for many
years until his death in 1963. Rare and closely-held by Greene who was for many years the only breeder
of Chinooks, the population dwindled rapidly after his death. By 1981 only eleven breedable Chinooks
survived. Breeders in Maine, Ohio and California divided the remaining stock and managed to save the
type from extinction. The Chinook obtained registered status with the United Kennel Club in 1991;
current numbers of registered animals are around 400. The registry has a cross-breeding programme
under which Chinooks are bred to individuals of other breeds thought to have contributed to Chinook
development; fourth-generation backcross descendants of such crosses may be accepted as registered
Chinooks.
Working Life

Although still used for recreational dogsledding by some owners, Chinooks today appear to be used
largely as family pets. Individuals are also used for dog-packing, search and rescue, skijoring, and
obedience and dog agility trials.


Miscellaneous
Chinooks are slowly gaining recognition by major kennel clubs.

The Chippiparai is a breed of dog from the south of India, particularly the area around Periyar Lake. It
is used primarily for hunting wild boar, deer and hare. It is said to be an excellent hunter, and is also
used for guarding the home. The typical colour is a silver-grey, with very limited, or no white markings.
This is a very handsome dog, being tall (27-32 inches at the withers) and powerful. The breed is very
rare and difficult to find, it is limited to the isolated villages such as Vandi Periyar. It may be lost soon if
steps are not taken to ensure its survival in its natural habitat.

                            Notes



The Clumber Spaniel is a gundog breed developed in Britain.


Appearance
A long and heavy-bodied, low-stationed spaniel, it stands only 17 to 20 inches (43-51 cm) in height but
weighs from 55 to 85 pounds (35-38.5 kg). The Clumber has heavier bone than other spaniels, a massive
head with a hound-like face and expression, a deep muzzle, large square nose, and broad low-set ears.
His coat is dense, weather-resistant, straight, and flat. Clumbers are predominantly white in colour with
lemon or orange markings.

Temperament
The Clumber is a serious gundog still, not as fast as some, but excellent in heavy cover and a good
retriever when trained. He is also an excellent tracker. His temperament is described as gentle, loyal and
affectionate, but dignified and aloof with strangers. Disadvantages of owning a Clumber are said to be
constant shedding, snoring, drooling, especially after a drink of water, and an incredible inventiveness
for raiding kitchen counters, cabinets, and even the refrigerator. Puppies are especially curious and
inventive. The combination of a very people-focused disposition and a strong urge to carry something
has led to many missing shoes and other articles of clothing.

Health
Canine hip dysplasia has been a serious issue in this breed in the past. Diligent breeding programmes
have reduced the incidence considerably in recent years. Other health issues are entropion and ectropion
(turning inward or outward of the lower eyelid) and hypothyroidism.

History
The breed's history is uncertain before the middle of the 19th century. One theory is that it originated in
France, stating that the Duc de Noailles at the time of the French Revolution gave his kennel of prized
spaniels to the Duke of Newcastle at Clumber Park in Nottingham. Another theory holds that it was
developed in Britain from older breeds of hunting spaniels, perhaps by crossing them with Bassets or St.
Hubert's hounds. What is certain is that the breed took its name from Clumber Park and that the Duke of
Newcastle's gamekeeper, William Mansell, is credited with their development and improvement. Prince
Albert, the Prince consort of Queen Victoria, was a fancier and promoter of the breed, as was his son
King Edward VII, who bred them at the Sandringham estate in Norfolk. The breed was shown in
England from 1859 onward.

                           Notes



A Cockapoo or Cockerpoo is a cross-bred dog, created by crossing a Cocker Spaniel and a Poodle, in
most cases the Miniature Poodle. Breeders usually try to retain the small build of the spaniel, while
retaining the wavy quality of the Poodle's coat.

Appearance
Cockapoos generally weigh between 20 and 24 pounds (9 to 11 kg) and stand about 14 or 15 inches (35
to 38 cm) at the withers. Like their originating breeds, Cockapoos come in a variety of coat colors, both
solid colors and combinations. The general shape of the Cockapoo, in particular its ears, mostly
resembles the Spaniel, but the coat and face are usually more reminiscent of the Poodle.

They do not shed, are loyal, and don't cost more than a cat to feed. They are as odorless as a dog can be
and they don't slobber.

Temperament
Cockapoos are well known for their loyalty to their owner, and are known to get jealous if he/she pays
attention to anything else. Like most spaniels, they can be very energetic, but this can vary widely from
dog-to-dog. They shed little to no hair.

Health
Cockapoos are generally well off in the health-risks lists, so vet bills are usually not an issue. However,
they can suffer from problems associated with either the Cocker Spaniel or the Poodle.

History
The Cockapoo has been popular in the United States since at least the 1970s. It has become so common
that many, if not most, Cockapoos on the market today are the result of breeding male and female
Cockapoos rather than of a direct cross between the Cocker Spaniel and the Poodle.

The Cockapoo is still under development. Strictly speaking, the Cockapoo cannot yet be described as a
dog breed because it does not 'breed true'. In breeders' terms, 'breeding true' means that, when two
specimens of the same breed are mated, the puppies have consistently predictable characteristics and
will resemble their parents, rather than exhibiting random characteristics of the dog breeds in their
parents' ancestries. Further, the breed standards of breeds-under-development are invariably freer, more
open to interpretation and cover more observable types than those of established or kennel club
recognized breeds.

                             Notes



The Curly Coated Retriever (curly) is an intelligent, friendly breed of dog originally bred for upland
bird and waterfowl hunting. He is the tallest of the retrievers and is easily distinguishable by the mass of
tight curls covering his body. Curly Coated Retrievers were developed as upland game hunters and
waterfowl retrievers in England and were recognized as a breed as early as 1860. Curly Coated and
Wavy Coated (now known as the flat-coated) Retrievers were the first two recognized retriever breeds.


Appearance
The curly is an active, upstanding, well-muscled breed bred for upland bird and waterfowl hunting.
Although he is related to the other more popular retrieving breeds, the curly is quite different in type and
structure and somewhat different in temperament than the more common retrievers. A correct curly will
appear slightly leggy but is actually slightly longer than tall. The breed sports a coat of tight, crisp curls.
He is balanced and agile with a significant air of endurance, strength, and grace.

Coat

The coat of the curly is a hallmark of the breed. A correct coat is a large mass of small curls that lie
close to the skin. Breeders aim for tight, crisp, individually pronounced curls rather than loose, open
curls. The coat is sufficiently dense to provide protection in ill weather and icy water, and against
brambles and briars.

The only places on a curly's body that are not covered in tight curls are the forehead, face, front of
forelegs, and feet, where the hair should be short, smooth, and straight. A looser curl is acceptable on the
ears. The breed should have no undercoat.

Patches of uncurled hair behind the withers or bald patches of skin are undesirable. The coat should not
be sparse, silky, fuzzy, very harsh, dry, or brittle.

Bald patches which may temporarily occur in growing puppies who are changing to adult coat and in
bitches who have recently whelped are not necessarily indicative of a permanent problem.

Colour

The only acceptable colours for the Curly Coated Retriever are solid black and solid liver (brown).
Occasional white hairs are permissable, but white patches are a serious fault.

Eyes should be either black or brown in black dogs, and brown or amber in liver dogs. Yellow eyes are
undesirable.

The nose should be fully pigmented, black in black dogs and liver in liver dogs.

Height and Weight
    ●   Dogs: 25-27 in at the withers
    ●   Bitches: 23-25 in

Weight should be in correct proportion to the size of the dog.

    ●   Dogs: 70-90 lbs
    ●   Bitches: 50-70 lbs

Care and Maintenance

Coat

To maintain the crisp, tight curls on a Curly Coated Retreiver, groomers avoid brushing the dog as this
could promote unwanted "fuzziness" or fluffiness. However, the coat must be combed through to
remove any dead hair. This should be done before bathing the dog. After bathing the dog, the curl will
be looser and fluffier but will tighten up, especially if sprayed with plain water. A curly kept as a
companion and/or hunting animal need not be elaborately groomed but needs to be kept clean and free
of mats for the health of the dog. Bathing should be as needed. Dead hair should be combed out of the
coat as needed and toe-nails should be kept trim.

Show ring exhibitors normally trim feathering from the tail, ears, belly, legs and feet. Trimming is not
required when exhibiting a curly at a dog show but most judges will likely discount the dog if he is not
trimmed. Shearing of the body coat is undesirable.

All curlies shed. Bitches usually shed more heavily during their heat cycles (usually twice a year). Dogs
and bitches may also shed more in the spring, especially those living in areas with extreme seasonal
temperature changes. Combing through the coat to remove dead hair is helpful, particularly during those
times of heavier shedding.

Curlies tend to shed hair in clumps, rather than one single hair at a time, which aids in cleanup.

Feeding

An active dog which is also prized for his endurance, the curly should be fed a high quality food. Some
breeders feed a natural diet, consisting of meat and vegetables. Others feed good quality commercial dog
foods. Some breeders feed both. A good curly breeder or a veterinarian will be able to recommend a
suitable diet for a curly, depending on age, size and activity level.

Exercise
The Curly Coated Retriever likes his exercise; he was bred for athleticism and endurance in the field. A
curly is an intelligent dog and is happiest when he has adequate exercise and play. Swimming is ideal
and so is running and walking with his owner. Retrieving work OR play, such as retrieving a tennis ball,
is another way to exercise the dog. He is not a dog for the lazy owner.

While active and exuberant outside, at play, or in the field, the curly is a calm house dog.

Health

Life expectancy

Average life expectancy is 9-12 years, although there are instances of curlies living to 15 to 17 years of
age.

Known medical issues

    ●   Hip dysplasia
    ●   Eye problems such as cataracts, corneal dystrophy, distichiasis, entropion, ectropion, or retinal
        dysplasia.
    ●   Cardiac problems
    ●   Seizuring (Epilepsy)
    ●   Bloat


Temperament
The Curly Coated Retriever is a very lively, fun-loving breed. They are slow to mature, which makes
them a great addition to any active family. As long as the CCR has enough exercise, he can be very calm
and laid back in the home environment, which makes them both a great activity dog as well as a placid
member of the family. CCRs are great dogs for flyball and dog agility trails as they love the outdoors,
working with people, and activities of any kind.

Curly Coated Retrievers were bred to work more independently than other retrievers. This has given
them a reputation for being reserved with strangers and they are often accused of being aloof because of
it. However, CCRs are very loyal to those they know and are very fond of children.

CCRs are extremely intelligent, learn quickly and love to please their owners; even so, training one can
sometimes be difficult as they can easily get bored with repetitive training. Short, fun sessions are the
best way to a CCR's mind. The breed is quick to figure things out, and once it has learned how to do
something (such as open a gate or door), he will use his new skill any time he sees fit.
This breed can sometimes be stubborn and self-willed. These individuals need careful motivational
training, as preventing bad behavior is much easier than reversing it. Negative reinforcement causes
some dogs to refuse to obey commands.

A Dandie Dinmont Terrier is a small breed of dog in the terrier family. The breed has a very long
body, short legs, and a distinctive "top-knot" of hair on the head.

The Dandie Dinmont Terrier is named for Dandie Dinmont, a jovial farmer in Sir Walter Scott's novel
Guy Mannering, who owned many terriers. The breed was first registered with the American Kennel
Club (AKC) in 1888.

                         Notes
The Deerhound, also sometimes called a Scottish Deerhound, is a breed of dog, specifically a member
of the sighthound family.


Temperament
The Deerhound is a large dog that needs quite a bit of exercise to keep it healthy. That does not mean it
needs a large house to live in. Many live in smaller houses and apartments quite happily. The average
adult Deerhound (over, say, two years old) spends much of the day stretched out on the floor or a couch,
sleeping. They are gentle and docile indoors and are good around company and children.

Outdoors, with room to run, they are anything but docile. They have a long floating gait and are
amazingly fast over a piece of ground. Some care has to be taken to give them freedom to run in places
where they are not likely to be tempted or able to give chase as they are tireless runners and fierce
hunters.

History
Deerhounds were bred in parallel with the English Greyhound for very similar purposes. They were
developed to hunt deer by running them to ground (exhaustion) in packs. As such, they are very closely
related to the Irish Wolfhound, Russian Wolfhound, and the other large sighthounds. Generally, these
big hunting dogs were sporting animals for nobility but many very similar animals were bred and hunted
by common folk. These big, fast, almost silent hunters made quick work of any game from a rabbit up
and were very well regarded by noble huntsmen and poachers alike.

Miscellaneous
Deerhounds compete in conformation and coursing. Many are trained to succeed in obedience
competition but few excel in it and fewer excel in dog agility or flyball.

                           Notes



The Drentsche Patrijshond is a rare dog breed, not widely known even in its country of origin, The
Netherlands, although breed clubs operate in Denmark and Norway, and a small number of American
breeders have recently introduced the dog to the United States. The Drentsche Patrijshond, also known
as the Drentse Partridge Dog or Dutch Partridge Dog, bears some resemblance to the spaniel and
setter families. An excellent pointer and retriever, this dog is often used to hunt fowl and adapts equally
well to the field or marshes.

Appearance
Valid color is white with brown or orange markings. Tricoloured, with the addition of tan markings, is
permissible. A mantle is permissible, but generally less desired. Size: 55 to 63 cm (22 to 25 in).

History
The Drentsche Patrijshond originated in the 16th century from the Spioenen (or Spanjoelen) which came
to the Netherlands through France from Spain- whence the spaniel category. In the Netherlands, these
dogs were called partridge dogs. In the eastern parts of the country, particularly the province of Drenthe,
the dog was kept a purebred. The breed was officially recognized by the Raad van Beheer op
Kynologisch Gebied in 1943, although its presence had been visible for centuries, including in Dutch
master paintings (see Rijksmuseum online portraits by Vermeer, Rubens, et al.)

Character
Though the breed shows a strong hunting instinct in the field, and can be quite driven, these dogs tend to
be more relaxed in the home than many of the hunting breeds. They are strongly attached to family
members, loyal, and of sweet disposition, particularly with children.

                             Notes



The English Cocker Spaniel is a breed of dog. It is one of several varieties of spaniel and somewhat
resembles its American cousin, the American Cocker Spaniel, although it's closer to the working-dog
form of the Field Spaniel and the Springer Spaniel. Outside the US, the breed is usually known simply
as the Cocker Spaniel, as is the American Cocker Spaniel within the US. Due to the breed's happy
disposition and continuously wagging tail, it has been given the nickname "merry cocker".

Appearance
The Cocker is a sturdy, compact, well-balanced dog. It has a characteristic expression showing
intelligence and alertness. Its eyes should be dark and its lobular ears should reach the tip of the nose
when pulled forward. The breed's slightly loose skin and feathered coat allow it to fight through any
brush unharmed. The Cocker's tail is customarily docked in North America.

Height at withers:

     ●   Dogs: 15-17 inches (38–43 cm)
     ●   Bitches: 15-16 inches (38–41 cm)

Weight:

     ●   Dogs: 28–34 lb (13–15 kg)
     ●   Bitches: 27–32 lb (12-15 kg)

Colour

Show dogs are restricted to certain colours dependent on country, whereas working Cockers can be any
of a wide variety of colours. They come in solid (or self) colours, where white is restricted to only the
chest in show dogs, parti-colour, roan, and merle.


Temperament
Cockers are renowned for their friendly, faithful, playful, and affectionate natures. They are easily
trained and make a good medium-sized family pet. Very few Cockers have temperament problems; in a
2002 survey consisting of 487 cockers, only 1% of the dogs were aggressive to people and 2% were
aggressive to other dogs [1].
Health
The Cocker is generally a healthy breed. Its main health problems are progressive retinal atrophy, kidney
disease, and hip dysplasia. They are also often prone to ear infections because of their pendulous ears.

They live for approximately 13 to 14 years on average.

History




                                             Young English Cocker Spaniel with long tail

In the 1800s, small spaniels were developed to help flush and retrieve game. The best hunters were used
for breeding. This created the most efficient puppies for the next generation, but the outcome of these
hunters was not very consistent, so a split was made. Essentially only the sizes of the pups counted and
The Kennel Club divided the dogs by weight alone. If a dog weighed under 25 lbs, it was classed as a
Cocker Spaniel (as its primary use was to hunt woodcock). If it weighed over 25 lbs, it was a Springer
Spaniel (which was used to "spring" game).

When showing, the new Springer and Cocker, both were in the same class until The Spaniel Club, which
was formed in 1885, created breed standards for each of the types. The Kennel Club separated the two
types eight years later. Since then, the Springer and Cocker enthusiasts have bred in the separate traits
that they desired. Today, the breed differ in more ways than weight alone.

In America, the American Cocker type was forming. As a result, the English Cocker lost favor. The two
Cocker Spaniels were shown together until 1936, when the English Cocker received status as a separate
breed. The American Kennel Club granted a separate breed designation for the English Cocker Spaniel
in 1946.

Working Cockers
This breed, like many others with origins as working dogs, has genetic lines that focus on working-dog
skills and other lines that focus on ensuring that the dog's appearance conforms to the breed standard,
these are the "show" and "working" strains.

After World War II, the show-bred Cocker Spaniel increased enormously in popular appeal and, for a
period of time, was the most numerous Kennel Club registered breed. This popularity increased the view
that all the spaniels were useless as working dogs. However, for many dogs this is untrue, as even some
show bred cockers have retained their working instinct to this day.

Today, this breed is beginning to experience a resurgence in usage as a working dog. Their happy and
inquisitive personality makes them ideal service or detection dogs. Dogs from working lines, often
refered to as "Field-Bred" cockers are noticably distinct in appearance. As is the case with the English
Springer, the working type has been bred exclusively to perform in the field as a hunting companion.
Their coat is shorter and ears less pendulous than the Show-Bred type. Although registered as the same
breed, the two strains have diverged significanlty enough that they are rarely crossed.

Working-dog lines often have physical characteristics that would prevent them from winning in the
show ring, such as heads that are more domed than desired or other traits. This most likely is a result of
the crossbreeding of other breeds into the working lines to enhance the working skills for much longer
than occurred with the show lines. Eventually, kennel club rules prohibited the crossbreeding of other
breeds, and working-line Cockers today show less variation than in the past.

                             Notes



The English Foxhound is the original of the two foxhound breeds of dog. They are scent hounds, bred
to hunt by scent.

Appearance
The English Foxhound is about 21-25 inches tall to the withers, and weighs anywhere between 65-75
pounds. The skull is wide, the muzzle is long, and eyes carry a sweet expression. The legs are muscular,
straight-boned, and the paws are rounded, almost cat-like.

Temperament
The English Foxhound was originally a pack hound, thus, it gets along well with other dogs and enjoys
human companionship. It gets along with horses, children, and other pets, seeing as it is a gentle, social,
and tolerant breed.
It is a very active breed that enjoys the hunt. Though it is slower than the American Foxhound it enjoys
running and will run all day with very few breaks in between.

Health
There are very few health factors in this breed. Occasionally seen are chronic hip dysplasia and renal
disease. The breed's lifespan is typically 10-13 years

History
The longest surviving breed, the modern English Foxhound was created in the late 1700s. It was created
by a delicate mix between a Greyhound, Bulldog, and Fox Terrier. The Greyhound allowed the
foxhound to be quick on its feet. The Fox Terrier helped to enhance the hunter in the breed, and the
Bulldog gave it a wider chest and more muscle.

Studbooks for this breed were kept as early as the 1800s.

The dogs were meant to trail foxes and live around horses. They are still used for those purposes.

Exercise
The English Foxhound is a very energetic breed. It needs plenty of exercise. This breed needs area to
run. If confined to a small area, the foxhound may become destructive. The apartment life is not one for
the English Foxhound.

An English Pointer, often called simply a Pointer, is a breed of dog developed as a gun dog. It is one of
several pointer breeds.


Appearance
The standard colourings of an English Pointer are liver, lemon, orange or black. These can be solid
colours, or a combination white Speckles, and patches are also acceptable. Black and white pointers are
sometimes confused with Dalmatians. Dalmatians have a great number of small spots, whereas Pointers
have a few large spots.




                      A pointer rests on the grass




                      A domestic pointer rests in her home

Health
The average life span of a Pointer is 12 to 17 years.

History
Four breeds went into the development of the Pointer: the Foxhound, Bloodhound, Greyhound, and
English Bull Terrier.
Miscellaneous
When Pointers work with hunters, they are often used in combination with a retriever, to point out the
prey to the retriever, using the pointer stance.

The English Setter is a breed of dog. It is part of the Setter family, which includes red Irish Setters and
black Gordon Setters.


Appearance
The English Setter is a gun dog, bred for a mix of endurance and athleticism. The coat is flat with light
feathering of long length. They have a long, flowing coat that requires regular grooming.

The various speckled coat colors when occurring in English Setters are referred to as belton; valid
combinations are white with black flecks (blue belton) or with orange flecks (orange belton—
depending on the intensity of the color, they might be lemon belton or liver belton), or white with black
and tan flecks (tricolour belton).

Temperament
This breed's standard temperament can be described as friendly and good natured, however, it can also
be strong-willed and mischievous. They are energetic, people-oriented dogs, so are well suited to
families who can give them attention and activity, or to working with a hunter, where they have a job to
do. They are active dogs that need plenty of exercise.

Health
A relatively healthy breed, Setters have few genetic problems but some problems occasionally occur.
Canine Hip dysplasia, Elbow dysplasia, and canine hypothyroidism are some of the more well-known
ailments that can affect this dog.

History
The English Setter was originally bred to set or point upland game birds. From the best available
information, it appears that the English Setter was a trained bird dog in England more than 400 years
ago. There is evidence that the English Setter originated in crosses of the Spanish Pointer, large Water
Spaniel, and Springer Spaniel, which combined to produce an excellent bird dog with a high degree of
proficiency in finding and pointing game in open country. The modern English Setter owes its
appearance to Mr. Edward Laverack (1800-1877), who developed his own strain of the breed by careful
inbreeding during the 19th century in England and to another Brit, Mr. R. Purcell Llewellin (1840-
1925), who based his strain upon Laverack's and developed the working Setter. Today, you still hear the
term Llewellin Setter, but this is not a separate breed. Instead, it is often used as an alternate name for a
field-bred English Setter.

With time, Laverack inbred successfully to produce beautiful representatives of the breed. The first
show for English Setters was held in 1859 at Newcastle-on-Tyne. The breed's popularity soared across
England as shows became more and more widespread. Not long after, the first English Setters were
brought to North America, including those that began the now-famous Llewellin strain recorded in the
writing of Dr. William A Burette. From this group of dogs came the foundation of the field-trial setter in
America, "Count Noble," who is currently mounted in the Carnegie Museum at Pittsburgh. At present,
the English is one of the most popular and elegant sporting breeds, often grouped with its cousins, the
Irish and Gordon Setters.


Miscellaneous
The name Llewellin Setter is given to a certain strain of English Setters bred by R.L. Purcell Llewellin
(also spelled Llewellyn) to be perfect for field trials.

                           Notes



The English Shepherd is an American breed of dog. In 1900 the most common dog on small farms in
the US was the English Shepherd. The English Shepherd is an all around farm dog, being used as a
herding dog, watch dog, hunting dog, and child's companion.
English Shepherds are similar in appearance to Border Collies and Australian Shepherds. English
Shepherds usually have tails and have a flatter head than Aussies. English Shepherds are never merle
and Aussies frequently are. They are generally not square in body like an Aussie. English Shepherds
tend to be larger than Border Collies but are most readily distinguished by their very different herding
style.

Appearance
The English Shepherd is a medium sized dog, usually somewhat longer than it is tall. It generally weighs
between 40 and 70 pounds (20 to 30 kg) and is balanced in proportions. As a small farm dog, English
Shepherds have evolved to fulfill a variety of needs. This has resulted in a wide range of regional
variations.

The coat is medium length and can be straight, wavy, or curly. There is frequently feathering on the legs
and tail. As a working dog, the coat should be easy to keep, requiring no grooming. Dirt and burrs tend
to just fall away. There are four coat colors: sable (clear and shaded), tricolor, black and white, and
black and tan. There are no merle English Shepherds.

Temperament
The English Shepherd temperament is the defining characteristic of the breed, with great intelligence
and often a unique type of kindness for those in his home, both animals and people. The English
Shepherd is often an independent worker. English Shepherds are adaptable but learn routines quickly.
Some can be standoffish with strangers and more one-person dogs. However, once he accepts people or
children or stock as his own, there are few better caretakers than an English Shepherd.

The English shepherd frequently exhibits a bossy or "enforcer" streak in his temperament. If the dog's
desire to enforce order is not channeled and directed to a suitable end by an owner who is a strong,
confident leader, he may exhibit many undesirable behaviors. English shepherds can thrive as
companion dogs in many environments, but do not make "good pets" for the average person.

Health
English Shepherds are generally healthy dogs, however hip dysplasia is not uncommon. Anyone
contemplating getting an English Shepherd would be well advised to research the hip ratings (OFA or
PennHIP) of the breeder's stock.


History
The historical English Shepherd is known in some areas as the Scotch Collie or "Farm Collie", but in
other areas was always considered a distinct breed. There was no breed club or registry at the time so
there is some dispute over exactly which name applies to which dogs. All of these names were applied to
the common farm dogs of the era. The Australian Shepherd is likely a derivative of these farm dogs and
appeared primarily in the Western United States. The English Shepherd was more common in the
Midwest and East. The English Shepherd is a descendant of the working farm dogs of the British Isles,
however the name is believed to derive from the Amish use of the word "English" to refer to anything
not Amish.

Working Life

They are very quick to learn the farm routine and will work independently with little training, but will
benefit from some training and guidance. The modern English Shepherd is still best suited for farm
work, but they are also used as search and rescue dogs, as therapy dogs, and as competitors in dog
agility, obedience, tracking, and flyball. English Shepherds are frequently larger than Border Collies, but
the quickest way to tell the two apart is to put them on stock. Border Collies tend to herd with distinctive
strong eye and a crouching stance, while English Shepherds have an upright, loose-eyed herding style.
English Shepherds can work all types of stock, be it cattle, sheep, goats, or ducks.

An English Toy Terrier (Black and Tan) is a small breed of terrier in the toy dog group. While the
name is sometimes used synonymously with that of the Toy Manchester Terrier, these are actually
separate breeds.

Appearance
The breed standards for the English Toy Terrier and the Toy Manchester Terrier (which was developed
in the United States) are very similar, but there are subtle differences. One evident one is that the
English Toy Terrier must exhibit ‘candle flame’ ears. Further, the breed standard of the English Toy
Terrier is often interpreted to describe a lighter, finer dog than the type acceptable under the Toy
Manchester Terrier breed standard.

History

Facing Extinction

Because the English Toy Terrier is facing extinction, the Kennel Club (UK) has opened its Stud Book to
allow Toy Manchester Terriers which fit the breed standard of the English Toy Terrier to be transferred
to English Toy Terrier breed clubs. Many owners in Great Britain are against this decision; others see it
as the only way to preserve the breed.

The Entlebucher Mountain Dog is a breed of dog in the Swiss mountain dog family of breeds. It is also
known as the Entlebucher Sennenhund, Entelbuch Mountain Dog, Entelbucher Cattle Dog and
similar combinations. This breed was used originally for driving and guarding cattle.

Appearance
Entlebuchers are always tricolor (black, tan, and white). For show dogs, the markings should be
symmetrical. The dog weighs 55-60 pounds (25-30 kg) and stands about 19 to 20 inches (48-51 cm) at
the shoulder.

Temperament
These muscular dogs are good guard dogs but are also excellent with children.

History




                           Entlebucher with a favorite toy

Like all of the Swiss mountain dogs, its origins are ancient, probably dating back to Roman times, but
today's breed standards were solidified in the 1800s when Franz Schertenleib made a concerted effort to
track down, identify, and breed this small mountain dog. The breed is named for the Swiss town of
Entlebuch in Lucerne.

The Estrela Mountain Dog is a breed of dog that has been used to guard herds in the Estrela mountains
for centuries.

History
The earliest of the Estrela’s ancestors were herd-guarding dogs in the Serra de Estrela, in what is now
Portugal. Since there are no written records, it is not known for sure whether they were brought by the
Romans when they colonized the Iberian Peninsula, or later by the invading Visigoths. Regardless, there
is no disagreement that the Estrela is one of the oldest breeds in Portugal.
Those early guardian dogs were not the distinct breed we know today. Rather, the Estrela developed
over a period of hundreds of years. Shepherds would have chosen to breed the dogs that had the
characteristics necessary to survive in their mountain environment and to do their job: large size,
strength, endurance, agility, a deep chest, ability to tolerate a marginal diet, the set of the legs, a
powerful mouth, a tuft of hair around the neck, an easy, jog-like gait, a warm coat, and a watchful,
mistrustful, yet loyal temperament. Since the region was isolated, there was little breeding with non-
native dogs, leading to the purity of the breed.

Life changed little for the people and dogs of the region, even into the 20th century. The isolation of the
region meant the breed was relatively unknown outside it until the early 1900’s, and even then, they
were mostly ignored in early dog shows. The Portuguese admired foreign breeds much more than their
own. Shepherds often castrated their dogs to prevent them from leaving their flocks to mate. These
factors were having a negative effect on the Estrela. So from 1908 to 1919, special shows called
concursos were held to promote and preserve the Estrela breed in the region. During this period there
was some attempt at a registry (of which there is no surviving record). Special livestock guardian
working trials were included in these shows. The trial consisted of an owner/shepherd bringing his dog
into a large field with many flocks of sheep. The dog was observed by judges for it’s reactions coming
into the field and as the shepherd was ordered to move the flock, which inevitably produced stragglers.
The dog was expected to move from his spot of guarding to bring the stragglers back, and then assume a
leadership position at the head of the flock.

Breed standards
The first, tentative, recorded breed standard was published in 1922. This standard just reflected the
functional features naturally found in the best dogs of the time, although it did mention the dew claws as
reflecting a “perfect” dog. The hooked tail and the turned-back ears, which later became part of the
official standard, were not mentioned.

The first official breed standard was written in 1933. This standard attempted to differentiate the Estrela
as a distinct breed. This led to the hooked tail and double dew claws becoming a requirement. All colors
were allowed. The standard has undergone small refinements since then. For example, dew claws
became optional by 1955, and the allowed colors have been limited a few times to achieve today’s
current set.

Prior to World War II, the Estrela’s breeders were still primarily the shepherds and farmers of the
region. Since they were mostly illiterate, they did not make any attempt to follow the official breed
standard, if they even knew one existed. But by the early 1950’s, interest in the breed returned, and the
annual concursos were reinstated. Again the intent was to stimulate interest among the Serra residents
and to encourage them to adhere to the official standard. During this period, the long-haired variety was
most popular at shows, but “show dogs” represented (and still do) only a small portion of the Estrela
population in Portugal. Many of the working dogs were (and are) short-haired.
Early in the 1970s, interest was steeply declining. There was some concern about the degeneration and
even possible extinction of the breed. But the Portuguese revolution of 1974 helped save the Estrela. It
led to changes both in dog shows in Portugal and in Portuguese dog breeds. Prior to the revolution, dog
showing had largely been a pastime of the wealthy, with their preference for non-Portuguese breeds as
status symbols. Now, working people could and did show the native dogs they preferred. Also, with the
revolution came an increase in crime and thus more interest in guard dogs.

There is no record of Estrelas outside Portugal prior to 1972. While some undoubtedly did leave the
country, they were probably interbred with no effort to maintain the breed. In 1972 and 1973, pairs were
imported to the U.S. Others were probably imported into the U.S. since then, but it was not until 1998
that the first EMDAA recognized dog was brought over to the U.S. The United Kingdom was the first
country to establish the breed outside Portugal in 1972. Today the Estrela can be found in many
countries.

Today, the Estrela Mountain Dog remains true to its guardian heritage. It is still a working dog, guarding
flocks in its native Portugal and elsewhere. The Portuguese use them as police dogs. It is also an ideal
family pet because of its alertness, loyalty, intelligence, and it’s instinct to nurture young; all features it
needed in its earliest days.

Appearance
The breed exists in two forms, the long- and the shorthaired one. They weigh between 66 and 110
pounds and grow to a height of 24.5 to 28.5 inches.

Temperament
They are very protective of their property and family, friendly with children, but suspicious of any
strangers, and can be stubborn.

The Eurasier, sometimes referred to as the Eurasian, is a breed of dog that is relatively unknown in
America, but in Europe it is widely known as a wonderful companion that maintains his own
personality, has a dignified reserve to strangers, a strong bond to its family and that is relatively easy to
train.

Appearance
The Eurasier is a balanced, well-constructed, medium-sized Spitz (Spitzen) type dog with prick ears. It
comes in different colors: fawn, red, wolf-grey, black, and black and tan. All color combinations are
allowed, except for pure white, white patches, and liver color. Fédération Cynologique Internationale
(FCI) standards call for the Eurasier to have a thick undercoat and medium-long, loosely lying guard
hair all over the body, with a short coat on the muzzle, face, ears, and front legs. The tail and the back of
the front legs (feathers) and hind legs (breeches) should be covered with long hair. The coat on the
Eurasier's neck should be slightly longer than on the body, but not forming a mane. The breed may have
a pink, blue-black or spotted tongue.

The male has a height of 52 to 60 cm (20-24 inches) at the withers and weighs approximately 23 to 32
kg (50-70 lbs).

The female has a height of 48 to 56 cm (16-18 inches) at the withers and weighs anywhere from 18 to 26
kg (40-60 lbs).

Temperament




Eurasiers are calm, even-tempered dogs. They are watchful and alert, yet reserved towards strangers
without being timid or aggressive. Eurasiers form a strong link to their families and are fond of children.
For the full development of these qualities, the Eurasier needs constant close contact with its family,
combined with understanding, yet consistent, training. They are extremely sensitive to harsh words or
discipline and respond best to soft reprimand. The Eurasier is a combination of the best qualities of the
Chow Chow, the Wolfspitz, and the Samoyed, resulting in a dignified, intelligent breed.

Eurasiers are not suitable as working dogs. Training should always be done through family members,
not through strangers or handlers. Eurasiers should never be restricted to only a yard, kennel, crate, or
chained up. They would pine and become depressed. This breed enjoys all kinds of activities for all the
family, e.g. agility. Eurasiers are calm and quiet indoors, outdoors they are lively and enjoy action.

History




                                 Eurasier puppy with "wolf grey" coat

Eurasiers originated in Germany in 1960, when the founder, Julius Wipfel, set out together with
Charlotte Baldamus and a small group of enthusiasts to create a breed with the best qualities of the
Chow-Chow and the Wolfspitz. The initial combination of the breeds resulted in what was first called
"Wolf-Chow" and then, twelve years later, after crossing with a Samoyed, was renamed
"Eurasier" (Eurasian) and recognized by the FCI in 1973. Nobel Laureate Konrad Lorenz obtained a
Eurasier puppy from Charlotte Baldamus, Nanette vom Jaegerhof, whom he called "Babett". He thought
her character was the best he had ever known in a dog.

Today, unethical breeders sometimes try to pass off a Keeshond/Chow-Chow mix as a Eurasier. While
they are genetically similar, these mixes cannot be classified as Eurasiers.

Eurasiers are still a comparably young breed. The three Eurasier Clubs in the German Kennel Club
VDH / FCI —EKW, KZG, and ZG—therefore strongly direct and supervise breeding in Germany. A
group of very dedicated European Eurasier Clubs have joined together in the International Federation for
Eurasier Breeding (IFEZ) in the FCI. Eurasier puppies bred according to these sound IFEZ guidelines
receive an IFEZ certificate.

A eurohound is a cross between an Alaskan husky and a pointer. It was created in Scandinavia. It is one
of the most formidable sled dogs in the world, combining the husky's ability to work in snow and a
pointer's energetic nature. The only problem is that its coat sometimes cannot sustain the amount of
snow and cold required for racing because it doesn't have a double coat like the other sled dog breeds.

The Fila Brasileiro (or Brazilian Mastiff) is a large working breed of dog developed in Brazil.


Appearance
The Fila Brasileiro is large and heavyset, with a powerful structure and large head. The breed standard is
for males to be between 65 and 75 cm (27 - 29.5 in) at the shoulder with a minimum weight of 50 kg
(100 lb). Females are slightly smaller at 60 to 70 cm (24 - 27.5 in) with a minimum weight of 40 kg (90
lb).

Coat

The coat of the Fila Brasileiro is smooth and short. Most solid or brindled colours are permitted except
mouse-grey and white. Patchy or dappled coats are outside the breed standard, although some white
markings are permitted on the feet, chest, and the tip of the tail.

Temperament
The breed is considered by owners to have a calm and loyal temperament. However, its power and
strength, along with a reputation for aggressiveness and irritability in some situations (particularly
around strangers), have led to this breed being banned or restricted in some countries. The breed is one
of the four specifically mentioned in the UK's Dangerous Dogs Act 1991.


History
Its origins are not well known, but it is believed to have been developed from various breeds including
the English Mastiff and the Bloodhound; the latter contributing to the Fila's baggy skin. They are often
used as guard dogs, tracking dogs, and guide dogs.

                             Notes



A Finnish Spitz is a breed of dog originating in Finland. The breed is thought to be an old one, bred as a
hunting dog. It is a "bark pointer", indicating the position of game by barking to attract the hunter's
attention. It has been used mostly to bark at game that flees into trees, such as squirrels, grouses, and
capercaillies, but it serves well also to hunt elk. Some individuals have been known to go after even a
bear, despite the dog's small size. In its native country, the breed is still mostly used as a hunting dog,
but as it is very friendly and loves children, in other countries it serves mainly as a house pet. The
Finnish Spitz has been the national dog of Finland since 1979.

Appearance

General appearance

The Finnish Spitz has a square build, meaning that the length of the body is approximately the same as
the height of the withers. The thick coat may distort the over-all appearance of the dog. He should have
rounded, cat-like feet and dew claws on all four feet, although the rear dew claws are always removed in
show specimens. The Finnish Spitz should have a very chiseled and sharp appearance, with a face and
expression resembling that of a fox and the typical Spitz tail that curls over the back.

Coat

The Finnish Spitz has a typical double coat, which consists of a soft, dense undercoat and long, harsh
guard hairs that can measure one to two inches long. The coat should be stiffer, denser, and longer on
the neck, back, back of thighs, and plume of the tail, whilst shorter on the head and legs. Dogs should
sport a slightly longer and coarser coat than the bitches, who are slightly more refined. In the show ring,
the coat should be shown as completely natural; a brush through the coat is acceptable but no trimming
is allowed, not even of whiskers. The one exception is the hair under the pads of the feet. Silky, wavy,
long, or short coat is also greatly undesired.

Colour

Puppies are often described as looking similar to a fox cub. They are born dark grey or fawn, with a vast
amount of black. The colour of the adult dog cannot really be assessed until about four months, but even
then the colour may change. The adult colour must be red. It can be of almost any shade, varying from
pale honey to dark chestnut. There are no preferences over shades as long as the color is bright and clear
with no hints of dullness, which is of most importance. The coat should never be of a solid colour. It
should be shaded and without any defined colour changes. The coat is usually at its darkest shade on the
back of the dog, gradually getting lighter around the chest and belly. The undercoat must always be
lighter in colour than the topcoat, but is never allowed to be white. A small patch of white, no more than
1.5 centimetres wide, is allowable on the chest, and white tips on the feet are acceptable, but not desired.

Pigmentation

The nose, lips, and rims of eyes should always be black.

Height and weight

     ●   Height at withers

         Dogs, 17½ to 20 inches (43-50 cm)
         Bitches, 15½ to 18 inches (39-45 cm)

     ●   Weight

         Dogs, 31-36 lbs
         Bitches, 23-29 lbs

Temperament
Finnish Spitz are a lively, faithful, and intelligent breed of dog. They love playing with children, and are
excellent companion dogs, which makes them an ideal family pet. They rarely show aggression unless
needed (they are a breed who like to protect their family) but they do love the sound of their own voices.
Careful training will need to be undertaken to teach him that his barking is both unnecessary and
unwanted, although the barking does come in useful if you are looking for a watchdog, as the Finnish
Spitz will very happily locate anything that is out of the ordinary and alert their owners to it.

Because of his intelligence, he is an independent and strong-willed dog and is best trained with a soft
voice and touch. He will easily become bored with repetitive training and so sessions should be kept
short and to the point, making patience a must-have for any owner. This trait, unfortunately, makes him
a poor choice for obedience training, which is a shame, as those who have persevered in training this
breed have gained an obedient dog who excels in competitions.

Health
The Finnish Spitz is typically a very healthy breed, and health concerns are rare. Here is a short list of
what is known to occur:

    ●   Hip dysplasia
    ●   Patellar luxation
    ●   Elbow dysplasia
    ●   Epilepsy

          Fox Terrier (Smooth)
                                             The Smooth Fox Terrier is a breed of dog, one of many
                                             terrier breeds. It was the first breed in the fox terrier
                                             family to be given official recognition (by The Kennel
                                             Club [London] circa 1875; breed standard 1876). It is
                                             well known, and although not a widely popular breed
                                             today outside of hunting and show circles, it is extremely
                                             significant due to the large number of terriers believed
                                             descended from it.

approximately 18 lbs.

The tail should be set well up on the back and be straight or slightly curved, but not carried over the
back or curled like an Akita's.

Its coat is hard, flat, and abundant. This breed does shed somewhat. In color they should be
predominantly white—some are even all white—but typically with markings of black and tan, black, or
tan. Red, liver, or brindle are objectionable and disqualifying faults in the show ring. Heads are usually
solid colored, but a variety of white markings are permissible, including half or split faces, blazes, or
color only over the eyes and/or ears.

Temperament




                                 A Smooth Fox Terrier with black markings

Smooth Fox Terriers make excellent family pets. Because this is an intelligent and active breed, they
must be kept exercised, and interested, and a part of the family. They are affectionate and playful. They
have well-developed hunting instincts. Left to their own devices and deprived of human companionship,
undesirable behaviour may be exhibited, including chasing of small animals, barking, and digging. Like
most terriers, Smooth Fox Terriers become bored, destructive, or escape artists if ignored.

History
The Smooth Fox Terrier was developed in England and is believed to descend from a mixture of the
smooth-coated Black and Tan Terrier, the Greyhound, the Bull Terrier, and the Beagle.

The Wire Fox Terrier is a breed of dog, one of many
terrier breeds. It is an instantly recognizable fox terrier
breed. Although it bears a resemblance to the Smooth
Fox Terrier, they are believed to have been developed
separately.

Appearance
This is a sturdy, balanced dog weighing up to 21 pounds.
Its rough, broken coat is distinctive. The coat colour is
predominantly white; brindle or liver markings are a
disqualification.                                                   Fox Terrier in the snow

The Wire-Haired Fox Terrier was developed in England          AKC:      Terrier
by fox hunting enthusiasts and is believed descended          ANKC: Group 2 (Terriers)
from a now-extinct rough-coated, black-and-tan working        CKC:  Group 4 - Terriers
terrier of Wales, Derbyshire, and Durham.

The Wire-Haired Fox Terrier was not popular as a family        NZKC: Terrier
pet until the 1930s, when The Thin Man series of feature       UKC:       Terrier
films was created. Asta, the canine member of the
Charles family, was a Wire-Haired Fox Terrier, and the popularity of the breed soared. Milou (Snowy)
from the Tintin comic strip is also a Fox Terrier.

In the late 20th century, the popularity of the breed declined again, most likely due to changing living
conditions in the Western world and the difficulty of keeping hunting terriers in cities due to their strong
instincts. Among the less desirable traits of all fox terriers are their energy, digging, stalking, and
chasing of other animals and yelping bark.




This notwithstanding, the Wire Fox Terrier has the distinction of having received more Best in Show
titles at major dog shows than any other breed.

                                 The honey pied coat is a fairly rare coloring.

Appearance
French Bulldogs average 22 to 25 pounds (10 to 12 kg) and are considered out-of-breed if they are over
28 pounds (13 kg). Their physical appearance is characterized by naturally occurring 'bat ears' that are
pointy and stick straight up. Their tails are naturally short, not cropped. Otherwise, their body shape is
similar to that of an English Bulldog.

There are several color variations allowed by the AKC that are disallowed in Europe, including the
cream color. French Bulldogs have their own variations in the amount of brindle, darkness of their coat,
and amount of white areas.

Temperament
The French Bulldog is a gentle breed that typically has a happy-go-lucky attitude. Like many other
companion dog breeds they have high energy and prefer interaction with humans to interaction with
other dogs. They do well around other dogs and small children, though they should be monitored closely
during their initial encounters; they tend to shy away from teasing or rough play. They tend to not bark a
lot and are of small size; these qualities may make them a good candidate for apartment living.

Health
European French Bulldogs typically are born naturally, while North American French Bulldogs are born
by Caesarean section.
                                 Brindle is a more common color for the French Bulldog

Due to the nature of their short windpipe, they tend to have breathing difficulties, and can easily suffer
problems in hot weather as a result. For the same reason, veterinarians consider them difficult to intubate
for surgery. Otherwise, they are generally considered a healthier breed than the English Bulldog, with a
lower occurrence of problems such as hip dysplasia. Like their larger cousin the English Bulldog, French
Bulldogs are prone to gastro-intestinal problems such as gas. The facial wrinkles often trap dirt, tears,
and mucous, and can become irritated and infected.

Life expectancy is 10 to 12 years.

History
The breed emerged as English Bulldogs were bred with Toy Bulldogs by the artisan community in Paris,
after Toy Bulldogs were marginalized by British kennel clubs as weakening the English Bulldog breed.
Toy Bulldogs were popular amongst the artisan and gay communities in Britain. The breeding of the
minuscule Toy Bulldog (averaging 8 pounds (3.5 kg)) and the English Bulldog (which can vary in size,
but is usually around 50 pounds (23 kg)) produced the medium-sized French Bulldog.

The German Shorthaired Pointer is a breed of dog developed in the 1800s in Germany for hunting.
This gun dog was developed by crossing an older German Pointer breed with the English Pointer to
create a lean, athletic, and responsive breed. Some authorities consider it to be the most versatile of all
gun dogs and its intelligence and affectionate nature make it a popular companion dog for active owners.

Appearance
The German Shorthaired Pointer's coat is short, flat, thick, and harsh. It is dense enough to be water-
resistant. The color can be liver (often called chestnut), black (although any area of black is cause for
disqualifiction in American Kennel Club and Canadian Kennel Club sanctioned shows), or either color
with white. Commonly the head is a solid or nearly solid color and the body is white that is speckled or
ticked with liver or black, with saddles or large patches of solid color. Roan coats also occur and, rarely,
yellow coloring (dogs with any area of yellow will also be disqualified in AKC and CKC shows).

It has moderately long flop ears set high on the head. Its muzzle is long, broad, and strong, allowing it to
retrieve even heavy furred game. Its tail is commonly docked, although this is now prohibited in some
countries.

The breed is lean, athletic, and graceful yet powerful, with strong hindquarters that make it able to move
rapidly and turn quickly. Various breed standards set its height at the withers anywhere between 21 and
26 inches (53 to 65 cm), making this a large breed. Adults typically weigh from 55 to 70 lbs (25 to 32
kg), with the bitch usually slightly shorter and lighter than the male.

Temperament
This variety of German Pointer can be shy; however, it is usually good with children and is affectionate
and loyal, making it a good companion dog. These dogs crave interaction and have been referred to as
"velcro dogs" often needing to be in physical contact with a member of their human family or very
nearby, sometime almost underfoot. It needs plenty of vigorous activity, so it is not a good pet for an
inactive home. The breed generally gets along well with other dogs. Some Shorthaired Pointers make
good watchdogs, but others are too good-natured.
Like the other German Pointers—the German Wirehaired Pointer and the German Longhaired Pointer—
this is one of the few hunting breeds that can perform virtually all gundog roles. It is pointer and
retriever, bird dog and water dog, can be used for hunting larger and more dangerous game, and in
addition has a scent hound's talented nose. It is an excellent swimmer but also works well in rough
terrain. It is tenacious, tireless, hardy, and reliable. In short, it is a superb all-around field dog that
remains popular with hunters of many nationalities.

This is an intelligent and trainable breed. Like most intelligent dogs, it can have a mind of its own and so
the breed requires training to ensure that it understands that the owner is in charge. Along with its superb
hunting ability and companionable personality, its intelligence and biddability (trainability) continue to
make this one of the more popular large breeds.

Health
The Shorthaired Pointer is generally a healthy breed. Seizures have been a problem in some lines, and a
few individuals may suffer from hip dysplasia, genetic eye diseases, or skin cancer. Like all dogs with
flop ears, it can be prone to ear infections and its ears require regular checking and cleaning. It has a
longer life expectancy than many breeds of this size, commonly living 12 to 14 years.

Care

Its short coat needs very little grooming, just occasional brushing. The dog should be bathed only when
needed.

As it is a large, active breed, it can require considerable food; however, it can also become obese if too
much food is given for its activity level.

History
The German Shorthaired Pointer is descended from the old Spanish Pointer, which was taken to
Germany in the 1600s. From that time until the first studbook was created in 1870, however, it is
impossible to identify all of the dogs that went into creating this breed. Most-likely candidates for its
ancestors include local German breeds such as other hunting dogs and scent hounds, the Bloodhound,
the Foxhound, various French hounds, assorted Scandinavian breeds, the German Bird Dog, and the
Italian Pointer. In the late 1800s, breeders added the English Pointer to the lines, rounding out the
breed's all-around utility.

Miscellaneous
On February 15, 2005, a German Shorthaired Pointer, "Ch Kan-Point's VJK Autumn Roses" (callname
Carlee), took the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show's prize for Best in Show.

                           Notes
The German Spitz is a dog breed or group of dog breeds of the Spitz type.


Types
There are five different types of German Spitz:

     ●   Wolfspitz (Keeshond - considered a separate breed in many countries)
     ●   Grossspitz (Giant Spitz)
     ●   Mittelspitz (Medium/Standard Spitz)
     ●   Kleinspitz (Small Spitz)
     ●   Zwerspitz (Dwarf/Midget Spitz also known as Pomeranian - considered a separate breed in many
         countries)

Most kennel clubs recognise only the Klein and Mittel varieties of German Spitz and consider the
Pomeranian (Zwerspitz) and Keeshond (Wolfspitz) as separate breeds. In many countries the Miniature
(Klein) spitz is also confused with the Pomeranians (Zwers).

Appearance
German Spitz are similar in appearance but vary in color. The Giant Spitz can only be black, white, or
brown but the Standard, Small and Dwarf can have various color combinations as well.[2]. All German
Spitz have a fox like head, double coat, highset triangular ears and a tail that curls up and rests on top of
the body. Although the Small Spitz and the Pomeranian look alike they are not the same dog.


History
German Spitz are descendants of the ancient spitzes found in the Stone Age and they are the oldest breed
of dog in Central Europe. [3]

                             Notes



The Giant Schnauzer is a large, powerful, compact breed of dog. It is one of several Schnauzer breeds.
It is a fairly large breed which needs a lot of exercise, making it unsuitable for owners who don't have
time for long walks.

Appearance
The Giant Schnauzer has a harsh, wiry outer coat and dense, soft undercoat. Coat color is typically black
but can also be pepper-and-salt. It weighs between 70 and 99 lb (32-45 kg) and stands 23.5 to 27.5 in (59
to 70 cm) at the withers.

When moving at a fast trot, a properly built Giant Schnauzer will single-track. Back remains strong,
firm, and flat.

Temperament
The Giant Schnauzer is a large, powerful, dominant dog which needs a firm and consistant handler. It
also needs a tremendous amount of exercise to prevent it from becoming bored and destructive.

Early and consistent training is necessary as the Giant Schnauzer tends to be obstinate and very willful.
Its ability to understand a command doesn't always translate into obedience.

They can become dog aggressive as they mature. If you are thinking of adding a second dog to your
family, it's best to get a puppy or rescue of the opposite gender.

Health
This breed used to be generally hardy; however, recently more auto-immune diseases have cropped up
in this breed. Arthritis does occur in shoulders or hips. Its life expectancy is about 11 or 12 years. Before
buying or adopting a Giant Schnauzer one should consider if he or she is able to afford potential
expensive vet bills.

Other health problems in the breed include:

     ●   Autoimmune diseases (hypothyroidism, Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) (also called
         Immune Mediated Hemolytic Anemia (IMHA)), SLO, Crohn's disease, and so on)
    ●   Epilepsy
    ●   Hip dysplasia
    ●   Incontinence
    ●   Toe cancer

History
The breed originated in the Middle Ages in Germany by selectively breeding the Standard Schnauzer for
larger and larger sizes. In earlier centuries it was a popular herding breed, but its need for more food
than some breeds made it less popular for farmers on tight budgets or with limited resources.

Its popularity grew again in the latter part of the 19th century, when it was used as a drover and as a
guard dog.

                           Notes
The term Goldendoodle (Golden Doodle) describes a hybrid dog, crossbred between a Golden Retriever
and a Poodle. This hybrid is often said to have begun in Australia, along with the Labradoodle; US
fanciers challenge this assertion. Poodle hybrids have become increasingly popular and it is likely that
the combination of Golden Retriever and Poodle has been duplicated by breeders in various countries.

Purpose of the Goldendoodle
The Goldendoodle, like the Labradoodle and many other Poodle cross breeds, was bred to produce a
very low shedding assistance dog for challenged individuals who need such a dog, but who suffer from
allergies to shedding hair or have other problems with excessive shedding. While the Goldendoodle is
typically a low-shedding hybrid, it does shed to some degree. The Goldendoodle hybrid works well for
many allergy sufferers; however, one can be allergic to an animal's saliva or its dander. While some
breeders claim that the Goldendoodle is a hypoallergenic canine, allergists believe that there is no such
thing as a hypoallergenic animal. There have been no studies to date verifying whether any canine is
completly hypoallergenic.

Appearance




                                          A one-year-old Goldendoodle.

There are currently no size classifications for the Goldendoodle. It is difficult for a hybrid litter to "breed
true"; that is, it is difficult to know exactly what size a Goldendoodle or Labradoodle will grow to as an
adult, regardless of parental size. However, Goldendoodles are usually described as either Standard or
Mini. A standard Goldendoodle is the result of crossbreeding with a standard-sized Poodle. A mini
Goldendoodle is the result of crossbreeding with a miniature Poodle, although some mini Goldendoodles
grow beyond their intended size. The Goldendoodle can come in many different colors, depending on
the poodle genes passed onto the pup. Truly golden Goldendoodles are more popular than other colors,
and are more expensive. However, Goldendoodles can be tan, black, or a mix. Black Goldendoodles are
fairly common and less expensive than golden offspring. A mix of colors can come from the same litter.

Temperament
The Goldendoodle is a loving, loyal dog and has a keen sense of smell. They can be taught to enjoy
swimming, as both the retriever and Poodle parts of their ancestry normally enjoy water. Goldendoodles
are intelligent, friendly, and great with kids, just like their Golden Retriever and Standard Poodle
parents. They are easily trained, highly social, and by nature are easy with strangers and other dogs.
They love to play, and retain the strong retrieving instincts of the Golden Retriever, and love fetching
sticks, balls, Frisbees, etc.

Breed or mixed breed debate
The Goldendoodle is not a purebred; rather, it is a specific type of mixed-breed dog or "crossbreed". As
such, it is not accepted for registration by mainstream registries of purebred dogs such as the American
Kennel Club or United Kennel Club. A true club will only register dogs with a provable pedigree.

Some breeders allege that the Goldendoodle standard is an F1 (first generation) pairing between
purebred Poodle and Golden Retriever parents. Other breeders maintain a looser definition and include
under the classification what's known as an F1 backcross Goldendoodle, or F1-B. This dog results from
a union of Goldendoodle plus Poodle or Goldendoodle plus Golden Retriever parents. Those marketing
F1-B puppies resulting from an F1 paired with a Poodle typically maintain that such animals achieve the
same hypoallergenic qualities as the purebred Poodle.

There are yet other breeders attempting to stabilize the Goldendoodle as an actual breed. To do so they
must attempt to lock the breeding pool according to the definition of one of the registration entities.
Then, according to this classification only those offspring from parings of animals within this set will be
considered representatives of the breed. This carries the risk that the gene pool might be narrowed too
drastically, increasing the probability of genetic problems that might only reveal themselves as the dogs
mature. On the other hand, all modern breeds have been developed in exactly this way, by limiting the
parental pool in order to isolate targeted characteristics of structure, color, and aptitude.

Gordon Setters are a medium sized breed of dog, a member of the setter family that also includes the
more-common Irish Setters and English Setters. Physically and behaviourally these three breeds are
similar.

Appearance
Gordon setters are coal-black with tan features, in comparison to Irish setters, which are red, and English
setters, which are white with speckles. Gordons have tan on their feet and lower legs, vents, and
muzzles, and two distinctive tan spots on their chests. Their coat is long and silky on chest, ears,
stomach, and leg feathering, and slightly wavy. They are the heaviest of the setter breeds, and the
slowest, with males reaching 27 in at the shoulder.

Historically, Gordon Setters did not have the long, flowing coat as seen today. In the early 1800s, a
Gordon Setter was not necessarily black and tan. Dogs from the Duke of Gordon kennel were found in
black and tan, black and white, and black, white, and tan.

Temperament
Setters are often said to be stupid. In reality, however, they are very intelligent in being able to figure out
how to get out of enclosures and the like. The perception of stupidity probably relates to their fairly
contemptuous attitude towards conventional dog obedience. Gordon Setters are intensely loyal to their
owners but can take a few minutes to warm to strangers. They are good family dogs, laid-back and
loving, though not recommended with small children as they can be boisterous.

They are usually quite passive and seem happy lying around sleeping all day. However, when out on a
walk they are frisky and in the countryside seem to be able to run for hours. They require 60 to 80
minutes of exercise a day, though care must be taken not to over-exercise young dogs (under 18 months)
to avoid joint problems in later life.

Gordons in particular are sensitive but kindly, and need gentle but firm handling. Any nervous
tendencies can be cured by early socialization, which is very important.
Health
This breed generally lives about 10 to 12 years.

                             Notes



The Greenland Dog is a large breed of dog bred as a sled dog. This is an ancient breed, thought to be
directly descended from dogs brought to Greenland by the first Inuit settlers more than 4,000 years ago.

Appearance
The Greenland Dog is a powerful, heavy-built dog. It has a broad, wedge-shaped head, slightly tilted
eyes and small, triangular ears covered with thick fur that prevents frostbite. It has strong, muscular,
short-haired legs. The tail is usually rolled along/across its back, but it may also hang down in a wolf
like manner. When it lays down and curls up to rest, the tail often covers the nose. Its coat is middle
length and consists of two layers. The inner layer consists of short wool like fur, the outer layer of
longer, coarser, water-repellant fur. The thick, stand-off outer coat and dense underwool allow them to
withstand constant outdoor living in temperatures that can reach -50 or even -75 degrees Fahrenheit.

A characteristic of most Greenland Dogs is the "úlo", a triangular shaped area on the shoulders. It is
named after a common woman’s-knife from Greenland which is of the same shape.

Dogs are significantly larger than bitches at between 58 and 68 cm (23-27 in) at the withers; bitches are
between 51 and 61 cm (20-24 in).

History
The Greenlanders used this dog-breed as a sled-dog, and it is still used for that purpose. It is also the dog
that is closest related to the wolf. The Greenland Dog is closely related to other northern hauling
huskies. At one time, there were dozens of breeds and varieties, but many have disappeared due to
modern use of snowmobiles and other machinery, which has supplanted the use of these dogs. Much
crossing of types occurred as the modern settling of northern areas provided contact between previously
remote areas. The Greenland Dog is one of the breeds saved and fostered by fanciers, especially in the
Scandinavian countries. Sadly, the breed is no longer as numerous as before, even in its native
environment.

Before use of the more recent method of chaining sled dogs when not working, the practice among the
natives was to keep them tethered with thongs of seal hide. Of course, dogs chewed through their ties, so
most working sled dogs had their incisors broken (the small cutting teeth in the front of the canines),
which necessitated cutting their meat. Since most of the dogs were fed frozen meat or fish, the rations
were chopped into small pieces which could be swallowed whole. In The Voyage of the Fox., McClin-
tock recalls how he once cut 65 pounds of seal meat into small pieces, and his 29 hungry Eskimo dogs
devoured every morsel in 42 seconds!

Greenland Dogs were also used by the natives as hunting dogs, utilizing their keen sense of smell to find
seals' breathing holes in the ice. Once the hole was found, the dog and master sat back to wait, as sooner
or later the seal came up for air and it would be speared. In the summer months, the dogs carried
backpacks of supplies up to 33 pounds.

Temperament
The breed remains principally a working dog. They have the typical Nordic, good, loyal, affectionate
temperament, but when the dogs work in teams, they don't have the opportunity to develop a relationship
with one master. They are independent and self-willed, and rowdy and boisterous in their play. One must
immediately show these pack dogs who is the alpha male or they will try and take charge to fill that gap.
Like the Siberian Husky, the Greenland Dog has a tendency to attack and kill small animals, like cats,
squirrels and rabbits. It is also little suspicious when it comes to strangers. Training must be firm, but
gentle and it takes a lot of patience as the Greenland breed still retains a lot of its wolf-like qualities. The
Greenland Dog is not a good first-time dog, since it takes one who really understands dog behaviour.

                            Notes
The Griffon Bruxellois covers three unified breed standards,
 except in the FCI, where they remain separate types with
       the same standard except for coat and colour.

The Griffon Bruxellois or Brussels Griffon is a breed of dog, named for the city of their origin,
Brussels, Belgium. Part of the toy dog category, the breed is generally small, with a flat face, prominent
chin, and large wide-set eyes that gives the Griffon an almost human expression—and they are often
compared to an Ewok.
Appearance
The Griffon Bruxellois is really three dogs rolled into one, the Griffon Bruxellois, the Griffon Belge and
the Petit Brabançon. Identical in standard except for coat and colour differences, in most standards they
are considered varieties of the same breed, much like Belgian Sheepdogs.

A sturdy toy dog with a thick set, well balanced body, that should give a squared appearance in
proportion when viewed from the side. A proper Griffon should be muscular, compact and well-boned,
and should not seem delicate, racy or overly cobby. The Griffon will often feel heavier than it is for such
a small size. Because they are judged by weight rather than shoulder height, proper proportioning is
essential to determine if a dog is too fat, too slim or too tall for their size.

Weight standards, especially upper range disqualification, vary from standards, but the ideal weight is
3.6–4.5 kg (8–10 lb) for both sexes.

The neck is medium length and arched slightly. The chest is deep, and the back level. The tail, either
cropped to one-third it's length or natural in standards than allow for that, should be set high, and when
showing, should express the alert, keen demeanor of the breed. Kinked tails are not uncommon in the
breed, and cannot be shown unless they can be cropped below the kink to standard.

Head

The head is the most important characteristic of this breed, and the most well defined aspect of the
standard.

The rounded head should be large to the body, but should not appear to unbalance the dog. Depending
on the standard, the forehead will be referred to as "rounded" or "domed". In either case, the appearance
or the skull should be of a circle (minus the features of the muzzle) rather than an oval, and the forehead
should not bulge or protrude.

The ears should be high set but well apart, small, and carried semi-erect if natural. They can be cropped;
no preference is given.

The dark, wide set, black rimmed eyes are very large and expressive, giving the face its essential human-
like qualities. They should be prominent but not bulging.

The nose is broad with wide nostrils, black, and set at the same level as the eyes. There should be a very
pronounced stop, and the muzzle between the nose and forehead should not be more than 1.5 cm in
length. Many standards prefer the stop to be so strong as to leave no visible distance between the nose
and forehead. The nose should angle upwards. The muzzle from nose to chin should not be in line with
the face, instead, it should slope towards the skull, giving a turned up or layback look. The broad chin
should be undershot and prominent, sweeping up to the lips.

The lips should be black, and close fitting. The top lip is short under the nose, and should not overlap the
bottom lip, nor should teeth or tongue should be visible. The upper lips should not be pendulous in any
way. The teeth should be strong and straight, with none missing or askew.

Coat

In the Griffon Bruxellois and the Griffon Belge, the coat is wiry and harsh. It should be dense, short
enough not to disrupt the form of the dog over the body, and long enough to distinguish the texture and
type from the Petit Brabançon. Furnishings around the face form a fringe around the eyes, cheeks and
chin, but should not be allowed to grow into a long, flowing beard. Rather, they accentuate the natural
form of the chin and cheeks. The eyebrow, moustache and beard look is essential to the human-like
expression sought after in the breed. There may be some furnishings around the legs as well, though
shorter than the head.

In the Petit Brabançon, the coat is short, smooth, glossy, and flat, rather like a Pug or Boston Terrier.

Colour

Griffon Bruxellois: Red or reddish-brown; black allowed on muzzle.

Griffon Belge: Black, Black and tan (a black and tan pattern with emphasis on a rich red shade), Black
and red (black mixed evenly with reddish-brown hairs). Black and red may have a black face mask.

Petit Brabançon: All colours allowed for the other standards. Until recently, black short may have been a
fault, but it is now allowed in all standards. A black mask is expected on the red or reddish brown coat.
Grey hair from age is not penalized.

Temperament
The Griffon Bruxellois is known to be a bit sensitive, to have a huge heart, and to have a strong desire to
snuggle and be with his or her master. They have an air of self-importance that can be especially
charming. A Griffon should not be overly shy or aggressive, however, they are very emotionally
sensitive. Because of this, they should be socialized carefully at a young age. They will be alert and
interested in their surroundings.

Griffons tend to bond with one human more than others, and because of this, along with their small size,
may not be suitable as a family pet, especially one with very small children. They tend to get along well
with other animals in the house, such as cats, dogs and ferrets, but can get into trouble because they have
no concept of size, and will attempt to boss around dogs much larger than themselves.
Having a Griffon means having a true constant companion. They need their favorite person all the time,
and will be very unhappy if left outdoors or alone most of the day. A Griffon Bruxellois will want to
follow you about the house, on your errands, and to bed.

History
For centuries, rough coated, short nosed toy dog breeds have been found in Belgium, but the true history
of the Griffon Bruxellois started in the 1800s, not in royal palaces, but in coach houses.

To help keep rats away, Belgium coachmen used to keep small terriers called Griffons d’Ecurie in their
stables. These Affenpinscher-like dogs were friendly and popular At some point in the 1800s, these
coachmen bred their Griffons with imported toy dogs, such as the Pug, the King Charles Spaniel,
bringing about the change in coat types that lead to the Petits Brabançon, which was originally a fault of
the breed. The spaniels also brought the rich red and black and tan colour of the modern Griffon
Bruxellois and Griffon Belge.

The Griffon Bruxellois grew popularity in the late 1800's with both workers and noblemen in Belgium.
Queen Marie Henriette was a dog enthusiast who visited the annual dog shows in Belgium religiously,
often with her daughter, and became a breeder and booster of Griffon Bruxellois, giving them
international fame and popularity and indirectly leading to two Griffon Bruxellois clubs starting in
England and America.

The First World War and World War II proved to be a disastrous time for the breed. War time is difficult
on any dog breed, and the recovering numbers after the First World War were set back by increased
vigilance in breeding faults such as webbed toes. By the end of the Second World War, Belgium had
almost no native Griffon Bruxellois left, and only through the vigilance of dedicated breeders, in
England particularly, that the breed survived at all.

The breed has never been numerous or popular, but had a brief vogue in the late 1950's, but now is
generally an uncommon breed. There has been a recent increase in interest in the United States due to
appearance of a Griffon in the movie, As Good as It Gets, and also because of a general increase in
interest in toy dogs.


Miscellaneous
A Griffon Bruxellois can be seen in the film As Good as It Gets (1997).

The Hanover Hound is a breed of dog sometimes referred to as a Hanoverian Hound. It is a hunting
and tracking dog descended from bloodhounds of medieval times, and is uncommon today.

Appearance
These short-haired dogs range in colour from light to dark reddish fawn with a brindled appearance.
They may also have a mask. Overall, the Hanoverian Hound is sturdily built with a large head, strong
jaws and a deep chest. Their weight ranges from 36-45 kg (80-99 lbs). Males range in size from 50-55
cm (19-22 inches) while females are slightly smaller, about 48-53 cm (18-21 inches).

Temperament
Like any working dog, the Hanover Hound fares best living in an area where he can get lots of exercise
and would not be ideal for city living. They are calm and loyal, but described as persistent and single-
minded when tracking.

The Harrier is a small dog breed of the hound class,
used for hunting rabbits ("hares"). It resembles a
foxhound but is smaller.


Appearance
The Harrier is similar to the English Foxhound, but
smaller. It is a muscular hunting hound with a short, hard
coat. It has large bones for stamina and strength. The
Harrier is slightly longer than tall, with a level topline.
The tail is medium-length, carried high, but is not curled
over the back. The skull is broad with a strong square
muzzle. The rounded ears are pendant, and the eyes are
either brown or hazel. The wide nose is black. The                         A tri-color Harrier
expression is mellow when the dog is relaxed and alert
when he is excited. The teeth should meet in a scissors or                 Country of origin
level bite. The feet are tight and cat-like, and the front                  United Kingdom
toes may turn inward.

raised with them from puppyhood. It prefers life in a
pack with people, dogs, or both. This active dog likes to go exploring, sniffing, and trailing, so be sure to
keep it on a leash or in a safe enclosed area. Some Harriers like to bay.

Health
This breed's lifespan is generally 10-12 years.
History
Sources have widely conflicting stories about the origins of this breed. According to one, the earliest
Harrier types were crossed with Bloodhounds, the Talbot Hound, and even the Basset Hound. According
to another, the breed was probably developed from crosses of the English Foxhound with Fox Terrier
and Greyhound. And yet another, the Harrier is said to be simply a bred-down version of the English
Foxhound.

In any case, today's Harrier is between the Beagle and English Foxhound in size and was developed
primarily to hunt hare, though the breed has also been used in fox hunting. The name, Harrier, reveals
the breed's specialty. Neither hare nor fox can escape its exceptional sense of smell, its cunning, and its
unequaled boldness. Prey chased by the inexhaustible Harrier have been known to collapse from sheer
exhaustion. The Harrier is still fairly rare in the United States, but has a long history of popularity as a
working pack dog in England.

Exercise
The Harrier is a very energetic breed. It needs plenty of exercise.

                            Notes



The Havanese is a member of the Bichon family of dogs, which also includes the Bichon Frise, the
Bichon Bolognese, Maltese, Coton De Tulear, Tsvetnaya Bolonka, Franzuskaya Bolonka and possibly
the Löwchen breeds. These dogs were developed from the now extinct Mediterranean Bichon Tenerife,
which was introduced to the Canary Islands by the Spanish and later to other islands and colonies of
Spain by sailors.

Appearance




                  Black and tan Havanese

The Havanese, while a toy dog and always a companion, is also a hearty and sturdy dog for such a size,
and should never give the appearance of fragility or of being overly delicate. The height range is from
8½ to 11½ inches (216 to 292 mm), with the ideal being between 9 and 10½ inches (229 and 267 mm),
measured at the withers, and is slightly less than the length from point of shoulder to point of buttocks,
which should give the dog the appearance of being slightly more long than tall. A unique aspect of the
breed is the topline, which rises slightly from withers to rump, and the gait, which is flashy but not too
reaching, and gives the Havanese a spritely, agile appearance on the move.

The expression of the face, with its almond eyes, is one of mischievousness rather than being cute, like
the Bolognese, and the ears, which are medium in length and well feathered, always hang down. The tail
should curve over the back at rest, and like the rest of the dog, is covered in long fur.

The key word for the Havanese is 'natural', and the breed standards note that except for slight clipping
around the feet to allow for a circular foot appearance, they are to be shown unclipped; any further
trimming, back-combing, or other fussing is against type and will cause a dog to be disqualified. That
includes undocked tails, uncropped ears, and even a standard that forbids the use of topknots and bows
in presentation. The AKC standard notes "his character is essentially playful rather than decorative" and
the Havanese, when shown, should reflect that, generally looking like a toy in size only, but more at
home with playing with children or doing silly tricks than being pampered and groomed on a silk pillow.

Colour

Though there is some argument on whether the original Havanese were all white or of different colours,
modern Havanese are acceptable in all coat colours and patterns, with allowances made in every breed
standard for their unique colourful nature. The only restrictions is that every Havanese must have a black
nose and eyerims, except in all-brown dogs, where brown colouration is allowed. Popular colours
include fawn, white, and black, and parti-coloured Havanese are as well regarded as solids.

Coat

Havanese, like other Bichons and related dogs like Poodles, have a coat that doesn't readily shed. Rather,
it catches hair and dander internally, and needs to be regularly brushed out. Many people consider the
Havanese to be nonallergenic or hypoallergenic, but they do still release dander, which can aggravate
allergies. It's best to be exposed to the Havanese before deciding to choose one as a dog for a house with
allergies.

Havanese have three coat types, the smooth, which is similar to the Maltese, the curly, which is not
unlike a Bichon Frise coat, and the wavy, which is the preferred coat type and the type most uniquely
Havanese. The hair is long, soft, and abundant, and should have no coarseness. A short coat mutation
shows up occasionally in otherwise normal litters, but these are not showable Havanese and go so far
against standard that even novelty breeding of them is discouraged.

Because of the tropical nature of the Havanese, the thick coat is light and designed to act as a sunshade
and cooling agent for the little dog on hot days. This means, though, that the fluffy Havanese needs
protection against cold winter days, in spite of the warm wooly look of their fur.

The coat can be shown naturally brushed out, or corded, a technique which turns the long coat into
'cords' of fur, and which is hard to start but easy to care for when completed.

Temperament
The Havanese has a silly, friendly temperament which is unlike many other toy dog breeds. It is at home
with well behaved children and most other pets, and is rarely shy or nervous around new people. Clever
and active, they will often solicit attention by performing tricks.

The Havanese is a very people oriented dog, and does not do well with long periods of separation from
their family. Because of that, they are not suitable for people who work long hours or take frequent trips.
They often have a habit of following their humans around the house, even to the bathroom, but do not
tend to be overly possessive of their people, and do not usually suffer aggression or jealousy towards
other dogs, other pets or other humans.

The Havanese's love of children stems back to the days when it was often the playmate of the small
children of the households to which it belonged. Unlike most toy dogs, who are too delicate and
sometimes too nervous or aggressive to tolerate the often clumsy play of children, the Havanese, with
care, is a cheerful companion to even younger children, and this is no small part of its growing
popularity around the world.

Health
Though the Havanese may seem to suffer from a large complement of ailments, very few Havanese from
reputable breeders will have these problems, and the wide list is more a testament to highly proactive
clubs and breeder organizations. Havanese clubs like the Havanese Club of America have worked hard
for many years to try and search out and eradicate the health problems these dogs may suffer from. In
spite of these uncommon ailments, Havanese are generally considered healthy and sturdy dogs, and live
between 12–16 years.

Among these ailments are:

     ●   Cataracts
     ●   Patella luxation
     ●   Hip dysplasia
     ●   Chondrodysplasia (stunted leg growth, often resulting in bowed, dwarfed legs)
     ●   Legg-Calve-Perthes (inheritable condition which causes femur malformation)
     ●   Liver shunts
     ●   Heart murmers
     ●   Deafness

Havanese, even ones not to be bred, should go through several tests, including a one-time BAER hearing
test, a CERF eye test annually, and a Patellar Palpation and Hip Evaluation. Soaping has also become a
popular way for breeders to test health. It involves soaping up the dog to flatten the coat to its body and
reveal the structure of the legs. Crooked, bowed or over short legs are a symptom related to many
Havanese health issues, and dogs suffering from them should not be bred.

Because of the small genetic pool from which the Havanese were revived, Havanese organizations
around the world are always on the lookout for new health and genetic issues that may come to the fore
in this otherwise wonderful and healthy breed.

History
The Havanese itself developed uniquely in Cuba, either as the result of said Spanish sailors, or as is
often believed by native Cubans, as gifts from Italian traders to open the doors of wealthy houses to their
goods. The "Little Dog from Havana" even traveled back to Europe where it found brief favour in the
late 19th century as a circus and trick dog and a court companion.

As part of the Cuban Revolution, many trappings of aristocracy were culled, including the pretty but
useless fluffy family dogs of the wealthy land owners of Cuba! Even though many upper class Cubans
fled to the United States, few were able to bring their dogs, nor did they have the inclination to breed
them. Indeed, when Americans became interested in this rare and charming dog in the 1970s, the gene
pool available in the US was only 11 animals.

With dedicated breeding, as well as the acquisition of some new dogs of type internationally, the
Havanese has made a huge comeback, with recognition by many major kennel clubs and one of the
fastest growing registration of new dogs in the AKC (+42% in 2004). They have also suffered from a
certain level of trendiness due to rarity, good temperament, and publicity by such famous owners as
Barbara Walters.

Havanese at work

Because of the cheerful and readily trained nature of the Havanese, they are increasingly a dog utilized
for a variety of jobs, especially those involving the public. Havanese have been utilized for:

    ●   Therapy dogs
    ●   Service dogs, such as aid dogs for those in wheelchairs and hearing-ear dogs
    ●   Performing dogs
    ●   Mold and termite detection
    ●   Tracking

Havanese also compete in a variety of dog sports, such as

    ●   Dog agility
    ●   Flyball
    ●   Musical Freestyle
    ●   Obedience


Care
Havanese have several specific considerations for their care that a prospective owner should keep in
mind.

The Havanese has difficulty in housebreaking and can take a year or longer to consistently train. This is
due to a smaller bladder than many other dog breeds. Crate training or litter box training are two options
to help aid in this difficulty.

The Havanese has a profuse coat that requires daily grooming. If one does not intend to show their dog,
it can be trimmed shorter so as to require less brushing.

The Havanese, with their drop ears, need to have their ears cleaned to help prevent ear infections.

Though they are not a dog that requires long walks, Havanese are active and require at least a large, well-
enclosed yard to run around in a few times a day. They will also use up energy tearing around and
getting underfoot.

The Havanese is not a naturally yappy dog, but may alert its owners to approaching people. Usually
acknowledging that you have heard their alert is enough to make them cease.

Miscellaneous

Buyer beware

The Havanese is an expensive and rare dog, and the cost of getting a dog from a breeder who takes the
time to put them through the right health tests can drive the price to $2000 or more. Beware of anyone
who is selling a Havanese through a pet store. There is a lot of time and money invested into a healthy
puppy, and a responsible breeder should want to meet you, often a few times, before selling you a puppy.

Many people sadly use the Havanese's rarity to sell them for a fast profit. Increasingly, some people will
attempt to pass off a crossbred 'poodog' as the more desirable Havanese. If you must look for an
inexpensive dog, try a Havanese rescue group first.

Hovawart is a German dog breed. The name of the breed means "an estate guard dog," which is the
original use for the breed. The breed originated in the Black Forest region and was first described in text
and paintings in medieval times.
Appearance
The Hovawart is a large dog. Dogs are 63-70 cm (24 3/4"-27 1/2") and bitches 58-65 cm (22 3/4"-25
1/2") at the withers. The weight is approximately 25-40 kg (55-90 pounds). It comes in blonde, black, or
black and tan, the latter being most common.

Temperament
The Hovawart is an outstanding watch dog and somewhat reserved towards strangers. They make
excellent family dogs as they are totally devoted to their family. They are a working dog breed, and
require a consistent and loving yet strict training and meaningful activity thoughout their lives.

History
In the early 20th century there was a project to create a German working dog, which resulted in the
German Shepherd Dog. Some people, however, disagreed with how the ideal German working dog
would be like and found some original Hovawart-type dogs and revived the breed. The breed standard
was published and the breed was recognized by the German Kennel Club in 1937. The breed is
recognized by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale.

Miscellaneous




                                A Hovawart dog in a forest.

The Hovawart does expectionally well in search and rescue, tracking and working dog activities. The
lighter females often love agility. In training and especially obedience work the trainer must keep
positive reinforcement in mind all the time, as the Hovawart is not as eager to please as many other
working dog breeds. The Hovawart may easily become reluctant if training is built only on punishments.

The owner of a Hovawart should have previous experience in owning and training a dog. The Hovawart
is not suitable as a first dog.

The Hungarian Vizsla, pronounced VEEZH-la (zh as in vision), is a dog breed originating in Hungary.
Vizslas are known as excellent hunting dogs, and also have a level personality making them suited for
families.

Appearance
The Vizsla, as described in the AKC standard, is a medium-sized short-coated hunting dog of
distinguished appearance and bearing. Robust but rather lightly built; the coat is an attractive solid
golden rust.

The breed comes in either of two coat types: smooth or wire-haired. The FCI, CKC, and the KC(UK)
consider the smooth-haired and wire-haired as separate breeds. Male Vizslas typically weigh between 55
and 65 lb (25 to 29 kg) and are 22 to 24 in. tall at the whithers, females 45 to 55 lb (20 to 25 kg) and are
21 to 23 in. tall.

Temperament
Vizslas are lively, gentle mannered, loyal and highly affectionate. They quickly form close bonds with
their owners. They are natural hunters with an excellent ability to take training. Not only are they great
pointers, but they are excellent retrievers as well.

Like all sporting breeds, Vizslas require a good deal of exercise to remain healthy and happy. A bored
Vizsla is a destructive Vizsla who is likely to engage in unwanted behavior, including chewing anything
and everything in your home. Thirty minutes to an hour of exercise daily in a large off-leash area is
optimal. Vizslas are excellent swimmers and often swim in pools if one is available.

History
There are two prevailing theories pertaining to the Vizsla's history. The first, and most prevalent theory
traces the Vizsla back to very early times in Hungarian history. Ancestors of today's Vizsla were the
hunting dogs used by the Magyar tribes living in the Carpathian Basin in the Eighth Century. Primitive
stone etchings seem to validate this theory.

The other theory holds that the Vizsla is a product of the nineteenth century, having been the product of
other pointer breeds.

Podenco Ibicenco, or the Ibizan
Hound, believed to have originated
in Ancient Egypt, may actually be a
more recent breed.

                            Notes



The Ibizan Hound, also called Podenco Ibicenco, is an agile, deer-like hound of the sighthound family.
There are three hair types of the breed: smooth, long, and wire, of which the most common is the
smooth-haired. Long-haired Ibizans are considered rare.

Appearance
The Ibizan Hound has no black on its body; they are either red or white or a combination of red and
white. Its nose is flesh colored, as is its ears. Its eyes are a striking amber colour.

The Ibizan may range in height from 24 to 29 inches and weigh from 45 to 60 pounds. The breed has a
pronounced sensitivity to cold, their hair providing little in the way of insulation.

History
For many years, this breed was considered one of the oldest dog breeds. It was believed the Ibizan
Hound originated in ancient Egypt, as pictures that appear to be of Ibizan hounds have been seen on the
walls of ancient pyramids.

However, according to Dr. Elaine Ostrander, a geneticist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center
and University of Washington, recent DNA analysis reveals that this breed is actually a recent
construction, bred to resemble an older form. In a study directed by Dr. Ostrander, with the aid of her
colleague, Dr. Leonid Kruglyak, "they have found genetic variations that allow them to distinguish
among 85 dog breeds and to identify an individual dog's breed with 99 percent accuracy," according to
Mark Derr, a science writer for the New York Times.

"We can assign a dog to a breed, but we can't tell what behavior it will have," asserts Ostrander. "There
is huge variation in behavior between dogs within breeds." The results of the study, published in May
2004 in Science magazine, may help in the study of disease, both canine and human, because certain
breeds are prone to some of the same genetic diseases as humans.[1]
Wherever it may have actually originated, the breed were used to hunt rabbits and other small game in
Ibiza. The Ibizan Hound is a fast dog that can hunt on all types of terrain, working by sight, sound, and
scent. Spanish hunters run these dogs in mostly female packs, with perhaps a male or two, as the female
is the better hunter. This breed is similar to the Pharaoh Hound, but the Ibizan Hound is larger and can
have a multicolored hair pattern. The Ibizan Hound was fully recognized by the AKC in 1979.

    The CKC "miscellaneous class" is for breeds working
          towards full recognition by the CKC.

The Icelandic Sheepdog is a breed of spitz dog originating from the dogs brought to Iceland by the
Vikings. Later, dogs were taken from Iceland to the British Isles and became the basis for Border Collies
and Corgis. In the Shetland Islands, it was crossed with the Norwegian Buhund and became the Shetland
Sheepdog.


Appearance
The Icelandic Sheepdog's distinct features are pointy ears and a curly tail. It is of medium height, and is
commonly golden, reddish, black, or grey combined with white. The coat may be long or short.

History
Plague and canine distemper destroyed over 75% of the breed in the late 19th century, leading to a ban
on the importation of dogs. The purebred Icelandic sheepdog was again bordering extinction in the late
20th century and in 1969 the Icelandic Dog Breeder Association (HRFÍ) was established, which had
among other aims to preserve the breed.

Miscellaneous
The breed is sometimes denoted in Latin as canis islandicus even though it is a breed and not a species.




                                 The icelandic sheepdog often have double spurs on the hind paws.

The Irish Red and White Setter is virtually identical in use and temperament to its cousin, the Irish
Setter, but is more often found as a working gundog.


Appearance
The coat is long and silky, mostly white, with deep red patches. The dogs range in height from 22 1/2 to
24 for bitches and 24 to 26 inches for males, and weigh 50 to 70 pounds (27-32 kg).
Temperament
The Red and White can take longer to train than other gundogs, but once trained it is a loyal and reliable
companion. Like the Irish Setter, the breed has an enthusiastic zest for life, loves to play, and is excellent
with children. Irish Red and White Setters thrive best in active families and require room to romp.

History
Originally all Irish Setters were mostly red, or red and white, but for many years breeders developed
only the red varieties. Consequently, the breed came close to extinction. Thanks to the efforts of an early
20th-century Irish clergyman, Noble Huston, the breed was saved. The Irish Red and White Setter has
undergone a revival in recent decades and is considered a separate breed by most major kennel clubs.
The breed is still in development for the AKC.


Miscellaneous
Currently Irish Red and White Setters that are recorded in the AKC's FSS may earn hunting titles as well
as titles in obedience, dog agility, rally obedience, and tracking. They may not compete and earn either
field or show championships.

The Irish Terrier is a dog breed from Ireland, one of many breeds of Terrier.


Appearance
Irish Terriers are coloured golden red, red wheaten, or wheaten. The dogs can become large and grow up
to 46 to 48 cm (18-19 in) with a weight of 11 to 12 kg (25-27 lb).

Temperament
The Irish Terrier is intelligent and a specialist in hunting rabbits and otters due to its very good sense of
smell.

History
The breed's origin is not known. It is believed to have descended from the rough haired Fox Terrier. Its
selection began only in 1870. The Irish Terrier Club was founded in 1879 and the breed was displayed
for the first time in Glasgow in 1920. At one point in this breeds history it was used for dog fighting.

                             Notes



Known as the "clown" of the spaniel family, the Irish Water Spaniel is the largest and one of the oldest
breeds of spaniels. It is also one of the rarest with only around 500 dogs left in the UK


Appearance
The Irish Water Spaniel resembles a stocky Poodle. The coat consists of dense curls, sheds very little,
and is a solid liver color. Their coat is also unusual in that it is comprised of hair, not fur (hence the
tendency not to shed). This characteristic means that people usually allergic to dogs might have less of
an allergic reaction to Irish Water Spaniels (see hypoallergenic), and also means that the dogs must have
regular haircuts, as humans. The dogs are strongly built, and a bit taller and more squarish than other
spaniels. There is a curly topknot upon the head and the face is smooth. The most distinguishing
characteristic of these dogs is their long "rat-like" tails, which are a striking contrast to their otherwise
curly coats. Dogs range in height from 22 to 24 inches (56-61 cm), and weigh 55 to 65 pounds (25-30
kg). As their name would imply these dogs love water and to this end they have evolved slightly webbed
feet to aid this.

Temperament
This is an active breed that is usually found in a real working retriever environment. They are intelligent,
quick to learn, alert, and inquisitive. They sometimes display humorous antics while working, earning
them their "clownish" reputation. With proper socialization they can be gentle dogs with family and
children, but are often shy around strangers. Irish Water Spaniels require lots of exercise and need an
experienced trainer, and therefore are probably not the best choice for a casual dog owner. They also
require access to water to swim, an activity they specialise in.

History
Although the current breed stock are Irish, the ultimate origin of the breed is unknown. It is possible that
more than one ancient breed of spaniel has gone into its makeup. Irish Water Spaniels share a common
lineage with the Poodle, Portuguese Water Dog, and Barbet, but whether they are antecedents,
descendants, or mixtures of these other breeds is a matter of some speculation. What is clear is that the
breed has ancient roots. The modern breed as we know it was developed in Ireland in the 1830s.

                             Notes



The Istarski Ostrodlaki Gonic is a breed of dog developed in the mid-1800s for hunting fox and rabbit.
It is a rough-coated scent hound still kept primarily as a hunting dog rather than as a pet.


Appearance
Dogs of this breed can vary considerably in size, as the dog is still bred primarily for hunting, so more
emphasis might be placed on performance than on specific appearance requirements. It can range from
25 to 56 lb (16 to 26 kg) and stand 17 to 23 inches (44 to 58 cm) at the withers.

The breed's wiry coat is weather resistent for hunting. The topcoat is 2 to 3 inches (5 to 8 cm) long and it
has a wooly undercoat. The color is white with yellow or orange markings, usually on the ears. The ears
are broad and hang flat.

Temperament
Again, because the Ostrodlaki Gonic has been bred primarily for hunting rather than as a companion, it
tends to be willful and hence more challenging to train than many other breeds.

History
Slovenian breeders created the Ostrodlaki Gonic in the mid-1800s by crossing the French Griffon
Vendeén with the Istrski Kratkodlaki Gonic, a smooth-haired hound developed from both sight hounds
and scent hounds. The breed first took part in a dog show in Vienna in 1866.

The dog is still used for hunting fox, rabbits, hare, and wild boar.

The Italian Greyhound is a small breed of dog, specifically a member of the sight hound family and
member of the toy group.


Appearance




The Italian Greyhound is the smallest of the sight hounds, typically weighing 3 to 5 kg. They look like
miniature Greyhounds.

The colour of the coat is a subject of much discussion. In England, the USA, and Australia, white
spotted Italians are accepted, while the FCI standards adhered to in Europe allows white spots only on
the chest and paws.

The modern Italian Greyhound's appearance is a result of breeders throughout Europe, particularly
Austrian, German, Italian, and French breeders, making great contributions to the forming of this breed.
The Italian Greyhound should resemble a small Greyhound, or rather a Sloughi. It is important that the
dogs are significantly more elegant and graceful than these breeds, though.

Temperament
The Italian Greyhound is considered a good companion dog, as they are very affectionate.

The Italian Greyhound's apparent lack of wide appeal is possibly because of their fragile appearance,
with their spindly legs. The reality of the breed is quite contrary to the appearance, though, as they are
frequently described as a 'big' dog in a small package. They also have a realatively loud bark. In fact, the
breed will be equally at home in a city and in the country, and it does not require as much exercise as
larger breeds. The Italian Greyhound is hardy, rarely ill, intelligent and easy to teach.

Sometimes, IG's will make a resonably good guard-dog and bark at things that aren't usually in the
street. They may also bark at passers by.

IG's often get along with cats so if you already have a cat and you are looking for a suitable dog which
won't chase your beloved kitty all day long, IG's can be recommended.

IG's despise the wind, wet and cold and will sometimes refuse to do their " business " outside if it is
raining so some recommend having some old newspaper on the floor near the exit.

This breed, like most dogs, is not a fussy eater and will eat almost anything, including the month-old
scraps from your garden. Most will eat enthusiastically, but some get more picky about their food as
they age.

IGs are good with kids but their thin bones are fragile and can be hurt by rough play from young
children.

Dogs of this breed have an almost odour-free, easily managed coat. Although the coat is incredibly
short, it can shed. The breed simply loves the company of people, and will promptly occupy your lap if
you let it. In fact, many owners of this breed have them sleeping with them in their beds.

The young dog will often be particularly active, and this high level of activity sometimes lead them to
try to 'fly' from furniture or stairs. It is important to keep a close eye on the dogs in this initial phase as
their young bones are still fragile. The first year of life is the most accident-prone, although the graceful
legs often seem to withstand incredible punishment they are not invulnerable.

IGs love to run as fast as they possibly can, and, like all dogs, it's important that they have an
opportunity to run full out at least once daily, either in the back yard or under supervision and control in
a larger area. Like most dogs they enjoy digging and, if left to their own devices for entertainment and
exercise, might resort to digging or other destructive behavior.

Like most smaller breeds, the Italian Greyhound can be difficult to housebreak. This will normally come
along with patience and training, but at a slower pace than most other breeds. Patience is the only way to
help the training along, and remember that the breed is small and as such the dog will have a small
bladder.

Health
Members of this breed might love the sunlight, so owners need to ensure that they don't become
overheated, and they do get sunburned (particularly on their heads and bellies), so it's recommended to
use sunscreen on them.

The breed is relatively free of disease, but the following ailments do occur:

     ●   Epilepsy
     ●   Legg-Perthes disease (degeneration of the hip)
     ●   Patellar Luxation (slipped stifles)
     ●   Osteoporosis
     ●   vWD (Bleeding disorder)
     ●   Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA)

History
The name of the breed is a reference to the breed's popularity in renaissance Italy. Mummified dogs very
similar to the Italian Greyhound (or small Greyhounds) have been found in Egypt, and pictorials of
small Greyhounds have been found in Pompeii, and they were probably the only accepted companion-
dog there. As an amusing aside the expression 'Cave Canem' (Beware of the dog) was a warning to
visitors, not that the dogs would attack but to beware of damaging the small dogs.

Although the small dogs are mainly companionship dogs they have in fact been used for hunting
purposes, often in combination with hunting falcons.

Miscellaneous
The grace of the breed has prompted several artists to include the dogs in paintings, among others
Velasquez, Pisanello and Giotto. The breed has been popular with royalty throughout, among the best
known royal aficionados were Mary Stuart, Queen Anne, Queen Victoria, Catherine The Great,
Frederick the Great and the Norwegian Queen Maud.

Activities
Some Italian Greyhounds enjoy dog agility. The breed's lithe body and its love of action enable it to
potentially do well at this sport, although not many IGs participate and their natural inclination is for
straight-out racing rather than for working tightly as a team with a handler on a technical course.

Lure coursing is another activity well-fitted to the Italian Greyhound, and they seem to enjoy it
tremendously. Although the Italian Greyhound is a very fast dog, it is not as well suited to racing as its
larger cousin.

The Jagdterrier is a terrier breed of dogs for hunting. It probably originated in Germany. Jagdterriers
are relatively small, but they are extremely strong dogs with much endurance and vitality.

Appearance




This breed is black, with brown markings that resemble that of the Dobermann. The German breed
standard calls for the breed to stand 33 to 40 cm (13 to 15.7 in) at the withers. It specifies that bitches
should weigh from 7.5 to 8.5 kg (16.5 to 18.7 lb), and males from 9 to 10 kg (19.8 to 22 lb).

The coat can be either wiry or smooth. The tail is normally (but not always) cropped at 2/3 the natural
length.

Temperament

Jagdterriers are usually used in hunting, especially for game that is underground such as beavers, otters,
foxes, wild boars, and rabbits, but due to its intelligence and adaptability, they can also become good
pets.
Health
Their life expectancy is 13 to 14 years.

                                           Sketch of a Jämthund

Appearance
The dog has a tightly curled or a scimitar-like curve in the tail. It has erect ears; medium to long muzzle;
strong, long endurance; and has a double coat of usually two colours. The eyes are brown.

Temperament
They make excellent pets and companions, due to their high adaptability to rural or urban settings.

History
The Jämthund is eponymous to Jämtland, a province of northern Sweden. Since the end of the last ice
age, Jämthunds have been the friends and helpers of Swedes. They are also the National Dog of Sweden;
They are used for moose hunting and sled pulling. They are the Swedish Marines and Air Force's official
service canine. It is thought that this breed in wartime is mobilised for sled pulling.

                              Notes



In Japan, there are Inu (犬) (dogs) and there are Chin (狆). The Japanese Chin (also known as the
Japanese Spaniel) is the dog of Japanese Royalty. A lap dog and companion dog, this breed of toy dog
is one with a distinctive heritage.

Appearance
Japanese Chins stand about 20 to 27 cm (8 to 11 in) in height at the withers and weigh 2 to 5 kg (4 to 11
lb). They have straight, silky, profuse long hair that is most often black and white or red and white, or
less often black and white with tan points. They have feathered tails that curl up over their backs. Their
faces have an "oriental" appearance, with a short, upturned muzzle and large, wide-set eyes that have
white visible in the inner corners, creating an astonished expression.

These dogs commonly have a white spot or blaze in the middle of their foreheads known as Buddha's
Thumbprint. This designation can be attributed to the Buddhist Emperor Ming of Han China, who
owned many of these dogs.

Temperament
This breed is considered one of the most cat-like of the dog breeds in attitude: it is alert, intelligent, and
often independent, and it uses its paws to wash its face; the name Chin means cat-like. A companion
dog, it is loving and loyal to its owner, but is distrustful of new people. Chins prefer familiar
surroundings, and are very uncomfortable in unfamiliar areas and with new situations. They are a quiet
breed, with a much deeper bark than the high-pitched yap commonly associated with many of the toy
breeds, and are naturally clean, making them excellent apartment dogs.

Health
This breed's flattened face contributes to some dogs suffering from breathing and heart problems, as is
common with such breeds. Luxating patellas (knees) and heart murmurs are other genetically
predisposed conditions. The oversized eyes are easily scratched and corneal scratches or more serious
ulcerations can result. Mild scratches benefit from topical canine antibacterial ointment specifically for
eye application; more serious injury or ulcerations require urgent medical care.
Care
The Chin's coat needs more than average brushing or combing to maintain its appearance. They are year
round shedders. Without fiber in the diet, they may need to have their anal glands expressed bimonthly.
The oversized eye orbits contribute to moisture about the face and the skin folds in and around the nose
and flattened facial area can trap moisture and cause fungal problems. The face should be occasionally
wiped with a damp cloth and the folds cleaned with a cotton swab. This breed has little or no odor.

Due to low exercise requirements, the Chin makes a perfect condominium or apartment pet. The use of
"housetraining pads" is recommended. The Chin is a bit tough to housetrain in the first 4 months of life,
but become quick studies. Always yearning to please, seeking affection and loving - the Chin is a perfect
pet for a single or elderly person.

History
There is some debate as to the origins of this breed. Some say that the ancestors of these dogs first
appeared in Japan around the year 732, as gifts from the rulers of Korea. Others attribute the ancestors of
the Chin to breeds of Chinese origin.

Portuguese sailors introduced the breed to Europe in the 1600s by presenting some to Braganza's
Princess Catherine.

An American naval officer, Commodore Perry, helped make this dog famous in England in 1853 when
he presented a breeding pair to Queen Victoria after returning from Japan. He is also credited with this
breed's appearance in America when he later gave a pair to the President of the United States.

                               Notes



The Japanese Spitz is a small, completely white breed of dog that is thought to have been bred from the
Siberian Samoyed for smallness beginning in the late 19th century in Japan. They were introduced to the
United States in the 1950s.

Appearance
They typically weigh 11 to 13 lb (5-6 kg), fully grown, and stand 12 to 14 inches (30-36 cm) off of the
ground at the withers. Their coats are mostly white. The hair is longest on the body, with short hair on
the head and ears.

Temperament
The Spitz is an intelligent dog. They make good pets, being easy to train. They are very active, playful,
affectionate. They are good with children and other dogs. They bark at strangers and to get attention,
making them excellent watch dogs. They are very affectionate and friendly; although some can be
withdrawn with strangers, once they get used to someone, they become a lifelong friend.

Health
Japanese Spitz typically live from 10 to 12 years if well cared for; in rare cases they might live as long
as 18 years.

The Japanese Terrier is a small terrier native to Japan. It is believed to be descended from the progeny
of fox terrier types, pointers and indigenous Japanese dogs. This dog is also known as the Nippon
Terrier. The breed is rare, even in Japan.

Appearance
The Japanese Terrier is a balanced, square dog, tri-coloured, with white predominating. Its ears are high
set and fold forward. The coat is short, slick and fine. Its tail is docked.

Temperament
The FCI breed standard describes this breed as having "a lively and cheerful character" and as "swift and
lively in temperament".

History
It is generally believed that the ancestors of the Japanese Terrier were brought by Dutch merchant ships
to Nagasaki, the only Japanese port open to the West in the 17th Century. Whether there was a type of
fox terrier developing in the Netherlands, or whether these were dogs brought along by English sailors is
unclear. Unlike other descendants of fox terriers, the JT seems to have been developed exclusively as a
pet. The dogs became very popular as lap dogs in ports such as Nagasaki, Kobe and Yokohama.

According to the Japanese Kennel Club, planned breeding of Japanese Terriers did not begin until
around 1920, when fanciers began selective breeding from the progenitor, the Kobe Terrier. The
Japanese Terrier was recognized by the JKC in 1930. The Japanese Terrier is recognized by the Japanese
Kennel Club and the FCI. It is little known outside of Japan, but does have its admirers in Europe.

The Japanese Terrier’s tiny stature and short coat make it a low-maintenance pet, but it does not do well
in the cold.

                             Notes



The Jonangi is a native dog breed of India, found all along the east coast of India, from Bengal to
Kanyakumari. The east coast of India has a long history of trade relations with South-East Asia.
Therefore, it is thought that the ancestors of the Jonangi arrived near Lake Kolleru from South-East Asia
in ancient times. He is used for hunting small game, as a watchdog, and for herding ducks. This is a
spunky, primitive-type dog that is wary with strangers. It does not usually bark but makes a yodelling
sound similar to that of a Basenji. The female comes into heat once per year.


Appearance
The Jonangi is reminiscent of a Bull Terrier but is not stocky or cobby. It is a typical primitive pariah-
type dog, and shares many common characteristics with other dogs of this type all over the world.
Perhaps the most similar breed to the Jonangi is the Basenji, not the western show dog, but the real
African village dog. Its coat is extremely short and fine, in solid colours of fawn, biscuit, chocolate,
black or white. Brindle is acceptable. It has a wrinkled forehead, thin curled tail, and tulip ears. The
Jonangi stands 14 to 16 inches at the withers. This is a one-man or one-family dog.

The Jonangi is threatened by extinction. Efforts are underway to preserve it.

 Still primarily found in Turkey, with some enthusiasts in
                 Europe and North America.
The Kangal Dog is the national dog breed of Turkey. This large dog (which can often grow as large as
140 pounds (64 kg)) was originally used as a Livestock guardian dog, but has been increasing in
popularity as a guard dog. It is of an early mastiff type with a solid tan or grey coat, and should always
have a black mask on its face; indeed, another name for the breed is Karabash or black head.

The breed is often referred to as a sheep dog, but it does not herd its charges. Instead, it is designed to
live with the flock and act as a livestock guardian dog. This trait has given it growing popularity as a
guardian for families as well, as it watches members of its flock with extreme devotion.

The Kangal was combined with the Akbash to create the Anatolian Shepherd Dog.


Appearance
The Kangal Dog is a large, heavily boned dog with long legs and a mastiff-like appearance. The head is
large and moderately wide, with drop ears that may or may not be cropped, set on a strong, slightly
arched neck. The body should be muscular, not fat, with strong forelegs, a deep chest, and a sickle or
curled tail carried high. The overall appearance should be of proportions slightly longer in body than in
legs.

Because the working characteristics of the breed are paramount, the UKC standard also notes that field
scars from working, such as may be gained from briars or predators, are not to be penalized.

Males should weigh 110-145 lbs, with a height of 30-32 inches at the withers, while females should
weigh 90-120 lbs, with a height of 28-30 inches.

Colour and Coat

The colour and coat are perhaps the most obviously distictive aspects that separate the Kangal from the
similar Akbash and Anatolian. The coat must be short and dense, not long or feathery, and of a fawn,
dun, or grey appearance with a black facial mask and ears. White at certain points (chest, chin, toes) may
or may not be allowed, depending on the standard. Some dark Kangal also have black paws and a dark
chest. Most importantly, the coat should not be broken or spotted.

Split-Lump Controversy

The Kangal dog's validity as a separate breed is a matter of controversy, especially between Anatolian
Shepherd Dog breeders and Kangal dog breeders. Kangal dog breeders feel that the standard they have
laid out for the breed most truly reflects the working dogs of the Kangal region, and that the Anatolian is
merely a Çoban Köpegi or generic sheepdog of uncertain breeding. They also point to the large increase
of fawn Karabash dogs as a tacit admission by Anatolian breeders of the correctness of the Kangal
position of being the original type.

Anatolian breeders state that the variation in colours in the Anatolian reflect the true diversity of the
Turkish sheepdog, and that Kangal breeders ignore examples of spotted or brindle Kangals in the field,
claiming they're not actually Kangals. Some Anatolian breeders accuse Kangal breeders of actively
culling unsuitable coloured dogs that come from purebred Kangals.

Generally, the arguments are whether Turkish dogs really are so breed specific, and if the splits placed
on them by groups are arbitrary, or if the breeds are distinct and bred to be distinct in Turkey, therefore
any mixing of bloodlines would be muddying the genetic waters. It is unlikely that the arguments will be
settled soon, even with the increased use of genetic fingerprinting in the tracing of breeds. Suffice to say,
both groups consider their dogs true Turkish livestock guardian dogs.


Temperament
The ideal Kangal dog should be calm, controlled, independant, and protective. Aloof towards strangers,
but never shy or vicious. A well-trained Kangal is sensitive and alert to changing situations, handling
them with intelligence. They make good guardians of livestock and children, but they may not be suited
for all homes, as the stubborn intelligence of the Kangal makes for a difficult pupil.

Temperament controversy

Unfortunately, some people assume that guardian dog or watch dog means attack dog, and will train this
large and hard-to-control dog to be aggressive towards humans. Very rarely, some people also use
Kangals in dog fights. Kangal dogs and Kangal crosses are occasionally owned by persons hoping to get
a macho animal.

This has led to the restriction and banning of Kangals in most parts of Germany. Kangal owners feel
unfairly singled out, and point out that aggression towards predators, especially with such an intelligent
dog as the Kangal, does not equal aggression towards humans. It is notable that some famous German
guard dog breeds, such as the German Shepherd, are not restricted.


History

The Kangal in Turkey

One of the national treasures of Turkey, the Kangal dog is part of a group of special sheep dog breeds
specific to the country. Each is considered an important example of the cultural character of its region.
To protect and conserve the genetic purity of the Kangal Dog, the government of Turkey has established
several state-sponsored breeding centers.
In its home region of Kangal, in the Sivas region of Anatolia, the Kangal Dog is still primarily used as a
livestock guardian, and prize animals compete annually in the Kangal Sheep Dog and Sheep festival.

In its duties as a national symbol, Kangal dogs often have jobs as guardians of state buildings, or as gifts
in international friendship to other heads of state. There was also a brief fad of owning Kangals by more
well-off city dwellers in Istanbul, but it has quickly died down as the 140 lb (64 kg) dogs are not well-
suited for city living.

The Kangal internationally

Originally, the Kangal, along with the Akbash, was imported into Europe and the United States
primarily as the foundation for the Anatolian Shepherd Dog. Curious enthusiasts of that and other
Turkish dog breeds discovered that the general look of the Anatolian didn't always reflect the look of the
dogs from various regions of Turkey. Several, such as David and Judy Nelson in the United States,
decided to breed to the regional types of Çoban Köpegi rather than for Anatolian.

For 30 years, there has been a small but growing interest in the Kangal dog, and as such, the United
States and Australia have kennel clubs that recognise the breed. In the UK, Canada, and Germany, there
are also enthusiast groups, though Kangal ownership has been restricted severely in Germany, where
they are considered a dangerous breed.

The Kanni, which means maiden, is an indigenous South Indian dog breed found in the state of Tamil
Nadu. The breed is a further extension of the Mudhol Hound, and is also a descendant of the Saluki, but
does not possess the grand features of these breeds.

Appearance
In general appearance, the Kanni is similar to a smooth-coated Saluki or a Doberman Pinscher with
natural ears and tail. The dog is usually black and tan in colour, perhaps with limited white on the feet
and chest. There also exists a cream-coloured variety of the breed, which is known as Paalakanni. The
Kanni is agile, slim, graceful, and moderately built, with a deep chest and slim body. The dog stands
about 25 inches at the withers, the bitch about 22 inches.


History
The Kanni is found in and around Tirunelveli, Pollachi, Kovilpatti, Kazhugumalai, Kileral,
Kodangipatti, Sivakasi, and Madurai. It is used mainly for hunting. The Kanni was often given away as
part of a bride's dowry. The breed is now extremely rare, and on the verge of extinction. Efforts to revive
the breed have not been taken up as specimens are few and there exists little information about them.

The Karelian Beardog is a breed of dog that today is used more for hunting moose and deer than it is
used for bear hunting, since bears have become rare in Finland.

Appearance
The dog should be in excellent physical condition. Males stand 54 to 60 cm (22 to 24 in.) at the withers
and females 49 to 55 cm (19 to 22 in.). The breed's coat is black or black and white.

Temperament
The dog should be brave. It tends to be aggressive towards other dogs and is suspicious of strangers.
These traits prevent it from becoming popular as a companion dog.

History
It was developed in the Karelia area around the border between Russia and Finland in the 1800s.

                             Notes



The Keeshond (pronounced KAYZ-HOND; plural: Keeshonden) is a medium-sized dog with a plush two-
layer coat of silver and black fur with a 'ruff' and a curled tail, originating in the Netherlands. Its closest
relative is the Pomeranian. Originally called the German Spitz, the name was officially changed to
Keeshond in 1925.

Appearance




A member of the spitz group of dogs, the Kees is 17 to 18 inches (about 45 cm) tall and weighs 35 to 40
pounds (about 16 to 18 kg). Sturdily built, they have a typical spitz appearance, neither coarse nor
refined. They have a wedge shaped head, a medium-length muzzle with a definite stop, small pointed
ears and an expressive face. The tail is tightly curled and, in profile, should not be carried as so to be
distinguished from the compact body of the dog.

Coat

Like all spitzes, the Kees has a profuse double coat, with a thick ruff around the neck. The tail is well
plumed, and feathering on the fore and hind legs add to the soft look of the breed. The coat is shown
naturally, and should not be wavy, silky, or long enough to form a natural part down the back.

Color

The Keeshond is a color-specific spitz type; the very names of the dog refer to the distinct wolf color of
the breed. The color is a mix of grey, black and cream. The top coat is tipped with black, while the
undercoat is pale grey, white, or cream (never tawny). The color can range from very pale to very dark,
but the Kees should neither be black nor white, and the ruff and "trousers" of the hind legs should be a
distinctly lighter grey.

The other important marking is the "Spectacles", a delicate dark line running from the outer corner of
each eye toward the lower corner of each ear, which, coupled with markings forming short eyebrows, is
necessary for the distinct expressive look of the breed. All markings should be clear, not muddled or
broken.

Temperament
Keeshonden tend to be very playful, with quick reflexes and strong jumping ability. Keeshonden can be
stubborn, but they are quick learners and eager to please. Because Keeshonden are quick learners, they
also learn the things you didn't necessarily wish to teach them - very quickly. However, Keeshonden
make excellent agility and obedience dogs. So amenable to proper training is this bright, sturdy dog that
Keeshonden have been successfully trained to serve as guide dogs for the blind; only their lack of size
has prevented them from being more widely used in this role.

They love children and are excellent family dogs, preferring to be close to their humans whenever
possible. They generally get along with other dogs as well and will enjoy a good chase around the yard.
Keeshonden are very intuitive and empathic and are often used as comfort dogs. Most notably, at least
one Keeshond, Tikva, was at Ground Zero on 9/11 to help comfort the rescue workers.

They are known by their loud distinctive bark. Throughout the centuries, the Keeshond has been a very
popular watch dog on manors in the Netherlands and middle Europe, as well as famously being a watch
dog on barges. This trait is evident to this day, and they are alert watch dogs that warn their owners of
any new visitors. Despite being a loud and alert watchdog, Keeshonden are not aggressive towards
visitors. They generally welcome visitors affectionately once their family has accepted them.
Unfortunately, excessive barking may become a problem if not properly handled. As with other
watchdogs, Keeshonden have a distinct territory that they want to guard. Therefore, a happy Keeshond
should have a yard to watch out for.

Training

The Keeshond is a very bright dog as evidenced by its level of achievement in obedience work. This
intelligence makes a Keeshond a good choice for the dog owner who is willing to help a dog learn the
right lessons, but also entails added responsibility. Keeshond ownership, when the dog and human have
worked together to become a good pet and a good pet owner, is a very positive experience.

Many people purchase a Keeshond thinking that, being a family dog, they must also be an easy to train
dog. While affectionate, the Keeshond may not be for the inexperienced trainer. Consistency and
fairness is needed with a Keeshond. While most dogs need a structured environment, it's especially
necessary with a Keeshond. Their intelligence, in some ways, can be a liability - especially in obedience
work, where they can get bored with repetitive training.

Being an intelligent dog, most problems with Keeshonden stem from the dog becoming bored and
inventing its own activities. They need daily contact with their owners and lots of activity to remain
happy. Therefore, it is not the right choice of breed for those who want a dog that lives happily alone in
a kennel or backyard.

Health
Keeshonden are prone to and hip dysplasia, luxating patellas (trick knee), epilepsy, Cushing's disease,
hyperparathyroidism, hypothyroidism and von Willebrand's disease. Keeshonden are also prone to bloat.
A healthy, well-bred Keeshond can be expected to live between 12 and 15 years on average.

Grooming
Due to their double coat, a thick undercoat and a long haired coat above that, Keeshonden need regular
brushing once every two weeks to maintain the coat and ward off doggy odor normally associated with
breeds that have hair. Proper grooming requires about an hour to an hour and a half to groom all the way
to the skin. If the undercoat is not groomed out properly then eventually the undercoat will mat and die
and the dog may acquire skin problems.

The Keeshond blows its coat twice a year. This entails shedding their undercoats completely during an
intense shedding period that can last up to three weeks from start to finish. The hair comes out in large
and small clumps and lots of vacuuming and brushing are in order. During the "blow", a Keeshond
should be groomed once or twice a week to facilitate rapid removal of the dead undercoat. If the coat
isn't combed out properly during the yearly sheds, hairs from that period may be shed for weeks or
months after.

A bath once or twice a year may be all that is called for, as Keeshonds often lack the strong doggy smell
of other breeds. Loose dirt can be brushed out, though any dog that gets very dirty should be washed.

Keeshonden (or any spitz), unlike breeds such as poodles, should not be clipped or shaved. Doing so has
many detrimental effects on the coat, which may grow back improperly, tangled, or not at all. The long
coat, which may appear hot during the summer, is in fact light and airy, and protects the Kees from
excess sun. The coat is essential for protection against all the elements, and lacking the outer guard coat
leaves the dog vulnerable to cold, rain, and insects like mosquitoes and fleas. The dirt-repellent effect of
the coat will also be lost, causing frequent bathing to be necessary. The coat also looses its distinct color,
as the black tipping on the hairs will be shorn off. If frequent brushing is too much effort, it is better to
chose another breed rather than clip the Keeshond short.
History
The Keeshond was named after the 18th-century Dutch patriot, Cornelis (Kees) de Gyselaer, leader of
the Dutch rebellion against the House of Orange. The dog became the rebels' symbol, and when the
House of Orange was returned to power, this wonderful breed almost disappeared. Luckily, the breed
continued as a guard on Dutch barges. Later, in the 1920s, Baroness van Hardenbroeck took an interest
in the breed and began to build it up again. The Keeshond was accepted for AKC registration in 1930.
Now bred for many generations as a companion dog, the Keeshond easily becomes a loving family
member.

Miscellaneous

Breed pronunciation

Out of the 350 some purebreds, the Keeshond has possibly the most mispronounced name. "Kay sawn",
"Case-hond", "kās-hond", "keys-hând", "keesh-ond", and "keesh-hond", as so many will say, are all
improper pronunciations. The proper pronunciation is "kayz-hond" or "kayz-hawnd" with the proper
pronunciation of the plural being "kayz-honden" or "kayz-hawnden".

Colored Keeshonden

Historically, Keeshonden came in several colors—white, black, red, orange, orange-shaded white (also
called orange and cream), and silver gray. Originally, like many other spitz-types, many colours,
including piebalds, were allowed, but as time progressed, only the silver-grey (wolf-colored) color was
finally established into the Wolfspitz type.[1],[2].

While colored Keeshonden can have terrific conformation, they're not allowed to be shown in the show
ring. Colored Keeshonden are considered "pet quality" and thus should be fixed.

Recently, the appearance of oddly-colored Kees in otherwise long, purebred lineages has caused
research into the early history of Keeshond coat colors. Because of this, some breeders wonder whether
the Keeshond should be bred for colors other than grey. There are many bloodlines carrying the colored
gene, and rather than examples of mixed breeding, colors are legitimate throwbacks to an earlier era of
the breed.

No one knows the exact number of colored Keeshonden born in the United States. Incorrect, or
incomplete, accounts of documentation make it impossible to determine how many colored Keeshonden,
and of which colors, have been born in the United States.

The King Charles Spaniel (known as the English Toy Spaniel in the U.S. and Canada) is a small breed
of dog in the spaniel category. The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel is a different breed, although it is
descended from and sometimes referred to as a King Charles Spaniel.

History
The breed originated in Renaissance-era Great Britain as a companion dog for royalty, although in that
era the breed more closely resembled the modern Cavalier King Charles Spaniel than contemporary
English Toys. Crosses between long-snouted toy spaniels and short-snouted breeds such as the Pug or
Japanese Chin in the 18th and 19th centuries led to the breed's current appearance.

                            Notes



The Komondor is a livestock guardian dog breed originally from Hungary. Known as the king of the
Hungarian sheepdogs, the Komondor is a truly impressive animal. The plural is Komondors or
Komondorok.

Appearance
Large (27 in/69 cm at the withers, 100 lb/45 kg), it has a thick, muscular body. Male Komondorok are a
minimum of 27 inches at the withers, but many are over 30 inches tall, making this a truly impressive
dog. The body is not overly coarse or heavy, however, and people unfamiliar with the breed are often
surprised by how quick and agile the dogs are.

Coat

Its long, thick, uniquely and strikingly corded white coat (the heaviest amount of fur in the canine world)
resembles dreadlocks. The puppy coat is soft and fluffy. However, the coat is wavy and tends to curl as
the puppy matures. A fully mature coat is formed naturally from the soft undercoat and the coarser outer
coat combining to form tassels, or cords. These cords are formed naturally as a result of the soft, wavy
undercoat intertwining with the coarser outer coat. The length of the cords increases with time, as the
coat grows. Shedding is very minimal with this breed, contrary to what one might think. The only
substantial shedding occurs as a puppy before the dreadlocks form. The Komondor is born only with a
white coat, unlike the Puli, which is usually white or black, or sometimes grayish. However, a working
Komondor's coat may be discolored by the elements, and may appear less than white if not washed
regularly.

History
The Komondor is an ancient breed, thought to be of Asian origin, descending from the dogs whom the
Magyars brought to Hungary in the 10th century. It's been suggested that the name "Komondor" comes
from the Cuman (or Koman) people, who were Turkish-speaking people who once lived near the Yellow
River; Koman-dor would mean the dog of the Cumans. The unique dreadlock appearance gives a hint of
common origin with the Puli and the Bergamasco. There might also be a link between the Komondor
and the big, white Russian livestock dogs, the South Russian Ovtcharka.

The Komondor is built for livestock guarding. It is big, strong, and armored with a thick coat. The coat
provides protection against wild animals and the weather and vegetation. The coat is the trademark of
the breed.

The Komondor is rare everywhere outside the country of origin, Hungary, although the USA and
Germany have large Komondor populations. In the USA, the Komondor is used as a livestock guardian,
but in Europe, outside Hungary, most Komondors are guardian and family dogs.

Temperament
Komondorok are independent, protective, aggressive with strangers, territorial, and very intelligent. The
Komondor excels as a guardian because it bonds strongly with its charges. The Komondor is a protector
rather than an aggressive dog looking for trouble; indeed, a good livestock guardian will not leave the
flock to chase a predator. In the absence of a flock, the Komondor bonds with the owner and family,
making it an excellent family dog. It is indeed intelligent and independent, due to the fact that
traditionally it lived with the animals with no master on hand to make decisions and direct the dog's
actions. The Komondor therefore makes his own decisions, which means the owner must bring the dog
up to understand that the owner makes the decisions and the dog must abide by them. No Komondor of
good temperament is aggressive toward his charges, however, human or animal. Such aggression is plain
poor temperament, not correct behavior for this breed.

Health
They have a life span of approximately 12 years and a tendency to develop bloat and skin problems. As
with many large breeds, there is also a predisposition toward hip dysplasia.

The Kooikerhondje or Kooiker Hound, is a small spaniel-type breed of dog of Dutch ancestry that was
originally used as a working dog, particularly in duck hunting. Kooikers were popular in the 17th and
18th century and appeared in the paintings of Rembrandt and Jan Steen.

Appearance
These dogs are around 35 to 40 cm high at the withers with a nearly square body that is slightly longer
than their height at the shoulders. They have long, hanging ears with wispy tips that are set close to the
head and upright, feathered tails. For showing, black ear tips and white tails are preferred.
They have multicoloured coats, often predominantly white and chestnut. The fur is medium long and
either slightly wavy or straight. The breed has a waterproof coat that does not require clipping, with a
well-developed undercoat.

Temperament
Kooikers are intelligent, alert, agile dogs, generally with a benevolent nature. However, they can be
extremely territorial and will bark at strangers. They are usually good swimmers and can generally adapt
to different levels of exercise.

Health
Kooikers have good appetites and a tendency to put on weight easily.

History
After earlier popularity as a hunting dog, the breed almost became extinct after World War II until
Baroness van Hardenbroek van Ammerstol rescued it. The breed was only officially recognised by the
Dutch Kennel Club in 1971 and has since been imported into other countries and recognised officially
although the breed is still relatively unknown in North America and not yet recognised as a breed in
America or Canada.

   Koolies registered with the Koolie club of Australia are
    accepted to the Canine Control Sporting registers in
        Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland.

The Koolie is an Australian dog breed; specifically, it is a herding dog or working dog. Koolies have
existed in Australia since the early 18th Century.

Appearance




                                 Blue Merle short coat

The Koolie is a medium-sized dog of varying coat type, and color though they are generaly recognised
with a merled coat pattern. Koolies are typically slightly longer than tall and resemble a cross between a
Border Collie, Kelpie and an Australian Cattle Dog, dogs with whom they share Collie bloodline
ancestry.

Like the Jack Russell Terrier Club of America, the Koolie Club of Australia defines the breed based on
its ability to work rather than on its conformation. Unlike the JRT Club of America, most Koolie
breeders refer to this dog as a breed rather than as a type, and assert that it "breeds true".

History
The Koolie is believed to be descended from the same Collie types that were brought to Australia for the
kennels of Thomas S. Hall (an originator of the Australian Cattle Dog breed); some believe that they
could be direct descendents of Hall's dogs. This, if true, would make the Koolie the oldest of Australia's
breeds.
                                 Red Merle short coat

The dog was originally referred to as a German Coolie or Collie or simply Coolie. To avoid unpleasant
connotations and also so that the breed's Australian origins are not confused, the Koolie Club of
Australia officially changed the breed name to Australian Koolie most enthusiasts use the current
spelling, or just Koolie although the variants are also seen.

The Koolie is currently not recognized by any of the major kennel clubs, although judges from the
ANKC may judge Koolies. In the states of Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland, Koolies may
compete in canine council-sponsored working, Obedience, tracking, Jumping and dog agility events by
registration on their Sates Sporting Registers. In 2000, the Koolie Club of Australia was formed to
preserve, protect and ethically promote the Koolie breed. Opinion is divided as to whether official
recognition would be good for the breed. As of (2006), no bench standard exists and none is expected in
the near future.

Miscellaneous

Herding technique

Koolies are much sought after in rural Australia and interest is now being shown in America and
Germany. According to Geoff Broughton, the current president of the Koolie Club of Australia, the
Koolie will head (move to the front or head of the stock to push them back towards you), heel, drive
(push the stock from behind), cast (move out and around the stock), and back, literally jump onto the
backs of their charges, to herd them if necessary. Koolies have a reputation for being an upright worker
with a good eye, who can easily shift their focus from holding the group to casting around a flock or
gathering breakaways. They are not known for having sticky eyes (stuck on the sheep that's in front
only). Unlike other working breeds which are noted for their crouched form or style and preference for
either yard or field work, Koolies are just as much at ease working in close as in yards or trucks or out in
paddocks and droving. As well as working anything from ducks to bulls, like all dogs of their kind, they
will herd family members and children in the absence of other charges.

                              Notes



The Korea Jindo Dog (진돗개) is a breed of dog originating in Korea. The Jindo is a hunting dog,
originally from Jindo Island. Although relatively unknown outside Korea, it is celebrated in its native
land for its unswerving loyalty to its master.

Appearance
The Jindo is a medium-sized, double-coated spitz-type dog, with prick ears. The body is either square or
slightly longer than tall. It has been divided into two body types: Tonggol or Gyupgae and Hudu or
Heutgae. The former is very muscular and shorter in body, with a depth of chest equal to one-half the
height at the withers and a shorter loin, while the latter is more slender with somewhat less depth of
chest and a slightly longer loin, resulting in a height to length ratio of 10:11. Typically, males are larger
with heavier heads and females have more fox-like features. These two types are gradually being
blended into a third type called Gakgol, which retains the length of body of the Hudu style and the depth
of chest of the Tonggol style. "The topline inclines very slightly downward from well-developed withers
to a strong back with a slight but definite arch over the loin, which blends into a slightly sloping croup.
The ribs are moderately sprung out from the spine, then curving down and inward to form a body that
would be nearly oval if viewed in cross-section. The loin is muscular but narrower than the rib cage and
with a moderate tuck-up. The chest is deep and moderately broad. When viewed from the side, the
lowest point of the chest is immediately behind the elbow. The forechest should extend in a shallow oval
shape in front of the forelegs but the sternum should not be excessively pointed.

     ●   Maturity: May reach full size by 5 months, but takes 2 years to physically and emotionally
         mature.
     ●   Height: At maturity, desirable height for male dogs should be 19 1/2 to 21 inches and 18 1/2 to
         20 inches for females.
     ●   Weight: In good condition, males should be 35-45 lbs. and 30-40 lbs. for a female.
     ●   Tail: There are two types: ring tail, rolled on its back; erect tail, straight up.
     ●   Eyes: Gingko nut-shaped yellowish brown eyes with clear pupils. Jindos with reddish eyes are
         considered better hunters.
     ●   Ears: Ears start out floppy and usually stand erect by 5 or 6 months. Jindos with ears that
         straighten later are said to be better hunters.
     ●   Hair: Coat is of medium length, coarse with a thick undercoat. Jindos shed twice a year.
     ●   Color: Korean law currently only recognizes white Jindos and red (tan) Jindos, thus they are the
         most popular colors. Some Jindo Island residents have valued black, black/tan and red/white
         Jindos for being good hunters over the years. The UKC recognizes five different coat colors:
         white, fawn, gray, black and tan, and brindle (tiger pattern).
Temperament
The Korean Jindo Dog is well known for its unwavering loyalty. Because of this there is a
misunderstanding that a Jindo will be loyal only to its first owner or the owner when young. However,
there are many examples of older Jindos being adopted out of shelters in the United States and becoming
very loyal friends to their new owners.

They are highly active and are not meant to be indoor-only dogs. Jindo dogs need reasonable space to
roam and run. Jindos require a lot of care and attention. They are also known to be escape artists and
high jumpers. If kept in a yard, the fencing must be at least six feet high.

Because the Jindo is an active and intelligent dog, it requires frequent interaction with people or another
dog in the family. If left alone by itself for a long stretch, it finds its own entertainment. A Jindo may
climb over a fence or wall, dig the ground, or tear up the house if confined indoors. Worse still, a
mistreated or badly trained Jindo may roam around the neighborhood and attack neighbors' pets and
threaten people.

For this reason many Jindo dogs are found in animal shelters. Also because the breed is not well known,
there are many good Jindo dogs available for adoption.

With Jindos, establishing the hierarchy (humans above dogs) with care and affection is essential.

It is important to socialize Jindos at a very early age. As with humans, Jindos will test boundaries to
establish themselves at the top of dog hierarchies--a true alpha dog--due to the way in which the breed
evolved. This may result in dog aggression in the unsocialized Jindo.

Jindos serve as excellent watchdogs, able to distinguish friend from foe, familiar people from strangers.
They are conscious of their owners' reactions towards others and act accordingly. Because Jindos so
rarely bark, especially in familiar environments, an owner may lend special credence to the warning of
his/her pet. Many are also finicky eaters and will not take food from strangers.

People adopt Jindo dogs because of their beautiful appearance, high intelligence, loyalty, and sometimes
for their fighting spirit, then quickly realize that raising a Jindo dog to be a well-behaved member of the
family takes a lot of effort and time. Many Jindo Dogs are abandoned in the U.S. because of the
difficulty of training them. Potential owners who are prepared and determined to have an intelligent,
loyal, but independent companion can adopt a Jindo dog from shelters.

History
It is said that Jindo Dogs descended from Mongolian battle dogs that were left on Korea's Jindo Island
after the Mongols' 13th century invasion of Korea. The Korean King surrendered but some of his armies
withdrew to Jindo Island, off the southern coast of Korea, where they continued to fight. This is known
as the Sambyeolcho Rebellion. The soldiers' dogs ended up isolated on Jindo Island, where they
developed a very pure strain. As the Jindos primarily bred themselves without human selection of traits,
only the most dominant dogs reproduced; this resulted in the formation of the highly dominant nature of
the Jindo. Jindos served both as hunting and guard dogs in Korea. In 1962, the Korean government
designated the white Jindo as the 53rd Natural Monument [1]; and passed the "Jindo Preservation
Ordinance". Jindos marched in the opening ceremonies of the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul, Korea.
The United Kennel Club recognized the Jindo on January 1, 1998.

Miscellaneous

Other characteristics

Jindo dogs will housetrain themselves as puppies. Even off lead or without direction, they will often
relieve themselves in the farthest corner of the yard.

Availability

Jindo dogs are not well known and not very common in the United States or generally outside of Korea,
especially purebreds, since the Korean government restricts the exportation of this breed.

However, Jindo Dogs are taken into the U.S. by former residents of Korea, and are bred for sale there.

                            Notes
The Kuvasz (pl. Kuvaszok, also known as the Hungarian Sheepdog) is a dog breed of ancient
Hungarian origin. The word is, contrary to some theories, not of Sumerian origin. These dogs are used to
guard livestock. Mention of the breed can be found in old Hungarian texts.

Appearance
Kuvasz are large white dogs with wavy fur, black noses, and almond shaped eyes. They are larger than
the average Labrador Retriever. Their facial features are very similar to those of a Golden Retriever,
however their build is larger.

Temperament
The Kuvasz can be a loyal pet who appreciates attention but who is not very demanding. The Kuvasz is
generally a quiet dog unless it perceives a threat to its family or territory. When it feels the need, it can
also be a fearless and aggressive protector. Considering the size and strength of this breed, they can be
quite impressive in this role. The Kuvasz has been known to be a very powerful breed, with the ability to
take down an adult bear.

                            Notes



A Labradoodle is a crossbred dog created by crossing the Labrador Retriever and the Poodle. Their
temperament makes them good service dogs.

The impetus behind experiments with this type of cross was the desire to achieve a service dog that
would not shed and so produce a hypoallergenic dog that is suitable for people with allergies to fur and
dander. This has not yet been reliably achieved, as Labradoodles have varying coat lengths and textures,
and crosses beyond the first generation do not yield a predictable coat type.
The Labradoodle is still under development. Strictly speaking, the labradoodle cannot yet be described
as a dog breed because it does not breed true. In breeders' terms, breeding true means that, when two
specimens of the same breed are mated, the puppies will have consistently predictable characteristics,
and will resemble their parents, rather than exhibiting random characteristics of the dog breeds in their
parents' ancestries. Further, the breed standards of breeds-under-development are invariably freer, more
open to interpretation and cover more observable types than those of established or kennel club-
recognized breeds.

Some breeders are anxious for the Labradoodle not to become a recognised breed in the belief that
genetic problems, such as the Labrador's weak hips, will otherwise continue. By restricting breeding to
F1 dogs (bred from a poodle and labrador rather than two labradoodles)it is hoped to maintain a wide
gene pool.

The Lakeland Terrier is a dog breed, one of many Terrier breeds, that originated in the Lake District of
England as a descendant of the old English Black and Tan and Fell Terriers.

Appearance
The breed is similar to the Welsh Terrier and has thick, hard hair that is coloured black and tan, blue and
tan, red-gray, red, wheat, liver, blue, or black. They have an upright tail. Lakeland Terriers grow to
between 33 and 38cm (13 to 15 inches) in height measured to the withers with a weight of between 7
and 8 kg (15 to 17 lbs).

History
In 1925 the breed attained homogeneity following a cross-breeding with the Fox Terrier and the
Airedale Terrier. The Lakeland Terrier is suitable for fox and rabbit hunting and for sheep predator
control.

                          Notes
The Leonberger is a giant breed of dog. The breeds name derives from the city of Leonberg in south-
west Germany. Due to this breeds large size, love of muddy water, and the amount of attention and
excercise needed, the Leonberger is not commonly seen in large cities or towns.

The female Leonberger weighs up to 60 kg and the male up to 80 kg although males of 59kg and
females of 45 kg are acceptable in show ring. The Leonberger sheds heavily.

Temperament




The Leonberger can make an excellent companion with a loving temperament. They are good with
children and are happy to play ball with the whole family. They get on well with other pets if they are
taught from an early age how to behave around them. They are sociable dogs that love other dogs and
water. This breed should be walked daily, starting with about 20 minutes a day as a puppy and working
up as the dog grows. They are not good apartment dogs; they at least need a big back yard where they
can run around.

History
The Leonberger, was originally bred from the Newfoundland, Saint Bernard, and Pyrenean Mountain
Dog. They originated from Germany in the early 1800s, it was bred to resemble the coat-of-arms animal
of Leonberg, the lion.

The Lhasa Apso is a small breed of dog originally from Tibet. They were used as watchdogs inside
Tibetan monasteries for over 2000 years, for which they are uniquely suited with keen intelligence, acute
hearing, and instincts for identifying friends from strangers.

Appearance
They are generally 10 to 11 inches (25 to 28 cm) at the withers and weigh between 15 and 25 lbs (7 and
11 kg). Lhasas should have dark brown eyes with black pigmentation on eye rims and a black nose.
They have a straight coat with soft undercoat (depending upon weather conditions) which comes in a
variety of different colors. The tail should curl up over the back.

Temperament
Having been bred to be sentinel or watch dogs, Lhasa Apsos tend to be alert and have a keen sense of
hearing with a rich, sonorous bark that belies their size. They are bright and outgoing, but some tend
toward wariness of strangers. Wariness does not mean unwarranted aggressiveness but having a
discerning attitude towards strangers; people approaching the dog simply need to show that they are a
friend. However, many Lhasas are quite friendly from the first introduction. If not properly socialized,
some may become aggressive or overly shy toward strangers.

History
The original American pair was a gift from the Dalai Lama to C. Suydam Cutting, arriving in the United
States in the early 1930s. The American Kennel Club officially accepted the breed in 1935 in the Terrier
group, but in 1959 moved the breed to the Non-Sporting group.

Recently, DNA Analysis has identified the Lhasa Apso as one of the 14 most ancient dog breeds.


Miscellaneous
Apparently monks believe that Lhasas are reincarnated lions and as such hold them in high esteem.
Golden Lhasas are said to house the souls of the Dalai Lamas.

The Löwchen once had the dubious disinction, like the Portuguese Water Dog and the Havanese, of
being the "rarest dog in the world". Even today, the breed generally has fewer than a few dozen new
registrations each year worldwide1.


Appearance
The Löwchen is, depending who you ask, a terrier or bichon type dog, with a long, slightly harsh coat
that should be presented in a lion cut. This means that the haunches, back legs, front legs (except
bracelets around the ankles), and the entire tail but the tip are shaved, and the rest of the coat is either
left natural or is slightly trimmed to give the appearance of a lion-like form. A small dog, they are
considered by some registries as toys, and have been long-time companions of royal courts.

The head of the Löwchen is one of the most important features, with its short, wide muzzle, broad skull,
lively round eyes, and pendulant ears. The head, when in proportion to the body, is neither too big nor
too small, but helps to emphasize the friendly, regal, and leonine personality of the Löwchen.

The coat should not be thin and fluffy like a Bichon Frise, but wavy with a mix of thicker hairs amongst
the fine ones. This allows for a flowing coat that is not frizzy or fly-away, and a Löwchen coat should
neither be soft like a bichon nor harsh like many terriers. They can come in all colours that allow for
dark eyes and nose, except, in the case of FCI, brown.

History
The Löwchen's origins are cloaked in mystery. The little lion dog is seen in many art pieces featuring
dogs as far back as the 1500s, but it is unclear whether these were all dogs like the Löwchen, or simply
small dogs of the Bichon type that were trimmed in a lion cut.

It is an old breed type, found in many countries as far back as the 1500s. The modern sources of the
breed were french and german enthusiasts in the late 19th century.

The term Mackenzie River husky describes several overlapping local populations of arctic and
subarctic sleddogs, none of which constitutes a breed. Most prominent and current of these are the
sleddogs of Donna Dowling and others in the interior of Alaska. These dogs are described as standing 27
to 32 inches (61-81 cm) in height and weighing 70 to 125 pounds (32-57 kg). Usually long-coated, they
are rangy, deep-chested and long-legged, built for heavy freighting in single file through deep snow.
Their colours are the usual northern-dog range of black and white, shades of grey and sable, tan, or
blonde.

Historically, the term has been variously applied to different dog populations in the arctic and subarctic
regions of Alaska and Canada. Dogs from Old Crow, Fort McPherson, Arctic Red River, Porcupine
River, Hay River and Mackenzie River regions, although distinguished by locals, were collectively
termed “Mackenzie River” dogs by outsiders; crosses of these local freighting huskies with large
European breeds such as St. Bernards, Newfoundlands, or Staghounds were sometimes called
“Mackenzie River Hounds,” giving rise to great confusion surrounding the name. Some reference
sources describe the Mackenzie River husky as a dog, used by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police,
consisting of a mix of Inuit (Eskimo) dog, large European breeds, and wolf ancestry.

Currently Donna Dowling acts as a co-ordinator for Alaskan residents interested in breeding and
preservation of the native arctic freighting dog. She describes the gene pool as capable of considerable
variation, but states that the temperament is always guaranteed to be independent but “completely
trustworthy with children, intelligent and eager to work.”

The Manchester Terrier is a breed of dog.
Appearance
Developed in the medieval era in England. It is said that that its closest ancestor and relative is an
English terrier known as the Black and Tan Terrier, which was crossed with Whippets to impart some
elegance and speed. The Manchester Terrier is said to be one of the ancestors of the Dobermann and is
partly responsible for imparting the black and tan colouration and sleek appearance to the latter.

History
The original intent of the breeders was to develop a breed that was good at killing rats. It is the earliest
known breed of dog developed exclusively to kill rats. The dogs used to be used in the blood sport of rat
baiting and bets were placed as to how quickly it could kill 100 rats. The dog who took the least time
emerged the winner. The sport is now banned. In addition, at one point in its history, this breed was used
for coursing small game.

                              Notes



The Maremma Sheepdog is a majestic white breed of dog, of a large size and a rustic appearance.


Appearance
They are strong, active, and for their size, very lithe. The Maremma Sheepdog is a massive, noble
distinctive-looking dog with a bear-like head. The jaws are strong with a scissors bite. It has a black
nose that often becomes slightly pink-brown with age. The ears are v-shaped, pointed and rather small.
The eyes have a lively, intelligent expression, but are not large. The nasal canal is straight. The tail is
low set and thickly feathered with dense hair. The deep, well-rounded ribcage extends to the elbows.
The long, harsh, and very abundant hair has a slight wave. The under-coat is dense. Coat colors include
white with markings of ivory, light yellow, or pale orange on the ears.

Temperament
Maremma Sheepdogs are a working dog and need a job to keep them occupied. They are devoted to
their master but treat them as an equal and a friend. They are affectionate with people they know.
Always treat a Maremma fairly and they will turn into an indispensable guardian angel for your stock,
your farm, and your family. Nevertheless, this rugged wolf-slayer breed has adapted into a marvelous
companion, without losing its extraordinary working abilities. It will defend both house and master, and
it is particularly attentive with children.

The Maremma is a friendly and well-balanced flock guardian, sober and dignified. This loyal, brave, and
determined dog makes an excellent guard-dog without being a constant barker. It is correctly described
as affectionate but not dependent. As a pet, they are not very attached or overly outgoing. This breed is
not a dog that will follow your every command submissively and certainly not if it cannot see the point
to it. It is very intelligent and its education and training require mutual respect in handling and voice,
and above all, consistency.

It gets along with other dogs and pets and can be slightly reserved with strangers but not strongly so.
People who are not welcome on your property will be stopped in their tracks. The Maremma is not as
large as many of its fellow flock guards, but he still possesses comparable endurance and strength, as
well as the ability to make up for the extra 50 pounds (23 kg) it lacks. It is alert and independent.

Original use
Their function has been to guard the flock and property of the shepherd for millennia, even in situations
where man is not present. A flock guard of impressive dominance and lifelong dedication, the breed
takes control over its flock and human family.The Maremma is a marvelous sheepdog and loves its
work. It is a terrible enemy of the wolf, but tame with man. Held in high esteem by shepherds, especially
in the mountains where it thrives in the snow; resistant to both cold and brambles. For several decades, it
also achieved success as a companion dog. This is due to the fact that English breeders have developed
dogs of excellent character.

The McNab—also called a McNab Sheepdog, McNab Border Collie, or McNab Herding Dog—is a
developing breed of dog. It originated from a smooth-coated dog typically reported to be the Scotch
Collie or Fox Collie that was also the ancestor of the Border Collie. The breed's focus is on herding.


Appearance
The appearance of dogs called McNabs can vary widely, though their shared roots with Border Collies
means that they are often black and white. McNabs also often have as ancestors breeds such as
Australian Cattle Dogs and other herding breeds. Some are large dogs of approximately 70 lbs (32 kg),
while others are as small as 40 lbs (18 kg); some have natural bobtails and others have long, narrow,
short-furred tails.

Characteristics
The primary quality that these dogs are bred for is their herding ability; they are well known as cattle
herders, but can herd other animals, such as horses, sheep, and llamas. McNabs are well-mannered dogs,
obedient, hard-working, water-loving with consequent good personal hygiene, and friendly with small
domestic animals such as cats and chickens, but they require extensive grounds in which to run and are
happiest with a job to do.

History
The breed has its roots in northern California, where they were first bred by a Scotsman named
Alexander McNab in the late 19th century.

The Miniature Australian Shepherd is a breed of dog developed by selectively breeding small
Australian Shepherds.

The breed is rapidly increasing in popularity among those interested in a compact dog of strong work
ethic. It is especially popular in dog agility, and does well in other dog sports including herding,
obedience, frisbee, and many other activities.

Appearance
The Miniature Aussie ranges in height from 14 to 18 inches (35 to 46 cm) at the withers and weighs
between 20 and 40 pounds (9 to 18 kg). Coat colors are the same as those for Australian Shepherds.

Temperament
Miniature Australian Shepherds are eager to work, which makes training and interacting with them a
pleasure, but their intelligence and drive require obedience training and plenty of interesting activity.
Because they are herding dogs, they make good guard dogs and excellent companion dogs for those who
provide an adequate outlet for the Mini Aussie physical and mental energy.

History
The history of the Miniature Australian Shepherd is the same as that of the Australian Shepherd until
approximately the 1960s. Thereafter, fanciers formed member clubs and registries to promote the dog as
a separate breed.

The Miniature Australian Shepherd has been recognized as a separate breed by the American Rare Breed
Association (ARBA) and the National Stock Dog Registry (NSDR). Dogs that are registered with the
Miniature Australian Shepherd Club of America (MASCA), North American Miniature Australian
Shepherd Club of the USA (NAMASCUSA), and NSDR may be registered with the United Kennel Club
(UKC) as Australian Shepherds only. The UKC does not recognize the Miniature Australian Shepherd
breed or a size variety of the Australian Shepherd.

The Miniature Fox Terrier is a small, fine, lightweight working terrier developed as a hunting dog and
vermin router. It is known colloquially in its native Australia as the “Mini Foxie”.

Appearance
This is a balanced, smoothly-muscled dog breed; its head is distinctive, with erect ears that can stand
straight up or fold just at the tips. Another distinguishing feature is its articulate, oval-shaped foot. The
breed standard has always allowed for the dog's tail to be docked or undocked. Natural bobtails are
known to occur. There are only three permitted colour combinations: black and white, tan and white, and
tricolour (black, white, and tan). The coat of the Mini Foxie is always short and fine.

It is akin to the Toy Fox Terrier, a breed that developed along similar lines in the United States. Some
Toy Fox Terrier owners can trace their dogs’ pedigrees to "Foiler", the first Fox Terrier registered by the
Kennel Club in Britain, circa 1875-6. Other related breeds include the Jack Russell Terrier, the Rat
Terrier, and the Tenterfield Terrier.
Temperament
Mini Foxies are known for being fiercely loyal to their owners and their owners' property, a
characteristic written into the breed standard. They must have an inquisitve and bold nature. According
to at least one breed club, they make excellent family pets. They get along well with other animals but,
like most working terriers, cannot distinguish between small pets—such as reptiles and fancy rats—and
vermin, and must not be left alone with such animals.

Health
Miniature Fox Terriers are generally healthy and hardy despite their size. They need little maintenance;
lightweight individuals and those that do not run on hard surfaces will need regular nail clipping.
Luxating patellae, a common ailment among small breeds, occurs frequently among backyard bred dogs
of this breed; breed clubs usually insist upon health screening for breeding individuals to help eradicate
it. The breed lives on average 14 years, with much older dogs not uncommon.

History




                               A Tan and White Mini Foxie with folded ear tips

The breed was most likely developed when smaller puppies from litters of Fox Terrier types were
crossed with Manchester Terriers, and, later, to other toy breeds such as the English Toy Terrier and
Whippet. Hunters were seeking a smaller, speedy Fox Terrier that could be used for hunting smaller
pests such as rats and rabbits. Although the origins of the breed are English, the breed was developed in
and is endemic to Australia. By the late 1800s, the breed type was clearly identifiable, where the Little
Fox Terrier proved its worth against rabbits, rats, and snakes on Australian farms. Mini Foxies
demonstrated tenacity, endurance, and extreme loyalty to their owners; the dogs were routinely taken on
the hunt, were sometimes used in search parties, and were used at Sydney’s North Head Quarantine
                                    [1]
Station, the Riverstone Meat Works , and the Brisbane City Council as vermin exterminators.

The dog’s vigilance, size, affectionate temperament, and ease of care soon resulted in its becoming a
popular choice in urban centers as well, and by the 1920s the Miniature Fox Terrier was iconic. So well
known and popular was the “Little Foxie” that very little thought was given to the need to preserve its
lines.

History of the breed club

By the 1980s, the interest in dog fancy, the looming spectre of proposed breed-specific legislation, and
increasing concerns about the need to protect purebred dogs led a group of enthusiasts to begin meeting
informally to consider the future of these little dogs. In 1986 the Miniature Fox Terrier Club of Australia
was formed. The founding members, in conjunction with members of the Canine Council of New South
Wales, wrote a breed standard for their breed and laid out a Constitution for the Club.

In 1991, fanciers in South Australia also formed a breed club. For these members, official recognition of
the dog by the Australian National Kennel Council was the most important of their goals. At that time,
challenges to the name “Miniature Fox Terrier” were being mounted, and threatened to preclude
recognition by an All-Breed club. These members joined with some owners in Western Australia and
organized as the Tenterfield Terrier Club of Australia (1993), a name which was first used by a
television personality of that era. The ensuing breed standard for the Tenterfield Terrier differs in
substance from that of the Miniature Fox Terrier, and though the two dogs are sometimes confused, they
have been developing along divergent lines for over twenty years and are now different breeds. To
comply with New South Wales government regulations for becoming an incorporated organization, the
Miniature Fox Terrier Club became incorporated as the Mini Foxie Club of Australia, Inc. (1992).

The breed is not recognized by the ANKC but ANKC judges may judge them.

In 2005, the Mini Foxie was added to the list of dog breeds recognized under the NSW Companion
Animals Act.

The Miniature Fox Terrier today

Although still relatively unknown outside of Australia, the Little Foxie is renowned in its native land.
Several parliamentarians made reference to the breed during recent legislative hearings on canine issues.
‘Pasqua’ and ‘Fergus’ owned by Anthony Field of The Wiggles, are Mini Foxies, and Ian Thorpe, the
Australian swimmer, has spoken fondly of Tiny, his Miniature Fox Terrier, in several interviews.

Today, the Miniature Fox Terrier is still very much a working terrier, and is in demand on farms across
Australia. They remain popular as pets, and enjoy playing the pampered pooch. As long as their active
minds are kept stimulated with games or toys and they receive at least moderate exercise, they make
excellent urban and apartment dwellers.

The Miniature Pinscher, also known as the Minpin by fanciers, is a toy breed of dog. Minpins were
first bred to hunt vermin, especially rats. In its native Germany, the dog is known as the Zwergpinscher.
Pinscher, refers to a classification of dogs bred as guardians or to hunt vermin. Zwerg, in German,
means Dwarf or Midget.




                                 A Miniature Pinscher puppy

Appearance
Typically, the Minpin stands between 25 and 30 cm (10 and 12.5 in) at the withers, give or take a bit
depending on the breed standard. Its weight is about 2.3 to about 4.5 kg (8 to 10 lb).

The coat colors, according to most breed standards, are red, stag-red, fawn, and black with tan markings.
The coat should be short and smooth.

A Minpin frequently has a docked tail and cropped ears, although this is becoming a somewhat
controversial practice, especially outside the United States.
Temperament
Dogs, like people, have a wide range of personalities. Although the same is true for Minpins, members
of the breed generally share some personality traits. Minpins, by their nature, are not generally timid,
calm "lap dogs." Rather, they have an energetic spirit and curious nature. Although small, a Minpin
generally makes a good watchdog, as the breed is eager to sound the alarm when unfamiliar people and
creatures appear in or around the home.




                                 Socialization can never begin too early.

Socialization

As with any puppy of any breed, it is important to properly socialize a Minpin puppy with people and
dogs. This is especially true for Minpins, since their small size combined with curiosity and fearlessness
could pose problems with larger dogs and human houseguests. Fans of the breed argue that its exuberant
spirit and small size make it the ideal house or apartment dog. The dog's energetic temperament, cat-like
agility, and curious nature, however, may not be for everyone.

Care
Although the breed is not necessarily bad with children, care must be taken in educating youths about
proper handling and play. Although Minpins are known to bound through, around, and over obstacles,
they can be easily injured by rough play with a child.

Grooming is easy, as the smooth, short-haired coat requires little attention. Care must be taken in colder
weather, however, as this coat provides virtually no protection from the cold.

Due to their instinct to hunt vermin, one should take special care in preventing a Minpin from
"attacking" small objects, such as bottle caps, as they could pose a choking hazard.

History
Although appearing similar to the Doberman Pinscher, the Minpin is not a "Miniature Doberman".
Rather, the breed is much older. Although, the miniature pinscher has appeared in paintings and
sculptures several centuries ago, the factual documentation on this breed goes back less than 200 years.
The Doberman Pinscher was bred by Lois Dobermann in 1890 to resemble a Miniature Pinscher. Both
Miniature Pinscher and Dobermann Pinscher share common ancestors. Similarities between the two may
result from a common genetic relation to the German Pinscher. Some genetic stock may have been
contributed by the Italian Greyhound and the Dachshund. The source of confustion regarding the
relationship between the Doberman and the Miniature Pinscher may have been the result of a Miniature
Pinscher breed standard from the 1930s, which basically stated that the breed should appear as a
Doberman in miniature. The Miniature Pinscher was imported into the U.S. in 1919 and was first
registered with the AKC in 1925.

                            Notes



The Miniature Schnauzer is a breed of small dog of the Schnauzer type that originated in Germany in
the mid-to-late 19th century. The dogs are believed to have developed from crosses between the
Standard Schnauzer and one or more smaller breeds such as the Poodle, Miniature Pinscher, or
Affenpinscher.


Appearance




                                 Miniature Schnauzer pup at five weeks

Miniature Schnauzers are quite distinctive in appearance. They are compact, muscular, and square
shaped. Owners typically groom them with long bushy eyebrows, beards, and long leg hair. Ears are
sometimes cropped to stand upright, and the tail may also be docked. Their coats are wiry, and shed very
little, which adds to their appeal as house pets. The AKC recognizes only three colors: black, salt and
pepper, and black with silver markings. Occasionally, they may be white, but this is rare; this coloration
is allowed in Europe but not by the AKC. Heights of about 13 to 15 inches (330 to 380 mm) are
common, and they generally weigh 13 to 18 pounds (6 to 8 kg).

Temperament
The dogs are known for their friendly personality and mischievous sense of humor as well as
intelligence and boundless energy.

A Miniature Schnauzer's personality can develop based on the family with which it lives. It can develop
certain traits that other family members possess.

While very good with children and most other pets, the Miniature Schnauzer does best when growing up
with them. He does not respond well to new additions after he is grown, and can go into a depressive
slump at a new arrival, sometimes causing health problems. This can be compensated for by lavishing
him with extra attention, but it is better not to induce this stress in the first place.
Miniature Schnauzers are good guard dogs in spirit, though the most damage they are likely to do is to
bite the attacker's ankles.

History




                                 Black Miniature Schnauzer with silver markings

The earliest recorded Miniature Schnauzer was in 1888, and the first exhibition was in 1899. With their
bold courage the Miniature Schnauzer was originally used for guarding herds, small farms and families.
As time passed they were also used to hunt rats, because they appeared to have a knack for it, and its
small size was perfect to get into tight places to catch them. The AKC accepted registration of the new
breed in 1926, 2 years after they were introduced to the United States.

Miscellaneous
Miniature Schnauzers are often classified as "working dogs," owing to their past as ratters. Currently,
they are most often employed as companion animals.

Health
Miniature Schnauzers are prone to Diabetes and Pancreatitis. With proper care, avoiding feeding sweet
or fattening food, it can often be avoided. Miniature Schnauzers with uncropped ears are prone to ear
infections and deafness later in life if the ears are not checked regularly or dried out after swimming.

Mioritic is a breed of large sheep dogs that originated in the Carpathian Mountains of Romania. They
have a height of about 65-75 cm, a weight of 50-60 kg and a life expectancy of about 12-14 years.This
massive dog is covered in thick fluffy hair and has one of the best personalities that recommend this
breed as a good choice for many owners.

The Mioritic has discipline as one of their main characteristics and is a calm and well mannered dog. As
this dog was used as a herd protector, he is very attached to family and goes all the way when protecting
those he is attached to. Because of this dog's ability to bond strongly with his master, Mioritic dog
training should only be started once the Mioritic puppy is already accustomed to the owner/trainer. The
combined strength and loyalty of the Mioritic recommend the breed as a good choice for guard dogs,
pets and flock dogs.

The Mountain Cur is a type of working dog used for treeing and trailing game; mainly squirrel and
raccoon, but also large game. It is a member of the Hound group. They can also be used as water dogs.
Mainly bred in Kentucky, Virginia, and Tennessee, it has been registered with the United Kennel Club
since 1998. The Mountain Cur Breeder's Association was formed in 1957.

History
The Mountain Cur was brought to America from Europe by the settlers of the Virginia, Kentucky, and
Tennessee mountains to guard the family and property, and chase and tree game. These dogs enabled the
settlers to provide meat and pelts which could be sold or traded for other goods. The Mountain Cur was
bred and maintained for nearly two hundred years. With the advent of World War II, many of the
families who had bred them left the rural areas and went to work in factories in the war effort. By the
end of the 1940's the breed was becoming rare. Four individuals, Hugh Stephens and Woody Huntsman
of Kentucky, Carl McConnell of Virginia and Dewey Ledbetter of Tennessee are given credit for saving
the breed from dying out and setting the Mountain Cur breed standard.
Appearance
    ●   Coat: Heavy, medium short.
    ●   Color: Black, black and brindle, yellow and can have white points.
    ●   Head: Broad square with top being a flat plane between the high set ears.
    ●   Eyes:Dark brown, expressive.
    ●   Ears:Short to medium with a high set and tightly controlled.
    ●   Muzzle: Heavy with wide nares. Teeth form a scissor like bite.
    ●   Body: Stocky, muscular, square and slightly longer than the tail which can be docked but long
        enough to form a handle for show. Some pups are born with a bobbed tail.
    ●   Legs: Straight, medium long, muscular capable of speed.
    ●   Feet: Oval shaped, muscled with feline-like pads. Can have back dew claws.

Temperament
The Mountain Cur is intelligent, easily trained, and neither vicious nor shy. They can be suitable as
companion animals and guard dogs.

Trivia
The book Old Yeller by Frederick Gipson was about a Mountain Cur but, in the 1957 movie Old Yeller,
he was played by a yellow Labrador Retriever.

The Mudi is a rare herding dog breed from Hungary.


Appearance
Mudis usually weigh 18 to 29 pounds (8 to 13 kg) and stand 14 to 20 inches (35.5 to 51 cm) high at the
withers. The coat is medium long and curly, commonly black, blue merle, ashen, brown, white, or
piebald.

Temperament
The Mudi is a versatile farm dog that can hunt, exterminate rodents, and act as a capable herding dog
and flock guardian. Although the breed is much less popular than the better-known Puli and Komondor
breeds in its native country, owners of the Mudi claim that he is incomparable for his versatile talents
and pleasant disposition.

                          Notes



The Mudhol Hound is an Indian breed of dog of the sight hound type. The breed is also known as
Caravan Hound and the feathered variety is commonly referred to as a Pashmi. In the villages he is
known as the Karwani. It is a common companion amongst village folk in India's Deccan Plateau, who
use the dog for hunting and guarding. However it is largely unknown to the general public or dog lovers,
both in India and abroad.

The Kennel Club of India and Indian National Kennel Club recognize the breed under different breed
names. The KCI registers it as a Caravan Hound while the INKC goes with the name Mudhol Hound.

Appearance




The Mudhol/Caravan of today has well-defined characteristics. The head is long and narrow, broad
between the ears with a tapering muzzle. The jaws are long and poweful, with a scissors bite. The nose
is large, and may be black, liver, or flesh coloured. The ears are medium sized, very slightly rounded at
the tips, and hang close to the skull. The eyes are large and oval in shape, and may be dark or light in
colour. The expression is a piercing gaze. The neck is long, clean, and muscular, and fits well into the
shoulders. The forelegs are long, straight and well-boned. The males are 68-72 cms in height and the
females are 64-68 cms tall. The back is long, broad and well-muscled. The loins are wide and deep. The
chest is strong and deep with well sprung ribs. The abdomen is tucked in. The hind quarters appear wide
and well-muscled. The tail is strong at the base, not too long, set low and carried in a natural curve. The
gait is high-footed, flexing all the four legs, but should not be hackney. There are two coat varieties -
one with an entirely smooth coat and the other with silky featherings on the ears, legs, and tail. All
colours and combinations of colours are acceptable.

Temperament
The breed is not spoilt; it leads a hard life that is essentially the survival of the fittest. It does not know
veterinary care and food is in short supply. The hound is employed for hunting but it receives only very
little of what it brings back. Its usual diet is roti and milk, supplemented with occasional table scraps.
Still it is extraordinarily strong and resistant to a variety of diseases.

The breed is above all a working hound, capable of providing an excellent performance in the field on a
consistent basis, under gruelling conditions that would decimate most other dogs. It is therefore elegant,
graceful, and courageous. Its physical strength couples with great speed and plenty of stamina to allow it
to catch and kill several types of game, from hare to blackbuck, over rough country.

History
The Mudhol/Caravan is an ancient breed, native to the Deccan Plateau of western India. This region
covers parts of the states of Maharashtra, Karnataka, and, to a lesser degree, Andhra Pradesh. The breed
is basically an offshoot of the Saluki and was first introduced into India by traders and mercenaries from
various parts of Asia, who traveled in caravans. When local people saw the dogs running alongside the
caravans, they began referring to them as “karwani”, meaning “of the caravans”. The name endures to
this day in the villages, but it was anglicized to Caravan Hound when the Kennel Club of India
recognized the breed.

In Karnataka, the breed is also known as the Mudhol Hound, after a small town in Bijapur district. A
former ruler of Mudhol, Sri Srimanth Raja Malojirao Gorphade (Maloji Rao Ghorpade), is said to have
presented a pair of hound puppies to King George V of England. Upon inspecting these curiosities, the
monarch found them true to sighthound conformation and dubbed them “the hounds of Mudhol”.

It is found not only in Mudhol, but is widely kept throughout the Deccan; however, the Indian National
Kennel Club uses the Mudhol Hound name.

                                                                                 Back | Home | Up | Next


The New Guinea Singing Dog (NGSD, New Guinea Highland Dog, or Singer) is a relative of the
Australian Dingo that is native to New Guinea. Discovered by Sir Edward Halistrom in 1957, NGSDs
have remained isolated for almost 6000 years, making them possibly the oldest of the pariah dogs. They
are unique in their ability to howl in a wolf-like manner, but unlike wolves, Singers modulate the pitch,
hence the name. NGSDs have a fox-like appearance, with a double coat that ranges in color from red to
brown, and have a characteristically large carnassial tooth. They stand between 14 and 18 inches (36 to
46 cm) at the withers, and weigh 17 to 30 pounds (8 to 14 kg)as adults.

Once thought to inhabit the entire island of New Guinea, today populations remain only in remote
mountainous areas. They are an exceptionally clever breed of dog, but are hard to keep because of wild
behavioural traits. There is some debate as to whether NGSDs are truly domesticated animals, though
with proper training, the pack-instinct of the NGSD usually makes it possible to keep the animal. They
are a recognized breed by such organizations as the United Kennel Club, which classifies them as a
pariah dog.

                            Notes
The Norfolk Terrier is a small breed of dog, one of many terrier breeds. Prior to 1960, when it gained
recognition as an independent breed, it was a variety of the Norwich Terrier, distinguished from the
Norwich by its "drop", or folded ears.

Appearance
The Norfolk Terrier has a wire-haired coat which, according to the various national kennel club breed
standards, can be "all shades of red, wheaten, black and tan, or grizzle."

They are the smallest of the working Terriers. They should feel heavier in weight than they appear to be.
They are self confident and carry their heads with presence and importance and the tails should also be
held erect.

They are active and compact, free moving, with good substance and bone. Good substance means good
spring of rib and bone that matches the body such that the dog can be a very agile ratter, the function for
which it was bred. Norfolks are moderately proportioned dogs. A too-heavy dog would not be agile. A
too-refined dog would make it a toy breed. Norfolks generally have more reach and drive and a stronger
rear angulation, hence cover more ground than their Norwich cousins. Norfolk have good side gait owed
to their balanced angulation front and rear, not their perceived slightly longer length of back as is often
cited.

The ideal height is 10 to 12 inches ( 25-30 cm) at the withers and weight is about 12 pounds (5 Kg).
They are the smallest of the terriers.

Grooming

These breeds have two coats - a harsh, wiry topcoat and a soft warm undercoat. All that is really
necessary for grooming a companion dog is a good combing and brushing once a week to remove the
loose, dead hairs and prevent matting. The coats should be hand stripped once in the Fall and once in the
Spring. Clipping or cutting ruins the coat's colours and texture. You can wash this coat with a dog
shampoo any time it is desirable.

Temperament
Norfolk Terriers are described as fearless but should not be aggressive despite being capable of
defending themselves if need be. The AKC standard describes the Norfolk as “alert, gregarious, and
loyal”. They are dogs that work in packs and must get along with other dogs. They love people and
children and can make good companions.

A Norfolk that is shy, or carries its tail between its legs is untypical as is a dog that is hot tempered and
aggressive with other dogs; these are not the standard. Norfolk Terrier's typical breed temperament is
happy, spirited and self confident.

Health
There are incidences of health issues that responsible breeders consider worthy to do preventative
testing. Norfolks have incidences of mitral valve disease, luxating patellas, hip dysplasia and bad bites
(where the teeth do not align with the breed standard, ie. overshot or undershot)

Exercise
A good daily walk takes care of the exercise requirements of the Norfolk Terrier. They are good walking
companions and reasonable joggers.

History
In the 1880s, British sportsmen developed a working terrier of East Anglia, England. The Norwich
Terrier and later the drop-eared variety now know as the Norfolk Terrier, were believed to have been
developed by crossing Yorkshire Terriers, Cairn Terriers, and small, short-legged Irish Terrier breeds.

They were first called the Cantab Terrier when they became fashionable for students to keep in their
dormitory at Cambridge University in England. Later, they were called the Thrumpington Terrier,
after a street in the area where the breed was first developed. Then, just prior to WWI, a Norwich
huntsman helped introduce the short-legged terriers to the USA, calling them the Jones Terrier.

In 1932, the Norwich was granted acceptance into the English Kennel Club and the first written standard
was created. The American Kennel Club registered the first Norwich Terrier in 1936. In 1964, The
Kennel Club reclassified the drop-ear variety as it its own breed, the Norfolk Terrier, and the prick-eared
variety retained the name Norwich Terrier. The American Kennel Club and Canadian Kennel Club both
recognized the division of the Norwich Terrier breed in 1979. After many generations, these two breeds
have developed as two distinct breeds both in physical looks and in temperament. Of note, there is
literature that suggests that the Norfolk and Norwich were always two distinct breeds and the original
mistake was classifying them as one.

Working style

They are tireless workers in the field. These versatile, agreeable dogs can go to ground and bolt a fox
and tackle or dispatch other small vermin, working alone or in a pack. Their courage is so that
“honourable scars from wear and tear” should not be counted against them in the show ring.

The Norwegian Buhund is a breed of dog, specifically a member of the spitz family. The dog is the
national dog breed of Norway. It is closely related to Icelandic Sheepdog and Jämthund. In Norwegian,
hund means dog and bu refers to both homestead and livestock.

Appearance
The Buhund ranges in size from about 17 to 18 inches, and between 30 to 40 lbs. It comes in wheaten
and black. The wheaten colour (colour of wheat straw) has a variety of shades ranging from light to
almost red and with various degrees of shading from dark tipped hairs, including wolf sable, which is
recognised in the UK as a separate colour.




                                                Two black Buhund Bitches.

Temperament
The Buhund is friendly and funloving and gets along with both people and other animals. They are alert,
agile, and quick learners. They possess a good amount of energy, making them good for dog sports and
for just going for a good run, or ball play.

The Norwegian Elkhound is a breed of dog, specifically a member of the scenthound family. The dog
is the national dog breed of Norway.

Description
The dog stands about 52 centimetres high and weighs up to 24 kilogrammes. Its grey coat is made of
dense smooth lying hair ranging from black at the muzzle, ears and tip of its tail, to silvery grey on its
legs, tail and underbody. Solid black elkhounds are rarer.

Origin and history
Archaeological digs in Scandinavia show this breed existed in the Stone age. At the end of the 19th
century the breed came to England and in 1901 the The Kennel Club was officially recognised it.

For many years, the breed was considered one of the oldest dog breeds, going back more than five
thousand years. Recent DNA analysis reveals, however, that this breed is actually a recent construction,
bred to resemble an older form. An ideal elkhound has a tightly curled tail, as the dog shown in the
photograph on this page. The elkhound is a medium sized dog and extremely hardy. They are bred for
hunting large game, such as bear and elk. The elkhound has a very strong drive and it is not unheard of
for an elkhound to go through a plate glass window when motivated by its quarry. Although the breed is
strong and hardy, the dogs typically have an inseparable bond with their masters and are quite loyal.[1]
The Norwegian elkhound was presented at a dog exhibition for the first time in 1877.

Temperament
Norwegian Elkhounds are loyal to their "pack" and make good family dogs. They are tolerant of
children and are protective of those they consider part of their pack or family. Norwegian Elkhounds are
difficult to train because of their intelligence and deep independent streak. However, they are good
natured in their disobedience (for example, failing to "come" because there is something of greater
interest in the other direction).

Grooming
Norwegian Elkhounds shed a great deal, particularly in fall and spring when they molt their undercoats.
Elkhounds require significant grooming because their oil glands will become plugged and easily infected
without regular brushing. When brushed in a hot summer month, the dog will produce copious amounts
of fur, which in some rural regions of Norway, people make clothing such as sweaters from.

The Norwegian Lundehund (Norwegian: Norsk Lundehund (from Norsk (Norwegian), lunde (puffin)
and hund (dog)) is a small dog breed originating from Norway and originally bred for hunting puffins.


Appearance
It is known for its great range of motion in its joints. It can swivel each ear 360 degrees. The Norwegian
Lundehund has an extra toe (at least 6 total) on each foot and double dew claws on the forefeet, which
helps with climbing cliffs when hunting puffins. The neck is double jointed and the legs can be bent to
sides at 90º angles because of moveable shoulder-joints and are also capable of 180º rotation. The
outercoat is dense and rough with a soft undercoat.

History
The breed has a long history. As far back as 1600 it was used for hunting puffins along the Norwegian
coast. Interest for the breed declined when new methods for hunting puffins were invented. A dog tax
also led to a decline in the dog population. The breed was nearly extinct around World War II—only 5
dogs survived. Due to careful breeding with strict guidelines, there are now around 1500-2000 dogs in
the world, with around 1100 in Norway. Estimates show there are approx. 250 in the US.

The Norwich Terrier is the smallest of the Terriers that was bred to hunt small vermin.

Appearance
These terriers are among the smallest terriers (11-12 lbs, 5 to 5.4 kg; 9 to 10 inches (24 to 25.5 cm) at
the withers), with prick ears and a double coat. In its earliest history, it was also known as the Jones
Terrier and the Cantab Terrier. It was developed in East Anglia in England.

Temperament




                                              Norwich Terriers can be red, wheaten, black and tan, or
grizzle (red and black hairs intermixed).

These small but hardy teddy bears are courageous, remarkably intelligent and wonderfully affectionate.
They can be assertive but they are never aggressive or quarrelsome. They are energetic and thrive on an
active life but won't be any worse for wear if they miss a day's exercise now and then. They are easy to
train and eager to please. They are sensitive to scolding but 100% Terrier. They should never be kept
outside or in a kennel setting because they love the companionship of their owners too much. Norwich
are not given to unnecessary barking but they will warn of a stranger approaching. When brought in to
the home as a puppy they quickly accept other pets and love children. Males often make the best
companions though are a little more sensitive to changes in routine than females. Most important is that
Norwich do not have a road sense and hence need to be kept on lead when there are being walked.
Norwich seem to prefer the company of humans over other dogs, though they readily accept their
heritage of being pack dogs.

History
The breed has existed since at least the late 1800s, as working terrier of East Anglia, England. The game
and hardy little dogs were useful as ratters in the stable yard, bolters of fox for the hunt, and loving
family companions. It was the mascot of students at Cambridge University. Small red terriers,
descendants of Irish Terriers, had existed in the area since at least the 1860s, and these might be the
ancestors of the Norwich, or it might have come from the Trumpington Terrier, a breed that no longer
exists.

Since its earliest identification as a breed, puppies have had either drop or prick ears, and both were
allowed when the Norwich was first recognized in the show ring in 1932 by The Kennel Club (England).
Drop ears were often cropped until it became illegal to do so. This intensified a long-standing
controversy over whether drop-eared dogs should be allowed in the show ring and whether the primary
difference was simply the ears or whether other, deeper, personality and structural differences marked
the drop-eared variety. Starting in the 1930s, breeders increased their efforts to distinguish the breeds.

Both ear types continued to be allowed in the ring until The Kennel Club recognized the drop-eared
variety as a separate breed, the Norfolk Terrier, in 1964, and the American Kennel Club and Canadian
Kennel Club did the same in 1979.

                            Notes



The Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever is one of the most unusual breeds of gundog, at least in terms
of how the dog works. The hunter stays hidden in a blind and sends the dog out to romp and play near
the water, usually by tossing a ball or stick to be retrieved. The dog's crazy antics and white markings
pique the curiousity of waterfowl, who swim over to investigate. The act of enticing or luring game to
approach is known as tolling. When the birds are close, the hunter calls the dog back to the blind, rises,
putting the birds to flight, and shoots them. The Toller then retrieves any downed birds.

Appearance
The coat is of moderate length and consists of a waterproof outer coat with a dense undercoat for
warmth. The tail is heavily feathered and the legs are moderately feathered. The coat color may be any
shade of red, with deeper colouring preferred. There is usually some white on the chest, feet, nose, head,
and tip of tail. Tollers range in height from 18 to 20 inches (43-53 cm) at the withers for males, and
weigh 45 to 51 pounds (17-23 kg). One unusual feature of this breed is the webbed feet that permits
them to swim easily, along with the "feathered" tail that they use for added balance.

Temperament
The Toller is a gentle but active breed. They are highly intelligent and easy to train, although many get
bored with repetition. The dog requires extensive daily exercise, as well as regular grooming. They are
excellent with older children, but can be wary of strange adults. They do not have the all-forgiving
temperament of a Golden Retriever and should not be left unsupervised with young children who have
not yet learned how to interact with dogs. Potential owners should note the "Toller scream," a high-
pitched and very loud utterance made up of a growl, whine, bark, and howl. The dog will do this to show
great excitement and, depending on the dog, any other reason.

History
The breed was developed in the Little River district of Yarmouth County, Nova Scotia around the
beginning of the 19th Century, and was officially admitted to the Canadian Kennel Club in 1945. 56
years later on June 11, 2001 it was approved for admission into the Miscellaneous Class of the American
Kennel Club and was granted full recognition into the Sporting Group on July 1, 2003. The exact origins
of the breed are not known, but it appears that some Cocker Spaniel, Golden Retriever, and/or Irish
Setter may have gone into the mix. It may share origins with the smaller Kooikerhond.

The Old Danish Pointer is a medium-sized breed of dog, white with brown markings, originally used as
a pointing dog in Denmark.


Appearance
                                  Old danish pointer, puppy, dog

Old Danish Pointers are strongly built. One of the most charming features of the breed is the great
difference between male and female. While the dog is powerful and substantial, the bitch is
characterized by being lighter, more spirited, and capricious.

     ●   Height at the withers:
             ❍ Male 54-60 cm (21-23.5 in), above 56 cm (22 in) preferred.

             ❍ Bitch 50-56 cm (19.5-22 in), above 52 cm (20 in) preferred.

     ●   Weight:
             ❍ Male 30-35 kg (66-77 lb)

             ❍ Bitch 26-31 kg (57-68 lb)




                                                Old danish pointer, dog

Temperament
Conveys the impression of a quiet and stable dog showing determination and courage. During the hunt,
the dog progresses rather slowly, always maintaining contact with the hunter and accomplishing its task
as a pointing dog without creating unnecessary disturbance of the ground. The breed is suited for small
as well as large hunting grounds.

This is a friendly family dog, as long as it gets its excercise. It is fast and active outdoors and quiet
indoors, but is not suitable for apartments or small yards.
History
The origin of the breed can be traced back to about the year 1710 when a man named Morten Bak, living
in Glenstrup near the towns of Randers and Hobro, crossed gypsy dogs through 8 generations with local
farmdogs and in this way established a pure breed of piebald white and brown dogs called Bakhounds or
Old Danish Pointers. The local farmers called their farmdogs Bloodhounds, but it seems more likely that
these hounds were offspring from the Squire’s scent hounds, which in turn were descended primarily
from St. Hubert Hounds. Likewise it is probable that the gypsy dogs generally descended from Spanish
Pointing Dogs and other breeds of scent hounds, so in many ways St.Hubert Hounds have contributed to
the Old Danish Pointer.

                           Notes
An Old English Sheepdog is a breed of dog formerly used for herding livestock, and now primarily
kept as a pet. They are best known for their shaggy grey and white fur which also covers their face,
including their eyes, which leads some casual observers to wonder how they can see.

Appearance
Males generally weigh 70 to 100 pounds although some can get up to 100 pounds (45 kg); females, 60 to
80 pounds. They stand around 22 inches at the withers. Their long coats can be any shade of gray,
grizzle, blue, or blue merle, with optional white markings. The undercoat is water resistant. The Old
English Sheepdog's abundant coat is an effective insulator in both hot and cold weather.

Temperament
This breed is intelligent, funny, social, and adaptable. It generally gets along well with children, other
dogs, other pets, and visitors. Like all herding breeds, it requires plenty of exercise, both mental and
physical.

Care
The long coat requires thorough brushing at least weekly, and the long hair around the pads of the feet
can form mats if it isn't kept trimmed.

Some people save their Old English Sheepdog's shed hairs at moulting and have spun it into yarn.

                            Notes



The current day Olde English Bulldogge is a breed of dog that resulted from one American breeder,
David Leavitt. In 1971, Leavitt began breeding to restore the English Bulldog to its original standard of
the now extinct Old English Bulldog, but without its aggressive tendency.


Appearance
Just as the original Old English Bulldog came in various sizes, the Olde English Bulldogge ranges from
80 to 100 lbs (36 to 45 kg).

History
By combining the affable modern English Bulldog with the more resolute American Pit Bull Terrier,
Bullmastiff, and American Bulldog, David Leavitt of Spring Grove, Pennsylvania was successful in
eliminating the English Bulldog's breathing problems and several other health issues, while at the same
time diminishing the tenacity of some of the other breeds.

Miscellaneous
The breed is currently registered by the National Kennel Club, the Animal Research Foundation, the
Continental Kennel Club and the International Olde English Bulldogge Association.

The Otterhound is an old British dog breed, with Bloodhound ancestors, and who is in turn one of the
ancestors of the Airedale Terrier.


Appearance
The Otterhound is a large, rough-coated hound with an imposing head showing great strength and
dignity, and the strong body and long striding action fit for a long day's work. They generally weigh
between 80 and 120 pounds (36 to 54 kg). It has an extremely sensitive nose, and is inquisitive and
perseverant in investigating scents. The Otterhound hunts its quarry on land and it has a combination of
characteristics unique among hounds; most notably a rough, double coat and substantial webbed feet.

Temperament
They are basically big, friendly dogs with a unique bass voice that they sometimes use to excess.
Because Otterhounds were originally bred for hunting, their most important characteristic is their
ultrasensitive nose. As a result, new owners of Otterhounds often find that their new dog gets into
everything and that the dog needs to be supervised or confined when unsupervised. The Otterhound's
hunting background means that it has energy and endurance, requiring more energetic exercise than
simply walking around the block. This is a good breed for active people who have a lively sense of
humor!

Health
The breed lives to between 10 and 13 years old, although some have reportedly lived to be 15 or older.

Miscellaneous
There are only an estimated 1,000 or so Otterhounds in the world and somewhere between 350 and 400
in the US. Even in the early 20th century, when otter hunting was most popular as a sport, Otterhounds
were not numerous. But they can be good family dogs that simply demand a bit more training than some
other breeds.

                             Notes



The Papillon is a small dog with large, luxurious ears that earned it its name, the French word for
butterfly. The Papillon is believed to be one of the oldest of the toy breeds.


Appearance




                                   The Papillon comes in several colors. This one does not meet the breed
standard criteria for facial coloration.

The modern Papillon bred according to the official breed standard is required to have an abundant,
flowing coat, which is considered proper only if it is a single coat (i.e., has no fluffy or cottony
undercoat), short on the head but profuse around the neck, chest, and pantaloons or culottes. The tail
should be a plume of long hair. A proper single coat ensures relatively low maintenance in grooming.
The large, erect, and fringed ears are the most notable physical attribute of the erect-eared breed today.
The Phalène is the same as the erect-eared Papillon except for its dropped spaniel-like ears. The AKC
considers the Phalène a variant of the Papillon and judges them together as the same breed; countries
whose breed clubs follow the FCI standard consider Papillons and Phalènes two separate breeds. This
belief is common, but the fact is that Papillon is a variant of the much older race Phalène. Papillons
should always be white with another color. Most common are the black and white, sable and white, red
and white, and tri-color papillons. The color should always cover both eyes and the front and back of the
ear to give the proper butterfly look. A white blaze and noseband are preferred as they also contribute to
the correct butterfly look of the dog. Size should range from 8 inches to 12 inches at the shoulder (11
inches in the UK) with the average papillon being between 9 and 10.5 inches in height and weight in
proportion.

Temperament




                                  The Papillon is not the dainty breed that most suspect.

Even though the breed has the connotation of a dainty toy breed, many owners will tell you they act like
big dogs in small dogs' bodies. There are several possible reasons for this. First, the Papillion is hardy;
some people believe the Papillon is very capable of handling a good five-mile walk. Some owners
believe the reality is that they will resist such an outing if the grass is dampish or if there are two clouds
in the sky that might lead to rain, but others have experienced them as very versatile in almost all
conditions, although not necessarily with prolonged exposure. Perhaps they seem to be larger dogs
because to many people Papillons appear not to be prone to small dog quaking when confronted with a
new situation. In fact, some Papillon owners believe that their dogs interpret any new event as having
been put on for their benefit, and believe that the dogs do their best to be an attentive host or hostess.
Another aspect of the Papillon that has led many to believe the 'big dog' assertion is that this breed is
surprisingly athletic. Perhaps people are surprised that in contrast to its staid and stately representation in
the Old Master portraits, the Papillon is highly energetic and intelligent (Stanley Coren, in The
Intelligence of Dogs, rates the Papillon eighth among all breeds). Provided their genetic structure is
sound and they are healthy, Papillons are built for movement, and most do not need any encouragement
to apply their energy to athletic activities.

History
The Papillon probably originated in continental Europe and was a favorite at the French court. The most
famous owner was Henry III; documentation of his devotion to the breed lies in his declaration of the
Papillon as the official dog of the Royal Court during his tenure. Other famous owners are said to have
been Marie Antoinette, and Madame de Pompadour.

There is evidence that these small dogs were favorites of European aristocrats, particularly French
royalty, during the time of the Old Masters, as Continental Toy Spaniels (Phalènes and Papillons) were
included in many Old Master royal portraits from as early as the sixteenth century.




                                    The Papillon is a highly athletic breed.

There are many stories about the Papillon. Marie Antoinette was said to have walked to the guillotine
clutching her small dog under her arm. Tradition has it that her dog was a small spaniel that had been
brought to the French court from Spain on the back of pack mules. According to the story, her pup was
spared and cared for in a building in Paris still called the Papillon House. Marie's small spaniel was said
to have descended from a very old drop-eared breed known as the Epagneul Nain Continental, or
Continental Dwarf/Toy Spaniel that appeared in church frescos and paintings as early as the 13th century.

The Papillon is still officially referred to as the Epagneul Nain Continental (ENC) in non-English-
speaking countries. The name Squirrel Spaniel also has been used, most likely referring to an earlier
standard in which the tail set is described as "curling over the back as a squirrel's." One version of the
history of the two varieties of ear shape in the ENC ("Papillon" to denote the erect ear and "Phalène" to
denote the dropped ear) is that toward the end of the 19th century, breed fanciers bred a version of the
spaniel whose ears stood up. This dog was said to have been nicknamed papillon based on the
impressively large, erect ears that resembled the wings of a butterfly. The drop-eared variety of the
breed came to be called the Phalène (which means "moth"). Both types are still bred today and appear in
the same litter. The Papillon variety is much more common, although recently the Phalène has
undergone a resurgence in popularity.

Dog Agility

In recent years, the Papillon has become a small dog star in the sport of dog agility. This sport consists
of an obstacle course with tunnels, jumps, A-frames, and narrow bridges that a dog completes at top
speed aided only by verbal and body-language commands from a handler. Agility requires the dog to
spring, scramble, weave, and turn on a dime. The breed is considered naturally agile, and Papillons
compete at both national and international trials. Because many Papillons have intense drive and natural
speed, their tiny turning radius gives them an edge over larger dogs, and some Papillons are capable of
beating even Border Collie speeds on some courses. At the same time, Papillons excel in companionship
and lap dog sweepstakes, and take it very seriously. The first dog to ever earn a MACH title in Alaska is
a Papillon.
Others have experienced Papillons as highly companionable—yet physically active—dogs requiring
appropriate socialization, consistent and monitored exercise, continued training (which also serves to
stimulate their active minds), and daily, proactive human-to-canine interaction.

The Parson Russell Terrier was the first recognized
variant of the Jack Russell Terrier (as the Parson Jack
Russell Terrier, by the Kennel Club, 1990). It is a
balanced, square dog, very similar in form to the other
Russell Terriers. Like all Jack Russells, the Parson
Russell Terrier is descended from the type of fox terrier
preferred by John "Jack" Russell, "The Sporting Parson".

Parson Russells are a longer-legged (therefore, taller; 12-
14 inches) version of the Jack Russell Terrier, although it
must be pointed out that taller Jack Russell types do exist
as "Jack Russells" in some working Jack Russell Terrier
clubs in the United Kingdom and the United States.

The Patterdale Terrier is a breed of dog native to the Lake District of Cumbria in Northwest England.
The name Patterdale refers to a village a little south of Ullswater and a few miles east of Helvellyn.

Appearance
According to breed standards, this terrier stands between 25,5 cm (10 inches) and 38 cm (15 inches) at
the withers and weighs between 4,5 kg (10 pounds) and 11 kg (24 pounds). The preferred size depends
on the quarry. In Great Britain, all sizes are in use, depending on the terrain and the quarry. Quarry here
is mostly fox. In the eastern United States, smaller is preferred and 30 cm (12 inches) tall and 5.5 kg (12
pounds) is considered the maximum usable size for groundhogs (aka woodchucks). However, larger (9 -
12 kg) is preferred when hunting raccoons in excess of 13 kg (29 pounds).

95% of the breed is black, but bronze (black that shines brown in sunlight), grizzle, chocolate, red, liver
(with red nose)and black-and-tan are also acceptable. White feet and white chest markings appear in all
coat colours. Coats are smooth, rough, or broken-coated. However, this breed is rarely shown and
breeders are more concerned with the practicality of the breed than with outward appearances.
Practicality means strong neck, jaws, and teeth; staying power at bay; ability to squeeze into tight
burrows; durability and endurance; and peaceful with humans, livestock, and other dogs.

Temperament
Most Patterdale puppies are bold and confident beyond their capabilities, and therefore are never, or
briefly, entered to rats as they soon lose all caution when confronted with quarry of any size. Many a
bold pup has lost his life in a raccoon den while on a casual walk-in-the-woods in the States. They have
great stamina and can work quarry all day, or play all day with the kids. Yet, indoors they are relaxed
and quiet. They have been exported abroad notably to the States where they appear to be used primarily
as hunting dogs.

An excellent book about the origin of the breed and fell terriers in general is The Fell Terrier by D.
Brian Plummer from The Boydell Press. Plummer goes into depth describing the land and the people
that shaped the big dog in the small package currently called the Patterdale Terrier.

History
The Patterdale Terrier of modern times refers to the mainly black smooth coated fell terrier first
popularized by Cyril Breay from Kirkby Lonsdale and Frank Buck from Leyburn in Yorkshire during
the early part of the 1950s. At that time, any "typey" fell terrier being shown in the Lake District was
called a Lakeland Terrier, or simply called a coloured terrier, whether or not they were from Ullswater
county. In the early 1960s, Brian Nuttall of Holmes Chapel began breeding dogs that he acquired from
his grandfather and from Breay and Buck blood lines. These dogs were carefully linebred. Nuttall blood
lines are still considered to be of the highest quality and adds a bit to the price of a puppy. The modern
Patterdale Terrier is to fell terriers, what the Jack Russell Terrier is to hunt terriers—the indisputable
leader in numbers and performance as a breed.

They were developed in the harsh environment in the north of England that is unable to sustain
agriculture and too hilly in the main for cattle. Sheep farming is the dominant farming activity on these
hills. Foxes being predatory on sheep and small farm animals, necessitated predator control. Unlike the
hunt terriers to the south, typified by the Jack Russel terriers of today, which are bred to bolt a fox to
continue the chase, or to bay the fox until the fox can be dug to, these fell terriers were bred to bolt the
fox or dispatch it, if it chooses to fight. Where much of the "earths" in south of England are an easy dig,
much of the north of England includes "earths" too rocky and/or too deep to dig. The fell terriers that
survived to pass on their genes, have created a truly "tough as nails" dog.

Some puppies are allowed to chase rabbits, but most tire of chasing any quarry that won't turn and fight.

                                Pekeapoo dog

A Pekeapoo (or, sometimes, Peekapoo) is a crossbred dog created by breeding a Poodle with a
Pekingese. In addition to being a combination of the two breed names, the name is probably a pun on
Peekaboo (a game for amusing a small child, in which one covers one's face or hides and then returns to
view saying “Peekaboo!”)

They are small for dogs, weighing from 9 to 20 pounds.

Due to the nature of their breeding, Pekeapoos have few defining characteristics. They are not
recognized by any breed registry.

The Pembroke Welsh Corgi (IPA: / kɔ(r) gi/) is one of two dog breeds known as Welsh Corgis that
originated in Pembrokeshire, Wales. These herding dogs are believed to be descended from Swedish
Vallhund dogs that came to Wales with the Vikings. The phrase "cor gi" translates to "dwarf dog" in
Welsh.

Appearance




                 Corgis' upright ears are distinctive




                      Tricolor (black and tan) Corgi with predominant black coloring

A Pembroke is between 10 and 12 inches (250 to 300 mm) tall at the withers (tallest point in the
shoulders) and weighs no more than 30 lb (15 kg); dogs in peak condition weigh about 27 pounds (12
kg) for the male and bitches about 2 pounds (1 kg) lighter. Pembrokes can be red, sable, fawn, or black
and tan with or without white markings on the legs, chest, neck, muzzle, underneath, and as a narrow
blaze on the head. Too much white is considered a fault in show dogs. Historically, the Pembroke was a
breed with a natural bob tail (very short tail). Due to the advent of docking, the trait was not aggressively
pursued, with breeders focusing instead on other characteristics, and the tail artificially shortened if need
be. Given that some countries are now banning docking, breeders are again attempting to select for dogs
with the genes for natural bob tails.

Temperament
Like most herding breeds, they are active, intelligent, and athletic dogs despite their shorter legs. The
short legs may seem to be a disadvantage, but they can run and jump just as well as any other dog of
comparable size. Though still sometimes used as a working dog, today they are more commonly kept as
companions. They are happy, loving, and eager to please. Pems are intelligent and quick thinkers, which
can make them challenging to train, but their desire to please means that they thrive on praise.




                                    Sable Pembroke doing agility teeter-totter

Although short, Corgis are fast runners and, like most herding breeds, need a minimum of an hour's
exercise daily. They are, contrary to appearances, a medium-size dog and should not be thought of as a
toy dog or one who needs less attention and activity.


Health
The length of the spine can cause spinal problems and early arthritis in Corgis. Corgis usually live about
twelve to fourteen years.

Pembroke Corgis, if not kept active and if overfed, can easily become obese, which is bad for their
elongated backs.

History
Originally bred for herding sheep and cattle, they have proven themselves as excellent companion
animals and are outstanding competitors in sheepdog trials and dog agility.

Corgis are becoming more popular in the United States and rank 23rd in American Kennel Club
registrations [1] as of 2004.
Miscellaneous




                               The dog, Ein

Ein, from the anime Cowboy Bebop, is a Pembroke Welsh Corgi.

Pembroke Welsh Corgis are a favorite of Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom.

               FCI recognition is still pending.

The Perro de Presa Canario is a large breed of dog. These dogs were originally bred to hold and guard.
They are a separate breed from the Dogo Canario.
Appearance
Presa Canarios have thick skin and short fur that comes in fawn, brindle (various shades), and black;
white is allowed up to 20 percent. No shades of blue are allowed in competition. Males average around
125 pounds and females roughly 105 pounds.

Many breeders are trying to change the functionality of this breed by breeding males above 140 pounds,
which causes health, endurance, and other issues.

History
The breed is originally from the Canary Islands in the 1800s. Its exact ancestry is unknown, but
enthusiasts believe that an already established farm dog from the Canary Islands by the name of Majero
bardino majorero was crossed with the Mastiffs and Old-Style Bulldogs that were brought from Europe
to the Islands, creating the modern Presa Canario. Like many fighting dogs, the breed became nearly
extinct after dog fighting was outlawed in the 1940s, but it was revived in the 1970s.


Health
Hip dysplasia is known to occur in this breed.


Aggression
As with any breed, those interested in purchasing a Presa Canario should carefully research breeders and
a dog's ancestry to ensure that the breeding lines are healthy. Some enthusiasts hold that, if the dog's
pedigree cannot be traced back to the Canary Islands, it is not a true Presa Canario but rather a Bandog.

As Presa Canarios are often bred for fighting or as attack dogs, this breed has a reputation of fierce
loyalty to its owners and vicious aggression to any other person or animal perceived as a threat. Owners
should be vigilant about purchasing from reputable dealers and ensuring the dog receives obedience
training.

The breed received considerably press noterity after Diane Whipple was mauled to death in 2001 by a
neighbor's two Presa Canario in the hallway of her San Francisco apartment building. The dogs'
caretakers were convicted of manslaughter.

The Peruvian Hairless Dog is a breed of dog with its origins in Peruvian pre-Inca cultures. It is one of
several breeds of hairless dog.
History
This is an ancient breed. Although it is often perceived to be an Incan dog because it is known to have
been kept during the Inca-imperium, they were also kept as pets in pre-Inca cultures from the Peruvian
coastal zone. Ceramic hairless dogs from the Chimú, Moche, and Vicus culture are well known. The
main area of the Inca imperium (the mountains) is too cold for the natural existence of the dogs. The
Spanish conquest of Peru nearly caused the extinction of the breed. The dogs survived in rural areas,
where the people believed in their magical forces. In recent years, the Fédération Cynologique
Internationale (FCI) accepted the breed and adopted an official breed standard. Before that time, in the
United States, some enthusiasts created another type of Peruvian hairless dog, the Peruvian Inca Orchid,
which has never been officialy recognized by a major all-breed kennel club.


Appearance
According to the FCI breed standard, the most important aspect of its appearance is its hairlessnes. The
dog may have short hair on top of its head, on its feet, and on the tip of its tail. In Peru, breeders tend to
prefer completely hairless dogs. The full-coated variety is not recognized as a valid breed variation for
the show ring. The color of skin can be chocolate-brown, elephant grey, copper, or mottled. Albinism is
not allowed. The eye color is linked to the skin color. It's always brown, but dogs with light colors can
have clearer eyes than darker-skinned dogs.

Peruvian Hairless Dogs vary in size:

     ●   Miniature, 25 to 40 cm (10 to 16 inches)
     ●   Medium (or medio), 40 to 50 cm (16 to 20 inches)
     ●   Large (or grande), 50 to 65 cm (20 to 26 inches)

The smallest weighs from 4 kg (9 lb) and the largest up to 25 kg (55 lb). Some kennel clubs consider the
three to be separate breeds.

The dogs should be slim and elegant, with the impression of force and harmony, without being coarse.

The ears should be candleflame shaped and erect with the possibilty to lay flat.

Proportions of height (at withers) to length (withers to base of tail) are 1:1.


Temperament
The dogs are very smart, independent, demanding, quick learners, and are loyal and good with children.
They are friendly with other dogs but can be protective as well. These dogs do not like to be alone, but
when trained, can do well. It is a dog that can be indoors or outdoors. They are agile and fast. Dispite its
assets, the primitive nature of the dog doesn't make it a good dog for beginners. It needs an owner that
understands dog language.

Care
The lack of hair leads to a reputation for being clean, for being easy to wash with a sponge, and for a
natural lack of fleas or other parasites. Despite this, the dog needs as much care as other dogs, but in
another way. The skin should be taken care of frequently. Almost all of this breed tend to have acne or at
least blackheads. The skin often becomes too dry and can be treated with some kind of moisturing cream.

Protection against sunlight may be neccesary, depending on the season and the color of the dog's skin.
The dark-colored dogs get used to direct sunlight and need to be looked after only in spring when
sunlight gets stronger. The light-colored dogs (copper) and spotted ones have to be protected always, in
summer. They tend to quickly sunburn.

Protection against cold is necessary when it gets colder. However, sensitivity to cold may vary from dog
to dog, with smaller dogs more sensitive to cold than the bigger ones.

The ears need special attention. The rims of the ears can dry out and chap easily.

Genetics and health
The genes that cause hairlessness also result in the breed often having fewer teeth than other breeds,
mostly lacking molars and premolars.

One theory is that hairlessness is dominant-lethal, which means that homozygotic hairlesness doesn't
exist. This results in a birthrate of 2:1, hairless : coated. However, some breeders don't show this result,
having a birthrate between 2:1 and 8:1.

AKC-type breed standards are not compatible with the genetics of hairlessness in dogs, but FCI rules
are. Some breeders think that interbreeding with coated (Peruvian) dogs is required to maintain
functional teeth and nervous system health in subsequent generations. They say that breeding of hairless
with hairless (and common but unacknowledged culling of hairy pups from litters to maintain a "pure"
image) leads to short-lived dogs with serious health problems. However, other breeders think the
opposite and are doing well, too.

Other than skin-care issues, there are no known health issues to this breed.
Miscellaneous
It is a persistent myth that the body temperature of hairless dogs is higher than other dogs; they may feel
warmer due to the lack of hair. Letting the dog "hug" you is supposed to help with stomach pain and
other disorders, according to Peruvian folklore. Other myths are the dog is a vegetarian or that it cannot
bark. It is very likely that some of these myths have helped the breed to survive in Peru.

The Petit Basset Griffon Vendéen is a Scent hound that was bred to hunt small game in bramble filled
terrain of the La Vendee district of France.

Appearance
Both sexes should be of similar size, range between 12.5 and 15.5 inches (32 to 40 cm) at the withers
and between 35 and 45 pounds (15 to 20 kilograms).

Like the other 3 Griffon Vendeen breeds: the Grand Griffon Vendeen, Briquet Griffon Vendeen, and the
Grand Basset Griffon Vendeen; they are solid dogs that appear rough and unrefined yet casual. They
have short legs, a sturdy bone structure, and a thick body that is about half as much longer than it is tall
at the withers.

The double coat is both long and rough. The fur on the face resembles a beard and moustache similar to
that of a Scottish Terrier. They have drop ears like many hounds share. The tail is long and tapered to
the end, similar in shape to a saber. The coloring is primarily white with spots of orange, lemon, or
black. They may be bicolor, tricolor, or have grizzling.

Temperament
They are very extroverted, friendly, and independent hounds. PBGVs are not lazy like the Basset Hound
they are much more active and lively. They are good with children and other dogs. They can be rather
vocal.

Like other hounds, they are stubborn and don't respond as well to training as some owners may like.
They tend to do what they want to do unless there is a reward for them.

Health
The PBGV has a strong constitution, and they are a very healthy breed with relatively few genetic
diseases. Some lines are susceptible to Hip dysplasia, Luxating patella, or Heart Murmurs. They are
prone to yeast infections in the ears.

Care
They should have daily walks to burn off excess energy. They need to be brushed regularly, but not
daily, to avoid matting and tangles. They need regular ear cleanings to prevent yeast infections.

The Phalène is the drop-eared version of the Papillon, a toy breed also known as the Butterfly Dog or
the Continental Toy Spaniel (Epagneul Nain Continental).

History
The Phalène is the earliest form of the Butterfly Dog; the appearance of the erect-eared variety was not
documented until the 16th Century, by which time the Phalène had been portrayed in numerous
paintings, particularly in portraits of the wealthy by Old Masters and their students. Belgium, France,
Spain, and Italy have all been credited with the creation or development of Butterfly Dogs; there have
even been theories of its origin in Latin American or Asia. The Papillon gained popularity after the turn
of the nineteenth century.

By the middle of the 20th Century, the Papillon’s popularity had far outstripped that of the Phalène,
which sank low enough into obscurity to become endangered. Fortunately, the breed had its fanciers and
did not slip into extinction. At some point the variety was named phalène, or ‘moth’.
The 21st Century has seen a revival of interest in the Phalène, with its fanciers pointing out that in
countries where it is judged together with the Papillon, judges must be familiar enough with the breed
standard to appreciate the qualities of a well-bred Phalène, and not confuse its dropped ears with those
of a semi-erect eared Papillon, which would suggest a fault in conformation.


Miscellaneous
The Phalène is considered a variant of the Papillon in the AKC, where they are registered as Papillons
and shown and judged in the same classes. The breed standard is the same with the exception of the
dropped ear, which does not sit as low on the head as that of other spaniel types. In nations where clubs
follow the guidelines of the FCI, the Phalène is considered a separate breed.

                           Notes
The Pharaoh Hound is a breed of dog, classed as a member of the sighthound/pariah family. It has a
decent balance between the primitive features and manners of the pariah family and the grace and racy
lines of the sighthounds.

Appearance
Two other breeds that are similar to the Pharaoh Hound and that apparently descended from the same
anscestral lines have developed in other Mediterranean islands. One is the striking Ibizan Hound, which
has a form much like that of the Pharaoh hound, but is colored differently. The Ibizan Hound may be
white, with shades of brown or tawn, whereas the Pharaoh hound is always a solid reddish-ruddy color
with only small amounts of white allowed on its chest, toes, throat, muzzle, and tail tip. The other
similar breed is the Sicilian Greyhound (not the Italian Greyhound), which is essentially a miniature of
the Pharaoh with a wholly different personality.

It stands between 50 and 65cm (22 to 28in.) at the withers and weighs between 18 to 32kg (40 to 70lb).


Temperament
The Pharaoh Hound is a friendly, calm, intelligant, trainable, active breed. It is reserved with strangers,
but affectionate with its family. It has a strong hunting instinct, and caution should be observed when it
is around small pets such as cats, birds, and rodents. It is not a demonstrative breed and is quietly
affectionate. It is a very trainable breed when positive methods are used as it is sensitive and responds
poorly to being physicaly punished.

History
For many years, this breed was considered one of the oldest dog breeds. Recent DNA analysis reveals,
however, that this breed is actually a recent construction, bred to resemble an older form.[1] This DNA
data now puts to rest the "Egytian Myth" and proves the breed did not originate from Egypt. The
Pharaoh was developed into its modern form on the islands of Malta and Gozo. It is often classified as a
sight hound, but hunts both by sight and scent.

The breed was brought to Britain in the 1920s and called the Pharaoh Hound because some thought it
resembled dogs featured on the walls of ancient Egyptian tombs.

Miscellaneous
The Pharaoh Hound is the national dog of Malta, and its Maltese name, Kelb-tal Fenek. A literal
translation is "Dog of the Rabbit", a better translation is perhaps "Rabbit Hound".

The Plott Hound is a large scent hound, specifically a coonhound, originally bred for hunting boar.


History
The Plott brothers brought their dogs with them from Germany to the United States. They bred the dogs
with neighboring dogs until they obtained the dogs they desired. Later, their neighbors referred to the
type of dog as a "Plott," named after the brothers.

                               Notes



The Polish Lowland Sheepdog (Polish: Polski Owczarek Nizinny), also just PON, is a medium sized,
shaggy-coated, sheep dog breed native to Poland.


Appearance
The PON is a stocky, muscular, thick-coated dog. The double coat can be of any color or pattern,
although white, gray, and brown are most common, with black, gray, or brown markings. It is common
for colors to fade as the dogs reach adulthood. The undercoat is soft and dense, while the topcoat is
rough and either straight or wavy, but not curly. The hair around the head makes the head appear to be
larger than it actually is, and typically covers the eyes.

Males are 45 — 50 cm (18 — 20 in) in height at the withers, while females are 42 — 47 cm (17 — 19
in). The body is not square, but rectangular; the ratio of the height to the body length should be 9:10 (a
45 cm tall dog should have a body 50 cm long). The tail is either very short or docked. Some undocked
dogs have tails that curl over the back.

Temperament
PONs are stable and self-confident, but are wary of strangers. They have an excellent memory and can
be well trained, but may dominate a weak-willed owner. PONs adapt well to various conditions, and are
popular as companion dogs for apartment dwellers in their native Poland. PONs require a moderate
amount of exercise daily.

History
Known in its present form in Poland from at least the thirteenth century, the PON is most likely
decended from the Puli and the herding dogs of the Huns.
Kazimierz Grabski, a Polish merchant, traded a shipment of grain for sheep in Scotland in 1514, and
brought six PONs to move the sheep. A Scottish shepherd was so impressed with the herding ability of
the dogs that he traded a ram and two ewes for a dog and two bitches. These dogs were bred with the
local Scottish dogs to produce the Scottish herding dogs, most obviously the Bearded Collie.

Almost driven to extinction in World War II, the PON was restored mainly through the work of Dr.
Danuta Hryeniewicz and her dog, Smok (en:Dragon), the ancestor of all PONs in the world today, who
sired the first ten litters of PONs in the 1950s. The breed standard was written with Smok as the model,
and accepted by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale in 1959.

Health
In general, PONs are a very healthy breed. Animals should be checked for hip dysplasia and progressive
retinal atrophy before being used for breeding. PONs require a low protein diet. Their food intake should
be carefully monitored, as they tend to obesity. The life expectancy of a PON is 12 — 15 years.

unknown outside of its native country of France.

Appearance
The Pont-Audemer Spaniel is a medium-sized dog, weighing 44 to 60 pounds (20-27 kg), and standing
around 20 to 23 inches (52-58 cm).

The coat is long and wavy, but smooth about the face. The color is liver or brown, or a mixture of liver
or brown and white. Ticking is quite common.

Temperament
Though hardy, as well as hard-working, the breed has the typical spaniel traits of being easy to train,
gentle, and affectionate. The dogs are known to have a fun-loving quality and in France are said to be le
petit clown des marais (the little clown of the marshes).

Working dogs
Pont-Audemer Spaniels are usually found in a working gundog environment, and are rarely kept as mere
family pets. The dogs specialize as water dogs, but like their relative, the Brittany Spaniel, can also work
as pointers and flushers.

History
The breed is alleged to have been developed in the Pont-Audemer region of France in the nineteenth
century. It is believed that the Barbet and/or Poodle may have gone into the Pont-Audemer's makeup as
well as old spaniel breeds such as the Picardy Spaniel. The breed's numbers were never large, and so few
examples existed after World War II that it became necessary to cross-breed dogs with Irish Water
Spaniels. The population of these unique spaniels is still small, and the breed is in danger of extinction.

                          Notes
The Portuguese Podengo is the name given to three types of dog from Portugal with a related ancestry.
They represent a small (Pequeno), medium (Medio) and large (Grande) type of dog, each with two hair
coats (smooth and wirehaired).

The rarest of all, the Grande, was most likely developed from larger Medios and the Pequeno was most
likely developed, with the addition of other small breeds, also from the Medio. Of the three, the Pequeno
displays more color variety because of this probable outcrossing.

Each has a different type of temperament but all three love to hunt, as is their heritage and tradition in
their native country. Typically, the dogs hunt in a pack with their human companion following them.
Each is capable of hunting game that is appropriate to their size. (Pequeno-rats, Medio-rabbits, Grande-
boars).

They are very old type of dog, probably descended from ancient northern African sighthound-type dogs.
As a breed, it is believed to be about 5,000 years old. They are all typically healthy, due to careful
breeding practices in a rustic setting (in Portugal) where unhealthy whelps would not usually survive,
thus removing them from possible breeding stock.

The WH PPM is a medium-sized, friendly, hardy and intelligent companion. It has a soft wire coat that
functions as an air conditioner in the hot weather. The single coat (without undercoat) does shed. It is
very active and is good with children and other animals, including livestock, if it is socialized from an
early age.

The WH PPM (and S PPM) has existed in America for decades in small numbers with Portuguese-
Americans in private home settings where they have been used for traditional rabbit hunting.
Amazingly, they were never popularized outside of their immigrant homesteads. If dog-loving
Americans had seen them there is no doubt that this breed would have become known sooner, as they
are attractive, nice family dogs, with a touch of mischief.

They are watchful and observant and will bark when something gets their attention. They enjoy digging
and need a secure fence. It is best if they have their own yard they can 'customize' themselves. When
trained, they can have a good recall when not on leash. They are a very enthusiastic, trainable dog with a
knowledgable trainer, as evidenced by their popularity in movies, where they are usually cast as a
"scruffy mutt." This publicity has enabled the WH PPM to obtain a small but loyal fan base in America,
who have turned into the first exhibitors (and will be the first breeders) of the breed.

The WH PPM have only recently been shown and developed as a registered (RVB-Netherlands, CPC-
Portugal and AKC-Foundation Stock Service), pedigreed breed in the US and Canada.
The WH PPM is very young as a breed in America. There are about 11 breeders worldwide with
registered, pedigreed stock. The available bloodlines of WH PPMs are extremely limited compared to
other breeds of dogs (the coat types are not interbred) and all WH PPM are very closely related at this
time. However, with careful breeding of only the best and healthiest dogs, larger bloodlines can be built
confidently and strongly. Other examples of this situation are the Saluki and Basenji, both breeds which,
within the past 100 years, descended from a tiny handful of registered dogs. With careful breeding of the
best quality dogs, it is now a healthy, strong sighthound breed with much diversity.

                              Notes



Portuguese Water Dogs are a breed of dog, bred by the Portuguese to be companions at sea. They are
similar in size to a Wheaten Terrier and are usually black but can also brown.


Appearance
The hair is either worn in a "retriever cut" or a "lion cut." In the lion cut, the hindquarters, muzzle, and
the base of the tail are shaved and the rest of the body is left full length. This cut originated with the
fishing dogs of Portugal to keep the body warm while allowing movement of the back legs. The end of
the tail is kept long, because in those days, the fishermen sometimes didn't know how to swim, and the
dog could pull them to safety with its tail. The retriever cut is left 1" (2.5 cm) long evenly over the body
(although some owners prefer the muzzle or the base of the tail shorter). This cut is a more recent style
and originated because breeders wanted to make the breed more appealing and less unusual looking for
buyers.

Most dogs, especially traditional show dogs, are entirely black or a dark brown; however, it is common
to see white chests and legs on black and brown coats. "Parti" coats, with white fur and black spots, are
rare but visually striking. The hair is either wavy or curly and is like human hair (and Poodle hair) in that
it keeps growing. The hair must be trimmed about every two months and, although it is possible to
groom at home, it is usually easier to pay a professional groomer. White hair is finer than black, and
parti coat dogs will require more frequent brushing and grooming to avoid matting.

Coat Types

Portuguese water dogs have two coat types, wavy and curly. From the Portuguese Water Dog Club of
America Revised Standard for the Portuguese Water Dog:

     ●   Curly coat: "compact, cylindrical curls, somewhat lusterless. The hair on the ears is sometimes
         wavy".
     ●   Wavy coat: "Falling gently in waves, not curls, and with a slight sheen".

Occasionally, a dog may have what is termed an "improper" coat. This is a cosmetic variation that
relates to what is believed to be a recessive gene. It causes the dog to have an undercoat (unlike curly-
and wavy-coated PWDs), a flatter coat overall, and may have curling on the hocks, and generally
appears more Spaniel- or Border Collie-like. Because these dogs do not adhere to the breed standard,
they may not be shown in competition, but otherwise are completely healthy and have all the excellent
traits of PWDs. Some reports indicate that these coats shed more and are not hypoallergenic, although
more study is needed. For more information on improper coats, see:

     ●   PWDCA's Allergy, Hairloss, Dermatology
     ●   PWD Grooming

The dogs also have an interesting bluish tinge to their skin that is hard to notice underneath their black
fur. Their paws are slightly webbed, which one can see by trying to pass one's finger between the dog's
toes.

Temperament
Portuguese Water dogs make excellent companions. They are loving and sweet. Also, they are very
intelligent. Since they are working dogs, they are perfectly content in being at their master's side at all
times. Owners of this breed will attest that their Portie follows them constantly. This is typical of the
breed, as it strives for attention and prefers to be engaged in activity.




                                      Portuguese Water Dog of the Curly Coat Type
History
Originating back to the 1500s in Portugal, Portuguese Water Dogs (Porties) were originally used by
fishermen. They were used to send messages between boats, to retrieve fish and articles from the water,
and to guard the fishing boats. (They often received a portion of the catch after a job well done, too!)
They helped to bring in nets and to save fishermen when they fell in the water. They were very popular,
and this might be where they picked up their loyal and dependable characteristics. Eventually
commercial fishing equipment made the dogs unnecessary. They fell out of favor and almost became
extinct. At one point, there were only 25 Portuguese Water Dogs in the world. Since then, breeders have
been carefully bringing back the breed. There are now thousands of Porties throughout the world.

Miscellaneous
The Portie is a fairly rare breed; only 15 entrants for Portuguese Water Dogs were made to England's
Crufts competition in 2002, although their personality and nonshedding qualities have made them more
popular in recent years.

When there is nothing else to do, Porties like to chew. Heavy-duty chew toys can help keep a Portie
occupied.




                                    Portuguese Water Dog Puppy of the Wavy Coat Type

Portuguese Water Dogs have a multi-octave voice. Although they are not prone to barking excessively,
they usually have a wide range of barks, chortles, grumbles and sighs. Porties also have an audible
"laugh," a loud, irregular, breathy pant used at play or during greetings.

A Pudelpointer is a versatile hunting dog breed from Germany. They are a pointing breed that came
from a cross between poodles and the English Pointer.


Appearance
The breed weighs between 44 and 66 pounds (20-30 kg), stands 21 to 26 inches (53-66 cm) at the
shoulder, and comes in liver, chestnut, and occasionally black coats. The ideal coat is harsh, wiry, and
dense.

History
In 1881, a German breeder, Baron von Zedlitz, worked on producing his ideal tracking, pointing, and
retrieving gun dog, suitable for work on both land and water. From seven specific Poodles and nearly
100 different Pointers, he developed the Pudelpointer. The original sire was Tell, an English Pointer
belonging to Kaiser Frederick III and the original dam was a German hunting Pudel named Molly who
was owned by Hegewald, an author known for works on hunting dogs.

The goal was to produce a dog that was willing and easy to train, intelligent, and loved water and
retrieving, like the Pudel, and add to that a great desire to hunt, a strong pointing instinct, and an
excellent nose, like in the English Pointer.

The Pudel breed had much stronger genes, and so many more Pointers were used to achieve the
balanced hunting dog that was desired. A mix of 11 Pudels and 80 Pointers was used during the first 30
years.

The breed was introduced to North America in 1956 by Bodo Winterhelt, who still today remains very
involved in maintaining the breed standard. His Winterhelle Kennel was the foundation of the breed in
North America. In 1977 Winterhelt founded the Pudelpointer Club of North America in Canada.

Although it is an excellent breed with no major faults, it has never become a popular or well-known
breed. In Germany, its performance standards are its most important traits and each dog must pass a test
of its field skills to be registered as a Pudelpointer.

The Pumi is a medium-small terrier-type breed of dog. It
is a sheep dog from Hungary. The plural of Pumi is
Pumik.

Appearance
Most Pumi are gray, and almost any shade of gray is
accepted in the show ring. Gray Pumi are born black but
puppies usually start graying at the age of 6 to 8 weeks,
and the shade gradually lightens. The final shade can be
predicted by the color of the parents. Other accepted
colors are black, white, and maszkos fakó, which is
yellow-brown with a darker mask. This color is known as
sable with mask in other breeds, such as the Tervueren.                   Alternative names

Other colors are possible, but not accepted for show dogs.                 Country of origin

The Pumi trademark is its ears, which are always alert         beeds working towards full recognition
and very lively. Ears are high-set and the tip bends down. Ears are covered with longer hair than the rest
of the body.

The Pumi is a light-bodied, square dog that looks slightly larger than it is because of the thick coat. The
Pumi has a long, narrow head. The muzzle is 45% of the length of the head, which is of equal length to
the neck. The stop is barely noticeable, and the skull is flat when seen from the side. The eyes are small,
dark, and slightly oblique. Movements are lively and energetic, as is the Pumi itself.

Male Pumi stand 41 to 47 cm at the withers and weigh 10 to 15 kg; bitches are 38 to 44cm and weigh 8
to 13 kg.

Temperament




The Pumi can be very protective of its own family, and often slightly reserved toward strangers, so
socialization must begin early. The Pumi is a lively and active breed. It is intelligent but barks easily.
Pumi are moderately easy to train, as it is easy to motivate using toys or food.

Health
Pumik are a healthy breed with a life expectancy of 10 to 12 years, but Pumik have been known to live
up to 17 years. Known medical problems are patella luxation and canine hip dysplasia.

The most extensive health records of the breed can be found from Finland and Sweden, and around 80%
of the Pumik born there have healthy hips.

Activities
The Pumi was originally used as a herding dog, but now, most of them are used for other purposes such
as dog agility, dog dancing, and obedience, but also can be trained for detection, search and rescue, and
other purposes. Pumi have been used also for hunting wild boar.

History
The Pumi has been used as a "general farm dog", shepherding not only sheep but also cows and pigs,
and also for catching small rodents. It originated in the 17th or 18th century, when shepherding terriers
were brought to Hungary from Germany and France. These terrier-type dogs mixed with the Puli-type
dogs that were in Hungary, and the result was a terrier-type herding dog. As a working dog, it was quite
freely bred until the 1970s, and other Hungarian dogs such as the Puli and Mudi were used for breeding.
Until recently there has been a special B-registry for work bred Pumi. The parentage of these dogs are
unknown, but if they meet the breed standard, they can be given a "B-pedigree".

Pumi received FCI recognition in 1966. The breed was quite unknown outside Hungary until the 1970s.
In 1973, the first Pumik were exported to Finland, and in 1985 to Sweden. Later, Pumik were exported
also to Germany, Netherlands, Italy, and in the 1990s to the USA.

Miscellaneous
The Pumi is relatively unknown outside Hungary, but in Sweden and Finland around 100 Pumik are
registered every year. In both countries, the Pumi is a very popular agility dog, and pumik are seen
almost every year in the Championship competition. In Scandinavia, the Pumi is used for obedience and
dog dancing competitions.

In 2004 Pumi was accepted to the American Kennel Club Foundation Stock Service program, and the
Hungarian Pumi Club of America was founded.

                             Notes



The Pyrenean Mountain Dog, also commonly known as the Great Pyrenees, is a large, loyal breed of
dog that was used traditionally for protecting livestock (especially sheep) in the pastures. It is a very old
breed, and has been used for thousands of years by the Basques of the Pyrenees Mountains in southern
France; more recently, it was the official dog of the royal French court. Males are usually about 100
pounds while females are only 85 pounds. They are typically white but can have some markings in gray,
tan, or badger.

Temperament
Loyal and protective of its territory, it makes a great family dog. This dog is not for everyone, as its
white coat sheds frequently and spreads huge amounts of fur throughout the house, and its deep booming
bark can annoy neighbors if left outside continuously. Furthermore, this is not simply an overgrown
Golden Retriever, and interested owners should familiarize themselves with the tempermant and
characteristics of the flock guardian breeds before considering this dog. Best suited for folks with a large
yard, it enjoys walks and attention, and loves children. Obedience training and socialization at a young
age is a must, as this breed grows large and strong and is best suited for someone capable of handling a
large dog. In the field it is an excellent guardian, large enough to be a deterrent to smaller pests (like
fox) and a match for animals as big as bears.

The Pyrenean Shepherd is a medium-small breed of dog that was bred originally in the 1700s for
herding. It often worked as an active herder together with the Great Pyrenees, who acted as the flock's
guardian.




                            Rough-faced variety having fun

Appearance
The smallest of the French herding dogs, the Pyrenean is no more than 22 inches (56 cm) at the withers,
with males between 15 1/2 to 22 inches (39-56 cm), and females between 15 1/2 to 20 inches (39-51
cm). The weight is between 18-32 lbs (8-14.5 kg), aiming for muscular, never fat.

The head is of small proportions in comparison to the dog, with a rather flat skull, and a somewhat short,
pointed muzzle. The face is expressive and intelligent, with dark eyes, except in the case of the harlequin
or slate gray colours. In France, the general choice for the dog's ears is cropped, otherwise, the Pyrenean
Shepherd should have drop ears. Naturally prick ears are not of the breed, and may indicate an outcross.

The body is long and lean, and should reflect the natural energetic athleticism of the dog. The legs are
well proportioned, with lean, well-bent hocks typical of a sure-footed mountain breed. The tail can be
cropped short, naturally short, or naturally long, so long as its carried below the backline at rest and in
motion.
                            Rough-faced face detail

Coat

The coat has two basic varieties, smooth-faced (or smooth-haired) and rough-faced (or long-haired). The
smooth-faced variety has short, fine hairs on the muzzle, with a modest ruff around the face and neck,
and some feathering along the legs, tail, and belly. In contrast, the rough-faced has some long hairs
around the muzzle and face, though never enough to cover or obscure the eyes or create a bearded effect,
and semilong or long, coarse hair over the rest of the body.

Colour

Shades of fawn are most typical for the breed, either with or without black shadowing, with shades of
grey, harlequins in various shades, and the much-rarer black. All colours allow for some white at the
head, chest and feet, but clean colours are preferred.

Temperament
The Pyrenean Shepherd was designed to be a sheepdog, and as such is full of the same sort of energy
that other herding dogs have, but in a surprisingly small package. This adaptive dog wants to, and can,
do all the jobs on the field, and is a natural herder. A dog that needs a job, its cleverness makes it ideal
for other work and dog sports such as flyball, competitive obedience and agility.

Pyreneans are "one-man" dogs, attached and dedicated to their owners, with a desire to follow them
around the house to help with daily chores. They sense every mood and often seem to be able to read
their masters' minds, as they are constantly watchful. Because of this, they are extremely trainable.

Their natural wariness, while valuable in a herding dog that may need to alert their shepherd of strange
animals or people, combined with their herding bossiness, can lead to shyness or aggression in even the
most friendly puppy if not properly managed. Frequent socialization from a very young age can help
counter this trait.
Care
In spite of the shaggy coat, even the rough-faced Pyrenean needs only a weekly brush, as well as regular
checks for burrs or knots, to keep its coat in show condition. The coat texture is resistant to tangling, and
is quite manageable compared to more showy long-haired dogs.

History
After the first World War, the Pyrenean gained national recognition in France for their valiant work as
couriers, search and rescue dogs, watch dogs, and company mascots.

The smooth-faced Pyrenean Shepherd in its harlequin or blue merle colouration may have been one of
the foundation breeds for the Australian Shepherd in the late 19th and early 20th century.

It is not yet a well-known breed outside of its native France, but its size, intelligence, and attractive coat
make it appealing. After one of its breed won the World Agility Championship for midsized dogs in
2003, it gained more attention as an intelligent performance dog for dog sports.

                            Notes



The Rafeiro do Alentejo, known also as Portuguese Sheepdog or Portuguese Mastiff, is a breed of
dog.


Appearance
The Rafeiro is a large dog, with males weighing around 110 pounds (50 kg) and females, 90 pounds (41
kg).

The following is the summary taken from standard of the Continental Kennel Club:

Description: Head: Bear like, short muzzle. Eyes: Dark. Ears: Hanging. tapered. Nose: Black and self-
colored according to coat. Bite: Scissor or level. Neck: Short. Top-line: Level. Chest: Thick. Body:
Rectangular, well muscled, strong bone. Legs: Forelegs are long, strong, muscular. Hind legs are strong,
hocks are moderately bent. Feet: Oval. Tail: Long, curved at end. Movement: Swift and very agile, with
flowing gait. Temperament: High-spirited, yet very lovable.

Temperament
They are not the dogs for beginners. They mature slowly, are very independent, and often do not
respond to traditional concepts of dog obedience. On the other hand, they are extremely territorial and
will protect the sheep, households, and families they feel were placed under their protection. Rafeiro do
Alentejo are guard dogs without herding qualities. They are not aggressive but protective; they get along
quite well with children.

History
The dogs are descendents of Tibetan Mastiffs, believed to be the oldest breed of dogs. They are closely
related to Anatolian Mastiffs, known also as Anatolian Shepherd Dogs. Rafeiro do Alentejo have been
used, for centuaries, to move sheep, during winter, from mountains in northern Portugal to the plateau of
Alentejo and back to the mountain. Gradually they adjusted to living in Alentejo province. The breed
was threatened with extinction but survived largely due to an organized effort by a few dedicated people.

At present there are very few registered and recognized breeders but the number of dogs is steadily
increasing. The breed is recognized by the Continental Kennel Club and, recently, the Rafeiro do
Alentejo were admitted to the Foundation Stock Service of the American Kennel Club.

Future of the breed
The pure Rajapalayam is more or less extinct, and only a few are to be found in isolated pockets around
southern Tamil Nadu. The breed may vanish all together if something is not done soon to revive it.

The Rat Terrier is an American dog breed, one of many terrier varieties. It is a small, active terrier.
Although the breed has been around in similar form since the early 1900s, it has remained more of a
type than a breed.


Appearance
The Rat Terrier comes in a variety of coat colors and patterns. It is often white with either black and tan,
apricot, blue, or brown spots. The original snazzy most common color is the tricolor: black, tan, and
white. Many have ticking on the white part of the coat; most have freckles on their bellies. Ear carriage
can be upright, tipped, or button, and the tail is traditionally docked to about 1/3 of its original length.

The Rat Terrier ranges from about 5 to 40 pounds, although the larger sizes are sometimes called
Deckers or Giant Deckers, after a breeder named Milton Decker who has been developing a larger
version of the Rat Terrier. The Toy size (10 pounds and under) is becoming increasingly popular as a
house pet & companion dog. Despite their diminutive size, many Toy Rat Terriers display the same prey
drive & hunting instincts as their larger cousins.

Temperament
Although often mistaken for a Jack Russell Terrier, the Rat Terrier has a very different temperament. It
is less aggressive and comparatively calm (although still exhibiting terrier personality). They are
normally cheerful dogs, but there are occasional dogs who are extremely sensitive to changes in their
environment or to unexpected noises, people, or activity.

History
The Rat Terrier type originated in England; like all terriers of this type, it most likely developed from
crosses among Manchester Terriers, Smooth Fox Terriers, and Whippets. After the 1890s, as the breed
type became popular in America, other breeds were added to the mix. Beagles and Italian Greyhounds
may have been used.

Breed recognition
Rat Terrier organizations rank among those in the dog world among which there is dispute over the best
course of action to be taken for the promotion and preservation of the dog breed. Points of departure are,
as usual, which dog type best represents the breed, and, as is common among working breeds, whether
the dog's working qualities will be sacrificed to show conformation. Perhaps because the Rat Terrier has
existed for decades with several different evident types being upheld by different clubs, disagreements
can be highly charged.

The Rat Terrier has been recognized by the United Kennel Club. The Rat Terrier Club of America is
actively working towards recognition by the AKC and the breed was accepted into the AKC's
Foundation Stock Service in 2005.

The Red Setter is a variant of the Irish Setter or Irish Red Setter. The Red Setter is a pointing breed of
dog used to hunt upland game. Considerable acrimony exists between the partisans involved in the
debate over this breed.

History
The Irish Setter was brought to the United States in the early 1800s. It commanded great respect in the
field and was one of the most commonly used dog among the professional meat hunter fraternity.

In 1874, the American Field put together the Field Dog Stud Book and registry of dogs in the United
States was born. At that time, dogs could be registered even when bred from sires and dams of different
breeds. At about this time, the Llewellin Setter was bred using blood lines from the Lavarack breeding
of English Setter and, among other breeds, bloodlines from native Irish Setters. Around the same time,
the red Irish Setter became a favorite in the dog show ring.

The Irish Setter of the late 1800s was not just a red dog. The AKC registered Irish Setters in a myriad of
colors. Frank Forester, a 19th-century sports writer, described the Irish Setter as follows: "The points of
the Irish Setter are more bony, angular, and wiry frame, a longer head, a less silky and straigher coat that
those of the English. His color ought to be a deep orange-red and white, a common mark is a stripe of
white between the eyes and a white ring around the neck, white stockings, and a white tage to the tail."

The Setter that was completely red, however, was preferred in the show ring and that is the direction that
the breed took. Between 1874 and 1948, the breed produced 760 conformation champions, but only five
field champions.

In the 1940s, Field and Stream magazine put into writing what was already a well-known fact. The Irish
Setter was disappearing from the field and an outcross would be necessary to resurrect the breed as a
working dog. Sports Afield chimed in with a similar call for an outcross. Ned LaGrange of Pennsylvania
spent a small fortune purchasing examples of the last of the working Irish Setters in America and
importing dogs from overseas. With the blessing of the Field Dog Stud Book, he began an outcross to
red and white field champion English Setters. The National Red Setter Field Trial Club was created to
test the dogs and to encourage breeding toward a dog that would successfully compete with the white
setters. Thus the modern Red Setter was born and the controversy begun.

The American Kennel Club refused to recognize the dogs registered by the Field Dog Stud Book in an
unprecedented change. Until this time registration in one body automatically qualified a dog for
registration in the other. To this day, the policy of reciprocal registration between the AKC and the
FDSB remains with all breeds except the Irish Red Setter.
Appearance
The modern Red Setter is smaller than his bench-bred cousin. While show dogs often reach 70 lbs, the
working Red Setter is generally around 45 lbs. The coat is less silky and the feathering is generally
shorter. The color is lighter, with the working dog found in russet and fawn colors. The Red Setter often
has patches of white on his face and chest as the Irish Setter of old did.

Temperament
The Red Setter is a happy, biddable dog. He is readily trainable and reportedly learns quickly. Most Red
Setters do not retrieve as readily as many of the versatile breeds do but can be taught to retrieve to hand.
The Red Setter makes a loving house companion and is reportedly good with children.

The Redbone Coonhound is a breed of dog bred to hunt raccoon. They are also widely used for hunting
bear and cougar. Their agility allows them to be hunted from swamplands to mountains. The Redbone
Coonhound is the only solid colored coonhound. Like the standard says: "The Redbone mingles
handsome looks and an even temperament with a confident air and fine hunting talents."[1]
Appearance
The Redbone Coonhound has the lean, muscular, well proportioned build typical to the coonhounds,
with long straight legs, a deep chest, and a head and tail held high and proud when hunting or showing.
The face has a pleading expression, with sorrowful dark brown eyes and long, drooping ears. The coat is
short and smooth against the body, but coarse enough to provide protection to the skin while hunting
through brush. The nose is always black and the coat color is always a rich red, though a small amount
of white on the chest between the legs or on the feet is permissible, though not preferred.

Males should be 22-27 inches (56-68.5 cm)at the shoulder, with bitches slightly shorter at 21-26 inches
(53-66 cm). Weight should be proportional to the size and bone structure of the individual dogs, with a
preference towards leaner working dogs rather than heavier dogs. Generally, weights will range from 45
to 70 lbs (20.5 to 31.75 kg). Males are typically larger and heavier boned than females and carry a
deeper bay.

History
The Redbone Coonhound is an American breed. It was developed in Georgia in the 1800s from
Foxhounds and Bloodhounds. Breeders followed a selective program that led to a coonhound that was
faster and had a more developed sense of smell than other coonhounds. They were ideal for pack
hunting of both small and larger prey. Originally, the Redbone had a black saddleback, but by the
beginning of the 1900s, they were a pure red tone.

Sadly, like many American hunting dogs, especially those from the South, they were widely known and
loved by hunters and farmers, but totally unknown in the dog show ring. Recently, this has changed, and
the Redbone has found recognition by the two major American kennel clubs.

Perhaps the best known fictional Redbones were Old Dan and Little Ann, featured in the children's
classic story, Where the Red Fern Grows.

Temperament
The Redbone Coonhound is an excellent companion and family pet, with some special considerations.
They love to be with their owners and family, and are happy just doing things with their humans, or
sitting by watching them. They are very affectionate, but can be overwhelming to small children or even
adults if not properly trained. They tend to be inactive if kept indoors most of the time and can easily
become overweight.

Conversely, young coonhounds are energetic and need lots of activity, or they will become destructive.
This can lead to acting out in the form of chewing and baying. They take a longer time to train than
some other breeds, because they mature more slowly both physically and mentally.

Some Redbones drool a significant amount, and others have a very doggy smell. They are all loud, loud
barkers.

Like many hunting dogs, they have an independent intelligence especially well suited for problem
solving. This can be an issue if the problem they want to solve is their backyard fence or the dog-proof
garbage. But they also are pretty unflappable, able to take anything that comes at them.

As with all hounds, this breed should be watched closely off leash since they have a tendency to roam
and a reputation for chasing small creatures such as cats.

Health
The Redbone Coonhound is a hardy breed that has few known diseases. The most common are hip
dysplasia and obesity. The average lifespan of a Red is 10-15 years.

                            Notes



The Rhodesian Ridgeback is a breed of dog from Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe and Zambia) in Southern
Africa. Also known as the "(African) Lion dog" because of their unique ability to taunt a lion and keep it
at bay while awaiting their master to make the kill. They rarely bark while hunting.

Appearance




                                 Examples of Ridges.

The Ridgeback's general appearance is of a handsome, strong, muscular and active dog, symmetrical in
outline, capable of great endurance with a fair (good) amount of speed. The mature dog is handsome and
upstanding. The Ridgeback's distinguishing feature is the ridge of hair along its back running in the
opposite direction to the rest of its coat. The ridge must be regarded as the escutcheon of the breed. It
consists of a fan-like area formed by two whorls of hair (called "crowns") and tapers from immediately
behind the shoulders, down to the level of the hips. The ridge is derived from the ridged hunting dog of
the Khoikhoi (literally, "men of men"; native South African people, referred to by the Europeans as
Hottentots).

Some Ridgebacks are born without ridges, and until recently, most ridgeless puppies were culled, or
euthanized, at birth. Today, many breeders opt instead to spay and neuter these offspring to ensure they
will not be bred.

Male Ridgebacks should be 25-27 inches (63-69 cm) at the withers and weigh approximately 85 lb (36.5
kg FCI Standard), females 24-26 inches (61-66 cm) and approximately 70 lb (32 kg). They are typically
muscular and have a light wheaten to red wheaten coat which should be short and dense, sleek and
glossy in appearance but neither woolly nor silky. The presence of black guard hairs or ticking is not
addressed in the AKC standard, although the elaboration of the AKC standard [1] notes the amount of
black or dark brown in the coat should not be excessive. White is acceptable on the chest and toes.
Ridgebacks have a strong, smooth tail, which is usually carried in a gentle curve upwards. The eyes
should be round and should reflect the coat color—dark in a black muzzle, amber with a brown nose.
The brown nose is a recessive gene and is therefore not as common as a black nose.

The original standard allowed for a variety of coat colors, including brindle and sable. Today, all shades
of wheaten are permitted. While the deeper red are often favored by pet owners, the lighter wheaten is
just as correct. Color variants such as brindles, black-and-tans and blue dilutes appear occasionally but
not commonly.

Temperament
They are loyal, intelligent, and gentle, making them good family pets despite their size. They were
traditionally hunters, guardians, and companions.

History
The breed's long history dates back to early in the 18th century when the first European settlers found
with the Khoisan tribes a domesticated dog with the hair on his spine being turned forward. To fill their
specific needs for a serviceable hunting dog in the wilds, these settlers developed, by selective breeding
between dogs which they had brought with them from home countries and the half-wild ridged dog of
the Hottentot tribes, a distinct breed of the African veldt, which has come to be known as the Rhodesian
Ridgeback.

The Breed Standard is based on that of the Dalmation & was first registered in South Africa in 1924.
The breed was first admitted into the American Kennel Club in 1955 as a member of the Hound Group.

As hunters, Ridgebacks kept a lion at bay while the hunters came to kill it. The dogs worked in groups to
keep the lion occupied until the hunter arrived; the dogs themselves did not actually kill lions.

Health
Health conditions known to affect this breed are cataracts, cancer, and hip dysplasia. Average lifespan is
from 9-11 years but they have been know to live to nearly 16 years but this is very rare.

Dermoid sinus is a congenital condition that is known to affect this breed.


Miscellaneous
There is some debate whether the Rhodesian Ridgeback is a sighthound or scent hound. In general,
Ridgebacks pursue prey by sight, but after the prey is no longer in sight, Ridgebacks continue tracking
with scent. More credibility is given to the sight argument largely because the Ridgeback seldom barks,
a technique scent hounds more often use to allow both hunters and hounds to follow.

                              Notes
A Rottweiler is a medium large, robust and powerful dog breed originating from Germany.


Appearance
The breed is black with clearly defined tan markings on the cheeks, muzzle, chest, legs, and eyebrows.
The markings on the chest should form two distinct upside-down triangles; a tiny patch of white in
between is acceptable. The cheeks should have clearly defined spots that should be separate from the
muzzle tan. The muzzle tan should continue over the throat. Each eyebrow should have a spot. Markings
on the legs should not be above a third of the leg. On each toe should be a black 'pencil' mark.
Underneath the tail should also be tan.

Nails are black. Inside the mouth, the cheeks may have black patches, although the tongue is pink. The
skull is typically massive, but without excessive jowls. The forehead is wrinkly when the Rottweiler is
alert.

A Rottweilers's eyes are a warm, dark brown—any other color may not be acceptable as part of the
"pure breed". The expression should be calm, intelligent, alert, and fearless. The ears are small drop ears
that lie flat to the head. 'Flying' ears are considered undesirable by some breeders. The coat is medium
length and consists of a waterproof undercoat and a coarse top coat. It is low maintenance, although
experiences shedding during certain periods of the year.




                                              Full-tailed Rottweiler

Rottweilers are not naturally without tails. Tails were originally removed to prevent breakage and
infection that would occur when the tail became covered in mud and other debris collected from pastures
and livestock. Today, many owners decide to have the tails removed soon after the puppies' birth for
purely cosmetic reasons. The tail is usually docked to the first joint. Although this is a commonly
accepted practice, many people and organizations believe it to be cruel and unnecessary; it must be
noted that there is debate about the degree of suffering experienced by a characteristically pain-tolerant
breed at such an early age.
The chest is deep and should reach the Rottie's elbows, giving tremendous lung capacity. The back
should be straight; never sloping. The Rottweiler stands 25 to 27 inches (63-68 cm) at the withers for
males, and 23 to 25 inches (58-63 cm) for females. Weight is usually between 90 and 110 lb (41-50 kg)
but can be even higher.

Temperament
A well-trained and socialized Rottweiler can provide the right owner with a great deal of exercise and
loving companionship. They are usually quick to learn and have a strong desire to please their owners.
They are intelligent, to the point that they shouldn't be left to their own devices, and are happiest when
mentally stimulated. Despite this, they can also be strong willed at times, and should be taught in a firm,
consistent manner. This is generally a calm breed. That said, they are playful animals, usually very
excited at the first sign of fun. Rottweilers thrive on attention from their owners and need their people to
be happy. If a Rottie has been neglected excessively, he will usually strive, creatively, to get the owner's
attention.

The Rottie is not usually a barker: he is a silent watcher who notices everything. In the event the dog
feels threatened, he tends to go very still before attacking, and there is no warning growl. This is one of
the breed's characteristics that lends itself to the reputation of being unreliable. An observant owner,
however, is usually able to recognize when the Rottie perceives a threat. When the dog barks, it is more
of a sign of annoyance with external factors (car alarms or other disturbances) rather than threats.

The Rottweiler can resort to aggressiveness in unfamiliar situations. For the most part, this is not of
grave concern to most dog owners. However, the Rottie's large size and incredible strength make this an
important point to consider. For this reason, early socialization with as many people, animals, and
situations as possible is very important in order to produce a dog that is tolerant of strangers.

The Rottweiler is not a breed for the inexperienced dog owner. A Rottie owner should be willing to
provide extensive socialization from puppyhood and onward, and should already have prior experience
teaching dogs to be obedient.

History
The breed is an ancient one, and its history stretches back to the Roman Empire. In those times, the
legions travelled with their meat on the hoof and required the assistance of working dogs to herd the
cattle. One route the army travelled was through Württemberg and on to the small market town of
Rottweil.

This region eventually became an important cattle area, and the descendants of the Roman cattle dogs
proved their worth in both droving and protecting the cattlemen from robbers and wild animals. It would
be a brave villain who would try and remove the purse around the neck of a Rottweiler Metzgershund
(Butcher's Dog of Rottweil).

However, by the end of the 19th Century, the breed had declined so much that in 1900 there was only
one female to be found in the town of Rottweil. But the build up to the World War I saw a great demand
for "police dogs," and that led to a revival in interest for the Rottweiler. Its enormous strength, its
intelligence, and its ability to take orders made it a natural weapon of war.

From that time, it has become popular with dog owners, and in 1935 the breed was officially recognized
by the American Kennel Club. In 1936, Rottweilers were exhibited in Britain at Crufts. In 1966, a
separate register was opened for the breed.

Dog attacks

In recent years, the breed has received a lot of bad press. This is primarily due to a lack of understanding
of the breed and canine nature on the part of the owner, and indiscriminate breeding on the part of the
breeder. Unscrupulous breeders have produced dogs with highly aggressive tendencies and some owners
have used the dogs to boost their macho images. Other owners may acquire a Rottie for a family pet, but
neglect to properly socialize and train the animal, resulting in a dangerous, unpredictable dog who
makes the rules.
Despite the media's fascination with Rottweilers who run afoul of canine behavioural standards, people
who have experience with properly raised individuals can attest to the Rottweiler's friendliness and often
clownish nature. In fact, the FCI standard calls for a dog that is fond of children. Nevertheless, this breed
is not for the inexperienced or uninvolved dog owner, or anyone who lacks the physical strength to
handle the Rottweiler.

As a result of bad press, some German Länder put the Rottweiler on an index of so called "dangerous
dogs". This includes Bavaria, Brandenburg and North Rhine-Westphalia. Visitors and residents must
obey the local muzzling and leash-length laws.

The 'Saarlooswolfhond' (Dutch Saarloos Wolfdog) is a breed of large dogs with relatively wolflike
appearance and behavior, such as strong pack instincts.

History
In 1921, Dutch breeder Leendert Saarloos started crossbreeding a German Shepherd Dog male to a
female European Wolf. He aimed for an improved version of the German shepherd, and succeeded so
far that the Saarlooswolfdog we know is a strong, imposant dog, but they retained their wolflike
characteristics; they are cautious, reserved and lack the ferocity to attack; it is not the dog Leendert
Saarloos hoped it to be. Till his death in 1969 Leendert Saarloos was in full control over the breeding of
"his" European wolfdog. It was not until 1975 that the Dutch Kennel Club recognized the breed. To
honor it's creator they changed the name to "Saarlooswolfdog". (in 1981 the breed was FCI
acknowledged). In the past some Saarlooswolfdogs were trained as guide dogs for the blind and rescue
dogs.

                            Notes



The Saluki is breed of dog that is a member of the sighthound family, that is, hounds that hunt by sight
rather than scent. The Saluki is one of the oldest dog breeds known, and originally came from the
Middle East, where it was used (and is still used to some extent) by the Bedouins for hunting hare and
gazelle.

Temperament
Modern Salukis retain the qualities of hunting hounds. They may appear reserved and uninterested. They
learn quickly but can get bored with repetition, so training sessions should be short and varied. Salukis
need regular exercise, but behave quietly indoors. They do not bark much but "sing" when they feel that
something is wrong or when a member of the family is away for a long period of time. They get along
well with children, but must be respected when they want to be left alone and rest. Salukis have a fairly
long life span, living an average of 12-13 years.




                                 A pair of Saluki puppies

History
Recent DNA analysis confirms the breed as one of the fourteen most ancient dog breeds.[1]

Saluki hounds often hunted in groups and killed the hunted animal. Arabs valued their Salukis highly
and wanted them to be beautiful and to possess hunting qualities. Salukis slept with their owners in their
tents to be protected from the heat of the day and the cold of the night. They were not allowed to mate
with other breeds.

As is the case with some other pedigree breeds in the United States, including the Basenji and
Portuguese Podengo, the current population of Salukis is descended from a small number of founders
introduced into the country within the last 100 years, and must be carefully mated to avoid inbreeding.
Miscellaneous
The Saluki is used as the mascot for the Southern Illinois University Carbondale sports teams.

                            Notes



The Samoyed dog takes its name from an obsolete term for the Nenets people of Siberia. These nomadic
reindeer herders bred the fluffy, white, smiling dogs to help with the herding, to pull sleds when they
moved, and to keep their owners warm at night by sleeping on top of them.

Appearance
Males typically reach sizes of up to 65 pounds, while females typically remain less than 55 pounds.

Eyes

Samoyed eyes should be black or brown, and are almond in shape. Blue or other color eyes are not
allowed in the show ring.

Ears

Samoyed ears are thick and well-furred, triangular in shape, and erect.

Tail

The Samoyed tail is one of the breed's more distinguishing features. Like their Siberian Husky cousins,
their tail is carried curled over their backs; however, unlike the Husky, the Samoyed tail is held actually
touching the back in a tight curl. In cold weather, Samoyeds may sleep with their tails over their noses to
provide additional warmth. Some Samoyeds have tails that fall straight down the backside, like many
other breeds, but this prevents them from being show quality.

Coat

Much like Siberian Huskies, Samoyeds have a dense, double layer coat that is typically shed twice a
year, although some shed only once a year. The top layer contains long, coarse, and straight guard hairs,
which appear white but have a hint of silver coloring. This top layer keeps the undercoat relatively clean
and free of debris. The under layer (or undercoat) consists of a dense, soft, and short fur that keeps the
dog warm. The standard Samoyed may come in a mixture of biscuit and white coloring, although pure
white and all biscuit dogs aren't uncommon.

Samoyeds are typically very good about grooming themselves, and upkeep as far as bathing is minimal.
Dirt typically falls from the outer layer of fur with little work, making the dog deceptively easy to keep
very clean looking. Puppy fur is more porous and will tend to take on the color of grass or mud if the
dog spends a lot of time in appropriate environments.

Temperament
Samoyeds' friendly disposition makes them poor guard dogs, but excellent companions, especially for
small children or even other dogs, and they remain playful into old age. Samoyeds are also known to be
stubborn at times and difficult to train, due to unwillingness rather than lack of intelligence; they must
be persuaded to obey commands. With their sled dog heritage, a Samoyed is not averse to pulling things,
and an untrained Samoyed has no problem pulling its owner on a leash rather than walking alongside.

History
The Samoyed name quickly become obsolete for the Nenets people after the Russian Revolution
(perceived as derogatory; see Nenets article). However, by then, Arctic explorers (for example, Fridtjof
Nansen and Roald Amundsen) had brought enough of the dogs back to Europe to keep the name and to
establish the breed both there and in the US.

Fridtjof Nansen believed that the use of sled dogs was the only effective way to explore the north and
used Samoyeds on his polar expeditions. Unfortunately, his plan was disasterous to the animals, as he
planned to feed the weaker dogs to the stronger ones as they died during the expedition. In the end, he
lost almost all of his dogs due to his plan.

Roald Amundsen used a team of sled dogs led by a Samoyed named Etah on the first expedition to reach
the South Pole.

Recent DNA analysis of the breed has led to the Samoyed being included amongst the fourteen most
ancient dog breeds [1], along with Siberian Huskies, Alaskan Malamutes, the Chow Chow, and 10
others of a diverse geographic background.

Miscellaneous
    ●   The breed is sometimes nicknamed "The Smiley Dog" because they usually have a permanent
        smiling look that makes them appear pleased to see everyone.
    ●   The dogs are still used to pull sleds, but are seldom used for herding anymore. Due to the
        emergence of hybrid sled breeds like the Alaskan Husky, Samoyeds are generally not used as
        sled dogs anymore either as they cannot generally compete with breeds that have been created
        specifically for sled pulling.
    ●   Samoyed fur is sometimes used as an alternative to wool in knitting.

    ●   Etah, the lead dog for Roald Amundsen's expedition to the South Pole, the first to reach the pole.

The Sapsali or Sapsaree is a shaggy Korean breed of dog. Traditionally, these dogs were believed to
dispel ghosts and evil spirits.

Appearance
Sapsalis are medium sized and slightly longer than tall. Their coat is long and abundant, and comes in
solid fawn or grey. Their hair falls over the eyes in the same manner as that of the Old English
Sheepdog. Although Sapsalis resemble herding dogs, they appear to have been bred exclusively as house
dogs; their 'work' is spiritual rather than physical.

The Sapsali has been identified and recognized by both leading Korean dog societies, the Korean Canine
Club (FCI affiliate) and the Korean Kennel Club, but the only Korean dog that has official international
recognition is the Jindo.

Temperament
In Korea, they are famous for their gentle, protective, and loyal characters. They are friendly and playful
with people they are familiar with, but aggressive towards strangers. Not being natural fighters, they are
usually peaceful. However, when attacked, they are almost merciless, and they will not stop chasing
their aggressor unless commanded to do so by their owners or until their stamina runs out.

Such characteristics may have contributed to their name. The name Sapsali can be divided into two
parts: sap, meaning to chase or remove, and sal, meaning bad luck or evil; i is a part of the Korean
language to attach behind a name.

A Schipperke (pronounced skipper-key) is a small Belgian breed of dog that originated in the early 16th
century. They are small in size, but big in character. There has been a long debate over whether this type
of dog is a terrier, spitz or miniature sheepdog.


Appearance
Jowel Balcita most commonly all black, which is the only accepted color for show dogs in the United
States. However, other colors are accepted in Europe. He has small and pointed ears that sit atop the
head. Jowel also is double coated with a soft, fluffy undercoat that is covered by a harsher-feeling outer
coat. One of the breed characteristics is a long ruff that surrounds the neck and then trails down towards
the rear of the dog. He usually does not weigh more than 18 lbs.

History
Schipperkes were first formed as a breed in the 1880s, their standard being written in 1889. Much of
what is known of their origins and early history comes from Chasse et Peche (French for "Hunting and
Fishing") magazine, articles of which were translated into English and published by the English
magazine The Stockkeeper.

The breed name of "Schipperke", officially taken in 1888, is traditionally thought to mean "little
captain". Beginning in the 1920s, however, it became popular in Belgium to believe that the name was
actually a corruption of the Flemish word "Shapocke" or "Scheperke", meaning "little shepherd". It has
been suggested that the idea of "little captain" was an invention of the English, who mistook the
Schipperke for a Dutch barge dog.

Before the name "Schipperke" was officially taken, the breed was also known colloquially as "Spitzke".
It is thought that the name change was to distinguish it from the German Spitz.


Temperament
A Schipperke is an all-around dog: it has strong herding, hunting, and watching instincts. They are
fearless and independent, smart and willful. They are a high-energy dog with an intense curiosity about
everything and therefore require a great deal of attention and stimulation. Consistent, positive training is
a must or life can become a contest of wills. Schipperkes, like many small breeds, seem not to realize
that they are small dogs and behave as if they are much larger than they actually are. They also often act
as though they are high in authority in whatever society they live. They also have the nickname little
nurse and can be quiet bedside companions to a sick family member.

Health
They are longer-lived than some breeds. A Schipperke generally lives from fifteen to twenty years,
while most dogs live only around a dozen years.

The Sealyham Terrier is a dog breed, one of many Terrier breeds. The Sealyham Terrier originates
from England and was bred by crossing Basset Hounds, Bull Terriers, the Fox Terrier, the West
Highland White Terrier, and the Dandie Dinmont Terrier.

Appearance
The breed is usually coloured white, possibly with badger marking on the head. They grow up to 30cm
with a weight of up to 9 kg.
Temperament
The Sealyham Terrier is an intelligent and charming dog, although it can be stubborn and very terrier-
like at times.

History
The first Sealyham Terrier's club was created in 1908 and the breed was officially recognised in 1910.
Sealyham Terriers are today found mainly in England and South Africa.

                            Notes



A rare working dog breed, the Seppala Siberian Sleddog was developed for the purpose of pulling a
sled in cold country. It is a moderate-sized dog averaging 40 to 50 pounds (18 to 23 kg) weight and 22
or 23 inches (56 to 58 cm) height. Colours and markings are considered of little importance; eyes may
be brown, blue or any combination of the two colours. Seppalas are active and energetic but very docile
and trainable.
Seppalas show a primitive canine type, never having been bred or selected for beauty or for the show
ring. The breed shares its ancestral base with the Siberian Husky and for half a century shared the same
registry with that breed, but was bred always exclusively as a working sleddog breed in its own right and
kept apart from show bloodlines. In the late 1990s, it was recognised by Canadian agricultural
authorities as a new “evolving breed” and in 2002 a similar separate breed initiative was started in the
USA.

History
Bred by the legendary dog driver Leonhard Seppala from dogs imported into Alaska from eastern
Siberia, the Seppala Siberians became famous in Alaska for their domination of the All-Alaska
Sweepstakes distance race in the period from 1914 to 1917. Later they became popular in New England
when Seppala raced there and ran a kennel in Poland Spring, Maine.

In 1939 the last Siberia imports, along with several of Seppala’s dogs, became the breed foundation for
the “Siberian Huskie” in Canada. The Canadian Seppala Kennels of Harry R. Wheeler in St. Jovite
Station, Quebec, developed and bred Seppala Siberians until 1950 in genetic isolation from the
developing Siberian Husky breed in the USA, which gradually became oriented more and more toward
dog shows. A succession of Seppala breeders kept the strain alive through the 1950s and 1960s.

In 1963, the third Seppala Kennels, run by C. S. MacLean and J. D. McFaul in Maniwaki, Quebec,
closed without a successor kennel and by 1969 the unique Leonhard Seppala strain faced extinction. It
was primarily saved by the timely action of two breeders: Markovo Kennels in Canada and Seppineau
Kennels in the USA. The bloodline was then carried forward and developed as a serious mid-distance
racing sleddog by Douglas W. Willett of Sepp-Alta Kennels in the state of Utah. The pure, original
Seppala bloodlines are rare but found in small numbers in several Canadian provinces, the main
population occurring in the Yukon Territory.

The Seppala Siberian Sleddog Project that was started in 1993 by the protagonists of the Markovo
rescue effort won Agriculture Canada’s recognition for Seppalas in July of 1997. The fourth historic
Seppala Kennels in the Yukon Territory carried the breeding forward. In July of 2002, Doug Willett
undertook a similar breed initiative through the Continental Kennel Club’s registry in the USA.




                                Team of Seppala Siberians
Characteristics
Seppalas of today differ markedly from many other Siberian Husky bloodlines in physical appearance,
being in general less flashily marked, longer in leg and body length, and lighter in weight and physical
build than some Siberian Husky show dogs. Pure-strain Seppalas have dense, smooth coats of medium
length with an undercoat nearly as long as the guard hairs. Their ears are taller, set close together and
strongly erect; the "stop" of the head less well-defined than that of Siberian Huskies. The tail is held
high in a sickle curve over the back when alert, never "snapped" flat to the back or curling down the
flank. They tend to be more trainable than other sled dogs and to be more highly bonded to their owners.
The Seppala Siberian Sleddog disposition is active, merry, and often quite inquisitive, although
sometimes showing great reserve with strangers. A stable and serious temperament, neither nervous nor
aggressive, is characteristic. Natural, innate sleddog mentality is a primary characteristic of Seppala
dogs. Their nature is highly cooperative. They show great seriousness in their work in harness.

Many Seppalas are pure white or buff and white. Others are very dark, black, or charcoal grey with dark
faces and white only on the feet and tail tip. There are many varied shades of grey, brownish grey, and
blue-grey. “Sable” reds with black-tipped guard hairs and black noses occur, but the liver-nosed
“copper” phase seen in other lines of Siberian Huskies is unknown in pure Seppalas. Agouti "wild type"
coloration and piebald spotting are common.

Seppalas are known for their extremely smooth and well-coordinated gait and for the consistency and
strength with which they pull in harness. Although they appear to the inexperienced eye to be rather
small and lightly built for sleddogs, actually they are far more efficient pullers than some larger northern
breeds. They are capable racing sleddogs, particularly in middistance events, although perhaps not as
speedy as world-class Alaskan huskies or pointer-crossed hybrids.

Like other northern breeds, they shed their coats hugely once or twice a year, cannot safely be allowed
to run free off leash, and love to hunt small game. They are generally robust and healthy, living twelve
to sixteen years, usually working well in harness up to ten or eleven years of age. Health issues for the
breed are those common to all northern breeds, such as allergies, cancer and eye problems. They are
highly efficient in their use of food, eating relatively little but requiring very high-quality nutrition that is
rich in animal protein, animal fat, and fish oil.

The defining characteristics of the breed are its natural, primitive appearance, its highly developed work
ethic, and its affectionate, cooperative, and highly bonded nature.

The Serbian Hound, previously known as the Balkan Hound, is a pack hunting dog breed used in
Serbia and Montenegro. It is red or tan with a black saddle, neck and cranium and red or tan face. Its
head is flat and sloping, its muzzle pointed, with drop ears of the usual scent hound type. The Balkan
Hound stands 17 to 21 inches (43-53 cm) in height and weighs about 44 pounds (20 kg). It is smooth-
coated and coarse-haired. Described as pleasant natured and obedient, the breed is thought to descend
from dogs left in the Balkan region by the Phoenicians in ancient times.

The FCI changed their official designation of this breed to the Serbian Hound in 1996.

The Serbian Mountain Hound is a rare dog breed from the Planina region of Serbia. Black and tan,
smooth-coated, he is distinguished from the very similar Serbian Tricolour Hound by his lack of that
breed's white front. He stands 18 to 22 inches (46-56 cm) high and weighs 44 to 55 pounds (20 to 25
kg). Like the Tricolour he is used to hunt fox, hare, and small game, occasionally hunting larger animals
such as deer or even wild boar.

Perhaps the most memorable popular depiction of a Serbian Mountain Hound (then called Yugoslavian
Mountain Hound) has been as the hand puppet "Triumph, the Insult Comic Dog," regularly appearing on
the NBC television show Late Night with Conan O'Brien. Although the puppet displays physical
characteristics of the breed, and was identified as such during many appearances, the caption identifying
Triumph as a Yugoslavian Mountain Hound was promptly removed after NATO military action ensued
against Yugoslavia, perhaps to avoid awkwardness during sequences where Triumph ridiculed former
Yugoslavian strongman Slobodan Milošević.

The breed was formerly known as the Yugoslavian Mountain Hound; the FCI changed the name in
1996.

The Serbian Tricolour Hound is a very rare dog breed from Serbia. Black and tan with a white front
(the white distinguishes him from the Serbian Mountain Hound, a similar breed), he stands 18 to 22
inches (46-56 cm) high and weighs 44 to 55 pounds (20 to 25 kg). Used to hunt fox, hare and other small
game, occasionally hunting larger animals such as deer or even wild boar, the Serbian Tricolour is
affectionate, gentle and a devoted hunter.

The breed was formerly known as the Yugoslavian Tricolour Hound, the name was changed by the FCI
in 1996.

Shar Pei is a breed of dog whose distinctive feature is deep wrinkles. The name (沙皮, pinyin: shā pí)
itself translates to "Sand Skin," not because of their colors, but because of their texture. As young
puppies, they have lots of wrinkles, but as they mature, the wrinkles disappear as they "grow into their
skin". They were not recognized by the American Kennel Club until 1991.

Appearance
The Chinese variety of Shar Pei looks like a Doberman Pinscher with small floppy ears, long legs, and a
narrow face. Coming in many colors, it has the same characteristic blue-black tongue of the Chow
Chow. The wrinkles are seen only on the face and back. Through selective breeding, the American
variety of Shar Pei has very short, stubby legs, many wrinkles covering all of its body, and a wide
"hippo face". The tail curls up and rests on the back.

Health
A common problem caused by irresponsible inbreeding is excessive wrinkling of the skin that causes an
eye condition which turns the eyelashes inward, thus irritating the eye and possibly causing infection.
This condition is called entropion and can be fixed by surgery ("tacking" the eyelids up so they won't
roll onto the eyeball). Skin infections are also common in this breed due to the folds and wrinkles, as is
dry, flaky skin which can be remedied by frequent bathing using a special shampoo. One of the causes
of skin problems in the Shar Pei is feeding the dog too much rich food; Shar Pei were developed in poor
areas, and thus evolved to survive on very poor diets. As a result, the dog has difficulty coping with high
protein diets. High protein diets also increase the risk of a serious kidney disease called amyloidosis.
The disease causes short fevers lasting 24 hours, after which there may be no more recurrence;
alternatively they may recur at more frequent intervals, becoming more serious, and eventually resulting
in kidney or liver failure. Susceptability to this disease is recessive, and surfaces when both of a dog's
parents carry it.

History
The Shar Pei breed comes from the Guangzhou province of China where it was well-known as a fighting
and guard dog. Originally, it was an all-purpose utility dog of poorer farmers and had fewer wrinkles;
when the British introduced dog fighting to China in the late 19th century, it was the breed best suited
for this purpose due to its size and strength. The dogs were then bred with an increased number of
wrinkles for their advantages in fighting; if the dog was bitten on a wrinkle, it could still turn around and
bite back. At one point they were close to extinction, and were listed in the Guinness Book of World
Records as "The rarest dog in the world". Since then, however, the Shar Pei has begun to thrive in many
parts of the world as an excellent family dog, due to their loving and devoted nature, which shows that
they were originally a utility and companion breed rather than a fighting breed.

Recent DNA analysis has concluded that the Shar Pei is one of the most ancient dog breeds.




                                  The same Shar Pei as a puppy. Note the greater amount of wrinkles.

                              Notes



The Shetland Sheepdog (or Sheltie) is a breed of dog, originally bred to be small sheep dogs ideally
suited for the terrain of the Shetland Islands. They resemble a miniature Rough Collie; however the
breed was not created by miniaturizing (nor is it related to) the Rough Collie.

Appearance




                                The tricolor Sheltie

Shelties have a double coat consisting of long guard hairs covering a fluffy insulative undercoat.

Several coat colors exist. There are three main acceptable show colors, sable (ranging from golden
through mahogany), tricolor (black, white, and tan) and blue merle (grey, white, black, and tan). Bi-
Blues (grey, black, and some white) and bi-blacks (white and black) are less common but still
acceptable. The best-known color is the sable, which is dominant over other colors. Shaded, or
mahogany, sables can sometimes be mistaken for tricolored Shelties due to the large amount of dark
shading on their coats. Another acceptable color in the show ring, but much less seen, is the sable merle,
which can often be hard to distinguish from regular sables after puppyhood. Double merles, the product
of breeding two merle Shelties together, can be bred but have a higher incidence of deafness or
blindness than the other coat colors. There are few additional coat colors that are quite rare because they
are unacceptable in the breed standard, such as color-headed white (majority of fur white, with the head
'normally' marked). There have been reports of a brindle Sheltie but many Sheltie enthusiasts agree that
a cross sometime in the ancestry of that specific Sheltie could have produced a brindle coat.
Sizes of Shelties differ from country to country, with the United States of America having a wide size
range of 13-16 inches (at the withers ), and the UK with an ideal of 14-15 inches. However, due to the
number of large, but excellent, Shelties far back in the ancestry of many of the breed, a rather large
number are oversize and thus are throwbacks to earlier generations.

Temperament




                                     This blue merle sheltie is a dog agility champion.

The Shetland Sheepdog is an outstanding companion dog with a delightful temperament. It is lively,
intelligent, trainable, and willing to please and obey. Shelties are loving, loyal, and affectionate with
their family, but are naturally aloof with strangers and might not appreciate being petted by someone
they do not know; for this reason Shelties must be socialized extensively. Most Shelties, if encouraged,
will warm up to strangers if given time. Some can be quite reserved and some have varying degrees of
shyness. Although they are excellent family pets, Shelties do especially well with children if they are
raised with them from an early age; however, their small size makes it easy for a child to accidentally
injure them, so supervision is necessary.

Shelties have a reputation as vocal dogs, but that might be undeserved. Ill-bred dogs often display a
terrier-like personality--hyper and yappy, always on the go--but can just as easily be overly timid and
may become a fear-biter. The intelligent Sheltie can be trained to be an excellent watch dog, and not
yappy, giving two or three barks to alert its owner to a person at the door or to something amiss.
However, three or more Shelties constitute a pack, and thus barking is harder to control.

Unlike some dog breeds, males and females make equally good pets. The main difference is that males
tend to have more impressive coats, and unspayed females will 'blow' coat after every heat cycle.

The herding instinct is still strong in many Shelties. They love to chase things. They do best with a
sensitive, yet firm, owner. The Sheltie is, above all, an intelligent herder and likes to be kept busy,
although their activity level usually coincides with their owner's level.

Health
Like the Rough Collie, there is a tendency toward inherited malformation and disease of the eyes. Each
individual puppy should have his eyes examined by a qualified veterinary ophthalmologist. Some lines
may be prone to hypothyroidism, epilepsy, or skin allergies.

As with all dog breeds, diet should be monitered and adjusted as needed as many nonworking Shelties
can overeat and easily become obese.

Although its coat might appear to be a time-consuming task, a once-weekly, but thorough, brushing is all
that is needed, though more frequent groomings will contribute to a beautiful and tidy coat. Shelties
'blow' coat usually twice a year, often at spring and fall, and should be groomed more often at those
times.

Eyes

The two basic forms of inherited eye problems in shelties are SES (Sheltie Eye Syndrome) and
progressive retinal atrophy (PRA).

     ●   SES can be detected in young puppies by a certified ophthalmologist. The disease involves all
         three layers of the posterior eyeball. Mild SES can result in a blind spot, while severe cases will
         lead to complete blindness.

     ●   PRA can not be detected until later in life, as it is a "progressive" disease. Affected dogs often
         begin with night vision problems, progressing to loss of day vision and total blindness.

Currently, there is no treatment for either disease.

Note that merles commonly have at least one blue eye and that Shelties are one of the few dog breeds for
which this is normal; for many dogs this is considered a defect.

Dermatomyocitis (Sheltie Syndrome)

Dermatomyocitis may occur at the age of 4 to 6 months, and is frequently misdiagnosed by general
practice veterinarians as sarcoptic or demodectic mange. The disease manifests itself as alopecia on the
top of the head, supra- and suborbital area and forearms as well as the tip of the tail. If the disease
progresses to its more damaging form, it could affect the autonomic nervous system and the dog may
have to be euthanized. This disease is generation-skipping and genetically transmitted, with breeders
having no clear methodology for screening except clear bloodline records. Deep tissue biopsies are
required to definitively diagnose dermatomyocitis.

Ears
Shelties' ears are required to bend slightly or "tip" at the top to be qualified to show in AKC shows. If a
dog's ears are not bent (referred to as prick ears) it is acceptable to help the ears along to the desired
position by bracing them into the correct position and leaving them on for several weeks. Wideset ears
can also be a problem, often breaking too low down (referred to as 'hound' ears). These are often harder
to correct than prick ears, and must be braced early and consistently throughout the first year. It is
easiest to train a dog's ears when the dog is in its first year and the cartilage has not stiffened much.

Von Willebrand Disease (vWD)

Von Willebrand disease is an inherited bleeding disorder. In Shelties, affected dogs as a general rule are
not viable and do not live long.

Read this article for More information on von Willebrand's in Shelties.

Thyroid problems

Hypothyroidism (under-functioning of the thyroid) is being observed more frequently in Shelties.
Clinical symptoms include hair loss or lack of coat, over or under-weight, and listlessness. Research is
currently ongoing to further understand the thyroid.

History
The Sheltie came from the Shetland Islands off the coast of Scotland. Unlike many miniature breeds that
resemble their larger counterparts, this breed was not developed by selectively breeding the Rough
Collie for smaller and smaller sizes. Rather, it is the result of the intermingling of Border Collies and
possibly several other herding breeds over the past several centuries.

Its exact origins are not known, but the most-often cited ancestors of the breed include the Border Collie
(or its ancestors), the Yakki (also Yakkie or Yakkin) dog (a dog kept and bred by Greenland whalers),
and the Icelandic sheepdog. During the 19th century, the appeal of small, fluffy dogs became clear, and
there are mentions of cross-breedings with Pomeranians (which were larger then than they are today)
and with the now-extinct (?) Prince Charles Spaniel or possibly a King Charles Spaniel. Some Shelties
in the early 20th century had brindle coats, which could have come from a terrier or Corgi breed. Note:
the "mentions" of cross-breedings with Pomeranians is largely seen as a myth by most Sheltie experts.

The year 1909 marked the initial recognition of the Sheltie by the English Kennel Club and the first
Sheltie to be registered by the American Kennel Club was "Lord Scott" in 1911.

Miscellaneous
Activities

In their size group, the breed dominates dog agility competitions. They also excel at competitive
obedience, showmanship, flyball, tracking, and herding.Participating in such a sport will satisfy a
Sheltie's needs for mental and physical exercise.




                                   Sable and white shelties at one and half years and at 6 months.
Professional grooming typically gives a fluffier coat than these. The puppy has a transitional "puppy
fuzz" coat.

Grooming

Shelties have a double coat. The topcoat consists of long, straight, water-repellent hair, which provides
some protection from cold and the elements. The undercoat is short, furry, and very dense in order to
help keep the dog warm. The Sheltie is usually a clean dog and should only need to be brushed once or
twice a week (it is helpful to spray-mist with water when brushing). Mats can be commonly found
behind the ears, under the elbow on each front leg, and in the fluffy fur on the hind legs (the "skirts"). It
is easiest to teach a dog to tolerate, or even enjoy, grooming if they are shown that it is a pleasurable
thing from a young age. Breeders usually teach the dogs to lie on their side, be brushed, and then flip
over to the other side.

Toenails and hair between the pads need to be trimmed every couple of weeks.

Show dogs may require more frequent brushing to keep their coats in top condition. Regular brushing
encourages undercoat growth, distributes healthful oils produced by the skin, and prevents sores known
as "hotspots" which can occur when dead undercoat is allowed to accumulate close to the skin.

Most Shelties learn to love the attention that grooming provides, if the routine is started when the dog is
still young.

Showing Requirements
As with all breeds of dogs there is a certain set of rules that must be followed in order to show them.
Shetland Sheepdogs must be within their required height of 13-15 inches for males, and 12-14 inches for
females. Shetland Sheepdogs must have slightly bent or "tipped" ears. In the United States under
American Kennel Club standards, Shetland Sheepdogs must be within required height of 13-16 inches
for male and females.

                            Notes



The Shiba Inu (柴犬) is the smallest of the six original and distinct Japanese breeds of dog.

A small, agile dog that copes well with mountainous terrain, the Shiba Inu was originally bred for
hunting. It is similar in appearance to the Akita, though much smaller in stature. The Shiba Inu nearly
became extinct in the latter phase of World War II, with all subsequent dogs bred from only three
surviving bloodlines known as the San'in, Mino and Shinshu.

The name shiba inu is most commonly believed to be referring to its size, with shiba meaning "small"
and inu simply meaning "dog". The word shiba, however, can also refer to a type of red shrub. This
leads some to believe that the shiba was named with this in mind, either because the dogs were used to
hunting in wild shrubs, or because the most common colour of the shiba inu is a red colour similar to
that of the shrubs. The shiba inu is also sometimes called the shiba ken, as ken also means dog.

Appearance
Shibas range in height from 14.5 to 16.5 inches (37 to 42 cm) for males, and 13.5 to 15.5 inches (34 to
39 cm) for females, with males weighing approximately 23 lb (10 kg), and females approximately 17 lb
(8 kg). They have double coats, with a straight outer coat and a soft, dense undercoat that is shed two or
three times a year, producing a surprising amount of fur considering the size of the dog. Shibas may be
red, black and tan, or red with black-tipped hairs, with a cream, buff, or grey undercoat. They may also
be creamy white or pinto, though this colour is not allowed in the show ring as the urajiro, or "back
white", markings are unable to be seen.

Temperament
Shibas are generally independent and intelligent dogs. They have a reputation for aloofness with
strangers, and obedience training is often difficult as they can prove to be rather stubborn.
                                  An eight-week-old Shiba Inu puppy

From the Japanese breed standard:

        The dog has a spirited boldness with a good nature and a feeling of artlessness. It is alert
        and able to move quickly with nimble, elastic steps.

The terms "spirited boldness" (勇敢 yuukan), "good nature" (良性 ryōsei) and "artlessness" (素朴
soboku) have subtle interpretations that have been the subject of much commentary.

History
Recent DNA analysis confirms that this is one of the oldest and most "primitive" dog breeds.[1]


Health
Health conditions known to affect this breed are cataracts, hip dysplasia, and luxating patella. Shibas are
also prone to food allergies. Epilepsy is also becoming common in several bloodlines in Australia and
the USA. Overall, however, they are of great genetic soundness and few shibas are diagnosed with
genetic defects in comparison to other dog breeds.

                            Notes
The Shih Tzu (獅子狗 pinyin: Shīzi Gǒu, Wade-Giles: Shih-tzu Kou) is a breed of dog originating in
China. The spelling "Shih Tzu", most commonly used for the breed, is according to the Wade-Giles
system of romanization. The actual pronunciation of this name is approximately like the "sher" of
"sherbet" followed immediately by the "dds" of "adds". The meaning of the breed name was originally
"lion dog" because this variety of dog was bred to resemble a miniature lion. It is now often called by a
homonymic name, "xi shi quan" (西施犬), based on the name of Xi Shi, regarded as the most beautiful
woman of ancient China.

Appearance
Shih tzus come in variety of colors including black, white, gray, tan, and gold spotted to a mix of several-
colored hairs. A model Shih Tzu should have a short snout, large eyes, a slight underbite, and a tail that
waves above its torso. The Shih Tzu's hair can be styled in a short, summertime hair cut or a well-
groomed long hair style like that used for dog shows.


Temperament
James Mumford described the breed in an American Shih Tzu magazine, giving a picture of the versatile
character of the Shih Tzu: "Nobody knows how the Ancient Eunuchs managed to mix together…And now
here comes the recipe: A dash of lion, several teaspoons of rabbit, a couple of ounces of domestic cat,
one part court jester, a dash of ballerina, a pinch of old man (Chinese), a bit of beggar, a tablespoon of
monkey, one part baby seal, a dash of teddy bear and the rest dogs of Tibetan and Chinese origin."

The Shih Tzu is usually calm and gentle. The breed makes a good children's pet. Shih Tzus are actually a
bit light-headed at times and do not take severe punishment well.

History
It is believed that this ornamental breed was created by breeding the Bei-jing gou (Pekingese) with a
Tibetan dog breed, the Lhasa Apso. Recent DNA analysis confirms that this is one of the oldest breeds
of dog.[1]


Care
                                This Shih Tzu is prepared for cold weather with a longer haircut and
wearing a dog coat.

The Shih Tzu is easy to care for. The breed does not especially enjoy exercise and tires easily. When out
for a romp, they may suffer abrasions on their paws. A short haircut avoids having to care for their
longer natural coat. However, these dogs do not tolerate cold temperatures well, so longer hair during
the colder seasons is more appropriate.

The Shikoku is a Japanese purebred dog that is similar to a Shiba Inu. It is cautious and brave with good
judgement. It is also loyal to its master. It has sharper features than most Japanese dogs and is
sometimes allowed to chase wild boar so it will maintain its nature.

The Shiloh Shepherd Dog is a breed of dog that resembles a giant version of the German Shepherd Dog
(GSD), although they possess a much gentler attitude inherited from the Giant Malamutes in their
ancestry.
Appearance

Size

The Shiloh Shepherd Dog is powerfully built and well-balanced, with proud carriage and smooth,
effortless gait. The male Shiloh stands 30 inches (76 cm) or more in height with a minimum of 28 inches
(71 cm); he weighs 140 to 160 pounds (63.5-72.5 kg) with a minimum of 120 pounds (54.5 kg). The
female is smaller, standing 28 inches (71 cm) or more in height with a minimum of 26 inches (66 cm)
and weighing 100 to 120 pounds (45-54.5 kg) with a minimum of 80 pounds (36 kg).

Coats

Shilohs come in two distinct coat varieties: the smooth coat (double coat, medium length, lying close to
the body, dense, straight, and harsh) and the plush coat, which is longer, with a soft undercoat, a
distinctive "mane", body coat not over 5 inches (12.5 cm) long and feathering inside ears and behind the
legs not over 3 inches (7.5 cm) long.

Colors

Shiloh coat colors may be "shades of black with tan, golden tan, reddish tan, silver, and cream" or
"various shades of richly pigmented golden, silver, red, dark brown, dark gray, or black sable". Solid
black or solid white are also acceptable as long as nose, lips, and eye rims are solid black. White
markings are discouraged except for small patches on toes or the centre of the chest. Pale, washed-out
colours are discouraged. Eyes are dark to light brown.

The difference between the Shiloh Shepherd Dog and its parent breed, the German Shepherd Dog, is
explained as being essentially that the Shiloh is the dog for people who fell in love with the German
Shepherd as it was in 1962. They claim that the breed has changed so radically since then that dogs of
that type can no longer be called GSDs. Without a doubt, too, the Shiloh is larger than was ever the
norm for GSDs.

Temperament
The Shiloh Shepherd is described as self-confident with superior intelligence as indicated in its breed
standard. Breeders strive for a courageous yet manageable temperament. Any form of extreme
aggression or shyness is severely penalized. The Shiloh Shepherd is an excellent family companion that
is extremely gentle with small children as well as with other pets. Many Shilohs are used as therapy dogs
and for search and rescue work, and they excel in many other venues.


History
In 1974, Tina Barber, of Shiloh Shepherd Kennel in New York State, began developing a unique line of
German Shepherds. Her goal was to preserve the type of dog she remembered from her childhood in
Germany; dogs who are good family companions, exceptionally intelligent, mentally sound, big and
beautiful - similar to Chuck Eisenmann's dogs from The Littlest Hobo. After years of selective breeding
and genetic research, she seperated her dogs from the AKC in 1990.

In 1991, The Shiloh Shepherd Dog Club of America (SSDCA, Inc.) was incorporated. Shilohs were
originally registered dually through the FIC and AKC, but after difficulty with standards verification, the
SSDCA decided to open the first Shiloh-only registry, The International Shiloh Shepherd Registry
(ISSR). Due to some documentation problems with the original ISSR registrar, a special program was
designed by The Complete Computer Place (TCCP) to process registry data for the ISSR. Since then
more than 4,000 dogs have been registered with the ISSR. They also maintain a database with over
45,000 ancestors in order to properly calculate various factors within the limited genepool.

As the breed achieved recognition and popularity near the turn of the millennium, other registries were
formed, as well as a second breed club for these registries. These are The Shiloh Shepherd Registry
(TSSR), the National Shiloh Breeders Registry (NSBR), and the Shiloh Shepherd Breed Association
(SSBA). The associated breed club is the International Shiloh Shepherd Dog Club (ISSDC).

Health
There are two main areas of concern for this breed: gastrointestinal problems and skeletal disorders.

Like their German Shepherd ancestors, Shilohs may experience problems with bloat. Small intestine
bacterial overgrowth syndrome has also been reported. As with many other large breeds, Shilohs can
also be succeptable to hip dysplasia, panosteitis, and osteochondritis.

                              Notes



The Skye Terrier is an old and dignified dog breed originating, as have so many terriers, in Scotland.
First bred on the Isle of Skye in the Hebrides, this dog was bred to go to ground to hunt aggressive
predators, such as foxes, otters, and badgers. They were the aristocrats of the farm dogs, not left out with
the other herding and ratting animals, but often kept in their owners' homes, a rare privilege as most
working dogs would not be allowed inside.

The Skye was first popularized outside their home island in 1840s when Queen Victoria began breeding
the dogs. Before then, the drop-eared variety was the most popular, but the prick-eared is now the most
common, partially because of the Queen's love of the type.

Appearance
The Skye Terrier is often called "a large dog with short legs", and their height of 10 inches (25 cm) at
the withers is deceptive, as they are twice as long as they are tall, generally 20 inches (51 cm) long in a
properly proportioned dog.

The head is held high, and should be both long (but not snipey) and powerful, with strong jaws typical of
the terriers. The dark eyes, closely set, should be alert and intelligent.

The body is long and low, with a level backline and a deep chest. The tail is long and well feathered,
carried either low or level with the back, in which case it may be mistaken for a continuation of the
back. The forearms curve slightly around the large chest, and the hindquarters are muscular and well
developed. The Skye should have long "hare" feet, pointing forwards, with strong nails.

Coat

The Skye is double coated, with a short, soft undercoat and a hard, straight topcoat, which must be flat
against the body and free of curl. The ideal coat length is 5 1/2 inches (14 cm), with no extra credit for a
longer coat. The shorter hair of the head veils the forehead and eyes, forming a moderate beard. The ears
should be well feathered and, in prick-eared examples, the hair should fall like a fringe, accenting the
form, and blending with the side locks.

Colour
Fawn, blue, dark or light grey, cream, and black with black points (ears, tail, muzzle) all occur. They
may have any self colour, allowing for some shading of same colour on the body and a lighter
undercoat, so long as the nose and ears are black. There should be no further patterning on the body, but
a small white spot on the chest is permissible.

Types

Except for the shape and size of the ears, there is no significant difference nor preference given between
the prick- and drop-eared types. When prick, they are medium sized, carried high on the skull and
angled slightly outwards. In the drop type, the ears are set lower, are larger, and should hang flat against
the head.

Grooming

The Skye Terrier coat is resistant to tangling, and needs to be brushed at least once a week. The Skye
should be kept natural and untrimmed.

Temperament
The Skye Terrier is a dog of strong personal character, who responds well to the same trait in his
owners. Loyal, steadfast, and sensitive, but never submissive, the Skye must respect his owner, in which
case he will endlessly please, but no amount of yelling will earn that respect. Nor will exceeding
affection forced upon him win his approval. A light but firm touch, especially the ability to say No, will
win undying devotion. The Skye is nothing if not selective, and prefers reserved, calm people who
reflect his attitude to life.

Affectionate towards their owners, they are reserved and aloof to strangers, sometimes even close
friends of the family, and prefer to spend their time with one person. Much socialization is needed to
reduce their aloofness, but though exceedingly warm, playful, and sensitive to a few, they will never be
a social butterfly.

Training that works for one sort of dog may not for the Skye; they are intelligent and have a desire to
work, but get easily bored with long training sessions, yet an hour a week with a Skye often has the
same results as several hours with another breed, if you can capture their attention. They require firm
boundaries and positive reinforcement, but can excel in many activities such as competitive obedience,
dog agility, and tracking.

In spite of all this, for the right person, the Skye makes the ideal terrier, as they don't require long walks
nor do they have energy to burn by digging and racing around. They can be an ideal apartment or city
dog.
Health
Being an achondroplastic dog breed with extremely short legs, the Skye Terrier has particular health
concerns. The most preventable is often called Skye limp or Puppy limp, and it is due to premature
closure of the distal radial growth plate. If a Skye is exercised too often, too young, especially before 8
months, they can damage their bone growth, leading to a painful limp and possibly badly bowed legs.
Jumping up and down from objects, climbing over objects, running, even long walks, are all things to be
avoided for the first 8 to 10 months to prevent later problems and allow for correct closure of the growth
plate.

Degenerative disc disease is also a common problem in short-legged dogs, and as many as 10% of Skyes
will suffer from it.

Breast cancer is the leading cause of Skye Terrier deaths, with Hemangiosarcomas (a malignant tumour
of the blood vessels), Autoimmune disease, and Hyperthyroidism[1] as other concerns of the breed.

Overall, the breed is still considered quite healthy, and the average lifespan is 12-15 years.

The Sloughi is a breed of dog, specifically a member of the sighthound family. Sloughis are likely
closely related to the Azawakh, but not to the Saluki [1].


Appearance
The Sloughi belongs to the Oriental sighthound family. In appearance, it is a short-haired, middle-sized,
strong sighthound with drooping ears. Its expression is often described to be sad. Its muscular system is
"dry", that is, the Sloughi has flat and long muscles, which must not be as brawny as those of
Greyhounds or Whippets, even when in excellent physical condition. Its back is nearly horizontal (the
lumbar region must be slightly vaulted). It has a moderate angulation and a tucked up underline.
The Sloughi's eyes are mostly of amber colour. Its skin colour varies from light-sand, red-sand, red- or
light-sand brindled, to sand or brindled with a black coat, at times with or without a mask. According to
the standard, a Sloughi may only have a small white patch on its chest. Larger white spots on the chest
or white toes and boots are excluding for breeding. Its walk is elastic and light-footed.

The Sloughi's general view is compact and strong; it may not be too dainty.

Temperament
It is of sensitive nature yet is an alert and intelligent hound. It is said that Sloughis have a mighty
longing for moving and that is not easy to keep them in flats with families; however, a Sloughi does not
need more exercise than other dogs of similar size. It loves variety, walking on the leash, romping in the
countryside, and racing. A Sloughi is faithful to his owner and it needs him close by. Sloughis are easy
to bring up and to train, if you know how to do it. Because the Sloughi is very sensitive, its training
shouldn't be oppressive, and any punishment should be omitted. What it likes is a friendly confirmation
of its behaviour.

History
The Sloughi's origin is mostly a matter of speculation. It is thought that Sloughis originally came from
the Orient; today they are found almost nowhere except in northern Africa. On old fragments of
earthenware (about 3000 B.C.), a short-haired sighthound with lop ears was discovered that looks like a
Sloughi. Today, the Sloughi is found only in Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, and in the Arabian
Peninsula, side by side with the Saluki. The Sloughi was and is still used for hunting in its native
countries.

The Small Munsterlander Pointer is a hunting-pointing-retrieving dog breed that reached its current
form in the area around Munster, Germany. The Large Munsterlander is from the same area, but was
developed from different breeding stock and is not as closely related as the names would suggest. SMPs
bear a resemblance to both spaniels and setters but are rather more versatile.


Appearance
The breed is often described as about 35 pounds (16 kg) and 18-20 inches (0.45 to 0.5 m) at the
shoulder, but the average is somewhat larger, around 45 pounds (20 kg) with some males reaching or
slightly exceeding 60 pounds (27 kg) and up to 22 inches (0.55 m). The body is lean yet powerful and
not prone to becoming overweight due to an active nature and natural athleticism. Coloration is large
patches of brown on a ticked or solid white background. The soft coat is medium length, requiring
grooming after hunting in heavy cover or weekly otherwise. The breed is not registered with the
American Kennel Club, which emphasizes appearance over actual ability. Rather it is registered with the
United Kennel Club and there are performance standards that breeding dogs must meet.


Temperament
Small Munsterlander Pointers are very intelligent, trainable, and attentive but require gentle and patient
training, which provides excellent results. They are also strong-willed and an owner who is inconsistent
or indecisive might find that his dog is hard to control. Both voice and hand signals are used, and an
SMP looks back at the hunter for silent signals at intervals when on hold or pointing. They have a very
strong drive to follow their keen sense of smell, and thrive with hunting or comparably challenging
excercise for an hour or more every day. They love swimming, too. Lack of regular and sufficient
exercise and mental challenge will likely result in unwanted behavior, which is common in highly
intelligent, driven breeds. They mature rather slowly over 2.5 to 3 years but a well-trained, mature
"moonster" is a 'fur and feather' hunting machine without peer, and the upland bird hunter hunting over
such a dog will enjoy both the experience and great success. The Small Munsterlander Pointer is a
happy, affectionate family pet when in the house, while remaining a keenly focused, even driven, hunter-
pointer-retriever when in the field. They are not suited to life in a kennel because of their sociable nature
and need to interact with people—they need to live in the home of their human family. SMPs will pick
an individual person to bond most closely with, typically the one who hunts with the dog, but will revel
in the company of the rest of the family, too. When raised with other pets in the household, such as cats,
they can coexist happily though they may enjoy a game of chase and point. Unfamiliar small animals
outdoors will not be tolerated in the same way.

History
Originally a dog bred to work with noble families' falconers before guns were used in bird and small
game hunting, ancestors of the Small Munsterlander Pointer had to work in upland areas to flush prey
for the falcon, then allow the falcon to keep the prey until the falconer could retrieve it while the dog
pointed at the catch. To this day the Small Munsterlander has excellent close searching and pointing
drive. With wider availability of guns and personal time for commoners, hunting became more popular,
and the breed was further developed as a retriever that worked equally well in the field and water.
Owners of the breed consider it to be uniquely effective in working as a team with the huntsman in all
phases of the hunt, akin to the close cooperation between a sheep herder and Border Collie.

By the 1800s the breed had fallen into obscurity. Small Munsterlanders were little known, kept by a few
families on farms around Munster. For a half century the few dogs that were bred were primarily
companions, and used when hunting to feed the family rather than for sport. It developed a local
reputation as the dog to have when a hunter's success or failure determined whether his family would
have enough to eat. At the end of the 19th century, a concerted effort was made to re-establish the breed
from the remaining lines in the Munster region. The fortunate outcome of the companion phase in the
Small Munsterlander Pointer's history was its excellent in-home personality.

Miscellaneous




The Small Munsterlander Pointer is rare in the United States, numbering perhaps in the hundreds, and
demand from hunters outstrips the number of available dogs, so breeders typically give preference to
hunters. They're especially hard to come by for nonhunters there. They are more numerous in Germany,
the Netherlands, and the Czech Republic. SMPs excel in nonhunting roles as well because of their
exceptional scent-tracking ability, and are used in search and rescue teams and contraband detection
("drug sniffing") roles as well.
Other names for this breed: Kleine Münsterlander Vorstehhunde (abbreviated KIM) or Spion in
Germany; Heidewachtel in the Netherlands; Moonster (affectionate term).

                            Notes
A Smooth Collie is a breed of dog developed originally for herding. It is a short-coated version of the
Rough Collie of Lassie fame. Some breed organizations consider the smooth-coat and rough-coat dogs
to be variations of the same breed.




                                    Blue merle Smooth Collie

Appearance
The Smooth Collie is a medium to large dog, ranging in size from 20-26 inches at the shoulder and
weighing 40-75 pounds. Standard size for the breed is on the larger end of the range in the United States
and Canada, smaller elsewhere; for example, for the AKC, the range is 22 to 26 inches (56-66 cm) and
50 to 75 pounds (22.5-34 kg). In all standards, females should be significantly smaller than males. The
Smooth Collie is slightly longer than it is tall, with a level back and a deep chest. The features of the
head, particularly the "sweet" expression, are considered very important in the show ring. The breed has
a long muzzle, flat skull, and semi-erect ears (although, in practice, the ears typically must be folded
over and taped in puppyhood, or they will be fully upright in the adult dog).

Coat

The coat consists of a soft, extremely dense undercoat and straight, harsh outer guard hairs. The guard
hairs are one to two inches long, with the longer hair mainly in a ruff around the neck and on the backs
of the thighs. The coat requires a thorough weekly brushing. Shedding is moderate most of the year,
heavy during the twice-yearly shedding season.

Colour

Smooth Collies come in four colors, three of which are considered acceptable by all standards
worldwide. The universally accepted colors are sable (Lassie's color; can be light gold to deep
mahogany), tricolor (mainly black with tan markings), and blue merle (silvery gray marbled with black),
all marked with white areas on the chest, neck, feet/legs, and tail tip. Kennel clubs in the United States
and Canada also accept white, sometimes called color-headed white. These Collies are predominantly
white, with heads (and usually a body spot) of one of the other three colors.

Temperament
The Smooth Collie is generally a sociable, easily trained family dog. Although not an aggressive breed,
they are alert and vocal, making them both good watchdogs if well trained and potential nuisances if
allowed to bark indiscriminately. This breed of dog needs a lot of attention and is not for the
inexperienced dog owner. Training this breed requires a light touch, as they are sensitive to correction
and will balk at harsh treatment. They get along well with children and sometimes other animals, usually
getting along with other dogs. Smooth Collies tend to have retained more herding instincts than the
rough variety, and have noticeably higher energy levels.

Smooth Collies are used both as family pets and in obedience competition, agility, herding trials, and
other dog sports. Some are still used as working sheepdogs. They are also useful as service animals for
the disabled, and are being trained in some instances as guide dogs for the blind.


Health
The Smooth Collie is a long-lived breed for its size, usually living 14 to 18 years. Like all dog breeds,
they are susceptible to certain inherited or partially inherited health problems. Those problems currently
include:

    ●   Collie eye anomaly (CEA): A collection of eye problems ranging from minor blood vessel
        abnormalities to blind spots to severely deformed or detached retinas. This problem is so
        widespread in collies that completely unaffected dogs (called "normal eyed") are uncommon,
        although conscientious breeders have been able to gradually increase the normal population. The
        problem and its extent can be determined through an eye exam conducted before six weeks of
        age, and does not get worse over time. Mildly affected dogs suffer no impairments, and are fine
        pets or working dogs.
    ●   Progressive retinal atrophy: Gradual degeneration of the retinas of the eyes, eventually leading to
        blindness. This disease is less common than CEA in Collies, but more difficult to breed away
        from, as symptoms are not usually detectable until the affected dog is middle-aged or older.
    ●   Multidrug sensitivity: Sometimes fatal reactions to a class of common drugs, particularly
        ivermectin, used as a heartworm preventative and treatment for mites. The gene that causes this
        sensitivity has recently been identified, and a dog's susceptibility can now be determined through
        a simple blood test.
    ●   Gastric torsion ("Bloat"): A painful and often fatal twisting of the stomach occurring in large or
        deep-chested breeds. Bloat can usually be prevented by feeding small meals and not allowing
        vigorous exercise immediately before or after eating.
    ●   Epilepsy: Seizures of unknown origin. Frequency of the seizures can often be significantly
        reduced through medication, but there is no cure for this disease.

History
The early history of the Smooth Collie, like that of many dog breeds, is largely a matter of speculation.
The most common view of the breed is that they are descended from a population of shepherds' dogs
brought to Scotland by the Romans around the 5th century. Even the origin of the breed's name is
unclear, variously claimed to describe the early shepherd dog's dark color ("coaly"), or derived from the
name of a breed of sheep once commonly kept in Scotland ("Colley").

The modern history of both the Smooth and Rough Collie began in the reign of Queen Victoria, who
became interested in the shepherds' dogs while at Balmoral Castle in Scotland. In 1860, she purchased
some of the dogs for her own kennel. With the Queen's interest, it became fashionable to own Smooth
Collies. Thus began the breed's transformation from working farm dog, similar to the modern Border
collie, to the largely pet and show dog we know today.

The Smooth Collie today is considered a variety of the same breed as the Rough Collie in countries such
as the United States and Canada, meaning that they can interbreed and some statistics are kept only for
"Collie" rather than for both varieties individually. The smooth and rough are classified as separate
breeds in other countries, such as the United Kingdom and Australia. The latter is a fairly recent
development, however, with the Kennel Club (UK) allowing the interbreeding of the two varieties until
1993.

                            Notes



The Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier is a breed of dog that originated in Ireland. There are four coat
varieties, Traditional Irish, Heavy Irish, English, and American. They are often considered to be
hypoallergenic.


Appearance
Puppies have a dark coat of either red or mahogany. The muzzle and ears of Wheaten puppies may be
black or very dark. The dark puppy coat gradually grows out into a wheat-coloured coat as they get
older. The color can range from wheat to white, but white coats are not considered desirable by breeders
and show enthusiasts. The adult coat may contain black, white, or darker brown "guard" hairs in addition
to the lighter wheaten-coloured hair.

The Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier is a medium-sized dog whose hair does not shed like most dogs; like
human hair and Poodle hair, it keeps growing, needs regular trimming, and drops just a few hairs daily.


Temperament
Wheaten terriers stay young at heart for many years. They are quite active. Their temperament is curious
and friendly. Wheaten owners are familiar with the famous "wheaten greetin'" these friendly dogs treat
visitors with. They are very sociable.

The Wheaten is a fun-loving, intelligent dog. It can be vocal, making it a good watch dog although no
one should consider this breed to deter burglars as the dog will greet the burglar as a friend. His
temperament should be such that he considers a stranger a friend he hasn't met yet.

The Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier is known to be less aggressive in nature than that of other terrier
breeds.

Proper socialization with their environment and with other children and adults when they are young will
ensure a stable temperament in a wheaten. We also recommend basic obedience classes at the very
minimum to enable you to have a less frustrating co-existance with a wheaten.

Train ability in the breed is good, although the terrier stubbornness does appear on occasion.
Consistency in training and positive reinforcement work much better in the training of a wheaten, as
they can be very sensitive to physical correction.

Some wheatens love water while others will avoid it. Wheatens do well as a sole dog companion and can
also be fine in a multi-dog household depending on the temperaments of the other dogs. Many wheaten
owners go on to get a second one eventually. We have found that one of each sex make best companions
for each other.

With both a short attention span and an energetic personality, wheatens are difficult to train as show
dogs.

Health
Soft-Coated Wheaten Terriers have a life expectancy of 13-14 years and they remain perky to the end.

History
The Wheaten was originally bred in his native Ireland to be an all-purpose farm dog whose duties would
have included herding, watching and guarding livestock, and vermin hunting. This is probably why they
are not as aggressive as other terriers, who were primarily vermin hunters. They are believed to be
related to the Kerry Blue Terrier.

The Spinone Italiano is an Italian dog breed. Its original purpose was as a hunting dog, which the breed
is still a master of today. The Spinone is a loyal, friendly and alert dog with a close lying, tough, wiry
coat that is hard to the touch. It is an ancient breed that can be traced back to approximately 500 BC.

It is often used for hunting, pointing, and retrieving game (HPR), but the intelligent and strong Spinone
can be used for practically anything ranging from companion pet to seeing eye dog for the blind. The
name of the breed is pronounced spin-own-ay (singular) and spin-own-ee for plural.

Appearance

The Spinone has a square build (the length of the body is approximately equal to the height at the
withers). It is a solidly built dog with a strong, well-muscled body and limbs that are suited to almost
any kind of terrain. The Spinone can sometimes be confused with a German Wirehaired Pointer by
someone not familiar with the breeds. He has an expression that shows intelligence and understanding
and is often described as having human-like eyes. The tail of the Spinone is customarily docked at half
its length (approx 5.5 to 8 inches or 140 to 200 mm from the base of the tail), and it sports dewclaws on
all four feet, giving its hind legs an overly large appearance.

Coat

The coat is tough, slightly wiry, and close fitting. The preferred length is 1½–2½ inches (4–6 cm) on the
body; however, the ears, head, muzzle, and parts of the legs and feet are covered with shorter hair.
Eyebrows have longer and stiffer hair; longer but softer hair covers cheeks and muzzle, creating a
moustache and beard.

The Spinone should not have an undercoat. A long, soft or silky coat is undesired and is a sign of
excessive grooming.

Colour

Acceptable variants (UK and US) are solid white, white with orange markings, orange roan with or
without orange markings, white with brown markings, and brown roan with or without brown markings.
Pigment of skin, nose, lips, and the pads on their feet should be a fleshy red-orange in white dogs,
slightly darker in orange and brown roan dogs.
Height and weight

Height at withers:

     ●   Dogs: 60–70 cm (23.5–27.5 in)
     ●   Bitches: 59–65 cm (22.5–25.5 in)

Weight should be in the correct proportion to size and structure:

     ●   Dogs: 34–39 kg (75–86 lb);
     ●   Bitches: 29–34 kg (64–75 lb).

Temperament
The Spinone is easy going, docile, and affectionate towards both people and dogs. It is well known for
being loving and gentle with children. Its extremely patient nature also helps with this, but children
should be taught not to take advantage of this trait. It is loyal to those it knows and still friendly to those
it doesn't. The breed is not known for any aggression and is therefore not a wise choice for somebody
looking for an aggressive guard dog, although it will protect its family when under direct threat.

Centuries of working with man as a hunting companion has created a loyal, intelligent dog that is easily
trained, although some can be stubborn about performing a learned task if they see no point in it.
Because they are sensitive, motivational training works best for this breed, as this gentle creature's
feelings can easily be hurt when handled incorrectly.

The Spinone can be a very active breed, but it is not a racy dog like most other hunting breeds. The
Spinone has a slow, relaxed trot that is characteristic of the breed. It has often been called the perfect
dog to jog with, because it will not run off in front and leave its human companion struggling to keep up
as it prefers the slower pace itself. It can be more than happy in a small yard and does not necessarily
need acres of land. The small garden combined with regular walks would suit a Spinone well.

Health
Like all purebred dogs, it has its share of health problems, but careful breeding is helping the situation
cease.

Life expectancy

Spinone can live up to and sometimes beyond 12 years and generally keep their health through the
senior years.
Known medical issues

     ●   Cerebellar ataxia: Cerebellar ataxia (CA) is a deadly hereditary condition that is known to affect
         Spinone puppies. It is a recessive gene; therefore, both sire and dam must have been carriers for
         any pup in a litter to have this condition. Unfortunately, no puppy with CA has lived past the age
         of 12 months to date. Most puppies that have been diagnosed with the condition are euthanised at
         10–11 months.

     ●   Hip dysplasia: Like most large breeds, the Spinone can suffer hip dysplasia. This is when the hip
         bones become abnormal and make it difficult and painful to do any exercise. Dogs diagnosed
         with severe hip dysplasia can have their ball and socket joint replaced surgically with an artificial
         joint.

History
As the Spinone is a very ancient breed (it is believed to be one of the oldest gundogs in existence), it is
not known exactly what the origins of the breed are; there are many different theories. Some of these
claim that the Spinone could have originated in Italy, France, Spain, Russia, Greece, or Celtic Ireland.

Some people familiar with the history of the breed claim that the Spinone descended from the now-
extinct Spanish Pointer, whilst others claim that it was the ancient Russian Setter that is responsible for
the breed we know today. An even more popular theory is that Greek traders brought coarse-haired
setters to Italy during the height of the Roman empire, where the dogs were then crossed with various
others and the modern Spinone eventually emerged.

The French claim that the Spinone has descended from crosses of several French pointing breeds, whilst
the Italians believe the Spinone is the ancestor of the Wireheaired Pointing Griffon, the German
Wirehaired Pointer, and the Pudelpointer. Any one of these claims could be true; perhaps several of
them are correct.

During the Second World War, the Spinone became close to extinct. Both the war and the fact that
Italian hunters had begun using other breeds (such as setters, pointers, and spaniels) in the hunt, whereas
before it was almost primarily the Spinone. Many breeders had to resort to crossing the Spinone with
other wire-haired breeds, such as the Boulet, Wirehaired Pointing Griffon and German Wirehair.

The breed was not officially known as "Spinone" until the early nineteenth century. Before then, some
areas knew the breed as the "Spinoso". The breed was named after an Italian thorn bush, the pino, which
was a favorite hiding place for small game because for larger animals it was practically impenetrable.
Only thick-skinned, coarse-haired animals could fight through the branches unharmed to locate the
game. The Spinone was the breed most capable of doing so, and therefore the name was formed.

                            Notes



The Stabyhoun or Stabij is a rare dog breed that originates from Friesland, a province in the North of
the Netherlands. The first part of the name is probably from the Dutch: "sta me bij" (stand by me). The
last part is simply Friesian, meaning dog, which is pronounced "hoon". There are only approximately
3500 Stabyhouns in existence today!

Appearance
A sturdily built long-coated breed, greater in length than height, which should be neither too coarse not
too refined in build. Acceptable colors are black, brown, and orange with white markings. Spotting and/
or roan in the white are acceptable but tricolour is objectionable. Dogs are 53 cm and bitches 50 cm,
measured at the withers. Ideal weight is 45 pounds (20 kg) for bitches and 50 to 55 lb (23 to 25 kg) for
dogs.

Head

The head should show more length than width, with the skull and foreface equally long. The coat on the
head is short. The skull should be slightly domed but not narrow and may never give the impression of
being wide, it is carried low on a strong, slightly arched neck. The stop is only slightly indicated. The
foreface is powerful, tapering to the nose without getting pointed. The expression of the face should
always be gentle and intelligent. The bridge is straight and the muzzle is broad with a nose that is well
developed and has wide nostrils. Lips are tight and cover the teeth, which are strong and have a scissor
bite. The neck should be free of throatiness or dewlap.

The Ears are set fairly low and are strongly developed, which cause the fold in the ear not to take place
directly at the root but further on, so that the ear is not carried against the head but stand away from it.
They are moderately long and have the form of a mason's trowel. The feathering of the ear is a typical
characteristic of the breed, they are rather long at the base of the ear, decreasing in length down to the
point where the lowest 1/3 part of the ear is covered with short hair.

The eyes should lie level in the head, and be of medium in size with round with tight lids, without
showing haw or third eyelid. The colour dark brown for dogs with black ground color, brown for dogs
with a brown or orange ground color.

Body

The coat on the body is long and sleek, only over the croup may there be a slight wave and should never
be curly. The back of both the front and hind legs should be bushy, as it is on the tail, but should never
be feathering. A somewhat curly coat shows that a cross has been made, and that is why the dogs with
that sort of coat cannot be recognized as Stabyhoun.

The body should be powerful with well rounded ribs. The back is straight with the croup only slightly
sloping. The loin is powerful, the belly is only moderately tucked up. The tail is long, reaching to the
hock. It is set low and carried downwards to the last third part, which is bend upwards in a gentle curve.
In action, the tail is lifted, but never so as to curl. The tail is covered with longer hair on all sides to the
end, without curls or waves, not feathered, but bushy.

The shoulder is well laid against the chest and the blade well laid back and angulated. Lower arm
powerful and straight, forelegs straight, with no weak pasterns. The hindquarters are powerful and well
angulated with a low placed hock. The feet should be round and rather big with toes that are well
developed and arched, the Stabyhoun should have thick pads

Temperament
The Stabyhoun has a nice temperament, friendly, peaceful, patient, and willing to please. A
characteristic of the stabyhoun is tolerance toward children and other animals. The Stabyhoun should be
obedient and devoted to its owner, making it easy to train, these dogs should never be viscious or snappy.

The breed needs excercise and is not for the lazy owner, although it can be very laid back in the home
environment, it still needs plenty of activity. Due to its strong retrieving instinct, is very happy to spend
the whole day playing fetch with its owner.

The Working Stabyhoun
The Stabyhoun is both a retriever and a pointer. It works very well on water, being able to withstand the
coldest of rivers and lakes, and is easily controlled over greater distances. It brings in any game alive
and undamaged. When catching moles and other vermin these animals are killed through breaking the
neck, but the furs remain undamaged. It is a very powerful dog and larger ones are used to pull sleds in
the winter.

These dogs have high levels of energy and endurance because of their history as a gundog, people have
recognised this and the Stabyhoun is now used in almost all imaginable forms of training and activity:
agility, obedience, hunting, triathlon, endurance, frisbee and others.

Health
The average life expectancy is 13-14 years.

The stabyhoun is a healthy dog. In the past the breed had some problems, but careful breeding expelled
most problems. Epileptics occurred in the past, but the inheritable form has luckily not been diagnosed
for a long time.

Care
The stabyhoun does not need any special care apart from proper brushing. All you have to do is keep
tangles out. The dogs moult (shed) usually twice a year, and thorough brushing helps the dog to finish its
moult in about two weeks. Washing should be avoided when possible, because it affects the natural
sleekness of the coat. The coat by its nature will lose dirt very quickly. After a swim the dog is usually
quite clean and dry in a couple of hours.

Breeding
As the stabyhoun population is so small, careful breeding is very important. The association has breed
advisors and the official opinion of the club is to keep inbreeding very limited. More specifically: not
over 10%. Although in the last 10 to 15 years dogs have gone abroad, there is no population elsewhere
to fall back on. The dogs are sold relatively cheaply in the Netherlands, especially because most
breeders see them as a national heritage. This makes them breed out of love rather than out of other
motives. The average number of puppies in a litter is 7, and the bitches are not allowed to have more
than 5 litters in their lifetime.

The bitch has to be over 18 months and no older than 9 years of age, at least one year should elapse in
between litters, the hips have to be x-rayed (not over FCI-C result), and the combination has to be
approved by the breeding committee. Sometimes wrong colours may be passed on, which is to be
avoided. The association keeps very careful track of these matters. The studs have to be 18 months of
age, with the same show and hip results as the bitches, and they are not allowed to give over 20 litters in
their lifetime. It is preferred to have no more then 3 litters out of a male a year, so on the breeders' days
the litters can be checked and notes can be taken as of the traits that the males (and females) may or may
not inherit. Stud-owners are expected to appear on these breeders' days. It is expected the breeders will
promote the breeders' days towards those who have bought puppies in the past year, so that as many as
possible will visit these days.

History
The stabyhoun is a gundog of which descriptions were found as early as 1800. In earlier days it was used
for hunting, foxes, small game and bird, it also turned out to be a fine mole catcher. During the hunting
season it was used as an all-round gundog, an occupation it keeps to this day, although British and
German breeds are more popular. It is a fine pointer, an excellent tracker and also a good watchdog. It
has also been used as a draught dog.

The dog used to be owned by farmers who were in general poor it was very welcome to have such an all
rounder, because often only one dog could be afforded. As a versatile breed, Stabyhouns have been used
through out ages as a guard and watch dog for the farms, but before all it is a hunting dog.

The breeds looks and purpose have not changed for decades, although in earlier days the breed was often
mixed with another Friesian breed: the Wetterhoun, because only working capacities were counted. In
1942 the breed was officially acknowledged and since then crossbreeding between the two has stopped.

Today it enjoys a moderate, though very devoted fancy among Dutch sportsmen and homeowners and
its numbers are increasing slowly but steadily. It has yet to gain any significant fancy outside of the
Netherlands.

                             Notes



The Staffordshire Bull Terrier is an old time breed of dog, originally bred for bull-baiting, lion
fighting, and eventually dog fighting. They originated in the "Black Country" of England. The
Staffordshire Bull Terrier evolved out of a "Proto-Stafford" that was originally bred for the
aforementioned sports. At the time that they were being developed there were no written standards for
their physical composition. Dogs proven in the pit were bred with others of like skill and ability and over
time the Staffie was produced. In the early part of the 20th century they gained respectablity and were
accepted into the Kennel Club of England as the Staffordshire Bull Terrier - not to be confused with the
White Bull Terrier. The Staffordshire Bull Terrier is an English breed of dog and should not be confused
with their larger cousin the American Staffordshire Terrier or the American Pit Bull Terrrier.

The Staffie is a breed that has many supporters and perhaps just as many detractors. Descendant from a
line of terriers bred to tussle with bulls prior to the beast’s slaughter (hence bull terrier) this plucky
breed, though no longer used for such tough endeavours, still displays those fearless and determined
qualities.

Often held responsible for many of the unpleasant attacks reported on humans and other animals, the
Stafford can polarise public opinion. When spoken of, people will generally fall into one of two camps,
those strongly for the breed and those strongly against. Staffie owners will talk of how, when exercising
their dog in the park, other dog owners will scream at them to put their dog back on the leash, or of
people literally crossing the road so as to avoid walking past their pooch.

But visit that family at home and you’re likely to be met by a boisterous though very affectionate human-
orientated dog who is happy to see you, loves nothing more than playing with the kids and will roll over
if given the slightest opportunity for a tummy rub. Owners and visitors should be careful when coming
home to these dogs because, males esspecially, are known to urinate in the excitment of company.

In cases of reported attacks, there is often little distinction made between the bull terrier breeds, such as
the American Staffordshire Terrier, the Pit-Bull Terrier, the Bull Terrier and the Stafford. Perhaps
because of its comparative high numbers and poor recognition by the public, the Staffie wears much of
the blame for reported attacks that may have been perpetrated by any member of the bull terrier breeds.
Appearance




                            Red Male

Lovingly referred to as a "keg on legs", the Staffordshire Bull Terrier is a stocky, muscular dog that
exudes character, strength and athletic ability. Their expressive countenances indicate their mood and
intelligence. They have a broad head, defined occipital muscles, a relatively short foreface, defined stop
and rose or half prick ears and a dark round eye and a wide mouth with a clean scissor-like bite. The
cheek muscles are usually pronounced and give the impression of strength. Their lips show no looseness.
The head tapers down to a strong well muscled neck and shoulders placed on squarely spaced forelimbs.
They are a square dog built of squares. Their feet are neat and tight and with frequent excercise. Their
nails should need little to no trimming. Their rib cage is well sprung and is topped by a level top line.
They are tucked up in their loins, and the last rib of their cage should be visible. Their tail is carried like
an old fashioned pump handle. It is rat-like in compostion - not too long or too short. Their hind quarters
are well muscled and are the drive in the Staffie's gait, being well let down in the hock. They should
look like a train coming and going.

They may be coloured black, brindle, red, blue(rare), white or any blending of these colours with white.
White with any colour over an eye is known as piebald or pied'. Liver-coloured and black and tan dogs
sometimes occur but these are considered an unacceptable colour for the showring or any reputable
breeding program. The coat is uniformly smooth and never trimmed.

The dogs stand 35-40cm (14-16in) at the withers and weigh 13-20kg (24-38lbs) with bitches on the
lighter side and male dogs on the heavier side.

Temperament
Terrier breeds are generally bold and inquisitive (to the point of often ignoring their owner’s calls) and
fearless though friendly towards humans, often getting on better with humans than other animals. There
is no doubt that Staffies are the safest and friendliest of the bull terrier breeds. However, there are still
those individuals who can be aggressive towards other animals and sometimes to people. It is important
that any breeder can satisfy you that the puppy you are interested in, and its parents, have a stable
temperament. Males in particular can be very dominant. Bitches are less domineering and both desexed
males and females can be more placid.

Puppies should be regularly exposed to the full gamut of situations that they are likely to encounter as
older dogs. Regular, supervised contact with other dogs, children and any other family pet, along with
early obedience training will help ensure that the dog grows into a well socialised animal. Obedience
training is imperative to ensure that the owner feels they will have control over their dog in any
situation. A Staffie well versed in the commands ‘sit’ and ‘stay’ is an animal that knows its place and
can be confidently managed.

Staffies are regularly the fourth most popular breed in Australia, behind German Shepherds, Labrador
Retrievers and Golden Retrievers, according to the numbers of puppies bred each year. A proportion of
any dog breed will show aggression towards humans and other animals and unfortunately those more
popular breeds can attract the notice of less than scrupulous individuals who are out to make a quick
buck. They will have little regard for producing puppies with good temperament and health and can
unfortunately increase the proportion of unstable dogs within a breed. The German Shepherd Dog
League of N.S.W recognised this very problem in its breed and has set up a tough accreditation program
for its breeders. There isn't such a program amongst Staffie owners, however there are very good
breeders who are mindful of producing dogs with stable temperaments.

Whilst its origins are "blood sport" related, the Staffie is renowned for its reliability as a family dog.
They are extremely lovable dogs, being loyal and devoted to man, with special emphasis on their
reliability with children. They absolutely love children and are devoted to them and their owners. The
breed thrives in the family environment, being a suitably compact size for close family living. Being
short coated they require nominal grooming, and are very low maintenance. They are protective of their
family, especially those with small children, and it is for this reason that they make and excellent family
guardian and watch dog.

Notwithstanding the above, it must be understood that the Staffordshire Bull Terrier in most instances
will "fight" when challenged by another dog and should be adequately controlled in public places.
Staffordshire Bull Terrier owners have a certain obligation to Society, and should always ensure that
their dogs are correctly and adequately housed and not allowed to roam freely in public and in the
vicinity of unfamiliar dogs. It is always good advice to avoid allowing your Staffie to make eye to eye
contact with strange dogs, as this is normally seen as a challenge. Having said that, if they are socialised
from an early age and properly trained, owners can let their dogs roam at off-leash dog parks with
confidence. Staffies seem to rather enjoy the company of other Staffies and certain larger breeds such as
Boxers.

History
In the mid-1800s, the Bull and Terrier split into two branches one being the pure white Bull Terrier and
seventy years later the coloured dogs were recognized as the Staffordshire Bull Terrier.

Mixes of all kinds were bred to fight animals, such as bulls, bears, badgers, lions, rats and even
monkeys. These early "proto-staffords" provided the ancestral foundation stock for the Staffordshire
Bull Terrrier, the American Pit Bull Terrier and the American Staffordshire Terrier. These blood sports
were not only for entertainment as they were an opportunity for a breeder to test his breeding stock.
These early breeders were not breeding for the visual specimen of the breed today. They were breeding
for an elusive and hard to define characteristic known as "gameness". The pitting of dog against beast
tested the will, strength and skill of the dog. Those that excelled at these sports were selectively bred for
these characteristics. The eventual elimintion of these bloodsports occurred in the mid 19th century as
Britain began to recognize the need for reform in animal welfare laws. These breeders turned to pitting
their dogs one against another in an effort to continue to test the gameness of their stock. Surprisingly
the dogfighting was not in the initial animal welfare reform laws and continued. Dog fighting met its
demise and only clandestinely took place in pockets of working class Britain. Many will be surprised to
realize that it is this very nefarious history that has produced the breed temperament of the beloved
Staffie today.

Kennel Club Recognition

The breed attained UK Kennel Club recognition on 25 May 1935. Much of the groundwork to attain this
status can be attributed to Joseph Dunn and Joe Mallan. Dunn and Mallan invited friends to a staffie
fanciers meeting at the Cross Guns Hotel, Cradley Heath, South Staffordshire (a hotel owned and
managed by Mallan). About fifty breeders met at the hotel and formed the Original Staffordshire Bull
Terrier Club. The name was shortly changed to Staffordshire Bull Terrier Club due to the Bull Terrier
Club objecting the use of the word 'original'. Staffies were imported into the US during this time. Since
that time the breed has grown to be one of the most popular breeds of dogs with a large repressentation
at the Crufts Dog Show.

In the US many were imported by pit fighters and used in their breeding programs. Many were imported
by British nationals who brought their dogs with them or US expatriates who fell in love with the breed
in England and brought it home to the US. Eventually through the campaign of many people the Staffie
was recognized in the US in 1976. He has a loyal following.

The Standard Schnauzer is the original breed of the three sizes of Schnauzer, although it is sometimes
classified as a terrier. The breed is a handsome, robust, squarely built, medium-sized dog with
aristocratic bearing, making it a popular subject of painters Albrecht Dürer and Rembrandt.

Appearance
The Standard Schnauzer has a harsh, wiry outer coat with minimal shedding that is salt and pepper or
solid black in color. Ideal weight and height ranges vary considerably from one breed club standard to
the next. Males range between 18 and 20 inches (45cm-50cm) high at the withers and generally weigh
between 35 and 50 pounds (15.5 kg-22.5 kg). Females are ideally between 17 and 19 inches (42.5 cm-
47.5 cm) high at the withers and generally weigh between 30 and 45 pounds (13.5kg-20.2kg).


Temperament
The Standard Schnauzer is sociable, alert, a comedian, a formidable guard, and a family companion.
Properly raised and trained, they are reliable companions with their own family's children. They are
usually not unnecessary barkers. They are noted for guarding the family home and for displaying
devotion to their immediate family. They learn fairly easily and have been used as retrievers both on
land and in the water.

Health
The Standard Schnauzer in general is a very healthy breed with a relatively long life span from 14 to 16
years.

History
The breed originated in the Middle Ages in southern Germany and adjoining regions of Switzerland and
France. Its ancestry might have included the Spitz and various other guard dogs. The Schnauzer's
original uses included catching vermin —such as rats—and guarding.

The Swedish Vallhund is a breed of dog. It is believed that the Swedish Vallhund (SV) goes back to the
age of Vikings, more than 1000 years ago. Back then they were known as the "Viking dog". The SV was
bred to herd cattle, catch vermin (such as rats), and guard the house. It is often referred to as "the little
cattle dog of the Vikings".

The Welsh Corgi is believed to be descended from the SV. However, by 1942, the SV itself was almost
extinct, until Mr. Björn von Rosen and Mr. Karl-Gustaf Zettersten (both from Sweden) began looking
for dogs to keep the breed alive. As a result of their work, in 1948 the Swedish Kennel Club recognized
the breed and the SV was given the name "Vallhund", which meant "herding dog". The breed is still
quite rare.

The SV is a powerful, fearless, watchful, energetic, alert, intelligent, friendly, and healthy small dog
who has a tendency to bark. It is suitable for many kinds of activities, including herding and dog agility.

The Teddy Roosevelt Terrier is a dog breed. It is a terrier formerly known as a Type B or Short
Legged Rat Terrier.

When the types were separated, the new breed was named in honor of US President Theodore Roosevelt
as it is believed that he owned this type of ratting terrier.

Appearance
The Teddy Roosevelt Terrier is a sturdy dog in the preferred length-to-height ratio of 10:7 or 10:8. It
comes in a variety of colours and markings but must have some white; a solid white dog is acceptable.
Merles and any solid coloured coat other than white are disqualified. A square or long-legged dog is
disqualified. The dog has a broad wedge-shaped head, v-shaped ears button or erect, slightly oval feet,
and a docked tail is preferred. A scissor bite is preferred but a level bite is acceptable.

The breed standard specifies that the dog is to be evaluated as a working terrier and hence ‘honorable
scars’ (those received in the field) are not to be penalized.
The Teddy Roosevelt Terrier was recognized by the United Kennel Club on January 1, 1999.

                             Notes



The Tenterfield Terrier is a small, lightweight terrier akin to Miniature Fox Terriers, and Rat Terriers.
The Tenterfield Terrier has English origins but, like dog breeds such as the Miniature Fox Terrier, the
Australian Terrier, the Silky Terrier, and the Australian Cattle Dog, was developed uniquely in Australia.




                  Tenterfield Terrier

Appearance
The Tenterfield Terrier is a balanced, square terrier with a short, fine coat. The coat is predominantly
white with markings in black, tan, liver or brindle. The preference is for a docked tail, but naturally short
tails or bobtails are known to occur.
History

Breed Origin

As is so often the case, the origins of the breed are somewhat obscure. It is generally believed that
smaller puppies from the litters of Fox Terriers were crossed with the progeny of other small breeds.
Certainly, by the late 1800s a dog type known as the Little or Miniature Fox Terrier (known colloquially
as ‘Mini Foxies’) was well established in rural Australia. By the 1920s the dog was a fixture in urban
households as well.

The name ‘Tenterfield’ is sometimes incorrectly stated to denote the terrier’s place of origin as
Tenterfield, New South Wales. Rather, Tenterfield is one of many Australian towns and villages in
which small dogs of this type were known to exist. The town of Tenterfield is significant in Australian
history, and the best-known owner of its saddlery was a man named George Woolnough, who was
immortalized by his grandson, entertainer Peter Allen, as the “Tenterfield Saddler”. Mr. Woolnough
owned a number of small terrier-type dogs; however, photographs of these dogs are not readily
available. The name Tenterfield Terrier was suggested in the 1990s by Don Burke, a television
personality of the era, and was adopted during the renaming of one of the then-Miniature Fox Terrier
clubs.

Breed Development

In 1991 a group of enthusiasts from the state of South Australia formed the autonomous Miniature Fox
Terrier Club of South Australia, separate to the Miniature Fox Terrier Club of Australia, which had been
operating in New South Wales for some time. In 1992 they met with owners from other states to discuss
the future of the Clubs. At that time, it became evident that there were some differences as to the
preferred type of dog that would represent the Miniature Fox Terrier breed. Further, challenges to the
name “Miniature Fox Terrier” were being mounted, and threatened to preclude recognition by an All-
Breed club, which was a priority among some breeders. In 1993 fanciers from South Australia and other
states formed the Tenterfield Terrier Club of Australia. The breed standard of the Tenterfield Terrier
differs in substance from that of the Miniature Fox Terrier, and although they are sometimes confused,
the two dogs have been developing along divergent lines for over twenty years and are now separate
breeds.

The tireless efforts of Tenterfield Terrier owners were rewarded in 2002 when the Tenterfield Terrier
was recognized by the Australian National Kennel Council (ANKC) and placed in Group 2, Terriers.

The Tenterfield Terrier Today

As of 2004, the Tenterfield Terrier is a breed under development. There is still variation in the types of
dog seen in the show ring from state to state. These differences are small and of little interest to the
average dog owner. For breeders and fanciers, however, foot shape, ear shape, colour, and other
conformation points have the capacity to change the future look of a breed, and are of the utmost
importance. Like the breeders of all other dogs, Tenterfield Terrier breeders work to improve their
breeding lines and to assure standardization of type.

The Thai Bangkaew Dog is an Asian dog breed. It is a medium-sized Spitz-type dog.


Appearance
The Thai Bangkaew Dog is compactly built and square in profile. It is well proportioned, with a smooth
gait. The double coat consists of a short undercoat, with longer guard hairs growing through it forming
the outer coat. The coat is thicker and longer around the neck, chest, and back forming a lion-like ruff,
which is more noticeable on dogs than on bitches. The plumed tail is carried with moderate upward
curve over the back. The TBD comes in white with shades of red, gray, brown, and black in a wide
variety of patterns.

Temperament
Thai Bangkaew Dogs are alert and watchful, protective of home and family. Bangkaew are devoted to
their masters but can be aloof with strangers. Agile and active, they are strong swimmers and voracious
diggers. They are highly intelligent but can be stubborn and benefit from training. Positive
reinforcement methods work best with this breed.
History
Bangkaew is a village located in the Bang Rakam District, Phitsanulok Province in the central region of
Thailand. In this district, near the Yom River, there is a monastery called Wat Bangkaew where it is
believed that Thai Bangkaew Dogs originated.

Legend has it that the third abbot of Wat Bangkaew Temple, the respected Luang Puh Maak Metharee,
was known for mercy and care given to all living things. An old Bangkaew villager named Tah Nim
gave the abbot a large native bitch with long black fur. Because she was pregnant, her mating may have
been to a jackal or dhole; the resulting litter produced longhaired puppies of black and dark brown
coloration. Luang Puh Maak Metharee raised the resulting puppies, four females.

However it happened, it is believed that the abbot's dogs mated with herding dogs belonging to the Song
people of the neighbouring village of Huay Chan. Local residents of the houseboats along the Yom
River took these dogs as their pets.

Seasonal rain produced flooding, a natural barrier that excluded other dogs from contributing to the gene
pool. The inbreedings that took place led to the creation of the purebred Thai Bangkaew Dogs. From
then on the breed has been selectively bred and has become one of the most favored varieties of Thai
dogs.

The Thai Ridgeback is a rare breed of dog. The breed was formerly unknown outside of Thailand, but
is gaining notice in the western world. Very small numbers of the Thai Ridgeback exist in the U.S. The
Thai Ridgeback is one of only three breeds that has a ridge of hair that runs along its back in the
opposite direction to the rest of the coat. They are also known as a TRD, Mah Thai, or Mah Thai Lang
Ahn.

Appearance
The Thai Ridgeback is a muscular, medium-sized pariah-type dog with a wedge-shaped head, triangular-
shaped prick ears, and a short, smooth coat. It has a pronounced ridge on its back from behind the
withers to the hips. Thai Ridgebacks have muscular thighs and a streamlined body, making them an
extremely agile. The tail is carried vertically or curved like a sickle. Its forehead wrinkles with enormous
expression. The tongue can be black or have black marks. Eyes are dark and almond-shaped. The ears
are set low and point slightly outward, and are never cropped. The back is straight and level. The coat is
short, hard, and straight and can be solid colors of blue, black, red, or fawn. The Thai Ridgeback is a
clean breed who sheds very little. Shoulder height should be 22-24 inches (56-61 cm) in males and 20-
22 inches (51-56 cm) in females. The weight should be 19-24 kilograms (42-53 pounds) in males, and
17-22 kilograms (37-48 pounds) in females.
History
The origin of the Thai Ridgeback is unknown, but the breed was developed in eastern Thailand. The
history of the breed is the subject of numerous theories. It is generally considered a Pariah-type dating
back to ancient times. The Thai Ridgeback may have mutated from another Thai dog of similar
appearance but with no ridged back. Thai Ridgebacks were originally used for hunting and guarding.
Descriptions of the breed can be found in written references dating back to the 17th century. The Thai
Ridgeback was used for hunting and as a guard dog. The relationship between the Thai Ridgeback and
the Rhodesian Ridgeback is uncertain and there is no scientific proof that they are related. The breed is
still very rare outside of Thailand.

Temperament
Thai Ridgebacks are an intelligent and obedient breed. Due to isolation and lack of human contact, the
Thai Ridgeback remains an independent and largely undomesticated breed. They are naturally protective
of their home and family and can be aggressive with other dogs. They have a strong hunting instinct.

Health
Like many large dogs, the Thai Ridgeback may be prone to hip dysplasia. They are also prone to
dermoid sinus cysts.

Tibetan Spaniels are a breed of small, highly intelligent dogs originating in the Himalayan mountains
of Tibet. This breed is not a true Spaniel; its breeding and role differs quite a bit (Spaniels are gun dogs.)
Tibbies, as they are often called, make excellent housepets for all people, including families with small
children.

General Appearance
Should be small, active and alert. The outline should give a well balanced appearance, slightly longer in
body than the height at withers.Size Height about 10 inches. Body slightly longer from the point of
shoulder to root of tail than the height at withers. Weight 9-15 pounds being ideal.

Temperament
Joyful and assertive, highly intelligent, aloof with strangers

History
Small monastery dogs, thought to be early representatives of the Tibetan Spaniel, loyally trailed behind
their Lama masters and came to be regarded as "little Lions", thus giving them great value and prestige.
The practice of sending the dogs as gifts to the palaces of China and other Buddhist countries grew
significantly, and in reciprocity more "lion dogs" were presented back to Tibet, continuing until as late
as 1908. Through exchange of Tibetan Spaniels between palaces and monasteries, the breed is likely to
have common ancestors with a number of the Oriental breeds, including the Havanese Chin and the
Pekingese.

Village-bred Tibetan Spaniels varied greatly in size and type, and the smaller puppies were usually
given as gifts to the monasteries. In turn, these smaller dogs used in the monastery breeding programs
were probably combined with the more elegant Tibetan Spaniel-type dogs brought from China. Those
bred closer to the Chinese borders were characterized by shorter muzzles,

Not only was the Tibetan Spaniel prized as a pet and companion, it was considered a very useful animal
by all classes of Tibetans. During the day, the dogs would sit on top of the monastery walls keeping a
steady watch over the countryside below. Their keen eye and ability to see great distances, as well as
their persistent barking, made them exceptionally good watchdogs.

The first authenticated reference we find to Tibetan Spaniels in this country is a litter born out of two
imported dogs from a Tibetan monastery in 1965. In January 1971, the Tibetan Spaniel Club of America
was formed with 14 charter members. After a period in the Miscellaneous classes, the Tibetan Spaniel
was accepted for AKC registration and became eligible to compete as a Non-Sporting breed effective
January 1, 1984.

                            Notes



The Tosa is breed of dog of Japanese origin that is considered rare.


Appearance
The Tosa varies considerably in size, with the Japanese-bred dogs tend to be about half the size of those
bred outside the country. The Japanese breed generally weighs between 66 and 88 lb (30 to 40 kg),
while the non-Japanese breeders have focused on dogs that weight from 197 to 200 lb (89.5 to 90.5 kg)
and stnd 24.5 to 25.5 (62 to 65 cm) inches at the withers.[1]
The coat is characterized by its short and smooth appearance and is often red, brindle, or fawn.
Occasionally it can be a dull black, but this is somewhat rare. Maintenance of the coat is usually
minimal.

Temperament
Befitting of its origins as a fighting dog, the Tosa Inu is not a dog for the novice owner. It is driven not
only to scrap with other dogs, but also with cats, as well as with other small animals. It is also one of the
largest breeds and can be extremely difficult to control except by the strongest of both body and will.

History
This breed originated in the second half of the nineteenth century. The breed started from the native
Shikoku-Inu, an indigenous dog weighing about 25 kilograms and standing about 55 centimetres high,
which closely resembles the European Spitz. These dogs were crossed with European dog breeds, such
as the Bulldog in 1872, Mastiff in 1874, St. Bernard, German Pointer in 1876, Great Dane in 1924, and
the Bull Terrier[2]. The aim was to breed a larger, more powerful fighting dog. The heyday of Tosa
breeding was between 1924 and 1933, when it was said that there were more than 5,000 Tosa breeders
in Japan.

Sumo wrestling

In Japan this breed is also called Sumo Dog. Sumo fighters are Japanese wrestlers who engage in a very
unusual style of wrestling that is already over 1,500 years old. The objective of sumo wrestling is always
to stay on your feet despite your opponent's attacks and not to allow your opponent to pin you to the
floor or drive you from the ring.

This sumo wrestling is also the basis for the traditional Japanese dog fight. The Tosa is thus a "wrestling
dog", and the fights are carried out according to sumo rules. The winner is the dog that presses its
opponent to the ground with its body, knocks it off its feet, and holds it to the ground. Biting and
growling dogs are disqualified and are banned from further competition.

Tosa who were successful in the sumo fight received a valuable, beautifully decorated cloth apron with
the crowning touch of an elaborately braided, thick hemp rope. What was demanded was not the wild
fighter, the mauler, but the physically strong dog, courage paired with skill, patience and stamina.

For Europeans it is hard to comprehend how it is possible to transform a dog breed into a wrestler. This
entails going against the dog's natural instincts, against every normal fighting technique of a dog. It
seems a likely supposition that dogs that were unsuitable for such fights were used in "normal" dog
fights.
There have been few specimens in Europe so far and only initial attempts at breeding. Despite its
claimed history, there remains the suspicion that these dogs as a rule also would rather bite than wrestle.

The Toy Bulldog, also known as the Miniature Bulldog, is a breed of small Bulldog that averaged 8
pounds in weight. Many of them were pushed out of Britain during the mid to late 19th century, seen as
a threat to the English Bulldog breed. In France, they were bred with the English Bulldog to produce the
French Bulldog. Efforts are now underway to reinvent this breed, as it slowly disappeared during the
early part of the 20th century.

                        Notes
The Toy Fox Terrier is a small terrier breed of dog, directly descended from the larger Fox Terrier but
considered a separate breed.

Temperament
The Toy Fox Terrier is an intelligent, bold and athletic little dog. Although lithe, it is hardy and well
balanced. Toy Fox Terriers are said to love human company. A related breed is the Miniature Fox
Terrier, which was developed along similar lines in Australia.

Toy Fox Terriers, like many active and intelligent breeds, can learn to respond to many words. Toy Fox
Terriers were used commonly in circus shows by clowns so they make great companions for owners
with a good sense of humor.

History
Some Toy Fox Terrier breeders can trace their dogs’ lineage back to a Smooth Fox Terrier called
"Foiler", the first fox terrier registered by the Kennel Club in Britain, circa 1875-76. It is believed that
careful breeding from smaller Smooth Fox Terriers with outcrosses to other toy breeds such as
Manchester Terrier and Chihuahua resulted in the Toy Fox Terrier of today. Toy Fox Terriers are also
called American Toy Terriers or Amertoys.

Toy Fox Terriers were recognized by the United Kennel Club (UKC) in 1936 and placed in the Terrier
Group, and by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in July 2000 (Toy Group).

                            Notes



The Toy Mi-Ki is a rare breed of toy dog. It is still a developing breed, and there is controversy over
what a "real" Toy Mi-Ki is, what it looks like, and so on. As with many controversial breeds, this issue
might or might not ever be resolved; for example, see the continuing controversy over the Jack Russell
Terrier and related varieties or breeds.


Appearance

The Toy Mi-Ki stands about 10 inches at the withers.

Whether the Mi-Ki has one coat type or two varies with the different groups. One states that the Original
Mi-Ki standard has only one coat type, long, straight silky hair with little to no shedding.

Another group states that the Mi-Ki comes in two coat varieties. The long-coated variety does not shed.
Any hair that comes out of the dog is retained by the long coat. It is suggested that a fine toothed "wire
hound comb" be used to remove the dead hair. The short-coated Mi-Ki does shed but moderately.
Neither coat type is prefered over the other. Both coat types are shown in the same ring together; they
are not separated into varieties. The Mi-Ki comes in all colors.

There are two ear types, the folded ear and the prick ear, which meams that the ear stands streight up.
Both types of ears are acceptable in the breed standard. When the Mi-Ki becomes excited, his ears
"wing", meaning that the folded ear can becoming erect, "winging" out to the side of the dog's head,
giving the appearance that the dog is flying.

The eyes are large, dark, and expressive. Mi-Kis are smaller than the average house cat, and are easily
trained to a cat litter box.

Temperament
It is a small, devoted companion, who is outgoing, fun loving, and intelligent.

History

In North America, at least two breeders began working with the Mi-Ki in 1991 and 1992. The Imperial
Toy Mi-Ki Club started in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1991, and a different breeder, started stud books for
the breed from a different line of Mi-Kis in 1992. The Greater American Toy Mi-Ki Club started around
this time, and in 1994 was incorporated in the state of Wisconsin. That club is no longer active, but a
new club, The Mi-Ki Club of America, was immediately formed. The Mi-Ki Club of America claims to
have received recognition for the dogs in their stud books in 17 countries around the world. The first
Multi-International Mi-Ki Champion was exported to Germany in 2004 and was the first Mi-Ki to be
registered there. The Imperial Toy Mi-Ki Club is also still active.

Various clubs have formed, with different ideas about the breed's status, appearance, and requirements.
Some breeders, still viewing the Mi-Ki as a type rather than a breed because there is not sufficient
breeding stock to work from and insufficient generations of breeding-true lines, have added additional
breeds to the Mi-Ki, including the Yorkshire Terrier and the Shih Tzu, among others. Their dogs have
not been accepted by the Mi-Ki Club of America as purebred Mi-Kis, which believes that the breed is
pure and is working to establish multiple generations of Mi-Ki-only breedings.

The Mi-Ki is not currently recognized by any of the major international kennel clubs.


Miscellaneous
Some Mi-Ki dogs are being used as therapy dogs.

                                 Tricolor Treeing Walker Coonhound

The Treeing Walker Coonhound is a breed of dog descended from the English Foxhound. The breed
began when a stolen dog of unknown origin, known as "Tennessee Lead", was crossed into the Walker
Hound in the 1800s. Thomas Walker had imported the English Foxhound to Virginia in 1742.

Numerous types of walker hounds exist, with the Treeing Walker being the most prominent. They are
excellent hunting dogs, very capable in the art of treeing game. They are known to sometimes virtually
climb the tree to get at their prey. Normally, they are trained to bay the breed's melodic and distinctive
howl, informing their hunters that the prey has been treed.

Appearance
They stand between 20 and 27 inches at the withers, weighing between 50 and 70 pounds. They come in
both bicolor and tricolor coats. They are extremely powerful, especially throughout the shoulder region,
and have large ears compared to head size. Their legs and straight and lean, yet well muscled.

Temperament




                                 This Coonhound is baying, which is a charicteristic of the breed

Treeing Walker Coonhounds are good with children and get along well with other dogs. They are
generally easy to train with little trouble, IF you can get their nose off the trail! They are primarily
known as working and hunting dogs, but also make excellent pets if well exercised. They tend to be
somewhat high-strung, but are also eager to please, loving, intelligent and confident. They are extremely
fast and agile, and are known to have a one track mind. Their characteristic bay is unique and somewhat
melodic

                            Notes



The Utonagan is a dog breed-under-development that strongly resembles a wolf. Until recently they
were thought to contain a percentage of wolf (Canis Lupus) but, on investigation by the Department for
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (UK), have been found to contain only three breeds of domestic
dog: Alaskan Malamute, German Shepherd, and Siberian Husky. Selective breeding of the wolf dog
began in the early 1990s

Appearance
The Utonagan is large and well-muscled but with a slender build so as to resemble a wolf as closely as
possible.

Adult males weigh around 70-110 lbs and stand 25"-33" to the shoulder. Females are approximately
20lb lighter at between 55-90 lbs and stand 24"-26" to the shoulder.

The breed has a thick double coat that appears quite different in winter and summer. The guard hair is
straight and slightly coarse to the touch. The pelage can be silver grey, cream, or brown with black
overlay and a characteristic wolf mask. It also comes in all white and all black.
Temperament
Utonagans are very placid and respond incredibly well to training (due to their German Shepherd
ancestors), which should begin at an early age.

Health
Utonagans should be fed on a BARF Diet and have only necessary vaccinations. They do not eat as
much as many other large breeds but are prone to obesity and bloating if overfed.

Utonagans need constant attention to remain in good health, so owners who will be unavailable for long
periods of time should rethink this breed as an option. They have thick coats that keep them warm in
cool conditions but they have great difficulty staying cool in summer. This becomes a problem when
walking the dog during hot weather, so owners must be careful not to overexercise the dog and to keep
available when playing.

Utonagans live between 12 and 15 years.

History
The breed was initially known as the Northern Inuit but, because it had no relationship to the Canadian
Inuit Dog, the name was changed to Utonagan.


Miscellaneous

Breed status and development

The development of the Utonagan is hampered by crossbreeding and backyard breeding. The British and
International Untonagan Society believes it now has a dog that breeds true. The BUIS insists that their
registered breeders screen breeding stock for genetic disorders. Adult dogs must be evalutated after 12
months of age to be certified fit for breeding. The Utonagan Society have recently introduced very
strong breeding rules, and refuse to breed from dogs with genetic disorders.

Containment

Utonagan should be kept in a house that has a large yard with plenty of cool, clean water. Like their
Siberian Husky ancestors, Utonagan may try to escape if the oppourtunity presents itself. The
surrounding fence should be at least 3 times the height of the dog and should curve inwards at the top.
The fence should be buried at least a foot below the ground unless it has concrete foundations as
Utonagan are good diggers. If the fence is weak it should be reinforced to prevent damage.

Wolf hybrids

DEFRA express their concern over people who believe they have a wolf hybrid. Dogs with wolf in them
are illegal as pets in the UK and owners without a Dangerous Animals Licence leave themselves open to
prosecution. Utonagans are not wolf hybrids; they are dogs that resemble wolves. (See also Novelty pet.)

                            Notes



A Volpino Italiano is a white breed of dog of the spitz family.


History
Spitz types were found throughout the ancient world. Specimens from this group have been found
preserved in European peat bogs which anthropologists trace to 4000 BC. The remains—with curly tails,
foxy heads, and small erect ears—have been found dating back over 5,000 years. These little pets wore
decorative ivory bracelets and collars. Engravings of similar dogs were found in Greece, and these have
been determined to date to about 400 BC.

The Volpino has been known and loved by Italian royalty for centuries, being a special favorite of the
ladies. Although bearing a strong resemblance to the Pomeranian, the breed is much older and thus has a
different background. The northern dogs found their way south very early in the history of domesticated
dogs. The Italian word for wolf is lupo, and the Keeshond is called both Lupino and Volpino in Italian,
so Volpino may be an old term for wolfdog or wolf spitz. Despite his long history, the Volpino is
unknown outside of Italy and is now quite rare even in his homeland.

The Weimaraner is a silver-grey breed of dog developed originally both for tracking large game, such
as bears, and as a gun dog. The name comes from the Grand Duke of Weimar, Charles August, whose
court enjoyed hunting.

Appearance




                  A sketch of a Weimaraner

This breed's short, smooth grey coat and its usually grey eyes give it a regal appearance different from
any other breed. There is a long-haired variety that is not as commonly known. The colour is rare in
dogs and is the result of breeding for a recessive gene. It has also lent the breed the nickname 'silver
ghost' or 'gray ghost'. The coat is extremely low maintenance; it is short and smooth to the touch.

Typically, the male Weimaraner stands between 25 and 27 inches (63-68 cm) at the withers. Females are
generally between 23 and 25 inches (58-63 cm). The breed is not heavy for its height, and weighs
upwards of 70 pounds (32 kg). Traditionally, the Weimaraner's tail is docked at birth to a third of its
natural length.

Temperament
Weimaraners are fast and powerful dogs, but are also suitable home animals given appropriate training.
From adolescence, a Weimaraner requires extensive exercise in keeping with an energetic hunting dog.
No walk is too far, and they will appreciate games and play in addition. An active owner is more likely
to provide the vigorous exercising, games, or running that this breed needs. Weimaraners are high-strung
and easily excitable, requiring appropriate training to learn how to calm them and to help them learn to
control their behavior. Owners need patience, as this breed is particularly rambunctious during the first
year and a half of its life. Like many breeds, untrained and unconfined young dogs often create their
own diversions when left alone, such as chewing house quarters and furniture.

Professional training
Professional training is beneficial, particularly for less-experienced owners. This includes behaviours
towards other family pets. Depending upon training they can be quite aggressive towards other dogs, but
they are a loyal, playful and affectionate pet and an alert and friendly member of the family. Visitors are
likely to be licked rather than warned away, but the Weimaraner does not miss a trick and is always
aware of its surroundings. Prospective owners should note that the Weimaraner is not recommended for
families with young children as it is usually boisterous, sometimes hyperactive. Furthermore, the breed
will continually try to push the boundaries set by its owner. If it can get away with something, it will!
This is also a breed with tremendous personality.

History




                                   William Wegman's Dressup Batty

Today's breed standards developed in the 1800s, although the Weimaraner has existed since at least the
1600s in a similar form. It is believed that Continental pointing breeds and mastiffs were its ancestors.
The breed was created strictly for the nobility. The aim was to create a noble-looking, reliable gundog.
As ownership was restricted, the breed was highly prized and lived with the family. This was unusual, as
during this period, hunting dogs were kept in kennels in packs. This has resulted in a dog that needs to
be near humans and that quickly deteriorates when kennelled.

Originally, Germany was possessive of its skilled all-purpose gundog, but released a pair in the 1950s to
America where the breed quickly became popular. Although slower than many other gundogs, such as
Pointers, the Weimaraner is thorough and this made it a welcome addition to the sportsman's household.
Furthermore, its happy, lively temperament endeared it to families, although it is perhaps too lively for
families with young children. Unfortunately, with the rise in popularity, some careless matches were
made and some inferior specimens were produced. Since then, both in Britain and America (where the
breed remains popular) breeders have taken care to breed for quality and purpose.

Two occurrences in the breed's history have helped its popularity. One is US President Dwight D.
Eisenhower owning a Weimaraner, Heidi; the other is the photographs of William Wegman. His dogs
(which include Man Ray—named after artist Man Ray—and Fay Ray—a play on Fay Wray) are the
subject of his photos, dressed in human clothes. These pictures are popular both in galleries of
contemporary art and as pop culture icons. These "dogs with hands" have appeared frequently on
Sesame Street, and occasionally on Saturday Night Live.

The Welsh Springer Spaniel is a breed of dog and a member of the spaniel family.


Appearance
The build of the Welsh Springer Spaniel should be slightly off square, meaning that the length of the dog
should be slightly greater than the height at the withers. However, some dogs may be square, and this is
not penalised in the show ring as long as the height is never greater than the length. The tail is generally
docked and the dew claws are usually removed.

Eyes should be brown in colour; yellow eyes do sometimes occur but are not acceptable for the show
ring. Ears are pendulous and lightly feathered. Nostrils are well developed and are black or any shade of
brown; a pink nose is to be severely penalized in the show ring. A scissors bite is preferred.

     ●   Height at withers:
                Dog: 18-19 inches (46 to 48 cm
                Bitch: 17-18 inches (43 to 46 cm)

     ●   Weight:
               35 to 45 lb (16 to 20 kg)

The coat is naturally straight, flat, and soft to the touch, it should never wiry or wavy. It is weatherproof
and gives protection from all kinds of thorn and brush. The back of the legs, chest, and underside of the
body are feathered, and the ears and tail are lightly feathered. The only color is rich red and white. Any
pattern is acceptable and any white area may be flecked with red ticking.

Temperament
The Welsh Springer Spaniel is an active, loyal, and affectionate breed. It can be reserved with strangers,
but is not timid, shy, or unfriendly. The breed is well known for being affectionate to all members of the
family, especially children, and accepting other pets of the household with a friendly, playful attitude.

The breed is a quick learner but is sometimes known to be deaf to commands, especially if there is
something more interesting in the environment. With correct training, they can become very obedient
dogs.

The Welsh Springer was bred for work and endurance, and as such needs plenty of vigorous excercise to
keep healthy and content. Without adequate excercise, a dog may become bored and design its own
(usually destructive) means of keeping busy, often to its owner's displeasure.

Health
The Welsh Springer is generally a healthy breed but some can suffer hip dysplasia. The average lifespan
is approximately 12 to 13 years.

History
The Welsh Springer Spaniel was originally called the Welsh Spaniel, but was also known as the Welsh
Cocker. It was recognised by The Kennel Club, after the breed had gained popularity, in 1902 under the
name Welsh Springer Spaniel. Until then it was shown alongside the English Springer Spaniel. It had
been transported to America in the late 1800s and gained recognition by the American Kennel Club in
1906

Some experts believe that the Welsh Springer Spaniel and the Brittany Spaniel share the same ancestry.

The Welsh Terrier is a breed of dog, one of many terrier breeds. It is suited for hunting fox, birds, and
badgers and for being kept as a pet. The Welsh Terrier originates from Wales and has existed since the
1800s. Its origins lie in the Old English Black and Tan terrier that existed in England as early as the 13th
century. It also existed in Wales and it was that sort that finally was registered by The Kennel Club
under the name Welsh Terrier. Until 1900, it was called the "Old English Terrier" or "Black and Tan
Rough Haired Terrier". The breed has been recognised since 1886 and is more common than the
Airedale Terrier or the Fox Terrier.


Appearance
This breed is coloured black and tan. They can grow up to 39cm (15 in.) with a weight of 9 kg (20 lb).

The fur contains two layers, an undercoat that insulates and an abrasive fur on top that protects against
dirt, rain, and wind. The colour is red-brown with black marks. White is allowed only as small marks on
the front of the breast.

Temperament




The Welsh Terrier is a consummate terrier—a terrier in a nutshell—with a typical terrier temper. It is not
recommended as a first dog in general, beceause it demands an owner who is steady and knowledgeable.
In the right hands, it is a happy, lively, and seldom shy or timid dog. Dogs of this breed can be devoted
and obedient friends and can function either as city dogs or as country dogs. Some Welshies exhibit a
typical hunting instinct. A Welsh Terrier does not demand lots of physical exercise, but it hardly ever
becomes tired and is a true comrade for the one who likes open-air activities. It is active and intrepid and
not eager to fight, although it will hold its own when necessary. The Welshie needs a lot of intellectual
stimulation to stay agreeable. A small yard to walk all day long, without any other activities, is not
enough. These dogs need interesting things to do each day.

Welsh Terriers get along well with children; they love to play and to follow a child as it plays. These
terriers love playing with children, but sometimes the child gets tired before the dog, so adult
supervision is required to prevent misunderstandings.

Care
This breed is a so-called trimming breed; it has abrasive hair that has to be trimmed—not cut! However,
it does not shed its fur as many other dog breeds do. This dog does not need constant bathing. The fur
must be trimmed about every third month. A complete trimming takes three to four hours and the
breeder should give tip about where the dog can get trimmed by a professional (in the correct way so
that the fur is not destroyed).

Health
The body of the Welsh Terrier is normal and healthy so that the physique is durable and lasting. There
are no known defects related to the breed. A healthy Welsh Terrier lives about 15 years on average and
stays active and alert up to a high age if it is well taken care of and healthy.

The Wilkinson Bulldog is a breed of dog.


Appearance
The breed is fit, healthy, and athletic. It weighs between 50 and 75 pounds, standing 17 to 19 inches at
the withers(about the size of a small Boxer). It is larger than the standard Bulldog and more muscular.

It retains the form of its forebearers, the fighting bulldogs,hence the alternate name Original English
Bulldog. It is more similar to the old Bulldog than to the standard breed or to any old-bulldog recreation.

History
Lolly Wilkinson of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada has been breeding a strain of Bulldogs
for many years that is similiar to, but not to be confused with, the Old English Bulldog.

These dogs originate from those taken to Canada from a pair brought in 1946 by Lolly Wilkinson's
grandfather. The type has been preserved by aspiring to functional and historical correctness rather than
fashion and Kennel Club standards.

This breed is not currently recognized by any major Kennel Club; however, it does seem to be gaining
popularity. Whether people accept the fact that this is the real thing is debatable. It may become more
popular in the future.

Temperament
This breed is not unfriendly towards other animals like the Pit Bull Terrier and it maintains a gentle
disposition. Still, it retains the tenacity of its ancestors and has a powerful "bite".

Health
The Wilkinsons claim that, despite inbreeding among a few dogs, the breed does not have serious health
problems.

The Šarplaninac (Шарпланинац) (pronounced "shar-pla-NEE-natz") (Macedonian:Šarplaninec ) is a
medium-sized shepherd dog breed of the Balkan region.


Appearance
The "Sar" stands 22 to 24 inches (56-61 cm) in height and weighs 77 to 99 pounds (35-45 kg). In colour
it is tan, iron grey, white or black. The coat is dense and medium in length; it can be rough or smooth.

Temperament
The temperament of the breed is described as independent, aloof with outsiders, and calm until a threat
to the flock presents itself, when suddenly the Šar erupts into swift ferocity. The breed has a highly
protective nature.

History
The name comes from the Šar mountain range (Šar Planina) spanning at the border of Macedonia,
Serbia and Montenegro where he is typically found accompanying and guarding the great sheep flocks
as they graze.

Working Life

The breed can also work cattle and serve as a guard dog; it was bred and used as a military dog under
Marshal Josip Broz Tito and is still used so by the Army of Serbia and Montenegro. The Šarplaninac is
spreading through ranches in North America as a serious sheep herding dog and a livestock guardian.
Predator problems are said to be greatly diminished once a Šar takes responsibility for a flock;
Šarplaninac is one of rare dog breeds which can win a fight with a wolf or a bear.

Canine coronavirus is a virus of the family Coronaviridae that causes a highly contagious intestinal
disease in dogs. The virus invades and replicates in the villi of the small intestine. Symptoms include
diarrhea, vomiting, and anorexia, but most cases are very mild or without symptoms. The disease is
spread through the feces of infected dogs, who shed the virus for more than two weeks following
infection. The incubation period is only one to three days. Diagnosis is through detection of virus
particles in the feces. Treatment usually only requires medication for diarrhea, but more severely
affected dogs may require intravenous fluids for dehydration. Fatalities are rare. The virus is destroyed
by most available disinfectants. There is a vaccine available, and it is usually given to puppies, who are
more susceptible to canine coronavirus, and dogs that have a high risk of exposure, such as show dogs.

A more serious complication of canine coronavirus occurs when the dog is also infected with canine
parvovirus. Coronavirus infection of the intestinal villi makes the cells more susceptible to parvovirus
infection. This causes a much more severe disease than either virus separately can.

Canine herpesvirus (CHV) is a virus of the family Herpesviridae which most importantly causes a
fatal hemorrhagic disease in puppies less than two to three weeks old. The incubation period is three to
six days. Symptoms include crying, weakness, depression, discharge from the nose, soft, yellow feces,
and a loss of the sucking reflex. Bruising of the belly may also occur. There is a high mortality rate, and
death usually occurs in one to two days.

In puppies three to five weeks old, the disease is less severe. More puppies survive, but they can develop
a latent infection. Some later get neurologic disease and have symptoms like difficulty walking and
blindness.

In adult dogs, the virus infects the reproductive tract, which allows it to be sexually transmitted or
passed to puppies during birth. The disease can cause abortion, stillbirths, and infertility. It is also an
infrequent cause of kennel cough.

Like other types of herpesvirus, previously infected dogs can from time to time release the virus in
vaginal secretions, penile secretions, and discharge from the nose. Raised sores in the vagina or on the
penis may be seen during these times. Spread of the disease is controlled by not breeding dogs known to
have it. Serology can show what dogs have been exposed (although not all of them will be releasing the
virus at that time). Bitches who have a negative serology for CHV should be isolated from other dogs
from three weeks before to three weeks after giving birth. Bitches that have lost puppies to the disease
may have future litters that survive due to transfer of antibodies in the milk.

Diagnosis of the disease in puppies is best accomplished by autopsy. Findings include hemorrhages in
the kidneys, liver, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract. Treatment of affected puppies is difficult, although
injecting antibodies to CHV into the abdomen may help some to survive. There is no vaccine for CHV.

Canine transmissible venereal tumor, also called transmissible venereal tumor (TVT), Sticker
tumor and infectious sarcoma is a tumor of the dog and other canids that mainly affects the external
genitalia. In male dogs, the tumor affects the penis or prepuce. In females, it affects the vagina or labia.
Rarely, the mouth or nose are affected. The tumor often has a cauliflowerlike appearance. The disease is
spread when dogs mate. The tumor does not often metastasize. Biopsy is necessary for diagnosis.
Chemotherapy is very effective for this type of tumor, but surgery often leads to recurrence. The
prognosis for complete remission is excellent. Canine TVT was initially described by Russian
veterinarian Novinsky in 1876, when he demonstrated that the tumor could be transplanted from one dog
to another by infecting them with tumor cells.

Tumor cells have fewer chromosomes than normal cells. Dog cells normally have 78 chromosomes;
tumor cells contain 57 - 64 chromosomes.

Cerebellar hypoplasia is a disorder found in cats and dogs in which the cerebellum is not completely
mature at birth.

Usually symptoms of cerebellar hypoplasia can be seen immediately at birth in cats, but sometimes can
take two months or so to become apparent in dogs. Cerebellar hypoplasia causes jerky movements,
tremors and generally uncoordinated motion. The animal often falls down and has trouble walking.
Tremors increase when the animal is excited and subside when at ease. There are several bacterial
infections, such as herpes, or viral such as feline panleukopenia, that can result in the disorder in both
cats and dogs. However, the disease can also be caused by malnutrition, poisoning, injury or general
accidents during development in the fetus. The disease does not get better or worse with age, but the cat
or dog can usually learn to somewhat compensate for it. Most afflicted animals can lead a fairly normal
life if special considerations for the animal's disability are taken by the pet's owner.

Congenital vertebral anomalies are a collection of malformations of the spine in animals. Most are not
clinically significant, but they can cause compression of the spinal cord by deforming the vertebral canal
or causing instability. This condition occurs in the womb. Congenital vertebral anomalies include
alterations of the shape and number of vertebrae.

Hemivertebrae
Among the congenital vertebral anomalies, hemivertebrae are the most likely to cause neurologic
problems. They are wedge shaped vertebrae, and therefore can cause an angle in the spine (such as
kyphosis, scoliosis, and lordosis). The probable cause of hemivertebrae is a lack of blood supply causing
part of the vertebrae to not form. Hemivertebrae in dogs are most common in the tail, causing a screw
shape, but can also occur in the thoracic vertebrae. Affected dog breeds include French and English
Bulldogs, Pugs, and Boston Terriers. It is inherited in Yorkshire Terriers and German Shorthaired
Pointers. The condition can cause death in very young Bulldog puppies.


Block vertebrae
Block vertebrae occur when there is improper segmentation of the vertebrae, leading to parts of or the
entire vertebrae being fused. It can lead to an angle in the spine, but there are usually no symptoms. The
sacrum is a normal block vertebrae.

Butterfly vertebrae
Butterfly vertebrae have a cleft through the body of the vertebrae and a funnel shape to the ends. This
gives the appearance of a butterfly on an x-ray. It is caused by persistence of the notochord (which
usually only remains as the center of the intervertebral disk) during vertebrae formation. There are
usually no symptoms. Butterfly vertebrae occur most often in Bulldogs, Pugs, and Boston Terriers.

Transitional vertebrae
Transitional vertebrae have the characteristics of two types of vertebrae. The condition usually involves
the vertebral arch or transverse processes. It occurs at the cervicothoracic, thoracolumbar, or
lumbosacral junction. For instance, the transverse process of the last cervical vertebrae may resemble a
rib. A transitional vertebrae at the lumbosacral junction can cause arthritis, disk changes, or spinal cord
compression.

Craniomandibular osteopathy is a developmental disease in dogs causing extensive bony changes in
the mandible and skull. It usually occurs between the ages of 3 and 8 months. Breeds most commonly
affected include the West Highland White Terrier, Scottish Terrier, Cairn Terrier, and Boston Terrier.
Symptoms include firm swelling of the jaw, drooling, pain, and difficulty eating. It is an inherited
disease, especially in Westies, but canine distemper has also been indicated as a possible cause. Growth
of lesions will usually stop around the age of one year, and then shrink. If the disease is extensive,
especially around the tympanic bulla (middle ear), then the prognosis is guarded.

                                              Dog Years
                                                                                  Back | Home | Up | Next


Dog years refer to a popular myth that household pets—specifically dogs and cats—age seven years for
each human year. For example, a dog of age 9 would be said to be "63 in dog years".

In technical terms, this is not correct: Most household pets do not age in any linear correspondence with
human aging. Dogs and cats age much more quickly in their early life than in their later life relative to
humans. For example, the human equivalent of a one-year-old cat or dog is actually between about 10
and 15 years—a one-year-old dog or cat has generally reached its full growth and is sexually mature,
although it might still be lanky and need to fill in a more mature musculature, similar to human
teenagers. The second year is equivalent to about another 3 to 8 years in terms of physical and mental
                                                                                   [1]
maturity, and each year thereafter is equivalent to only about 4 or 5 human years.

However, even that rough guideline varies immensely from breed to breed. For example, giant dog
breeds might suffer from arthritis and heart disease by the age of 7 or 8, while some small terrier breeds
might live 20 years. According to the UC Davis Book of Dogs, small-breed dogs (such as small terriers)
become geriatric at about 11 years; medium-breed dogs (such as larger spaniels) at 10 years; large-breed
dogs (such as German Shepherd Dogs) at 8 years; and giant-breed dogs (such as Great Danes) at 7 years.
[2]
      Conversely, giant breeds mature mentally and physically more slowly than small breeds.

With the advent of computerized data collection for breeds and for veterinarians, it has become possible
to establish reliable records for average and typical life expectancies of animals. British life expectancy
data show that mixed-breed dogs have a life expectancy of 13.2 years; some breeds, including the
Bernese Mountain Dog, Bulldog, and Irish Wolfhound, have median life expectancies of only around 7
years, while the median is over 14 years for some small dogs, including Whippetss, Miniature Poodles,
                                                                        [3]
Miniature Dachshunds, Bedlington Terriers, and Jack Russell Terriers.

Ear mites are mites that live in the ears of animals.

Contagion
The problem is very contagious, and can be transmitted from even brief physical contact with other
animals. Very rarely, Humans can also be affected.

Consequences of infection
This is often a problem in pets such as cats and ferrets, as they cause inflammatory symptoms, like
bacterial and yeast infections. Other, more serious problems can result from untreated infections, such as
skin disease, deafness, and seizures.

Elbow dysplasia is a condition involving multiple developmental abnormalities of the elbow-joint. It is
a common condition of certain breeds of dogs. Most developmental elbow abnormalities are related to
osteochondrosis (OCD), which is a disease of the joint cartilage. Osteochondrosis (or osteochondritis)
dissecans refers to separation of a flap of cartilage on the joint surface.

Causes
In OCD, the normal change of cartilage to bone in the development of the joint fails or is delayed. The
cartilage continues to grow and may split or become necrotic. The cause is uncertain, but possibly
includes genetics, trauma, and nutrition (including excessive calcium and decreased Vitamin C intake).

The disease
OCD lesions are found in the elbow at the medial epicondyle of the humerus. Specific conditions related
to OCD include fragmentation of the medial coronoid process of the ulna (FMCP) and an ununited
anconeal process of the ulna (UAP). All types of OCD of the elbow are most typically found in large
breed dogs, with symptoms starting between the ages of 4 to 8 months. Males are affected twice as often
as females. The disease often affects both elbows, and symptoms include intermittent lameness.
Osteoarthritis will develop later in most cases.

Diagnosis is through x-rays. In cases with significant lameness, surgery is the best option, especially
with UAP. However, conservative treatment is often enough for cases of FMCP and OCD of the medial
humeral epicondyle. The dogs are exercised regularly and given pain medication, and between the ages
of 12 to 18 months the lameness will often improve or disappear. Control of body weight is important in
all cases of elbow dysplasia, and prevention of quick growth spurts in puppies may help to prevent the
disease.

Commonly affected breeds
For UAP:

    ●   German Shepherd Dog
    ●   Labrador Retriever
    ●   Basset Hound
    ●   French Bulldog
    ●   Great Dane
    ●   Bull Mastiff
    ●   Great Pyrenees
    ●   Irish Wolfhound
    ●   Weimaraner
    ●   Newfoundland

For OCD of the medial humeral epicondyle:

    ●   Labrador Retriever
    ●   German Shorthaired Pointer

A combination of FMCP, UAP, and OCD of the medial humeral epicondyle is seen in the Bernese
Mountain Dog. This is known as elbow incongruity, and it may be caused by abnormal development of
the trochlear notch of the ulna.

In animal fancy and animal husbandry, entire indicates that an animal has not been desexed, i.e. spayed
(female) or neutered (male).

Animals are desexed for selective breeding purposes. Males may also be neutered in order to make them
more tractable. A specialized vocabulary has arisen for neutered animals of given species, see more at
castration.

Except where a desexed pet is desirable, entire animals usually fetch much higher prices than castrated
ones.

                                    Hordeum murinum, a common source of foxtails in many areas

Foxtails are spikelets or spikelet clusters of grasses (some of which are themselves called foxtails) that
can become a health hazard for long-haired dogs and other domestic animals, and a nuisance for people.
Foxtails are also called "speargrass".

Source
The name "foxtail" is applied to a number of grasses that have bushy spikes of spikelets that resemble
the tail of a fox. Not all of these are hazardous; most of the hazardous ones, in the genus Hordeum, are
also called "wild barley".

Other grasses also produce hazardous spikelets. The spikelets are sometimes called foxtails, even though
the grasses are not.
Structure
All foxtails have a hardened tip, sometimes called a "callus", and retrorse barbs, pointing away from the
tip of the callus. Wild barleys have clusters of three spikelets, and the callus is the portion of the rachis
to which they attach. In other grasses, such as needlegrass and brome grasses, the foxtail consists of a
single spikelet, with the callus being the hardened lemma tip. Retrorse barbs can be found on the callus,
the lemmas, and the awns.

Mode of Action
The spikelets or spikelet clusters of foxtails are adapted for animal dispersal: The foxtails disarticulate
easily, the barbs cause the foxtail to cling to fur, and movement of the animal causes the foxtail to
burrow into the fur, since the barbs permit it to move only in the direction of the callus. In wild
mammals that inhabit the native ranges of foxtail grasses, the fur is ordinarily short enough that the
foxtails will eventually become dislodged, dispersing the seed.




                                                        The spike of Hordeum murinum disarticulates into
clusters of three spikelets

Especially in the long-haired dogs and other domestic animals, the foxtails can become irreversibly
lodged. Foxtails can also enter the nostrils and ear canals of many mammals. In all these cases, the
foxtail can physically enter the body.

Muscular movements (or air flow, in the case of nostrils) can cause the foxtails to continue to burrow
through soft tissues and organs, causing infection and physical disruption, which in some cases can
result in death.

Foxtails can also work through clothing, particularly fabric shoes and socks, causing discomfort to
people while walking.
                                                         Each spikelet cluster is held together by a portion
of the rachis

microscope




                                                                  The rachis segment, sometimes called a
"callus", is hardened, and covered with retrorse barbs

                                           Retrorse barbs and trichomes on lemma.

Prevention

Control
Many wild barley species are weeds of disturbed habitats, and their growth is encouraged by foot traffic
of humans and domestic animals. Control consists of restricting traffic to established paths, and
eradication of wild barley by mechanical removal or herbicide.

Some other foxtail-producing grasses, especially needlegrasses, are dominant species in stable grassland
habitats. Control attempts in these cases can actually be conterproductive, creating disturbed habitats
where wild barleys may thrive.

Avoidance

Foxtails are a problem beginning when the grass inflorescences begin to disarticulate, and ending when
the spikelets or spikelet clusters are mechanically abraded or incorporated into the soil, turf, or leaf litter.
In some habitats, this can be a matter of weeks, but in others it may require months, especially if
different species flower and fruit at different times during the season. Nevertheless, restricting dogs at
these times from areas known to have foxtails is very effective.

Removal

Combing of fur removes foxtails along with burrs and other detritus, but potentially the most dangerous
foxtails are found in areas easily missed: the axillae, between the toes, and in nostrils and ear canals. The
first two should be routinely examined in long-haired dogs. In the latter two cases, dogs may exhibit
symptomatic behavior, such as sneezing or pawing.

Treatment
Foxtails that have progressed no further than surface lesions are ordinarily removed and the lesion
treated with antiseptic and bandaged if necessary. Once a foxtail has passed beneath the skin, dogs are
often treated with systemic antibiotics, and the foxtail either allowed to encyst and degrade, or in the
case of actual or imminent organ damage, removed surgically (surgical removal can be problematic,
since foxtails cannot easily be imaged by x-ray or ultrasound).

Foxtails imbedded in the nostrils can migrate into the nasal turbinates, causing intense distress, and in
rare cases into the brain. Foxtails in the ear canal can puncture the eardrum and enter the middle ear,
causing hearing loss. In both cases, detection and early removal is the best treatment.

Folklore
Because foxtails "burrow" through fur, soft tissues, and organs, some people think of them as parasites.
Although they may be technically "alive", containing viable grass seeds, foxtails are equally dangerous
dead, since their burrowing is purely mechanical, in response to movements of the affected animal.

                                                                                          Home | Up | Next


Heart valve dysplasia is a congenital heart defect which in dogs and cats affects the aortic, pulmonary,
mitral, and tricuspid heart valves. Pulmonary valve stenosis and aortic valve stenosis are discussed
separately. Dysplasia of the mitral and tricuspid valves can cause leakage of blood or stenosis.

Dysplasia of the mitral and tricuspid valves - also known as the atrioventricular (AV) valves - can
appear as thickened, shortened, or notched valves. The chordae tendinae can be fused or thickened. The
papillary muscles can be enlarged or atrophied. The cause is unknown, but genetics play a big role. Dogs
and cats with tricuspid valve dysplasia often also have an open foramen ovale, an atrial septal defect, or
inflammation of the right atrial epicardium. In dogs, tricuspid valve dysplasia can be similar to Ebstein's
anomaly in humans.

Mitral valve stenosis is one of the most common congenital heart defects in cats. In dogs, it is most
commonly found in Great Danes, German Shepherd Dogs, Bull Terriers, Golden Retrievers,
Newfoundlands, and Mastiffs. Tricuspid valve dysplasia is most common in the Old English Sheepdog,
German Shepherd Dog, Weimaraner, Labrador Retriever, and Great Pyrenees.

The disease and symptoms are similar to progression of valve disease in older dogs. Valve leakage leads
to heart enlargement, arrhythmias, and congestive heart failure. Heart valve dysplasia can be tolerated
for years or progress to heart failure in the first year of life. Diagnosis is with an echocardiogram. There
is a poor prognosis with significant heart enlargement.

Heartworm is a parasitic roundworm (Dirofilaria immitis) that is spread from host to host through the
bites of mosquitoes. The heartworm affects dogs, cats, wolves, coyotes, foxes, and some other animals,
such as ferrets, sea lions, and even humans. The parasitic worm is called a "heartworm" because the
parasite, in the final reproductive stage of its life cycle, resides in the heart of its host where it can stay
for many years, until it kills its host through congestive failure of the heart.

History of the disease
Heartworm was first discovered in dogs over a century ago and documented in cats by the 1920s. Since
then, diagnostic tests and treatments for heartworm as well as preventative measures have been
developed. Heartworm infestation may be extremely serious for the infected host; infected dogs that go
untreated can die and even treated dogs must go through a long period of uncomfortable treatment
(sometimes requiring surgery) to kill the worms and remove them from the body. The best defense
against heartworm is the use of prophylactic treatment given regularly during the mosquito season.

A course of heartworm prevention begins with a blood test to see if the parasite is present. If the dog is
parasite free, a prophylactic medication can be used to prevent heartworm infection. A positive test
result, on the other hand, usually requires treatment to eradicate the worms.

Heartworm in North America

Although at one time confined to more southern climates, heartworm has now spread to nearly all
climates where its vector, the mosquito, occurs (a vector is an intermediate host for the developing
parasite, that spreads the disease from host to host). Transmission of the parasite from dog to dog occurs
in all of the United States (except Alaska) and the warmer regions of Canada. The highest infection rates
in North America occur in dogs within 150 miles of the Atlantic and Gulf coasts and along the
Mississippi River and its major tributaries. However, high rates of infections are found in any area with
large mosquito populations.

The parasite
                                  Microfilaria

Heartworms go through several life stages before they become adults infesting the heart of the host
animal. The worms require the mosquito as an intermediate stage in order to complete their life cycle
and so at least two animal hosts other than the mosquito are required for the heartworm to reproduce. A
mosquitoe ingests heartworm larvae, called microfilariae, from an infected host. The mosquitoe then
transfers the larvae to another uninfected host when next it feeds. The microfilariae then go through
several changes to reach adult form, eventually traveling to the right side of the heart to reproduce.
Reproduction results in the dispersal of microfilariae into the bloodstream where ingestion by another
feeding mosquito spreads the microfilariae to another host.

At this stage, the host dog will likely be asymptomatic. Once the infestation reaches a certain
concentration in the lungs, the now adult worms migrate from the pulmonary artery to the right side of
the heart and begin to reproduce in ernest, filling the blood with microfilariae. At this point the host will
begin to show symptoms of infestation. These symptoms can manifest earlier or increase in severity
depending on the activity level of the animals as infestation reduces cardio-pulmonary capacity. Very
active animals may experience symptoms at lower heartworm concentrations and have more severe
symptoms than less active animals.

Heartworms can reach up to 12 inches in length and can remain in the host's heart for several years.

Course of infestation
The period between the initial infection when the dog is bitten by a mosquito and the maturation of the
worms into adults living in the heart takes some 6.5 to 7 months in dogs and is known as the prepatent
period.

Heartworms bear live young, known as microfilariae, producing thousands of them every day. The
microfilariae then circulate in the bloodstream for as long as two years, waiting for the next stage in their
life cycle in the gut of a bloodsucking mosquito. When ingested by a mosquito, the microfilariae
undergo a series of molts to the infective, or third, larval stage and then migrate to the head of the
mosquito, where they wait to infect another host. These changes can occur in as little as two weeks and
as long as six weeks, depending on the warmth of the climate, and generally cease entirely at ambient
temperatures below 14° Celsius (57° Farenheit).
After infection, the third stage larval heartworms deposited by the mosquito grow for a week or two and
molt to the fourth larval stage under the skin at the site of the mosquito bite. Then they migrate to the
muscles of the chest and abdomen and, some 45 to 60 days after infection, molt to the fifth stage
(immature adult). Between 75 and 120 days after infection these immature heartworms then enter the
bloodstream and are carried through the heart to lodge in the arteries of the lungs. Over the next 3 to 4
months they increase greatly in size, growing backwards until they fill the right atrium and ventricle of
the heart. By approximately 6.5 to 7 months after infection the adult worms have mated and the females
begin producing microfilariae.

Symptoms of infestation
Dogs show no indication of heartworm infestation during the 6 month long prepatent period prior to the
worms' maturation, and current diagnostic tests for the presence of microfilariae or antigens cannot
detect prepatent infections. Rarely, migrating heartworm larvae get "lost" and end up in unusual sites
such as the eye, brain, or an artery in the leg, which results in unusual symptoms such as blindness,
seizures and lameness.

Many dogs will show little or no sign of infection even after the heartworms have matured. To some
degree these dogs may be described as seeming to age slightly faster than normal as the worms slowly
damage the lungs, kidneys and liver. These animals usually have a light infection and live a fairly
sedentary lifestyle. However, active dogs and those with heavier infections will quickly show the classic
symptoms of heartworm disease. Early symptoms include a cough, especially on exercise, and early
exhaustion upon exercise. More advanced cases progress to severe weight loss, fainting, coughing up
blood, and, finally, congestive heart failure.

Epidemiology
Heartworm is present on every continent except Antarctica, where the mosquito vector is noticeably
absent. The presence of heartworm in a geographic region is dependent on the following factors:

    ●   susceptibility of host population
    ●   stability of the disease reservoir
    ●   population stability of vector species
    ●   proper climate conditions

Dogs are considered the definitive susceptible host for the parasite. Untreated dogs also provide a stable
disease reservoir. (Cats, on the other hand, are considered a resistant host and a poor disease reservoir.
However, cats are more difficult to treat and so prevention is even more critical with felines.)
Mosquitoes of several different species are the vectors. Development of the microfilariae in the
mosquito ideally requires a temperature at or above 80° Fahrenheit for about two weeks. No larval
development takes place in the mosquito below 57° F.
Testing
Heartworms can be detected by blood test. The filtration test finds microfilariae in the blood; the occult
tests (antigen and antibody) are used to detect adult worms. Many veterinarians prefer to do both tests,
since the absence of microfilariae in the blood does not necessarily mean that there are no adult worms
in the heart. Both tests are done with a single blood draw, preferably in the early spring before daily
temperatures warm above 57° F.

X-ray radiographs and, to a lesser extent, ultrasound can also detect the presence of adult heartworms in
the heart and lungs. X-rays also can provide a good estimate of the amount of lung damage caused by
the presence of heartworms.

Treatment
If either a blood test or the onset of symptoms betray the presence of heartworms, treatment is indicated.
Treatment is highly efficacious if the disease is diagnosed early in the disease process. Before the worms
can be treated, however, the dog must be evaluated for good heart, liver, and kidney function to ensure
the animal can survive the treatment. Any insufficiencies in these organs must be dealt with first, before
treatment, as the eradication process can be taxing on organ function. Usually the adult worms are killed
with an arsenic-based compound. The currently recommended compound, Melarsomine
dihydrochloride, is marketed under the brand name Immiticide. It has a greater efficacy and fewer side
effects than previous formulation (Thiacetarsamide sodium, sold as Caparsolate) which makes it a safer
alternative for dogs with late-stage infestations.

After treatment, the dog must rest (restricted exercise) for several weeks so as to give its body sufficient
time to absorb the dead worms without ill effect. Otherwise, when the dog is under exertion, dead
worms may break loose and travel to the lungs, potentially causing respiratory failure and death. Aspirin
can be used during this time to help prevent further arterial damage and thromboembolism.

The course of treatment is not completed until several weeks later when the microfilariae are dealt with
in a separate course of treatment. Once heartworm tests come back negative, the treatment is considered
a success.

Surgical removal of the adult heartworms is also a treatment that may be indicated, especially in
advanced cases with substantial heart involvement.

Long term monthly administration of ivermectin (but apparently not moxidectin, milbemycin or
selamectin) year round for at least three years at the dose normally used for heartworm prevention (see
"Prevention") also removes most adult heartworms from most dogs. However, this is not the treatment
of choice for removal of adult heartworms for two reasons. First, not all dogs are completely cleared of
heartworms by this treatment. More importantly, adult heartworms do not begin to die until some 18
months of treatment have elapsed, which is not acceptable under most circumstances. This treatment is
normally reserved for dogs that are not likely to tolerate treatment with the harsher, but more effective,
melarsomine or instances where the owner cannot afford the more expensive melarsomine treatment.

From time to time various "homeopathic," "natural" or "organic" products are touted as cures or
preventives for heartworm disease. However, such products have never been proven effective by
rigorous scientific methods, and the claims should be viewed with skepticism.

Prevention
Prevention of heartworm infection can be obtained through a number of veterinary drugs. Most popular
are ivermectin (sold under the brand name Heartgard), milbemycin (Interceptor) and moxidectin
(ProHeart) administered as pills or chewable tablets. These drugs are given monthly during the local
mosquito season. Moxidectin is also available in a six-month sustained release injection administered by
veterinarians, but the injectable form of Moxidectin was taken off the market in the United States due to
safety concerns. Selamectin (Revolution), on the other hand, is a topical preventive that is likewise
administered monthly. Some of these drugs also kill other parasites, including intestinal worms. In
addition, Selamectin controls fleas, ticks, and mites.

Preventative drugs are highly effective, and when regularly administered will protect more than 99
percent of dogs from infection. Most failures of protection result from irregular and infrequent
administration of the drug. However, the monthly preventives all have a reasonable margin for error in
their administration such that if a single month's dose is accidentally missed, adequate protection is
usually provided so long as the next two monthly doses are administered on schedule.

Cats may be treated with ivermectin (Heartgard for Cats), or the topical selamectin (Revolution for
Cats).

Monthly heartworm prevention should be administered beginning within a month of the onset of the
local mosquito season and continued for a month after the cessation of local mosquito activity. In warm
climates, such as the warm temperate climate along the immediate Gulf coast of the United States and in
tropical and subtropical regions, heartworm prevention must be administered year round. Some
authorities recommend year round administration even in colder climates on the theory that mosquito
activity may occur during the occasional unseasonable warm spell, but others argue that computer
models indicate heartworm transmission is highly unlikely under such circumstances.

Human health considerations
The dog heartworm is a negligible public health risk, because it is unusual for humans to become
infected. Additionally, human infections usually are of little or no consequence, although rarely an
infected human may show signs of respiratory disease. In most cases, however, the heartworm dies
shortly after arriving in the human lung, and a nodule, known as a granuloma, forms around the dead
worm as it is being killed and absorbed. If an infected person happens to have a chest X-ray at that time,
the granuloma may resemble lung cancer on the X-ray and require a biopsy to rule out the life
threatening condition. This may well be the most significant medical consequence of human infection by
the dog heartworm.

At one time it was thought that the dog heartworm infected the human eye, with most cases reported
from the southeastern United States. However, these cases are now known to be caused by a closely-
related parasite of raccoons, Dirofilaria tenuis. Several hundred cases of subcutaneous (under the skin)
infections in humans have been reported in Europe, but these are almost always caused by another
closely-related parasite, Dirofilaria repens, rather than the dog heartworm.

Hypertrophic osteodystrophy is a bone disease in rapidly growing large breed dogs. It usually occurs
between the ages of 3 and 4 months. Symptoms include swelling of the metaphysis (the part of the bone
adjacent to the joint), pain, depression, loss of appetite, and fever. The disease is usually bilateral in the
limb bones, especially the distal radius, ulna, and tibia. Possible causes include decreased Vitamin C
uptake, increased vitamin (other than C) and mineral uptake, and infection with canine distemper. Some
dogs recover within a few days, but some relapse. X-rays show a dark line at the metaphysis, which can
progress to new bone growth on the outside of that area. There is no specific treatment besides pain
medication. The best way to prevent hypertrophic osteodystrophy is to avoid feeding young puppies too
much.

Hypertrophic osteopathy is a bone disease secondary to disease in the lungs, usually cancer. This
condition occurs mainly in dogs and is rare in cats. Hypertrophic osteopathy is characterized by new
bone formation on the outside of the toe bones, which then extends proximally. Symptoms include
stiffness and warm, firm swelling of the legs, and signs of lung disease such as coughing and difficulty
breathing.

Hypertrophic osteopathy is caused by increased blood flow to the ends of the legs, overgrowth of
connective tissue, and then new bone formation surrounding the bones. This is secondary to nerve
stimulation by the lung disease. The condition may reverse if the lung mass is removed or if the vagus
nerve is cut on the affected side.

Infectious canine hepatitis is an acute liver infection in dogs caused by canine adenovirus type-1 (CAV-
1). The virus is spread in the feces, urine, blood, saliva, and nasal discharge of infected dogs. It is
contracted through the mouth or nose, where it replicates in the tonsils. The virus then infects the liver
and kidneys. The incubation period is 4 to 7 days.

Symptoms include fever, depression, loss of appetite, coughing, and a tender abdomen. Corneal edema
and signs of liver disease, such as jaundice, vomiting, and hepatic encephalopathy, may also occur.
Severe cases will develop bleeding disorders. Death can occur secondary to this or the liver disease.
However, most dogs recover after a brief illness.

Diagnosis is made by recognizing the combination of symptoms and abnormal blood tests that occur in
infectious canine hepatitis. A rising antibody titer to CAV-1 is also seen. The disease can be confused
with canine parvovirus because both will cause a low white blood cell count and bloody diarrhea in
young, unvaccinated dogs.

Treatment is for the symptoms. Most dogs recover spontaneously without treatment. Prevention is
through vaccination. Most combination vaccines for dogs contain a modified canine adenovirus type-2.
CAV-2 is one of the causes of respiratory infections in dogs, but it is similar enough to CAV-1 that
vaccine for one creates immunity for both. CAV-2 vaccine is much less likely to cause side effects than
CAV-1 vaccine.

CAV-1 is destroyed in the environment by steam cleaning and quaternary ammonium compounds.
Otherwise, the virus can survive in the environment for months in the right conditions. It can also be
released in the urine of a recovered dog for up to a year.

                               Legg-Calvé-Perthes Syndrome
                                                                                           Home | Up | Next


Legg-Calvé-Perthes syndrome is a degenerative disease of the hip joint, where a loss of bone mass
leads to some degree of collapse of the hip joint, that is, to deformity of the ball of the femur and the
surface of the hip socket. The disease is typically found in young children, though it also affects small
dogs.

It is the idiopathic avascular osteonecrosis of the capital femoral epiphysis of the femoral head. It is
caused by an interruption to the blood supply of the head of the femur close to the hip joint.

It is also known as Perthes disease, ischemic necrosis of the hip, coxa plana, osteochondritis and
avascular necrosis of the femoral head, or Legg-Perthes Disease or Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease (LCPD).

Cause
The direct cause is a reduction in blood flow to the joint, though what causes this is unknown. Genetics
does not appear to be a determining factor, though it may be involved. when the disease is genetic in
origin, it typically runs along the male line. Some evidence suggests that parental smoking may be a
factor, though this is not yet proven, or more recently that a deficiency of some blood factors used to
disperse blood clots may lead to blockages in the vessels supplying the joint.

Signs and symptoms
Symptoms are hip or groin pain, exacerbated by hip/leg movement. There is a reduced range of motion
at the hip joint and a painful gait. There may be atrophy of thigh muscles from disuse and an inequality
of leg length. In some cases, some activity can cause severe irritation or inflammation of the damaged
area including standing, walking, running, kneeling, or stooping repeatedly for an extended period of
time.

The first signs are complaints of soreness from the child, which are often dismissed as growing pains,
and limping or other guarding of the joint, particularly when tired. The pain is usually in the hip, though
can also be felt in the knee (so-called 'referred pain'). It is predominantly a disease of boys (around 4 in 5
cases), and is generally diagnosed between 5 and 12 years of age. Typically the disease is only seen in
one hip, though appearance in both hips is not uncommon (about 10-15% of cases).

Diagnosis
X-Rays of the hip joint are absolutely necessary. A bone scan may be useful in helping determine the
extent of the avascular changes. A hip aspiration may be performed if there is suspicion of a septic
arthritis.

Diagnosis is made predominantly by X-ray study, together with physical examination (MRIs have also
been found useful for judging the extent of the deformity). Sufferers typically have limited range of
motion in their hip, particularly when rotating the joint.

Treatment
The goal of treatment is to avoid severe degenerative arthritis.

Treatment involves bedrest to take weight off the joint. It may require traction, leg braces, a plaster cast
and physiotherapy. Surgery is only rarely necessary.

Orthopedic assessment is crucial. Younger children have a better prognosis than older children.

There are no drugs for treatment of Perthes. Analgesic medication should be given as necessary.

Treatment has traditionally centered on removing pressure from the joint until the disease has run its
course. Options have included bed rest and traction (to separate the femur from the pelvis and reduce
wear), often for several months or even years. Braces were also popular, again to isolate the joint.
Recent evidence suggests that these methods are not effective, and treatment seems to be moving
towards a mixture of careful monitoring, and surgical intervention when needed.

Perthes is a long-term problem - treatment is aimed at minimizing damage while the disease runs its
course, not at 'curing' the disease. As sufferers age problems in the knee and back can arise, as a result of
the abnormal posture and stride adopted to protect the affected joint. The condition is also linked to
arthritis of the hip and other joints, though this appears not to be an inevitable consequence. Hip
replacements are relatively common as the already damaged hip suffers routine wear; this varies by
individual, but generally is required any time after age 50.

Incidence
Perthes is a relatively unusual condition, with only 1 in 9,000 children being affected.

Caucasians are affected more frequently than other races, males are affected 4-5 times more often than
females and it is most commonly seen in persons aged 3-12 years, with a median of 7 years of age. In
the US, 1 in 1200 children younger than 15 years will have this disease.
Prognosis
Children that have been diagnosed with Perthes' Disease after the age of 10 are at a very high risk of
developing osteoarthritis.

Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease in dogs
This is also known as aseptic necrosis of the femoral head. Yorkshire Terriers, Pugs, Jack Russell
Terriers, and Dachshunds can be affected. Bilateral hip pain is usually seen by the age of 6 to 8 months.
X-rays confirm the diagnosis. The recommended treatment is surgical removal of the head of the femur.

Leptospirosis (also known as Weil's disease, canicola fever, canefield fever, nanukayami fever or 7-
day fever) is a bacterial zoonotic disease caused by spirochaetes of the genus Leptospira that affects
humans and a wide range of animals, including mammals, birds, amphibians, and reptiles. It was first
described by Adolph Weil in 1886 when he reported an "acute infectious disease with enlargement of
spleen, jaundice and nephritis". The pathogen, Leptospira-genus bacteria was isolated in 1907 from post
mortem renal tissue slice.

Though being recognised among the world's most common zoonosis, leptospirosis is a relatively rare
bacterial infection in humans. The infection is commonly transmitted to humans by allowing fresh water

Except for tropic areas, leptospirosis cases have a relatively distinct seasonality with most of them
occurring August through September (in the Northern

Causes
Leptospirosis is caused by a spirochaete bacterium called leptospira interrogans that has at least 4
different serovars of importance in the United States causing disease (icterohaemorrhagiae, canicola,
pomona, grippotyphosa). There are other (less common) infectious strains. It should be however noted
that genetically different leptospira organisms may be identical serologically and vice versa. Hence, an
argument exists on the basis of strain identification. The traditional serologic system is seemingfully
more useful from diagnostic and epidemiologic standpoint at the moment (which may change with
further development and spread of technologies like PCR).
Leptospirosis is transmitted by the urine of an infected animal, and is contagious as long as it is still
moist. Rats, raccoons, possums, voles, skunks, mice and even infected dogs may serve as hosts. Dogs
may lick the urine of an infected animal off the grass, or drink from an infected puddle. There have even
been reports of "house dogs" getting leptospirosis apparently from licking the urine of infected mice that
entered the house. There is a direct correlation between the amount of rainfall and the incidence of
leptospirosis.

Humans become infected through contact with water, food, or soil containing urine from these infected
animals. This may happen by swallowing contaminated food or water or through skin contact. The
disease is not known to be spread from person to person and cases of bacteria dissemination in
convalescence are extremely rare in humans. Leptospirosis is common among watersport enthusiasts in
certain areas as prolonged immersion in water is known to promote the entry of the bacteria.

Symptoms
In animals, the incubation period (time of exposure to first symptoms) is anywhere from 2 to 20 days.
One should strongly suspect leptospirosis and include it as part of a differential diagnosis if the whites of
the dog's eyes appear jaundiced (even slightly yellow), but the absence of jaundice does not rule out
leptospirosis, and its presence could indicate hepatitis or liver pathology other rather than leptospirosis.
Vomiting, failure to eat or drink, reduced urine output, unusually dark or brown urine, lethargy, and
other such symptoms are also indications of the disease.

In humans, leptospiral infection causes a wide range of symptoms, and some infected persons may have
no symptoms at all. Because of the wide range of symptoms the infection is often wrongly diagnosed.
This leads to a lower registered number of cases than there really are. Symptoms of leptospirosis include
high fever, severe headache, chills, muscle aches, and vomiting, and may include jaundice, red eyes,
abdominal pain, diarrhea, and/or a rash. The symptoms in humans appear after 4-14 day incubation
period.

Complications
Complications include meningitis, respiratory distress and renal interstitial tubular necrosis, which
results in renal failure and often liver failure (this severe form of the disease is known as Weil's
disease). Cardiovascular problems are also possible. Approximately 5-50% of severe leptospirosis cases
are fatal, however, such cases only constitute about 10% of all registered incidents.

The natural course of leptospirosis falls into 2 distinct phases, septicemic and immune. During a brief
period of 1-3 days between the 2 phases, the patient shows some improvement.

First stage: This stage is called the septicemic or leptospiremic stage because the organism may be
isolated from blood cultures, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and most tissues.
During this stage, which lasts about 4-7 days, the patient develops a nonspecific flulike illness of
varying severity.

It is characterized by fever, chills, weakness, and myalgias, primarily affecting the calves, back, and
abdomen.

Other symptoms are sore throat, cough, chest pain, hemoptysis, rash, frontal headache, photophobia,
mental confusion, and other symptoms of meningitis.

Because of the abrupt nature of the onset, the patient often can tell exactly when the symptoms started.

During the 1-3 day period of improvement that follows the first stage, the temperature curve drops and
the patient may become afebrile and relatively asymptomatic. The fever then recurs, indicating the onset
of the second stage when clinical or subclinical meningitis appears.

Second stage: This stage is called the immune or leptospiruric stage because circulating antibodies may
be detected or the organism may be isolated from urine; it may not be recoverable from blood or CSF.

This stage occurs as a consequence of the body's immunologic response to infection and lasts 0-30 days
or more.

Disease referable to specific organs is seen. These organs include the meninges, liver, eyes, and kidney.

Nonspecific symptoms, such as fever and myalgia, may be less severe than in the first stage and last a
few days to a few weeks.

Many patients (77%) experience headache that is intense and poorly controlled by analgesics; this often
heralds the onset of meningitis.

Anicteric disease: Aseptic meningitis is the most important clinical syndrome observed in the immune
anicteric stage.

• Meningeal symptoms develop in 50% of patients. Cranial nerve palsies, encephalitis, and changes in
consciousness are less common. Mild delirium also may be seen.

• Symptoms may be nonspecific, and a viral etiology may be suspected.

• Meningitis usually lasts a few days, but occasionally it can last 1-2 weeks.

• Death is extremely rare in the anicteric cases.
Icteric disease: Leptospires may be isolated from the blood for 24-48 hours after jaundice appears.
Abdominal pain with diarrhea or constipation (30%), hepatosplenomegaly, nausea, vomiting, and
anorexia also are seen.

Uveitis (2-10%) can develop early or late in the disease and has been reported to occur as late as 1 year
after initial illness. Iridocyclitis and chorioretinitis are other late complications that may persist for
years. These symptoms first manifest 3 weeks to 1 month after exposure. Subconjunctival hemorrhage is
the most common ocular complication of leptospirosis, occurring in as many as 92% of patients.
Leptospires may be present in the aqueous humor.

Renal symptoms such as azotemia, pyuria, hematuria, proteinuria, and oliguria are seen in 50% of
patients with leptospirosis. Leptospires may be present in the kidney.

Pulmonary manifestations occur in 20-70% of patients.

Adenopathy, rashes, and muscular pain also are seen.

Clinical syndromes are not specific to the serotype, although some manifestations may be seen more
commonly with some serotypes.

Often, the serovar helps determine some of the more characteristic clinical manifestations, but any
leptospiral serovar can lead to the signs and symptoms seen with this disease. For example, jaundice is
seen in 83% of patients with L icterohaemorrhagiae infection and in 30% of patients infected with L
pomona. A characteristic pretibial erythematous rash is seen in patients with L autumnalis infection.
Similarly, GI symptoms predominate in patients infected with L grippotyphosa. Aseptic meningitis
commonly occurs in those infected with L pomona or L canicola. Weil syndrome.

This severe form of leptospirosis primarily manifests as profound jaundice, renal dysfunction, hepatic
necrosis, pulmonary dysfunction, and hemorrhagic diathesis.

It occurs at the end of the first stage and peaks in the second stage, but the patient's condition can
deteriorate suddenly at any time. Often the transition between the stages is obscured.

o Fever may be marked during the second stage.

o Criteria to determine who will develop Weil disease are not well defined.

o Pulmonary manifestations include cough, dyspnea, chest pain, bloodstained sputum, hemoptysis, and
respiratory failure.

o Vascular and renal dysfunctions accompanied by jaundice develop 4-9 days after onset of disease, and
the jaundice may persist for weeks.

o Patients with severe jaundice are more likely to develop renal failure, hemorrhage, and cardiovascular
collapse. Hepatomegaly and tenderness in the right upper quadrant may be present.

o Oliguric or anuric acute tubular necrosis may occur during the second week due to hypovolemia and
decreased renal perfusion.

o Multi-organ failure, rhabdomyolysis, adult respiratory distress syndrome, hemolysis, splenomegaly
(20%), congestive heart failure, myocarditis, and pericarditis also may occur. o Weil syndrome carries a
mortality rate of 5-10%. The most severe cases of Weil syndrome, with hepatorenal involvement and
jaundice, carry a case-fatality rate of 20-40%. Mortality rate is usually higher for older patients.


Leptospirosis may present with a macular or maculopapular rash, abdominal pain mimicking acute
appendicitis, or generalized enlargement of lymphoid glands resembling infectious mononucleosis. It
also may present as aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, or fever of unknown origin.

Leptospirosis should be considered when a patient has a flulike disease with aseptic meningitis or
disproportionately severe myalgia.

Diagnostics
On infection the microorganism can be found in blood for the first 7 to 10 days (invoking serologicaly
identifiable reactions) and then moving to the kidneys. After 7 to 10 days the microorganism can be
found in fresh urine. Hence, early diagnostic efforts include testing a serum or blood sample
serologically with a panel of different strains. It is also possible to culture the microorganism from
blood, serum, fresh urine and possibly fresh kidney biopsy. Kidney function tests (Blood Urea Nitrogen
and creatinine) as well as blood tests for liver ferments are performed. The later reveal a moderate
elevation of transaminases. Diagnosis of leptospirosis is confirmed with tests such as Enzyme-Linked
Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) and PCR. It should be noted that serological testing is laborious and
expensive, thus underused in developing countries. Differential diagnosis list for leptospirosis is very
large due to diverse symptomatics. For forms with middle to high severity, the list includes dengue and
other hemorrhagic fevers, hepatitis of various etiologies, viral meningitis, malaria and typhoid fever.
Light forms should be distinguished from influenza and other related viral diseases. Specific tests are a
must for proper diagnosis of leptospirosis. Under circumstances of limited access (e.g., developing
countries) to specific diagnostic means, close attention must be paid to anamnesis of the patient. Factors
like certain dwelling areas, seasonality, contact with stagnant water (swimming, working on flooded
meadows, etc) and|or rodents in the medical history support the leptospirosis hypothesis and serve
indictaions for specific tests (if available).

Treatment
Leptospirosis treatment is a relatively complicated process comprising two main components -
suppressing the causative agent and fighting possible complications. Aetiotropic drugs are antibiotics,
such as doxycycline, penicillin, ampicillin, and amoxicillin (doxycycline can also be used as a
prophylaxis). There are no human vaccines; animal vaccines are only for a few strains, and are only
effective for a few months. Human therapeutic dosage of drugs is as follows: doxycycline 100 mg orally
every 12 hours for 1 week or penicillin 1-1.5 MU every 4 hours for 1 week. Doxycycline 200-250 mg
once a week is administered as a prophylaxis.

Supportive therapy measures (esp. in severe cases) include detoxication and normalization of the hydro-
electrolytic balance. Glucose and salt solution infusions may be administered; dialysis is used in serious
cases. Elevations of serum potassium are common and if the potassium level gets too high special
measures must be taken. Serum phosphorus levels may likewise increase to unacceptable levels due to
renal failure. Treatment for hyperphosphatemia consists of treating the underlying disease, dialysis
where appropriate, or oral administration of calcium carbonate, but not without first checking the serum
calcium levels (these two levels are related). Corticosteroids administraion in gradually reduced doses (e.
g., prednisolone starting from 30-60 mg) during 7-10 days is recommended by some specialists in cases
of severe haemorrhagic effects.

Improper treatment greatly reduces the survival rate. A patient with leptospirosis SHOULD be
treated at a specialized medical institution and MUST remain hospitalized untill proper resolution
of organ(s) failure and clinical infection.

Research
In a study of 38 dogs diagnosed and properly treated for leptospirosis published in the February 2000
issue of the Journal of the American Veterinary Association, the survival rate for the dialysis patients
was slightly higher than the ones not put on dialysis, but both were in the 85% range (plus or minus). Of
the dogs in this study that did not die, most recovered adequate kidney function, although one had
chronic renal problems.

                                                Mange
                                                                                  Back | Home | Up | Next


Mange is an irritation of the skin, primarily resulting in hair loss and sometimes including itching and
inflammation, all of which are caused by microscopic mites. Mange is most commonly found in dogs
and other canines, but it can occur in other domestic and wild animals, and occasionally in humans.

The mites embed themselves in the hair follicles or skin, depending on the type, making both detection
and treatment difficult. The condition can be treated with parasiticidal shampoo, topical or oral
medication, or injections, but it takes time and patience for repeated applications, and almost always
requires veterinary care.

Two types of mites produce canine mange, and each has similar but somewhat different symptoms.

Demodectic mange




                                 Demodex canis

Also called demodicosis, demodectic mange is caused by an overpopulation of Demodex canis, a mite
that occurs naturally in the hair follicles of most dogs. In most dogs, these mites never cause problems.
However, in certain situations, such as an impaired immune system, intense stress, or malnutrition, the
mites can reproduce too rapidly, causing anything from mild irritation and hair loss on a tiny patch of
skin to severe inflammation, infection, and--in rare cases--a life-threatening condition. Small patches of
demodicosis often correct themselves over time, although treatment is usually recommended.

Minor cases of demodectic mange usually do not cause much itching but might cause pustules on the
dog's skin, redness, scaling, hair loss, or any combination of these. It most commonly appears first on
the face, around the eyes, or at the corners of the mouth, and on the forelimbs.

In the more severe form, which usually develops in dogs who have previously suffered minor cases, hair
loss can occur in patches all over the body and might be accompanied by crusting, pain, enlarged lymph
nodes, and skin infections.

This variety of mange is not generally contagious; these mites thrive only on very specific hosts (dogs)
and transmission usually occurs only from the mother to nursing puppies during the first few days after
birth.

Some breeds appear to have an increased risk of mild cases as young dogs, including the Afghan Hound,
American Staffordshire Terrier, Boston Terrier, Boxer, Chihuahua, Shar Pei, Collies, Dalmatian,
Doberman Pinscher, English Bulldog, German Shepherd Dog, Great Dane, Old English Sheepdog,
American Pit Bull Terrier, and Pug. There is strong evidence that a predeliction for juvenile demodectic
mange is inherited.

Sarcoptic mange
Also known as canine scabies, sarcoptic mange is a highly contagious infestation of Sarcoptes scabei
canis, a burrowing mite. The canine sarcoptic mite can also infest humans and cats, although usually not
severely, as its natural host is dogs.

These mites dig into and through the skin, causing intense itching and crusting that can quickly become
infected. Hair loss and crusting frequently appears first on elbows and ears. Skin damage can occur from
the dog's intense scratching and biting.

Affected dogs need to be isolated from other dogs and their bedding, and places they have occupied
must be thoroughly cleaned. Shaving is sometimes warranted.

For more information, see Scabies.

Diagnosis
Veterinarians usually attempt diagnosis with a skin scraping, which is then examined under a
microscope for mites. Because they are burrowing creatures, mites are not always present on or near the
surface of the skin when the scraping takes place. As a result, diagnosis is often based on symptoms
rather than actual confirmation of the presence of mites. This also means that mange is occasionally
misdiagnosed as other medical conditions, and vice versa.

Masticatory muscle myositis (MMM) is an inflammatory disease in dogs affecting the muscles of the
jaw. It is also known as atrophic myositis or eosinophilic myositis. The disease mainly affects large
breed dogs. There is a similar disease of the eye muscles found in Golden Retrievers. Symptoms of acute
MMM include swelling of the jaw muscles and pain on opening the mouth. In chronic MMM there is
atrophy of the jaw muscles, and scarring may result in inability to open the mouth (trismus). The disease
is usually bilateral.

MMM is caused by the presence of 2M fibers in the muscles of the jaw. 2M fibers are not found
elsewhere in the body, but they are close in structure to proteins found on the surface of bacteria. The
immune system recognizes these proteins as foreign to the body and attacks them, resulting in
inflammation. Diagnosis of MMM is through biopsy. Treatment is usually with corticosteroids, and in
the case of trismus, manual opening of the mouth under anesthesia. Feeding very soft or liquid food
during this time is usually necessary. Recurrence of MMM is common.

A Mastocytoma is an accumulation or nodule of mast cells that resembles a tumor. In dogs and cats this
collection of mast cells is actually a mast cell tumor. A mast cell originates from the bone marrow and
is normally found throughout the connective tissue of the body. It is associated with allergic reactions
because it releases histamine. A mast cell tumor is a common malignant tumor of the skin in older dogs
and cats.

Symptoms
Most mast cell tumors are small, raised lumps on the skin. Some are hairless, ulcerated, or itchy. They
are usually solitary. In rare cases a highly malignant tumor is present, and symptoms may include loss of
appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, and anemia. The presence of these symptoms usually indicates
mastocytosis, which is the spread of mast cells throughout the body. Release of a large amount of
histamine at one time can result in ulceration of the stomach and duodenum, or disseminated
intravascular coagulation.

Diagnosis
A needle aspiration biopsy of the tumor will show a large number of mast cells. This is sufficient to
make the diagnosis of a mast cell tumor. However, a surgical biopsy is required to find the grade of the
tumor. The grade depends on how well the mast cells are differentiated, from grade I to grade III. The
disease is also staged.

    ●   Stage I - a single skin tumor with no spread to lymph nodes
    ●   Stage II - a single skin tumor with spread to lymph nodes in the surrounding area
    ●   Stage III - multiple skin tumors or a large tumor invading deep to the skin with or without lymph
        node involvement
    ●   Stage IV - a tumor with metastasis to the spleen, liver, bone marrow, or with the presence of mast
        cells in the blood

X-rays, ultrasound, or lymph node, bone marrow, or organ biopsies may be necessary to stage the
disease.

Treatment and prognosis
Removal of the mast cell tumor through surgery is the treatment of choice. Antihistamines such as
diphenhydramine are given prior to surgery to protect against the effects of histamine released from the
tumor. Wide margins (two to three centimeters) are required because of the tendency for the tumor cells
to be spread out around the tumor. If complete removal is not possible due to the size or location,
additional treatment such as radiation therapy or chemotherapy may be necessary. Prednisone is often
used to shrink the remaining tumor portion. H2 blockers such as cimetidine protect against stomach
damage from histamine.

Mast cell tumors that are grade I or II that can be completely removed have a good prognosis. Any mast
cell tumor found in the gastrointestinal tract, prepuce, paw, or around the anus has a guarded prognosis.
Tumors that have spread to the lymph nodes or other parts of the body have a poor prognosis. Any dog
showing symptoms of mastocytosis or with a grade III tumor has a poor prognosis. Boxers have a better
than average prognosis because of the relatively benign behavior of their mast cell tumors.

Mast cell tumors in cats
Siamese cats are at an increased risk for mast cell tumors. Gastrointestinal and splenic involvement is
more common in cats. Diagnosis and treatment are similar to the dog. The prognosis for solitary skin
tumors is good, but guarded for tumors in other organs.

Megaesophagus is a condition in dogs where peristalsis fails to occur properly and the esophagus is
enlarged. The food fails to enter the stomach, and is eventually regurgitated.

A molera is a "hole" in a Chihuahua's head; it is the same as a fontanelle in human babies. Historically,
the Chihuahua as developed in Mexico and the United States has displayed a "hole in the head". In times
past, this has been accepted as a mark of purity for this dog breed, and it is still mentioned in most
Chihuahua breed standards the world over. The bones of the head in all foetuses are not firmly knitted
together, but in most mammals, the different bones of the skull join with cartilaginous sutures as the
animal matures. The Chihuahuas' moleras vary in size and shape, occurring on the top of the head where
the parietal and frontal bones come together.

The simple fact that a Chihuahua has a domed head with an open molera does not predispose it to
hydrocephalus as found by a study done by Greene and Braund in 1989, which concluded that "Many
clinically normal toy breeds and brachycephalic (short faced) breeds also may have open fontanelles
without associated hydrocephalus." Also, "There did not appear to be any relationship between the
presence or size of the fontanelle and the concomitant presence of hydrocephalus." When the dog seems
normal but displays enlarged ventricles of the brain (under ultrasound), its hydrocephalus is termed
"occult" (having no clinical signs).

                                            Osteosarcoma
                                                                                          Back | Home | Up


Osteosarcoma is a malignant bone cancer; together with Ewing's sarcoma it accounts for most primary
bone malignancies. There is a preference for the metaphyseal region of tubular long bones. 50% of cases
occur around the knee. It is a malignant connective (soft) tissue tumor whose neoplastic cells present
osteoblastic differentiation and form tumoral bone.

Prevalence
It is the 6th leading cancer in children under age 15. It affects 400 children under age 15 and 500 adults
between the ages of 15-30 every year. Approxiately 1/3 of the 900 will die each year, or about 300 a
year. A second peak in incidence occurs in the elderly, usually associated with an underlying bone
pathology such as Paget's disease, medullary infarct, or prior irradiation. Unfortunately although 90% or
more of those with osteosarcoma will have a limb-salvage surgery of their knee, because of infection,
non-union, local recurrence and other reasons some will lose a limb after limb-sparring surgery.

Pathology
The tumor may be localized at the metaphyseal end of the long bones. Most often it affects the upper
end of tibia or humerus, of lower end of femurus. The tumor is solid, hard, irregular ("fir-tree" or "sun-
burst" appearance on X-ray examination) due to the tumor spicules of calcified bone radiating in right
angles. Surrounding tissues are infiltrated.

Microscopically: Tumor cells are very pleomorphic (anaplastic), some are giant, numerous atypical
mitoses. These cells produce osteoid describing irregular trabeculae (amorphous, eosinophilic/pink) with
or without central calcification (hematoxylinophilic/blue, granular) - tumor bone. Tumor cells are
included in the osteoid matrix. Cartilage may be present. Presence of immature blood vessels
(sarcomatous vessels lacking endothelial cells) favors the bloodstream metastasizing. 1


Symptoms
This type of bone tumor will first appears as a lump in long bones. Muscles will start to become weaker
as the affected bone part is not as strong as normal bones. Since it is a bone tumor, the feel of it is bony
but muscles are not necessarily attached.

Causes
The causes of osteosarcoma are not known. Due to the rarity of osteosarcoma, it appears that a genetic
predisposition exists which renders some individuals vulnerable to developing the condition. Questions
remain about whether radium , or fluoride, in drinking water can act as "environmental triggers" for
increasing the incidence of the disease.

Treatment
Standard therapy is a combination of limb-salvage orthopaedic surgery and a combination of high dose
methotrexate with leucovorin rescue, intra-arterial cisplatin (with or without caffeine(Japan)),
adriamycin, ifosfamide with mesna, BCD, etoposide, muramyl tri-peptite (MTP).

Classic treatment is Intra-arterial cisplatin with Adriamycin. Ifosfamide can be used as a adjuvant
treatment if the necrosis rate is low.

3-year event free survival ranges from 50% to 75%. and 5-year survival ranges from 60% to 85+% in
some studies. Overall, 60-65% treated 5-years ago(2000) will be alive today. Osteosarcoma as one of the
lowest survival rates for pediatric cancer despite chemotherapy's success in osteosarcoma of 6
chemotherapies, interferon-alpha, interleukin-2, and being the prototype of solid tumors in cancer.

Treatment studies come from Children's hospital Boston, Memorial Sloan-Kettering, Children's
Oncology Group, Italian Oncology Group, Japan, and MD Anderson in Texas.

Fluids are given for hydration.

Drugs like Krytril and Zofran help with nausea and vomiting.

Neupogen, epogen, Neulasta help with white blood cell counts and neutrophil counts.

Blood helps with anemia.

Prognosis
Prognosis is separted into three groups.

    ●   Stage I osteosarcoma has a good prognosis(>90%) and just requires surgery.

    ●   Stage IIb prognosis depends on the site of the tumor(proximal tibia, femur, pelvis, etc.) size of
        the tumor mass(in cm.), the degree of necrosis from neoadjuvant chemotherapy(beforeoperation
        chemotherapy), and pathological factors like the degree of p-glycoprotein, whether your tumor is
        CXCR4 positive, Her2 positive as these can lead to distant metastases to the lung. Longer time to
        metastases, more than 12 months or 24 months and the number of metastases and resectability of
        them lead to the best prognosis with metastatic osteosarcoma. It is better to have fewer
        metastases than longer time to metastases. Those with a longer length of time(>24months) and
        few nodules(2 or fewer) have the best prognosis with a 2-year survival after the metastases of
        50% 5-year of 40% and 10 year 20%. If metastases are both local and regional the prognosis is
        different unfortunately. (see http://www.osteosarcomasupport.org/prognosis.htm) top two
        articles.

    ●   Initial Presentation of stage III osteosarcoma with lung metastates depends on the resectability of
        the primary tumor and lung nodules, degree of necrosis of the primary tumor, and maybe the
        number of metastases. Overall prognosis is 30% or greater depending.

Canine Osteosarcoma
Osteosarcoma is the most common bone tumor in dogs and typically afflicts older large and giant breed
dogs (for example, Greyhounds German Shepherds, and Great Danes). The most commonly affected
bones are the humerus, the radius, the femur, and the tibia. Other sites include the ribs, the mandible, the
spine, and the pelvis. Metastasis of tumors involving the limb bones is very common, usually to the
lungs. The tumor causes a great deal of pain, and can even lead to fracture of the affected bone.
Amputation of the leg is the initial treatment, although this alone will not prevent metastasis.
Chemotherapy combined with amputation improves the survival time, but most dogs still die within a
year. There are surgical techniques designed to save the leg, but they do not improve the prognosis. One
key difference between osteosarcoma in dogs and humans is that the cancer is far more likely to spread
to the lungs in dogs.

Osteosarcoma is also the most common bone tumor in the cat and most commonly affects the rear leg.
The cancer is less aggressive in cats than in dogs, and therefore amputation alone can lead to a
significant survival time.

Panosteitis is a common bone disease in dogs. It manifests with sudden, otherwise unexplained
lameness, usually between 5 and 14 months of age. Fever, weight loss, and lethargy can also be seen.
The cause is unknown. Diagnosis is made by pain on palpation of the long bones of the limbs. X-rays
may show an increased density in the medullary cavity of the affected bones. Pain medication can help
to relieve the symptoms, and the lameness usually goes away eventually without additional treatment.
Larger breeds, such as German Shepherd Dogs, are more prone to this problem.

This is also referred to as eosinophilic panosteitis, enostosis, endosteal proliferation of new bone, and
eopan.

Parvovirus, commonly called parvo, is a genus of the Parvoviridae family of DNA viruses.
Parvoviruses are some of the smallest viruses found in nature (hence the name, from Latin parvus
meaning small). Like all members of the parvoviridae family, they infect only mammals.

Parvoviruses can cause disease in some animals. For example, Canine parvovirus is a particularly
deadly disease among young puppies, causing gastrointestinal tract damage and dehydration as well as a
cardiac syndrome in very young pups. Mouse parvovirus 1, however, causes no symptoms but can
contaminate immunology experiments in biological research laboratories. The most accurate diagnosis
of parvovirus is by ELISA. Dogs and cats can be vaccinated against parvovirus.

Many types of mammalian species have a strain of parvovirus associated with them. A parvovirus tends
to be specific about the taxon of animal it will infect. That is, a canine parvovirus will affect dogs,
wolves, and foxes, but will not infect cats or humans.

Parvovirus B19, which causes fifth disease in humans, is a member of the Erythrovirus genus of
Parvoviridae rather than Parvovirus.

Phycomycosis is an uncommon disease of the gastrointestinal tract most commonly found in dogs. The
disease is caused by a variety of molds and fungi. Pythiosis is the most common type and is caused by
Pythium, a type of water mould. Phycomycosis can also be caused by two types of zygomycetes,
Entomophthorales (such as Basidiobolus and Conidiobolus) and Mucorales (such as Mucor, Mortierella,
Absidia, Rhizopus, and Rhizomucor).

Pythiosis occurs most commonly in dogs and horses, but is also found in cats, cattle, and humans. In the
United States it is most commonly found in the Gulf states, especially Louisiana. Pythium occupies
swamps in late summer and infects dogs who drink water containing it. The disease is typically found in
young, large breed dogs. Other causes of phycomycosis are found throughout the U.S. and Europe.

The disease grows slowly in the stomach and small intestine, eventually forming large lumps of
granulation tissue. It can also invade surrounding lymph nodes. Symptoms include vomiting, diarrhea,
depression, weight loss, and a mass in the abdomen. Phycomycosis of the skin is very rare, and appears
as ulcerated lumps.

Diagnosis is through biopsy. Treatment is very difficult and includes surgery when possible. Antifungal
drugs show only limited effect on the disease. The prognosis is poor.

Protothecosis is a disease found in dogs, cats, and humans caused by a type of mutant green algae that
lacks chlorophyll. The two most common species are Prototheca wickerhami and Prototheca zopfii.
Prototheca is found worldwide in sewage. Infection is rare despite high exposure, and can be related to a
defective immune system. In dogs, females and Collies are most commonly affected.

The two main forms of protothecosis are cutaneous and disseminated. Cats are exclusively infected with
the cutaneous, or skin, form. Symptoms include soft lumps on the skin of the ears, legs, feet, nose, and
head. Infection usually occurs through a wound in the skin. The disseminated form is seen in dogs and
humans. The algae enters the body through the mouth or nose and causes infection in the intestines.
From there it can spread to the eye, brain, and kidneys. Symptoms can include diarrhea, weight loss,
weakness, inflammation of the eye (uveitis), retinal detachment, deafness, and seizures.

Diagnosis is through culture or finding the organism in a biopsy. Surgery is the treatment of choice for
the cutaneous form. Treatment of the disseminated form is very difficult, although use of antifungal
medication has been successful in a few cases. Prognosis for cutaneous protothecosis is guarded and
depends on the surgical options. Prognosis for the disseminated form is grave.

Raw Feeding is the practice of feeding pets, especially dogs, what is believed to be a species-
appropriate diet largely consisting of uncooked meat. Practitioners often cite evidence that domesticated
dogs have very similar gastrointestinal systems to wolves. Raw feeders are commonly opposed to
commercial dog foods, which they believe to be harmful. There exist other moral, health and cost
reasons as well.

One popular raw diet is the "Bones and Raw Food" model which includes non-meats and numerous
supplements along with careful preparation and measuring. Another model is a "Whole Prey" diet which
simulates the proportions of an actual prey animal in a pet's diet. This includes organ meat, heads, fur
(and feathers and scales), skin, muscle, and bone, but no other supplements.

Proponents of raw feeding are often vehement in their belief of its superiority to a commercial diet as it
affects the health, disposition and longevity of their pets. It is believed by many raw feeders that
veterinarians (the majority of whom are opposed to raw feeding) are influenced by academic
departments that rely upon funding from pet food companies and by their own desire to profit from
selling special dietary commercial pet food.

Opponents of raw feeding cite the dangers of dental fractures, bacterial contamination, parasites, GI
obstruction, and dietary imbalances.

Most, if not all, specific evidence that raw feeding is beneficial is anecdotal, limited to the experiences
of a few authors and website maintainers.

                                            Toxocariasis
                                                                                 Back | Home | Up | Next


Toxocariasis is a parasitic infection with the dog or cat roundworm, Toxocara canis or Toxocara cati,
respectively. Ingestion of these worms causes the condition, visceral larval migrans.




                                 Toxocara canis

Epidemiology
Toxocariasis is a worldwide infection. Epidemiologic surveys show a 2-5% positive rate in healthy
adults from urban Western countries and 14.2-37% in rural areas. In tropical countries, surveys show a
positive rate of 63.2% in Bali, 86% in Saint Lucia, and 92.8% in Réunion. Toxocariasis is most
commonly a disease of children, typically children aged 2-7 years.

Pathophysiology
Adult worms of the Toxocara species live in the small intestine of dogs and cats. They range from 4-12
cm in length. Almost all puppies are infected at or soon after birth. During the summer, Toxocara eggs
are shed and become infective. They survive for years in the environment, and humans typically ingest
the eggs by oral contact with contaminated hands. Once introduced into the human intestine, the eggs
hatch, releasing the larvae. The larval form is less than 0.5 mm in length and 0.02 mm wide. The larvae
penetrate the bowel wall and migrate through vessels to the muscles, liver, and lung and sometimes to
the eye and brain as well.

Disease severity depends not only on the number of larvae ingested but also on the degree of allergic
reaction. The inflammatory reaction causes epithelial cells to surround each larva, and, subsequently, a
dense fibrous capsule invests each granuloma.

Features
    ●   Weakness
    ●   Pruritus
    ●   Rash
    ●   Difficulty breathing
    ●   Abdominal pain
    ●   Eosinophilia
    ●   Increased total serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) level
    ●   Elevated antibody titers to T canis

Diagnosis
In suspected cases, diagnosis is confirmed by an increase in the anti-Toxocara excretory-secretory
antigen IgE level

Treatment
Mebendazole or thiobendazole are the treatments of choice.

Prognosis
Toxocariasis is almost always a benign, asymptomatic, and self-limiting disease, although brain
involvement can cause brain damage, meningitis, encephalitis, or epilepsy. Ocular involvement may
cause loss of visual acuity or unilateral blindness. Pulmonary and hepatic forms can cause protracted
symptoms if the patient does not receive treatment.

Prevention
The eggs of Toxocara species are widespread in parks, playgrounds, yards, and in homes and apartments
where the occupants have dogs or cats. Elimination of eggs from the environment is not possible;
therefore, prevention depends on proper hygiene, including handwashing after contact with pets. Public
policies that have attempted to eradicate Toxocara infection in dogs and cats have had limited success.

                                                                                   Back | Home | Up | Next

century, engraving, 1796

Bear-baiting is a blood sport that was a popular entertainment from at least the 11th century in which a
bear is secured to a post and then attacked by a number of dogs.

In the most well known form, there were purpose-built arenas for the entertainment, called in England
bear-gardens, consisting of a circular high fenced area, the pit, and raised seating for spectators. A post
would be set in the ground towards the edge of the pit and the bear chained to it, either by the leg or
neck. The dogs would then be set on it, being replaced as they tired or were wounded or killed. For a
long time the main bear-garden in London was the Paris Garden at Southwark.

In England, from the 16th century, many herds of bears were maintained for baiting. Henry VIII was a
fan and had a pit constructed at Whitehall. Elizabeth I was also fond of the entertainment; it featured
regularly in her tours. In 1575 a baiting display for her had thirteen bears, and when an attempt was
made to ban baiting on Sundays she over-ruled Parliament. A variation was "the whipping of a blinded
bear" and certain other animals were also baited, especially bulls but also on one curious occasion a
pony with an ape tied to its back was baited and a spectator described that "...with the screaming of the
ape, beholding the curs hanging from the ears and neck of the pony, is very laughable".
Attempts to end the entertainment were first made in England by the Puritans, with little effect. In 1849,
Catharine Macaulay wrote,"The Puritan hated bearbaiting, not because it gave pain to the bear, but
because it gave pleasure to the spectators."

By the late 17th century "the conscience of cultivated people seems to have been touched", but it was
not until 1835 that baiting were prohibited by Parliament, a ruling that was soon extended across the
Empire. Baiting is banned worldwide but can still be found in parts of the Middle East and Pakistan.

The term may also be used for the hunting practice of luring a bear with bait to an arranged killing spot.
The hunter places an amount of food, such as raw meat and/or sweets, every day at a given spot until the
hunter notices the food is being taken each day, accompanied by bear tracks. He then chooses a day to
await the bear, killing it when it arrives to feed. Because the practice is time consuming and disrupts a
person's daily schedule, the term "bear baiting" is sometimes also used in Alaska to mean "screwing
off," for example if a person is late for work or misses an appointment.

A bear-bait filled a significant symbolic role as the turning point in Ken Follett's book, The Pillars of the
Earth.

Bull-baiting was a popular amusement, particularly in 17th and 18th-century England, in which trained
bulldogs attacked a tethered bull. In Queen Anne's time it was performed in London at Hockley Hole,
regularly twice a week, and there was scarce a provincial town to which it did not extend. At Stamford
and at Tutbury, from a very early period, a maddened bull was annually hunted through the streets.

Before the event started, the bull's nose was usually blown full of pepper to enrage the animal before the
baiting. The bull was often allowed a hole in the ground, into which to thrust his vulnerable nose and
lips. A variant of bull-baiting was "pinning the bull"; specially-trained dogs would be set upon the bull
one at a time, a successful attack resulting in the dog fastening his teeth strongly in the bull's snout.

Together with other animal blood sports such as bear-baiting, cockfighting, and dogfighting, this
amusement was prohibited in Britain by an act of Parliament in 1835.

Hog-baiting, aka Hog dogging, Hog-dog fighting, or Hog-dog rodeo is a bloodsport involving the
baiting of a hog or boar.


Background
In a typical match the hog, tusks removed, is released into a pen with one or more dogs who attempt to
subdue it. In more violent versions of the sport, specially trained "catch dogs" try to bring down the hog
by biting and dragging. Occasionally the dogs are outfitted with chest armor, but major injuries to both
animals are common in any case.

Hog dogging as a sport developed from the training of specialist boar-hunting dogs. Typically a hunter's
pack of dogs is divided into "bays" who corner the hogs and "catch dogs" that try to bring them down.
The development of this training into a competitive spectator event is believed to have first taken place
in Winnfield, Louisiana at an event known as "Uncle Earl's Hog Dog Trials." The Trials were first
organized in 1995 as part of the celebration of former Governor and well-known hog hunter Earl K.
Long's 100th birthday. The annual event is known as "The Super Bowl of Hog Dog Baying." In these
trials, a group of five judges score the dogs' skill at baying the hog (cornering it and causing it to stand
still.) Events are classed by the age of the dog and the number of dogs attempting the bay.

According to the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) most active pens are found in the U.S.
Southern states, with the highest current concentration in Alabama. Louisiana passed a bill in 2004 to
prohibit hog dogging contests in which either animal could be hurt or killed. The Winnfield event, which
is officially recognized by the Louisiana legislature, is exempted from the ban because only bay dogs are
used and if a dog "catches" or clamps onto the hog for more than five seconds it is pried loose with a
"break stick" and disqualified from competition. The organizers consider their event to be a "family-
oriented" spectacle that preserves aspects of Louisiana's traditions and culture.

Already such contests can be prosecuted as animal cruelty, though only the dogs' owners are punished,
often with a fine or short sentence. Several states, including Alabama, South Carolina, and Tennessee
are considering specific laws to set penalties for breeders, promoters, hosts and spectators who
participate in these events. Crafting such laws is complicated by organized resistance from breeders of
fighting cocks, whose long-established, though technically illegal, industry still has enough power to
discourage broad new legislation against all animal combat. The proposed legislation in Alabama would
also exempt the use of dogs in hunting wild boar (which are considered nuisances and can be hunted
year round) or for herding hogs on a farm.

Human-baiting is a bloodsport involving the baiting of humans.


Gentleman and the Bull Dog
In Sporting Magazine vol. XVIII, there is the description of a fight between the 'Gentlemen and the Bull
Dog'. The Sporting Times reports on this fight, which occurred in 1807.




       "A fight between a man and Bull Dog took place some time ago to settle a bet. With its first
       charge the Bull Dog already succeeded in throwing and pinning its opponent. Although the dog's
       jaws were nearly closed by a muzzle, it succeeded in sinking its teeth into the man's body. Had
       the dog no been pulled away immediately, it would have disembowelled the man."

This story illustrates the outcome of a large, mastiff like dog charging its opponent. Despite the handicap
of a muzzle, the dog was the winner.

Brummy and the Bulldog
The Daily Telegraph on July 6, 1874, provided an article written by journalist, James Greenwood, in
which he reported on June 24, 1874 to have witnessed a human-baiting. In 1876, Greenwood
republished the article in his book "Low-Life Deeps" in the chapter called In The Potteries.

To make the story all the more odd, the human named 'Brummy' was a forty-year old dwarf standing at
most four-and-a-half feet tall, but possessing extraordinary strength. The enormous size of his head and
ears were particularly striking. He had huge hands and feet and he was extremely bow-legged.




                                              Physic and Brummy, An Evening at Hanley

The Bulldog named 'Physic' was stately white and red-eyed, eager for the fray. He did not bark but was
frenzied with passion to the degree that tears trickled down his blunt nose and his gasping became each
moment more shrill and hysterical.

The bait occurred at an old inn located at Hanley, Staffordshire, in a large guest room with a ring
cordoned off with a line. The fifty spectators were mostly coal miners, with some gentlemen from better
social classes, each eagerly awaiting the fight. The floor was covered with sawdust, from the ceiling
hung an oil lamp and all the windows were closed and carefully covered, with the only ventilation
through the fireplace. Thick smoke from cigars and pipes filled the room, with perspiration from the
crowd making the room hot and sticky.

Brummy had agreed to fight the dog for a wager, on his theory that no dog, not even a Bulldog, "could
lick a man". The conditions were no weapons and he could only wear his trousers. The combat rules
provided that both 'beasts' should be chained to the wall opposite and facing each other and the man was
to assume and continue the position on all fours throughout the fight. During the fight Brummy was
bitten deeply several times on the arms and the Bulldog was dealt several heavy blows to the head and
ribs from sledge hammer fists.

By the end of round ten the Bulldog's head was swollen beyond its accustomed size, it had lost two teeth
and one of its eyes was entirely shut up; while as for the dwarf, his fists and arms were reeking and his
hideous face was ghastly pale with rage and despair.

The fight lasted until round eleven when Brummy dealt the Bulldog a tremendous blow under the chin
and with such effect that the dog was dashed against the wall, where despite all its' master could do for
it, for the space of one minute it lay still and Brummy was declared the winner.

East End Club
In 1892, another human-baiting occurred between the human combatant James Oxley and a fighting dog
named 'Crib'. The following is extracted from a report published from those times.

        "An arbite (man and dog fight) took place in an East End Club. The match was that James Oxley,
        a man well known in the neighbourhood of Shoreditch, would stall off for thirty minutes a
        fighting dog called 'Crib' owned by Robert Green. The match came off not many yards from the
        Britannia Theatre, Hoxton and excited considerable interest amongst those in the know. Some of
        the prominent people, who brought about this sickening match, when interviewed, stated that for
        twenty-one minutes Oxley kept the dog off by using his fists. But, at one moment, the dog made
        a desperate effort to get past the man's guard and did and jumped over his left shoulder, wheeled
        round and fastened on the man's right ear, and dragged him to the ground. As soon as it was
        possible, the dog was choked off, but the upper part of Oxley's ear had disappeared."

Warning from history
The history of dog fighting breeds reflects the intensive breeding efforts to create a dog breed with the
absolute courage, insensitivity to pain, gameness and willingness to win, even if they have to pay with
their own life. This and the above examples of past human-baiting should provide ample warning to any
person considering fighting such a dog themselves.

between Wallace and dogs, Tinker and Ball, circa 1825.

Lion-baiting is a bloodsport involving the baiting of lions.


Antiquity
Antiquity has examples of the eternal dream of man's faithful companion, the dog, which defeats even
the 'King of Beasts', the lion. Greek legend reflects Achilles shield with a depiction of the victory of his
dog over two lions. A second is a Persian King Kambyses possessed a dog that started a fight with two
full-grown lions. A third, is reported by a Roman historian, Claudius Aelianus, in which he states
Indians showed Alexander the Great powerful dogs bred for lion-baiting. Certainly, historians from
antiquity would embellish their stories, but they do capture the spirit.

1610
In 1610, during the reign of James I of England the practice of lion-baiting was first recorded. The
spectacle was staged for the amusement of the court. The King requested Edward Alleyn, Master of the
Bear Garden, to acquire the three largest and most courageous dogs. The event was as follows:
       "One of the dogs, which was the first to be sent in the cage, was soon put out of action by the
       lion, which seized it by the head and neck and dragged it through the cage. A second dog was
       sent in and met with the same fate. The third, however, which came to its aid, immediately seized
       the lion by the lower jaw and gripped it securely for a considerable time until, severely injured by
       the lion's claws, it was forced to loosen its grip. The lion itself was seriously injured in the fight
       and was not able to continue fighting. With a sudden mighty leap over the dogs, it fled inside its
       den. Two of the dogs died shortly after the fight from the injuries they had suffered. The last,
       however, survived this splendid fight and was nursed back to health with great care by the King's
       son, Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales. Prince Henry declared: 'He had fought the king of the
       wild animals and should never again have to fight baser creatures!' In this way, the dog had
       gained for itself a safe life at the English Royal court."

1790
In 1790, The Times reported a lion-baiting in Vienna as follows:

       "There was a lion fight at the amphitheatre of Vienna, in the summer of 1790, which was almost
       the last permitted in that capital. The amphitheatre at Vienna embraced an area of from eighty to
       a hundred feet in diameter. The lower part of the structure comprised the dens of the different
       animals. Above those dens, and about ten feet from the ground, were the first and principal seats,
       over which were galleries. In the course of the entertainment, a den was opened, out of which
       stalked, in free and ample range, a most majestic lion; and, soon after, a fallow deer was let into
       the circus from another den. The deer instantly fled, and bounded round the circular space,
       pursued by the lion; but the quick and sudden turnings of the former continually baulked the
       effort of its pursuer. After this ineffectual chase had continued for several minutes, a door was
       opened, through which the deer escaped; and presently five or six of the large and fierce
       Hungarian Mastiffs were sent in. The lion, at the moment of their entrance, was leisurely
       returning to his den, the door of which stood open. The dogs, which entered behind him, flew
       towards him in a body, with the utmost fury, making the amphitheatre ring with their barking.
       When they reached the lion, the noble animal stopped, and deliberately turned towards them. The
       dogs instantly retreated a few steps, increasing their vociferations, and the lion slowly resumed
       his progress towards his den. The dogs again approached; the lion turned his head; his adversaries
       halted; and this continued until, on his nearing his den, the dogs separated, and approached him
       on different sides. The lion then turned quickly round, like one whose dignified patience could
       brook the harassment of insolence no longer. The dogs fled far, as if instinctively sensible of the
       power of wrath they had at length provoked. One unfortunate dog, however, which had
       approached too near to effect his escape, was suddenly seized by the paw of the lion; and the
       piercing yells which he sent forth quickly caused his comrades to recede to the door of entrance
       at the opposite site of the area, where they stood in a row, barking and yelling in concert with
       their miserable associate. After arresting the struggling and yelling prisoner for a short time, the
       lion couched upon him with his forepaws and mouth. The struggles of the sufferer grew feebler
       and feebler, until at length he became perfectly motionless. We all concluded him to be dead. In
       this composed posture of executive justice, the lion remained for at least ten minutes, when he
       majestically rose, and with a slow step entered his den, and disappeared. The apparent corpse
       continued to lie motionless for a few minutes; presently the dog, to his amazement, and that of
       the whole amphitheatre, found himself alive, and rose with his nose pointed to the ground, his tail
       between his hind legs pressing his belly, and, as soon as he was certified of his existence, he
       made off for the door in a long trot, through which he escaped with his more fortunate
       companions."

1791
J. March's, Zoological Anecdotes, circa 1845, has the story of a second lion-bait, which occurred in
Vienna in the year 1791 as follows:

       "Of late years the truth of the accounts which have been so long current, respecting the generous
       disposition of the lion, have been called in question. Several travellers, in their accounts of Asia
       and Africa, describe him as of a more rapacious and sanguinary disposition than had formerly
       been supposed, although few of them have had the opportunity to make him a particular object of
       their attention. A circumstance that occurred not long since in Vienna seems, however, to
       confirm the more ancient accounts. In the year 1791, at which period the custom of baiting wild
       beasts still existed in that city, a combat was to be exhibited between a lion and a number of large
       dogs. As soon as the noble animal made his appearance, four large bull-dogs were turned loose
       upon him, three of which, however, as soon as they came near him, took fright, and ran away.
       One only had courage to remain, and make the attack. The lion, however, without rising from the
       ground upon which he was lying, showed him, by a single stroke with his paw, how greatly his
       superior he was in strength; for the dog was instantly stretched motionless on the ground. The
       lion drew him towards him, and laid his fore-paws upon him in such a manner that only a small
       part of his body could be seen. Every one imagined that the dog was dead, and that the lion
       would soon rise and devour him. But they were mistaken. The dog began to move, and struggled
       to get loose, which the lion permitted him to do. He seemed merely to have warned him not to
       meddle with him any more; but when the dog attempted to run away, and had already got half
       over the enclosure, the lion's indignation seemed to be excited. He sprang from the ground, and in
       two leaps reached the fugitive, who had just got as far as the paling, and was whining to have it
       opened for him to escape. The flying animal had called the instinctive propensity of the monarch
       of the forest into action: the defenceless enemy now excited his pity; for the generous lion
       stepped a few paces backward, and looked quietly on, while a small door was opened to let the
       dog out of the enclosure. This unequivocal trait of generosity moved every spectator. A shout of
       applause resounded throughout the assembly, who had enjoyed a satisfaction of a description far
       superior to what they had expected. It is possible that the African lion, when, under the impulse
       of hunger, he goes out to seek his prey, may not so often exhibit this magnanimous disposition;
       for in that case he is compelled by imperious necessity to satisfy the cravings of nature; but when
       his appetite is satiated, he never seeks for prey, nor does he ever destroy to gratify a blood-thirsty
       disposition."
1825
In 1825, two more lion fights took place, staged by a promoter named George Wombwell, who travelled
around the England with his collection of caged wild animals. The venue for the encounters was an
extensive enclosure called the Old Factory Yard, in the suburbs of Warwick, on the road towards
Northampton. The cage where the fight was to take place stood in the center of a hollow square, formed
on two sides by a range of empty workshops, the windows of which were fitted up with planks on
barrels as seats for the spectators. The price of admission was three guineas for seats at the windows,
first, second and third floors of the unoccupied factory; two guineas for seats on the fourth floor; one
guineas for a still more distant point; and a half-guinea for standing room in the square.

The cage measured fifteen feet square, ten feet high, with an elevated floor six feet from the ground. The
old iron bars were wide enough apart for a dog to enter or escape.

The first bait involved the lion named "Nero" and the second bait a lion named "Wallace".

Nero

The Morning Herald of July 26, 1825, provided the following account:

       "The lion's travelling caravan was drawn close to the fighting cage, so that the door could be
       opened from one into the other; and the keeper, Wombwell, then going into the travelling
       caravan, in which another man had already been staying with the lion for some time, the animal
       followed him into the cage as tamely as a Newfoundland dog. The whole demeanour of the beast,
       indeed, was so quiet and generous, that at his first appearance, it became very much doubted
       whether he would attempt to fight at all. While the multitude shouted and the dogs were yelling
       in the ground below, he walked up and down his cage with the most perfect composure, not at all
       angered, or even excited.

       In the meantime, Wombwell had quit the cage and the dogs were 'made ready'. These were the
       fallow-coloured dog, a brown with white legs and a third brown altogether averaging about forty
       pounds in weight a piece and described in the printed papers, which were distributed by the
       names Captain, Tiger and Turk. As the dogs were held for a minute in slips, upon which they ran
       from the ground to the stage, the lion crouched on his belly to receive them; but, with so perfect
       an absence of anything like ferocity, showed clearly that the idea of fighting, or doing mischief to
       any living creature, never had occurred to him.

       At the first rush of the dogs, which the lion evidently had not expected and did not at all know
       how to meet, they all fixed themselves upon him, but caught only by the dewlap and the mane.
       With a single effort he shook them off, without attempting to return the attack. He then flew from
       side to side of the cage, endeavouring to get away; but in the next moment the assailants were
upon him again, and the brown dog, Turk, seized him by the nose, while the two others fastened
at the same time on the fleshy part of his lips and under-jaw. The lion then roared dreadfully, but
evidently only fro the pain he suffered, not at all from anger. As the dogs hung to his throat and
head, he pawed them off by sheer strength; and in doing this and in rolling upon them, did them
considerably mischief; but it amounted to the most curious fact that he never once bit, or
attempted to bite, during the whole contest, or seemed to have any desire to retaliate any of the
punishment which was inflicted upon him.

When he was first 'pinned', for instance, the dogs hung to him for more than a minute and were
drawn, holding to his nose and lips, several times round the ring. After a short time, roaring
tremendously, he tore them off with his claws, mauling two a good deal in the operation, but still
not attempting afterward to act on the offensive. After about five minutes fighting, the fallow-
coloured dog was taken away, lame and apparently much distressed and the remaining two
continued the combat alone, the lion still working only with his paws, as though seeking to rid
himself of a torture, the nature of which he did not well understand. In two or three minutes
more, the second dog, Tiger, being dreadfully maimed, crawled out of the business; not the
brown dog, Turk, which was the lightest of the three, but was of admirable courage and went on
fighting by himself.

A most extraordinary scene ensued; dog, left entirely alone with an animal twenty time its
weight, continued the battle with unabated fury and thought bleeding all over from the effect of
the lion's claws, seized and pinned him by the nose at least half a dozen times; when, at length,
releasing himself with a desperate effort, the lion flung his whole weight upon the dog and held
him lying between his fore paws for more than a minute, during which time he could have bitten
his head off a hundred times over, but did not make the slightest effort to hurt him. Poor Turk
was then taken away by the dog-keepers, grievously mangled but still alive and seized the lion,
for at least the twentieth time, the very same moment that the he was released from under him.

The second round of the contest presented only a repetition of the first. However, the second set
of dogs being heavier than the first and the lion more exhausted, it became a one-way contest.
Nero, bleeding freely from the nose and head, was unable to keep his footing and slipped on the
wet boards. The dogs, all three, seized him; the lion endeavoured to get rid of them in the same
way as before, using his pawn and not thinking of fighting, but not with the same success. He fell
and showed symptoms of weakness, upon which the dogs were taken away. This termination,
however, did not please the crowd, who cried out loudly that the dogs were not beaten.

Some confusion then followed; after which the doges were again put in and again seized the lion,
which by this time, as well as bleeding freely fro the head appeared to have hurt one of this fore
feet. Nero weakened rapidly, Mr. Wombwell announced that he gave on the part of the lion; and
the exhibition was declared to at an end. The first round lasting eleven minutes with the seconds
less than five. From the beginning of the contest to the end, the lion was merely a sufferer; he
never struck a blow in anger."
Wallace

Wombwell, in the same week, submitted another of his lions to be baited and this match proved to be a
very different proposition for the dogs. The Times gave an account of the contest as follows:

       "Wombwell has, notwithstanding the public indignation which accompanied the exposure of the
       lion Nero to the six dogs, kept his word with the lovers of cruel sports by a second exhibition. He
       matched his 'Wallace,' a fine lion, cubbed in Scotland, against six of the best dogs that could be
       found. Wallace's temper is the very opposite of that of the gentle Nero. It is but seldom that he
       lets even his feeders approach him, and he soon shows that he cannot reconcile himself to
       familiarity from any creature not of his own species. Towards eight o'clock the factory-yard was
       well attended, at 5s. each person, and soon after the battle commenced. The lion was turned from
       his den to the same stage on which Nero fought. The match was—1st. Three couples of dogs to
       be slipped at him, two at a time—2d. Twenty minutes or more, as the umpires should think fit, to
       be allowed between each attack—3d. The dogs to be handed to the cage once only. Tinker, Ball,
       Billy, Sweep, Turpin, Tiger.

       In the first round, Tinker and Ball were let loose, and both made a gallant attack; the lion having
       waited for them as if aware of the approach of his foes. He showed himself a forest lion, and
       fought like one. He clapped his paw upon poor Ball, took Tinker in his teeth, and deliberately
       walked round the stage with him as a cat would with a mouse. Ball, released from the paw,
       worked all he could, but Wallace treated his slight punishment by a kick now and then. He at
       length dropped Tinker, and that poor animal crawled off the stage as well as he could. The lion
       then seized Ball by the mouth, and played precisely the same game with him as if he had actually
       been trained to it. Ball would have been almost devoured, but his second got hold of him through
       the bars, and hauled him away. Turpin, a London, and Sweep, a Liverpool dog, made an excellent
       attack, but it was three or four minutes before the ingenuity of their seconds could get them on.
       Wallace squatted on his haunches, and placed himself erect at the slope where the dogs mounted
       the stage, as if he thought they dared not approach. The dogs, when on, fought gallantly; but both
       were vanquished in less than a minute after their attack. The London dog bolted as soon as he
       could extricate himself from the lion's grasp, but Sweep would have been killed on the spot, but
       he was released. Wedgbury untied Billy and Tiger, casting a most piteous look upon the wounded
       dogs around him. Both went to work. Wallace seized Billy by the loins, and when shaking him,
       Tiger having run away, Wedgbury cried out, 'There, you see how you've gammoned me to have
       the best dog in England killed.' Billy, however, escaped with his life; he was dragged through the
       railing, after having received a mark in the loins, which (if he recovers at all) will probably
       render him unfit for any future contest. The victory of course was declared in favour of the lion.
       Several well-dressed women viewed the contest from the upper apartment of the factory."

Outrage
The public were outraged at the promotion of such baiting spectacles and the matter was raised in
Parliament. Wombwell's lion baits were the last to be staged in the United Kingdom.

Polar Bear-baiting is a bloodsport involving the baiting of Polar Bears.


Background
Perhaps, due to the infrequent occurrences of the baiting of Polar Bears, few written citations can be
found.

First citation

In the book:

    ●   Jesse, George R. (1866). Researches into the History of the British Dog, 2 vols. London: Bobert
        Hardwicke.

The following occurrence is cited.

        "The Spanish Ambassador is much delighted in bear-baiting. He was the last week at Paris
        Garden, London, where they showed him all the pleasures they could with bull, bear and horse
        and then turned a white bear into the Thames, where the dogs baited him swimming; which was
        the best sport of all."

Second Citation

The Daily Advertiser, January 20, 1747, edition, carried this advertisement:

        "At the particular request of several persons of distinction, the celebrated white sea-bear, which
        has been seen and admired by the curious in most parts of England, will be baited at Mr.
        Broughton's amphitheatre, this day being the 29th instant. the creature is now supposed to be
        arrived at his utmost strength and perfection; and though there never yet was one of this kind
        baited in Europe, it is not doubted, from his uncommon size, excessive weight and more than
        savage fierceness, but he will afford extraordinary entertainment and behave himself in such a
        manner as to fill those who are lovers of the diversion of this kind with delight and astonishment.
        Any person who brings a dog will be admitted gratis."

The history of dog fighting breeds is difficult to track because dog fighting undoubtedly started before
written history.

History

Modern History

As with all domesticated dogs, the ancestors of the large breeds of fighting dog were wolves. The
foundation breed of the fighting dog was, in its outward appearance, a large, low slung, heavy breed
with a powerful build and strongly developed head.

Scholars speculate that large scale human migrations, the development of trade, and gifts between royal
courts of valuable fighting dogs facilitated the spread of fighting dog breeds. There are many accounts of
military campaigns which utilised fighting dogs, as well as royal gifts in the form of large dogs.

Breeding
Dog breeding in its earliest stages was carried out systematically, with the desire for specialization. It is
believed that the development of individual breeds took place in narrow geographic areas, corresponding
to the performance required in these regions. The selection for performance, complemented by the
breeding for suitable body forms, leads to the formation of breeds. The task of the fighting dog
demanded specific basic anatomical traits and temperamental features. The anatomy of the fighting dog
requires an imposing outward form to instil fear and terror, with the foundation breed naturally large,
low-slung, heavy, powerfully built, strongly developed head, powerful biting apparatus and a
tremendously threatening voice. However, we must not consider only giant's among dog breeds, but
rather all breeds with a character suitable for protecting humans and fighting wild animals. We can
consider the following breeds developed over the millennia as the foundation forms of the contemporary
fighting dog breeds:

    1.   Tibetan Mastiff
    2.   Molossus
    3.   Bull Biter
    4.   Great Dane
    5.   Mastiff
    6. Bulldog
    7. Bull and Terrier


Hunting of dangerous game
Over many centuries man has hunted dangerous game, such as the bison, stag, wild boar and bear. The
men opposed their quarry with spear in hand with the fighting dog's job to position the game so that the
hunter could kill it with the spear. The game involved required specialized breed types. To track down
the prey would require long legged tracking dogs; the pack that followed would include large powerful
fighting dogs to deal with the cornered quarry.

Baiting sports
This bloodsport of baiting animals has occurred since antiquity, most famously during those times in the
Roman Colosseum; however, in contemporary times, it is most associated with the English, who pursued
it with utmost earnestness, which was barely known elsewhere in the world. For over six hundred years
the pastime flourished, reaching the peak of its popularity during the sixteenth century. The various
animal types involved in the bait allowed for the breed specialization and basic anatomical forms of
fighting dogs, which we see today.

Old English bulldog
We find the first historical traces of Bull-baiting in the time of the regency of King John. Specially bred
and enraged steers, with their aggressive nature were used to test the keenness of their dogs. A collar
around the bulls neck fastened to a thick rope about three to five metres long, attached to a hook then
fastened to an embedded stake that will turn around allowing the bull to watch its antagonizer. The dog's
goal in the attack was to pin and mercilessly hold onto the bull's nose, which is its most sensitive spot. If
the dog grips tightly here, the bull is virtually helpless. To avoid this attack, experienced fighting bulls
lowered their heads as much as possible in the direction of the attacking dog, protecting their nose and
meeting the attacker with only its horns and tossing the dog into the air. The dog reciprocated by staying
low to the ground as it crept along its path to the bull. These tactics allowed for a specialized breed in
the form of the now extinct original Old English Bulldog. This new breed was extremely compact, broad
and muscular. A particular characteristic of the breed was the lower jaw that projected considerably in
front of the upper jaw, which made possible the strong, vice like grip. The nose was deeply set, which
allowed the dog to get enough air as it gripped the bull. The contemporary recreation of the breed is
recognized called the Olde Englishe Bulldogge.

The Yukon Quest Sled Dog Race, or just the Yukon Quest, also known as 'the toughest dog sled race
in the world', is an international dog mushing race held every February. It runs from Whitehorse, Yukon,
Canada to Fairbanks, Alaska, U.S. on odd-numbered years, and from Fairbanks to Whitehouse on even
years.




                                    A team of sled dogs leave the Yukon Quest starting gate,
Whitehorse, 2003.

A single musher and a team of 14 dogs race for about two weeks, following historic Klondike Gold
Rush and mail delivery routes from the start of the 20th century. The mushers must pack their own
equipment, are not permitted to replace their sled, and cannot accept any help except when they reach
Dawson City, Yukon, the halfway mark of the race. Ten checkpoints lie along the trail, some more than
200 miles (300 km) apart.

The race route runs on frozen rivers, across open water and bad ice; over four mountain ranges, reaching
an elevation of 3,800 feet (1,160 m); and though isolated, northern villages. Racers cover 1,000 miles
(1,600 km), as temperatures hit −40 °F (−40 °C), and winds reach 100 miles per hour (160 km/h).

USD $125,000 is divided among the top 15 finishing teams and the winner takes home $30,000.

The first musher to win the Yukon Quest was Sonny Lindner in 1984. The shortest race was in 1995,
with Frank Turner winning in 10 days, 16 hours, 20 minutes. The longest finishing time was in 1988
when it took Ty Halvorson 20 days, 9 hours and 16 minutes. The closest finish was in 1991 with Bruce
Lee a mere 5 minutes behind winner Charlie Boulding. Aliy Zirkle became the first woman to win the
race in 2000, in 10 days, 22 hours and 57 minutes. Lance Mackey won the 2005 race, and is competing
in the Iditarod.

                                            Hearing Dog
                                                                                   Back | Home | Up | Next


Hearing dogs, called "signal dogs" in the past and also "sound alert dogs" or "hearing assist dogs," are a
category of assistance dogs that are especially selected and trained to assist people who are deaf or hard
of hearing.

Hearing dogs allow their handlers to become aware of important sounds such as doorbells, smoke
alarms, passing traffic, a ringing telephone, or an alarm clock. They also can work outside the home as
24/7 hearing dogs and alert to sounds such as sirens, fire alarms, fork lifts, people coming up behind
someone quickly, name call, and other sounds.

Hearing dogs may be trained professionally in as little as three months; however most are trained for a
year. They are trained to recognize, then physically alert or lead their handler to the source of the sound,
paw the owner for some sounds, and for others paw or jump on them but not lead them to it (example
fire alarm). They are tested for proper temperament, sound reactivity, and if they are willing to work.
Then they are trained in basic obedience, exposed to things they will face in public such as escalators,
shopping carts, different types of people, elevators and so on. After that they are trained in sound alert.

Some hearing dogs wear a blaze orange leash and collar to identify them.

In the United States, Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 allows these dogs access to
anywhere the general public is permitted to go; state laws also provide for access. There are fines and
also criminal penalities for interfering with a hearing dog team or denying access to a hearing dog. The
same penalities apply to a person trying to disguise a dog as a hearing dog illegally.

                                     Psychiatric Service Dog
                                                                                  Back | Home | Up | Next


A Psychiatric Service Dog is a dog that helps its handler with a mental (psychiatric) disability.
Common mental disabilities that sometimes qualify a person for a service dog include, but are not
limited to: Major Depressive Disorder, Bipolar Disorder, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Autism,
Agoraphobia, Anxiety Disorder, and Schizophrenia. Other psychiatric conditions which may also be
assisted by the use of a psychiatric service dog may include Borderline Personality Disorder, Conversion
Disorder, or Asperger's Syndrome, and many others.

Like all other types of service dogs, a Psychiatric Service Dog helps its handler mitigate his/her
disability through trained tasks, including but not limited to:

    ●   picking up/retrieving objects or aiding with mobility when the handler is dizzy from medication
        or has psychosomatic (physical) symptoms

    ●   waking the handler if the handler sleeps through alarms or cannot get himself/herself out of bed

    ●   alerting to and/or responding to episodes (i.e. mood changes, panic attacks, oncoming anxiety,
        etc.)

    ●   reminding the handler to take medication if the handler cannot remember on his/her own or with
        the use of an alarm

    ●   distracting the handler from repetitive and obsessive behaviors (such as counting or others which
        may accompany various disorders such as Obsessive Compulsive Disorder)

    ●   pressing an emergency-call or 9-1-1 button on a telephone or portable medical alert system in the
        event of a serious medical crisis

    ●   and many other tasks directly related to the handler's disability.

Psychiatric service dogs may be of any size and of any breed. Many are owner-trained (trained by the
person who will become the dog's handler), but increasingly, service dog training programs are
recognizing the need for dogs to help individuals with psychiatric disabilities. Some psychiatric service
dog owners may choose to refer to their dogs as "medical alert" or "medical response" service dogs.

Handlers of psychiatric service dogs are entitled to the same rights and protections afforded to handlers
of other types of assistance dogs, including guide dogs, hearing dogs, and mobility service dogs under
federal law, originating from the Americans with Disabilities Act. Psychiatric service dogs are
specifically trained to help individuals with psychiatric disabilities.

Seizure-alert and -response dogs are a special type of assistance dog that are specifically trained to help
someone who has epilepsy or is otherwise prone to seizures.

These dogs are trained to do various tasks- anywhere from pulling objects away from the person and
providing emotional and physical support during a seizure, to in special cases, alerting their charge of an
impending episode. Because of the differing needs of the people who own these special animals, each
dog is trained specifically for the person in need. Dogs that may become and are seizure-dogs must be
absolutely perfect for the job, and must be able to stay in control in all situations. Because of the
difficulty in training, only a few organizations train these dogs, although the number is rising.

                                                                                               Home | Up




                                 An anti-tank dog and tank

Anti-tank dogs, also known as dog mines, are starving dogs with explosives harnessed to their back,
trained to seek food under enemy tanks and armoured vehicles. By doing so, a small wooden lever
would be tipped, detonating the explosives.

The dogs were employed by the Soviet Union during World War II, to be used against German tanks.
Unfortunately, in battle the dogs were as likely to run beneath a friendly tank as they were to attack the
enemy. This was due of the fact that the dogs were trained to follow and seek food underneath Soviet
tanks, making the dogs less comfortable running towards a German tank. Also, the dogs were reluctant
to run towards an active tank, and as such became a menace to everyone on the battlefield. In 1942, after
dogs forced an entire Soviet tank division into retreat, dog mines were withdrawn from use.

The German army learned of the use of Hundeminen as anti-tank weapons, and on the Eastern Front
dogs were shot on sight, under the pretence that they were likely to be rabid. Dogs became scarce as a
result, making the use of dogs as a surprise weapon even more improbable.

After the war, more efficient and easier anti-tank methods became available, but there has been
speculation that this method was still being used by Russia as late as the mid 1990s.

1.2  Feridas cirúrgicas e infecção
    As infecções de feridas cirúrgicas são complicações pós-operatórias
comuns, que exigem bastante cuidado e custo. Em média 5% de peque-
nos animais desenvolvem infecções de ferida pós-operatória, mesmo com
o amplo uso de meios para minimizar a contaminação bacteriana na ci-
rurgia e uso de antibióticos. O resultado dessas infecções pode variar de
mínima morbidade facilmente resolvida até doença catastrófica com alto
risco de vida11.
    Todas as feridas cirúrgicas se tornam contaminadas por bactérias, mes-
mo quando se mantém uma técnica asséptica impecável. A evolução des-
sa contaminação para uma infecção depende de: ambiente e local da feri-
da, microrganismos envolvidos e mecanismo de defesa do hospedeiro. O
fator mais importante para uma infecção é a presença de microrganismos
no tecido da ferida. A cirurgia que preza pela técnica asséptica, reduz a
contaminação da ferida em um nível em que possa ser controlada pelos
mecanismos de defesa do paciente11.
    A duração da cirurgia interfere diretamente na quantidade de bacté-
rias que possam ter acesso ao ferimento. Para cada hora cirúrgica, o índice
de infecção praticamente dobra. O tipo de procedimento também afeta
fortemente a probabilidade de infecção. O risco de contaminação de uma
ferida é determinado pela classificação das cirurgias baseado no grau de
contaminação cirúrgico (tabela 1)11.
    As fontes de contaminação podem ser exógenas e endógenas. As fon-
tes exógenas incluem a equipe cirúrgica, instrumentais, panos de campo
e o ar. Se existir uma técnica asséptica rigorosa, a contaminação por via
exógena será mínima. Os microrganismos endógenos, originam-se do
próprio paciente. Essas bactérias causam possivelmente as infecções em
feridas limpas-contaminadas, contaminadas e infeccionadas11.

1.3  Classificação de feridas

                   Feridas traumáticas recentes (< 4 horas);
 Contaminada       Extravasamento dos tratos gastrointestinal e urogenital;
                   Grande falha na técnica asséptica.

                   Ferida traumática (> 4 horas), tecidos desvitalizados ou corpos estranhos;
  Infeccionada     Orgão perfurado;
                   Inflamação bacteriana aguda ou supurativa.



   É difícil denominar a categoria da ferida com precisão baseando-se
apenas na avaliação do grau de contaminação e do tempo que ocorreu a
lesão. A classificação das feridas são úteis para determinar qual o melhor
tratamento para cada ferida12.


                                  2. CICATRIZAÇÃO

    A cicatrização da ferida se inicia imediatamente após uma lesão ou
incisão cirúrgica. Corresponde a reconstituição de um tecido pelas célu-
las que sobreviveram à lesão tecidual10. É uma combinação de eventos
celulares, físicos e químicos que restauram o tecido ferido e substituem
por colágeno. A cicatrização é influenciada por elementos do hospedeiro,
características da ferida e fatores externos3.

2.1  Fases da cicatrização
   A cicatrização é dinâmica, ou seja, apesar de possuir três fases, ambas
ocorrem simultaneamente.

QUESTÕES COMENTADAS

01 (COREMU – ULBRA – 2019)
As feridas cirúrgicas são classificadas de acordo com o grau de contami-
nação para auxiliar na previsão da probabilidade de que ocorra a infecção.
Sobre a classificação das feridas cirúrgicas, analise as assertivas a seguir:
   I –	 Uma ferida não traumática e não inflamada, na qual os tratos respi-
        ratórios, gastrointestinal, genitourinário e orofaríngeo não são pe-
        netrados, é considerada uma ferida limpa-contaminada.
   II –	Feridas contaminadas são as feridas abertas, frescas e acidentais;
        procedimentos nos quais o conteúdo gastrointestinal ou urina in-
        fectada escapa ou ocorre uma grande falha na técnica asséptica.
   III – Feridas sujas são aquelas nas quais a infecção está visivelmente pre-
        sente no momento da intervenção cirúrgica.
   IV – A laparotomia exploratória e a castração eletiva são procedimentos
       que estão inclusos na categoria de feridas limpas.

Considerando as assertivas, assinale a alternativa correta.

Ⓐ	 Somente I, II e IV estão corretas.
Ⓑ	 Somente I e III estão corretas.
Ⓒ	 Somente II, III e IV estão corretas.
Ⓓ	 Somente I e IV estão corretas.
Ⓔ	 Todas as afirmativas estão corretas.

                   ••°
GRAU DE DIFICULDADE 

Assertiva I: FALSA. Uma ferida não traumática e não inflamada, na qual
os tratos respiratórios, gastrointestinal, genitourinário e orofaríngeo não
são penetrados, é considerada uma ferida limpa11.
Assertiva II: VERDADEIRA. Feridas traumáticas, escapes do trato gas-
trointestinal e urogenital, e quando ocorre uma “grande” falha na técnica
asséptica, pode ser denominado feridas contaminadas11.
Assertiva III: VERDADEIRA. Quando há infecção aguda ou supurativa,
trata-se de uma ferida suja ou infeccionada11.
Assertiva IV: VERDADEIRA. A laparotomia exploratória e a castração ele-
tiva são procedimentos que estão inclusos na categoria de feridas limpas.
A laparotomia exploratória só deixa de ser uma ferida limpa, caso haja ma-
nipulação dos tratos genitourinário e gastrointestinal11.

Presentacion (edici6n espanola) 

5e han escrito tantas cosas sabre los petros, su modo de cornunicacion, su adiestramiento ... que parece increible que todavia puedan surgir libras tan interesantes y de alguna forma tan novedosos como el que nos oeupa en esta ocasion, 

La lectura de este libra resulta interesante y divertida. Es como redescubrirlas cosas que sabiamos de siernpre de una forma intuitiva. sorprence cuando alguien pone todas las plezas juntas y les da sentido, las estructura, sistematiza y da unas pautas, sintetiza y establece un rnetodo de anallsls de 10 que observamos. Oespues de la lectura de este libra uno disfruta mucho mas de la observadon y la comuntcaclon can los perras. 

Un libro esencial para todos los profesionales relacionados con el mundo del perro y para los propietarios. Escrito en un lenguaje muy directo, senciHo, sin tecnlcismos, para lograr comprender el codlqo que rige en la comunicacl6n de y can los perros, nos ayudaraa evitar conflictos y a disfrutar can mayor intensidad de la retacton can nuestros perras. Sin duda, este libra carnblara el modo en que te camunicas can tu animal de compafHa. 

Esto ha sido 10 que nos ha animado y decidido a tradueir y publicar este libra que, esperamos, tenga una buena acogida entre los profesionales y permlta continuar la publicacion de los ultirnos trabajos en el mundo del perro.

La historia de Vesla 

EI enorme Pastor de Brie reallzo un violento ataque acompaiiado de gruiiidos y ladridos. A toda velocidad se dirigia hacia la pequefia Eighund, que se pare, se quedo lnrnovil y giro su cabeza hacia un lade. EI perro se paro perplejo, desconeertado, a tan solo unos pasos dela Eighund, como sin saber que haeer. Entances, busco a un lado y a otro alguna actividad alternativa, olisqueanda ligeramente el sueio, distrafdamente, y final mente volvio al punta de partida. 

Ellugar de los hechos era mi pista de entrenamiento. EI Pastor de Brie era un perro con problemas de relacion can otros perros que un cliente habra trafdo a mi consulta. La pequefia Eighund era mi perra Vesla, de trece arias. 

Vesla siempre sabia 10 que habra que hacer y siempre se las arreglaba para apaciguar a los otros perros cuando se mostraban agresivos, asustados, estresados a slmplemente, la hostigaban. Durante once 

afios ningun perro ha sido capaz de conseguir hacerle perder el equilibria mental, [as nervios. Ella es el retrato de la supervivencia, una perra capaz de resolver conflictos, can todas las destrezas de comunlcadon necesarias para sobrevivir. 

4 EI lenguaje de los perros: las sefiales de calma 

Ves/a no siempre se habra comportado de ese modo. Uega a mis manos como una perra vagabunda, y tenfamos 113 intenci6n de encontrarle una familia que la adoptase dado que no se adaptaba a mis perras y mostraba un comportamiento muy agresivo y violento. Se peleaba, tenia reyertas, disputas, estaba estresada, era imposible, y yo no me sentia con fuerzas como para comenzar a adiestrarla. Pera nadie 113 querfa, par 10 que, con un suspiro de resignaci6n, decidimos quedarnosla y comenzamos a intentar integra ria en 113 «rnanada» de perras y gente. 

Fue un tiempo de pruebas y experlrnentaclon. Estoy convencida de que era el perro con pear comportamiento de todos los que habra tenido en casa. Perc, gradualmente, las cosas mejoraron. Deja de subirse por las cortinas. Cornenzo a salir junto con los otros perros Sin intentar morderlos todo el tiempo y conseguia relajarse de cuando en cuando. Y de repente, un dla, para mi sorpresa, vi que comenzaba a comunicarse con los otras perros. iEI trabajo de las otras perras camenzaba a dar sus frutas can ella! Cuanda me percate de que comenzaba a recuperar su lenguaje canino Intente apllcar mis rnetooos tradicionales de adiestramiento. Premiando todo 10 que hada en las suceslvas apraximacianes al comportamienta deseado: cada vez que dejaba entrever un signa de calma, yo la premiaba. Vesla/ progresivamente, rnejoro. Me percate, para mi sarpresa, de que era posible refarzar su prapia lenguaje con los prernlos, y luego las casas sucedieran muy rapldo. Mis das perras y yo la avudabamos. En poco tiempo se convlrtlo en el milagra del lenguaje canina. Un ana mas tarde, ya habra desapareclda todo su camportamienta agresiva, y desde entances hasta hay, dace afios mas tarde, nunca ha tenida altercado alguno con otras perros. Simplemente no consiguen hacerle perder el control. 

La historia de Ves/a me ha hecho camprender que es posible devalver a los perras el lenguaje perdido. Desde entonces he hecha de esta ensefianza mi modo de vida y mi trabajo principal. Adernas, ha enriquecido rnl vida, ya que ahora entiendo, cornprendo mejar, que sienten los perras. Sienta realmente que me comunfca can ellos. Yesa me produce buenas vibraciones, casl como el suefio infantil de canseguir hablar con las animales. 

Gracias Vesta, par todo 10 que me has enseiiada. Has cambiado mi vida.

Introduccion de Terry .Ryan 

Acontec16 en la VI Conferencia Ioternaclonat, Los animales y nosotros, sobre la lnteraccion personas-animales, en M.ontreaL. Una de las personas asistentes al seminario, atenta y tranquila, era Turid Rugaas, que estaba sentada unas filas par delante de mf durante las presentadones sobreel comportamiento canlno, Turid nunca podria ser una buena jugadora de poquer. Enseguida me percate de que sus hombros se tensaban a relajaban dependiendo del ponente. Lo gradoso del case era que su lenguaje corporal reflejaba can precision la opinion que me rnereclenlas presentaclones de los conferenciantes .. 

«Los perros, como anlrnales de manada que son, tienen un lenguaje para comunicarse entre elias. En genera.I, el lenguaje canino consiste en una gran variedad de sefiales utllizando cuerpo, 

iContactos! .iPara eso sirven los simposium! Deseaba conocer a esa extranjera cuyas opiniones sobre temas de comportamiento paredan ser muy sirnllares a las mias. AI percatarme de que el inqles no era su Ilengua rnaterna, y precuntandorne sila entenderla, me pase la jarnada hacienda acapio de fuerzas para presentarme ante ella. Desde aquel encuentro en 1992, he estada en numerosas ocasiones can Turid. La he invitado como ponente en los seminarios, presentaciones sabre eomportamiento y sesiones practtcas de adiestramiento que he organlzado tanto en los Estados Unidos como en el extranjero, En todos los lugares por los que ha pasado ha cautivado a la audiencia. Fue muy popular en Japan can sus Oj05 azules y sus caletas rubles, 

La granja de Turid, Ha.gan Hundeskole, rodeada de una densa floreste, esta sltuada en la elma de una montaFia desde la que se divisa una panoramica de los flordos noruegos. Gente de todas partes del pars Ie lIeva sus perras para que los adiestre en las respuestas basicas y resuelva los problemas de comportamiento. He estado alii observandola durante sus sesrones de trabajo can los perras y me he quedado Impresionado. He descubierto su gran conocimiento del camportamiento canino. La siguiente cita muestra la esencia dela teorla de las sefiales de calma de Turid Rugaas.

Estas son habUidades que, cuandolas aplicamos en nuestra lnteracdon can los perros, resultan enormemente beneficiosas para la relacion. Los petros tienen la habilidad de apaciguarse entre sf cuando afrontan una situation traurnatica (sltuadon de rniedo a estresante) y tarnbien para caimarse unos a otros, Consideremos, par ejemplo, la forma en que se presentan a otros, Los perros que se rnuestran temerosos en unencuentro "social" pueden comunicar diversas sensaciones como: "Se que aqui eres el lfder y no voy a darte problemas." Adernas, el llder puede tarnbien querer comunicarle que no tiene lntenclon de crear problemas. "No te preccupes, yo soy el jefe aquf y no tengo intenclon de hacerte dana." Los perros que no utilizan lias sefiales apropladas pueden ser los causantes de problemas».

Como muchos de los entusiastas de los perros, estaba demasiado ocupada dedlcandose al tema como para ponerse a escrlblr sabre el, Los capftulos que presentamos a contmuaclon representan una traducclon directs de los conceptos, en Noruego, de Turid. Los terrninos y expreslones se han conservado, sin intentar cambiar la sintaxis para cumplir las reglas qramaticales. Esta es una decision intencionada par rni parte, con laaprobaclon de Turtd. Can frecuencia, cuando tratamos de expresarnos en una lengua distinta a la nuestra, nos encontramos que no hay una palabra aproplada para la idea que deseamos transrnltir, Desprendarnonos del Jenguaje establecido y de las barreras que impone el ldioma.

Adorei! Mas como estudar?

Você estuda por questões desde a escola. É uma forma de exercitar o cérebro e condicio-
ná-lo aos assuntos que podem ser cobrados. Para um concurso, usar provas anteriores
como método de estudo é o que você precisa para entender o funcionamento da banca
ou instituição, perceber quais assuntos mais caem, se acostumar com o estilo das ques-
tões e reforçar os estudos num assunto que você percebeu não dominar tanto assim.

Isso não parece ser uma grande novidade. Mas resolver questões há bastante tempo não
significa que tenha aprendido a estudar de forma eficaz e direcionada para provas de
concurso, não é mesmo?

Por isso, quero te dar 3 dicas de como estudar por questões (e ainda tem um bônus!)

   •	 Estude primeiro, responda depois - Isso vai te ajudar a se organizar melhor e apro-
      veitar o momento de resolver uma questão para também revisar e identificar o que
      você precisa reforçar. Vale usar o resumo do livro para este momento do estudo.

   •	 Varie as questões - Evite responder as mesmas questões sempre. Com o passar
      do tempo, você poderá não ser capaz de perceber se acertou porque aprendeu
      ou se porque decorou.

   •	 Identifique o assunto do enunciado - Na hora de resolver provas anteriores,
      tenha um pensamento estratégico para entender quais temas aquela instituição
      costuma cobrar e de que forma.




                                           Lembre-se!
                               Quando a questão é comentada, como
                                 acontece neste livro, o aprendizado
                                 é potencializado. Afinal, ao mesmo
                               tempo em que você responde o que foi
                               perguntado no enunciado, você confere
                               se a resposta foi correta e aprende com
                               os comentários das alternativas (e aqui
                                vai mais longe, com a dica do autor e

3 passos para um
estudo inteligente

Quero te contar um segredo: não adianta estudar sem foco, planejamento e organização. Senão, você
vai acabar caindo na armadilha de estudar de forma pesada (e não inteligente), fazendo da sua jorna-
da rumo à aprovação um peso que será difícil carregar - e provavelmente sem resultado.

Para quê estudar pesado se você pode estudar de maneira inteligente? Estudos inteligentes farão
você utilizar seu tempo e energia naquilo que mais importa: estudar com qualidade e com foco no
progresso! Você já sabe que estamos do seu lado, segurando a sua mão, para você conseguir ter su-
cesso, então separei estes 3 passos simples e certeiros.



           1. Preparação
           É essencial estudar de forma focada e direcionada. Por isso, a preparação é tão importante
           quanto o estudo em si. Separe um tempo antes de começar para planejar seus estudos,
           considerando um dia que você deseja começar, quais materiais vai usar e ainda criando
           seu próprio cronograma de estudos.


           2. Mindset
           O mindset é uma atitude mental que determina a forma como você vai responder às situa-
           ções. No seu caso, foque em otimizar os estudos, com toda a energia e atenção que você
           pode dar. Isso significa não procrastinar e não se distrair.


           3. Não decore, entenda!
           Você pode descobrir a forma que mais funciona para você. Use abuse de fichas de estudo,
           mapas mentais, resumos escritos e falados. Aposte em associações e busque se envolver
           com os conteúdos.
            A prática leva à
            perfeição aprovação
Você sabe que procurar questões não é tão simples. Aposto que acaba perdendo um
bom tempo para encontrá-las.

Agora imagine um aplicativo com milhares de questões... Gostou? E melhor ainda: um
app que você pode filtrá-las por profissão, disciplina ou assunto e entender quais
errou e acertou.

Esse aplicativo existe: é o app Sanar Saúde! São mais de 100 mil questões gabarita-
das da área de Saúde inteiramente GRATUITAS para você se preparar para as provas!

                    { Só mais um detalhe }
Sabemos que tem uma coisa inevitável quando estudamos com questões: errar. E a maioria das pes-
soas fica frustrada quando isso acontece.
Queremos te ver sempre motivado e sabendo que nada poderá te desviar da sua trajetória que já é de su-
cesso (e só depende de você!). E nunca se esqueça: errar faz parte de todo aprendizado. Ninguém aprende a
andar de bicicleta sem tomar umas boas quedas. É melhor errar treinando para a prova do que na hora H, né?
Então separamos 6 coisas que você aprende ao errar uma questão para que você possa voltar aqui
quando isso acontecer.

       Saber qual assunto você não entendeu muito bem
Às vezes, achamos que dominamos um assunto da raiz do cabelo até a ponta do pé, até que chega
o momento de passar da teoria para a prática: a hora de resolver uma questão. É neste instante que
você pode fazer uma avaliação sincera do seu método de estudo e entender qual lacuna ficou faltan-
do, e ir com tudo para se sentir confiante de novo.

       Ficar craque em identificar pegadinhas
Algumas bancas são experts em fazer questões com pegadinhas e a gente sabe: é bem frustrante
errar por uma “bobagem” dessas. Porém, logo depois da atenção plena na hora da leitura do enuncia-
do e das alternativas, a melhor saída para não cair nestas armadilhas é praticar muito para entender
quais são os pontos certeiros que podem querer te desviar da alternativa correta.

       Entender quais matérias está com dificuldade
Este tópico é bem parecido com o primeiro que listamos aqui, mas tem uma diferença. Ao resolver
questões de provas, você pode não só entender aquilo que achava que dominava como também
identificar matérias que você precisa estudar pela primeira vez ou fazer uma boa revisão por não estar
conseguindo marcar a alternativa certa.

       Relembrar coisas que já tinha esquecido
Acreditamos que isso já pode ter acontecido com você. Sabe aquele assunto que foi o primeiro que você
estudou, mas só errando a questão e conferindo o gabarito você lembra na hora aquele tópico que havia
esquecido? O erro vai te ajudar a reforçar o que você precisava lembrar e já tinha ficado no fundo da caixola.

       Listar o conteúdo que falta estudar ou revisar
Só ficar chateado ao errar uma questão não adianta nada, né? Então, no momento que reservar para resolver
questões, você pode fazer uma listinha (no papel ou até no celular) de todo o conteúdo que você precisa
estudar ou revisar. É uma dica para otimizar as suas revisões e também fazer ajustes em seu plano de estudo.

       Ficar fera em interpretação de texto
Quanto maior o seu repertório de questões resolvidas (até mesmo erradas), mais você vai melho-
rando a sua performance neste quesito e se preparando ainda melhor para a hora “H”. Isso porque
você vai aprendendo cada vez mais a interpretar o texto dos enunciados e também das alternativas,
tornando tudo mais fluido quando chegar a tão sonhada prova.

                           Dito tudo isso, só temos uma coisa para te desejar:


       BONS ESTUDOS E CONTE SEMPRE
