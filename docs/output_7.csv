were you going to [00:04] I I heard you say something I was going [00:07] to remind you that often we get talking [00:09] because we're so comfortable here and we [00:11] forget to say really who we are and [00:14] where we're from and oh yeah we do talk [00:16] a little bit about that I did do that in [00:17] the intro but I think it's good that you [00:19] point out that fact like that we [00:21] actually are dog trainers we actually [00:23] have a training facility talk a little [00:25] bit about that yeah so we do have a we [00:26] have an in-person training facility in [00:29] um Ontario Canada and then we have uh [00:32] online classes as well so for people who [00:34] are not in our area can still take our [00:36] same programs we have um students from [00:39] uh how many countries now onine 70 up to [00:43] 70 different countries which is great [00:45] very cool um sort of neat my our [00:47] business is family-owned so it's um my [00:49] parents started the business 41 years [00:52] ago now which is crazy so I've grown up [00:54] around dogs and dog training my whole [00:56] life um and then um Ken's been a trainer [01:00] at mcan's for 15 years now 15 years now [01:03] which is how Ken and I um met each other [01:05] yeah um but um our goal is to help you [01:10] guys learn to have a well-trained dog [01:13] but really what that leads to is [01:16] allowing you to enjoy life more with a [01:18] dog because we know that the more [01:20] well-trained dogs are the more we [01:23] integrate them into our life the better [01:25] relationship we have with them the [01:27] longer they live probably the longer you [01:29] live because you're out walking them and [01:31] enjoying your walks instead of being [01:32] dragged everywhere so we're really [01:34] looking to teach you how to um be a good [01:39] leader and also make training fun you [01:42] know you see a lot of training out there [01:43] that's very structured and we love [01:45] structur for sure but we also want to [01:47] make sure you and your dog are actually [01:49] having fun together um and you'll see [01:51] from watching our training that that's a [01:53] big portion of what we do Mary H [01:56] dropping the Super Chat Mary Mary coming [01:58] out dropping the super sticker thank you [02:01] Mary for [02:02] that Merry Christmas to you too Mary we [02:05] do appreciate it um I saw a great [02:07] question in the chat saying are you [02:09] going to have some more advanced online [02:11] courses coming up soon and uh what a [02:14] great opportunity to tease a little bit [02:17] we do have some more advanced courses [02:19] coming up kale was just talking a little [02:20] bit about um how we insist that training [02:24] be fun you know it's it's got to be [02:26] effective and part of that part of being [02:28] effective is making it fun for you and [02:29] your dog there's that Mary just lighten [02:32] the train station up in holiday spirit [02:36] um it's very cool but um we do have some [02:39] more uh um uh advanced classes coming to [02:41] our online programs we just want to make [02:43] sure that we like to move slowly on [02:45] stuff like this because there's a [02:47] million things out there we want ours to [02:48] be the best for you and your dog so uh [02:51] yeah we have something coming all right [02:53] 2024 let's talk a little bit about the [02:55] number one the first problem um that [02:58] people are going to encounter this [02:59] holiday season and how they can overcome [03:01] some of these challenges and that is [03:02] probably and I mean you can apply this [03:04] doesn't just have to be the holidays you [03:06] can apply this to anyone who has a busy [03:09] schedule but the holidays is especially [03:11] challenging because you know for those [03:13] handful of days if you celebrate [03:15] Christmas Around the Christmas time it [03:17] can be just non-stop it's exhausting so [03:20] let's talk a little bit about some of [03:21] the um planning pre-planning that you [03:25] need to do when it comes to those super [03:27] condensed busy that the holiday season [03:29] yeah this is something that I find I we [03:32] always seem to have not this year but I [03:34] mean last year the year before we had a [03:36] young dog around Christmas time and this [03:38] is definitely something that I mean all [03:40] of the dogs it affects especially young [03:42] dogs that don't know how to just go and [03:44] chill out quite yet and when you're busy [03:46] for Christmas and you're on the go maybe [03:48] your schedule's a little bit more heavy [03:49] and you're trying to manage you know [03:51] dealing with a puppy and then having to [03:53] go keeping your puppy um well exercised [03:57] so that you actually don't feel as [03:59] guilty um you know having to have them [04:02] in the crate a little longer because you [04:03] have family over maybe you have to leave [04:05] and go to a Christmas parties or you're [04:08] out Christmas shopping or whatever it [04:10] might be and you just don't have maybe [04:12] additional time that you normally do to [04:15] um train puppy exercise puppy play with [04:18] puppy all of that stuff it can be really [04:20] challenging so you know we want to uh [04:23] recommend that you really think about [04:25] scheduling that time into your day um [04:28] but we can also give you some ideas on [04:30] how to do that really efficiently [04:32] because I think a lot of people think [04:34] exercise and they only think about [04:36] physical exercise which is important but [04:39] we know that um exercise can be both [04:42] body and mind so the one of the best [04:45] ways to to Tire your dog out so that [04:48] they'll actually crash and go to sleep [04:49] in their crate when you leave them for a [04:51] while is to actually do something that [04:54] exercise them physically and mentally um [04:56] I can give you a few ideas in uh just a [04:59] moment moment but I did want to talk [05:01] about the physical and mental side of [05:03] things because you could throw you know [05:05] a toy for your dog or dub retrieve or [05:07] you know let them run around in the [05:08] backyard mindlessly for a half an hour [05:11] but that's actually not as good as doing [05:13] a couple training exercises where they [05:15] have to move around and then use their [05:17] brain which could maybe only take 10 [05:19] minutes and you'd actually Tire the dog [05:21] out more because it's not necessarily [05:23] about how long you do it's about what [05:25] you do which is important when you're [05:26] tight on time and you're trying to you [05:29] know accomplish having a tired and happy [05:31] puppy yeah we talk a lot about [05:33] efficiency you know how can you make the [05:35] most of your time so that your your dog [05:37] benefits your puppy your dog in training [05:39] benefits from that and um you know I was [05:42] just thinking back I remember we filmed [05:45] a um maybe it's a 24-hour puppy video uh [05:49] a while ago but you talked about the [05:50] order you talked about like getting your [05:52] dog ready for that your puppy ready for [05:53] that overnight period is as easy as [05:56] starting the plan at dinner time doesn't [05:58] take any extra time but you start [06:00] planning out okay here's Meal Time [06:01] here's a little bit of training here's [06:03] some uh physical exercise and then [06:05] here's some mental exercise trick [06:06] training like using a little bit of [06:08] shaping doing something with your dog [06:10] that um really gets some thinking and [06:12] it's a nice way to sort of land the [06:14] plane the other nice part about working [06:16] on some of those uh exercises just [06:17] before their bedtime is uh it stimulates [06:20] a bowel movement or you know you know [06:22] you're taking your puppy to uh to bed or [06:24] putting them in their kennel or crate um [06:26] with an empty bladder and bowels and [06:28] that's really helpful but super [06:30] important especially when oh boy the [06:33] family's coming over at 11: this morning [06:35] what on Earth are we going to do with [06:36] this puppy so let's talk about some [06:38] efficient ways to exercise your puppy [06:40] number one uh we have fuzzy ball tug [06:42] great great toy to engage with your dog [06:44] for those dogs that have a little bit of [06:45] play drive or ball Drive they love that [06:48] thing it's springy super easy to use [06:49] puppy tug puppy tug is the most [06:51] versatile tool that we uh offer but it's [06:54] also like so it's so um it's good for so [06:58] many dogs because you can can really get [06:59] them engaged but man does the exercise [07:02] the the amount of exercise that you can [07:03] do with your puppy and uh not just like [07:06] physically exercising them but training [07:09] them I I set aside a video I want you to [07:11] check out uh kayen I can this is from I [07:14] don't remember when we shot this but [07:16] it's it's it's older I think it was I [07:18] don't know a couple years or maybe two [07:20] think anyway it's perfect for those of [07:22] you who have a busy schedule this [07:24] holiday season uh let's see here okay so [07:28] we're going to talk about an exercise [07:29] called the restrained recall and um [07:32] whether you're doing it uh doing it uh [07:34] by yourself with like a a line around a [07:36] tree or a post or something some static [07:38] object or you're doing it with family [07:40] members which I think kale talks about [07:41] here great way to incorporate family in [07:43] the training but a great way to exercise [07:45] your dog a lot in a short period of time [07:48] this can be done outside backyard down [07:50] your hallway from one corner of your [07:52] living room to the other it doesn't [07:54] really matter the more space you have [07:55] the less reps you have to do but you [07:57] should know uh uh how to do this [08:00] exercise effectively and efficiently and [08:02] you're going to see through the course [08:03] of this how you can use it in your [08:05] training to build value for you let's [08:08] see clearly we haven't overdone it with [08:10] this puppy there is still energy to burn [08:12] so I'm actually going to show you an [08:14] additional version of the restraint [08:15] recall that include your family members [08:17] so if you have anybody that can help you [08:18] with this this is actually a great way [08:20] to get other family members involved [08:21] which could also help build [08:22] relationships with other people that the [08:24] puppy will be interacting with your [08:26] husband your wife your kids anybody can [08:28] get involved so I'm gonna ask my husband [08:30] to come and help me here all right so [08:33] Ken's gonna hold on to uh Percy and [08:36] again I have to lean to ensure that he [08:38] doesn't get uh get off anywhere make [08:40] sure he doesn't sneak [08:43] away I'm going to call him and then K's [08:45] going to release [08:49] [Music] [08:53] him I'm going to let him catch that toy [08:56] what a good boy am I going to play a [08:59] little game of tug good and just a [09:01] little tip when you're tugging with your [09:03] puppy try to make sure that you keep [09:05] your hands nice and low and that you're [09:07] not shaking the toy back and forth any [09:09] of the shaking that's happening with the [09:10] puppy Percy's doing that not me I'm just [09:13] sort of going with the flow of the tug [09:14] toy but I want to make sure I'm not [09:16] putting too much impact on his body but [09:18] at the same time I need to keep the toy [09:20] moving around to ignite my puppy's Chase [09:22] driveo that's really good and once I've [09:25] tug for a few seconds I'm going to reach [09:27] into my pocket and I'm going to trade in [09:29] this tuing is really what [09:31] helps there we go I can sneak that toy [09:33] away you can see I just did a little bit [09:36] of training there so he was tugging like [09:37] a maniac into get the back teing our [09:40] puppies out with exercise we talked [09:41] about building a good relationship but [09:43] where we're going with this exercise is [09:45] that we are starting a great foundation [09:46] for teaching our puppy to have a really [09:48] reliable response to name now I've done [09:51] several repetitions with Percy now so I [09:53] want to show you how quickly this can [09:55] start to take action so oh yeah this is [09:57] pretty cool so let's talk briefly for [09:59] the these for those of you who are [10:00] thinking about using this as an exercise [10:02] in your day-to-day which you should be [10:04] um or if you're going to use this like [10:06] before family comes over or something so [10:08] there's a few things that you've just [10:09] worked on there you've built value for [10:10] the dog's name you built value for you [10:13] and your motion away from the dog you've [10:15] uh taught your dog how to drop a food [10:18] drop a toy for food you've also built a [10:21] little bit of toy drive for that dog so [10:23] like you have covered a lot of bases in [10:25] your dog training and how long did that [10:27] take like 25 seconds of exercise like [10:30] it's just such it's so like content [10:32] dense and that's what we love about the [10:34] way the strategies uh like this to uh [10:38] speed up your dog training and uh your [10:41] dog enjoys the whole thing like Percy's [10:43] uh Percy you can see it with pery loves [10:45] this activity and the amount of training [10:47] it's done is amazing and you you could [10:49] do it outside like we're doing it [10:50] outside in the video but you also if you [10:52] have like a hallway um you know you [10:55] don't have to do this outside you just [10:56] need a little bit of space where you can [10:57] run a little bit so that you can get [10:59] your puppy to chase you that's a big [11:00] aspect of the restraint recall um but [11:03] yeah yeah I'm going to uh I can actually [11:05] cut back to the uh do you want to watch [11:07] the do you want to see the uh the test [11:09] okay so kale uh this night kale had [11:12] worked with this puppy I mean you saw it [11:13] on camera you saw one rep but I think [11:15] the puppy had three reps uh by then do [11:17] you have a dog at home that sometimes [11:20] responds to their name or sort of like [11:22] you call their name and he sort of like [11:24] I'll get over there but hold on I'm [11:25] going to sniff this thing and I'm going [11:26] to go that way well imagine your puppy [11:28] had this sort of energy and enthusiasm [11:30] on and I think you tested here it was [11:32] truly remarkable let's check this out I [11:34] have my my toy ready here but what I'm [11:35] going to do is just sort of let Percy [11:37] get distracted which is happening very [11:39] naturally with all of these leaves on [11:40] the floor here what I'm going to do is [11:42] I'm going to without showing them the [11:44] toy first I'm just going to call out his [11:46] name as happily as I did before and if [11:48] he looks up at me and leaves his [11:50] distraction I'm going to say yes to mark [11:53] that he's correct and I am going to take [11:54] off running and having a party the same [11:57] picture that he's seen before and then [11:59] I'm going to let him play tug when he [12:00] catches me so I'm going to wait till [12:01] he's a bit distracted he's very [12:04] distracted I want to get a bit more of a [12:06] head start cuz he's fast Percy [12:10] y I dropped the toy I dropped the toy [12:13] get this take [12:14] Le so cute boy did you see how he [12:16] snatched the leash there he said hey [12:18] this is fun I'm supposed to be tugging [12:20] on something and I just switched him for [12:22] the toy oh my goodness so only after a [12:25] couple repetitions was he able to put [12:28] together that word Percy that you're [12:29] saying which she doesn't really get very [12:31] much yet that means fun stuff is about [12:34] to happen and that means that I need to [12:36] be very um consistent about making sure [12:40] that when I'm training this my puppy is [12:42] focused what we don't want to be doing [12:44] is saying the name and then not getting [12:46] a reaction so only test the puppy the [12:49] way you just saw me do this if things [12:51] are going really really well that was [12:54] amazingy okay very that was great I love [12:57] the the the remind reminder that uh you [12:59] want to make sure your puppy is focused [13:01] oops you want to make sure your puppy is [13:03] focused before you um MH before you call [13:06] it their name yeah I wanted to say [13:08] something too um one of the um you know [13:10] if your puppy is really toy motivated [13:13] this is going to be something that um [13:15] happens very naturally for you the game [13:16] that we just showed you um if your puppy [13:18] isn't super toy motivated then I would [13:21] work on building a bit more drive and [13:24] one of the things that we do when we [13:26] have um certain toys that we're going to [13:28] use use for training is we don't let [13:30] like we wouldn't let Percy or we don't [13:32] let our puppies have access to our puppy [13:35] tugs or fuzzy ball tugs or things like [13:37] that they don't get access to that when [13:38] we're just hanging around the house we [13:40] have like a a set um list of toys chew [13:45] bones you know Kongs things like that [13:48] that our puppies can have and play with [13:49] all of the time but then we have a [13:52] separate set of toys that are only used [13:54] for training and for play together and [13:57] why that is important is you start to [14:00] train the dog that when you pull that [14:02] toy out you both are going to do [14:04] something fun together sometimes they [14:05] get to go run around the backyard with [14:07] it in their mouth and they get to play [14:08] keep away it devalues your importance [14:11] and that's not a good step for your [14:13] relationship and for your dog learning [14:15] to like to listen to you so it's [14:18] important that when you're playing with [14:19] toys you do um keep a few toys that are [14:22] very special that only come out to do [14:25] things together um and that's also going [14:27] to help up uh the excitement and if your [14:30] dog's not into it initially you know [14:33] work on making it a little bit more [14:34] exciting you can see me flipping it [14:36] around but it is worth the effort [14:39] 100% you may be you may have family [14:42] people come into your home uh who are [14:45] going to um you know you you you foresee [14:48] a challenge there's too many people in [14:50] your home maybe you're you've got to go [14:51] away for the holidays and you're taking [14:52] your young dog with you that's in [14:53] training uh you need some kind of [14:56] strategy to deal with the all these new [14:58] new people socialization is off people [15:01] focus on the idea that oh I need to I [15:02] need to rush introduction I need to [15:04] introduce my puppy to 10 people and 10 [15:06] dogs and 10 things and whatever um [15:08] that's not the case it's entirely dog [15:10] dependent but we're going to talk a [15:11] little bit about a strategy for [15:12] socializing your puppy in a way that can [15:15] actually get some of your friends and [15:16] family involved in the process um and [15:19] set your puppy up to be successful we [15:21] always talk about setting things up to [15:22] be successful this instance this [15:25] challenge is no different wait before we [15:28] get there [15:29] I see Maryann mat Matan with the 1999 [15:33] Super sticker thank you very [15:36] much let us know if you have a question [15:38] Maran for sure and be happy to answer it [15:40] for you Lisa McClure also dropping the [15:42] $10 super sticker thank you for that [15:44] it's her first Super Chat on a live [15:46] stream so thank you thank you Lisa for [15:49] you and I see let us know if you have a [15:51] question Sydney bilman thank you for all [15:53] the work you do uh first time ever on my [15:55] own puppy that's exciting Sydney's thing [15:59] um thank you for all the work you do [16:01] first time ever I'll have my own puppy a [16:02] toy poodle oh man you are in Choice yeah [16:06] great choice you may have seen hippie [16:08] Shake on the channel we have a toy [16:09] poodle yeah she's unbelievably awesome [16:11] so cute [16:13] um I'm confused with what the max in [16:16] maximum of time puppy can stay in a [16:18] crate in a day that is Humane great [16:20] question yeah let's talk about that yeah [16:23] um well the puppy actually when it's [16:25] young and it doesn't have any you know [16:28] skills like being able to go and lie [16:29] down and like hang out in a bed and not [16:32] chew things and all that kind of stuff [16:34] they're actually going to be spending a [16:36] lot of time in their crate um and I [16:39] don't actually want to give you a [16:40] specific like hourly number because [16:43] every puppy is a bit different but what [16:45] I will say generally speaking is they're [16:47] going to spend a lot more time if you [16:49] take the 24 hours they're going to spend [16:51] a lot more time in their crate than they [16:53] are out of the crate it's just when a [16:55] puppy you have a puppy you don't [16:56] necessarily want to have them in the the [16:58] crate for really really really long [17:00] periods of time at the same time so to [17:03] give you um like an example of what we [17:05] would do with our own puppies when [17:07] they're anywhere from 8 to you know six [17:11] seven months old um is they sleep in a [17:15] crate at night we get them out of the [17:16] crate in the morning immediately go [17:18] outside maybe spend a few minutes um [17:20] doing some training maybe some play Tire [17:23] them out have them work a little bit for [17:25] their breakfast and then we would put [17:27] them in their crate um and then we would [17:29] do what we needed to do or maybe that [17:31] means we would go to work and after a [17:33] couple hours we'd stop what we were [17:35] doing and go and get the puppy out and [17:37] let them out for a pee maybe a poo and [17:39] have another little 5 to 10 to 15 minute [17:42] little interaction session with them [17:45] play Train something that tires the [17:47] brain and the body like I mentioned [17:49] before and then we would put the puppy [17:50] back in the crate and we would go back [17:52] to doing whatever we needed to do a few [17:54] hours later we' take the puppy back out [17:57] repeat ring wash and repeat that that [17:59] same process and if we have you know [18:02] some extra time we might let the puppy [18:04] have a little bit of free time say you [18:07] know our puppies often get the most free [18:09] time when we're making dinner um but uh [18:12] free time also is um not free so um you [18:16] know for example if I'm making dinner my [18:19] puppy would have a line on they would [18:22] have a few safe toys that I don't have [18:23] to pay super close attention to in the [18:26] kitchen my kitchen would have baby gates [18:27] on it so that the puppy can't go [18:29] anywhere else usually Ken would also be [18:32] in the kitchen so one of us is kind of [18:34] paying attention to the puppy while one [18:35] of us is is um cooking um and that way [18:39] the puppies kind of be bopping around [18:40] maybe playing a little bit on their own [18:42] but they're not allowed to like wander [18:44] off into another room and have an [18:45] accident or eat something it's very much [18:47] like having a baby like you're you're [18:49] watching the puppy very closely and when [18:51] one of us can't pay attention we just [18:53] pop the puppy in the crate so sometimes [18:55] they're in for several hours sometimes [18:57] they're in for just a few moments and as [18:59] the training starts to move forward and [19:02] the dog starts to have more skills then [19:04] they start to spend less and less and [19:06] less time in the crate so that's sort of [19:09] the yeah you know so process yeah and [19:11] and to your point you know focus on [19:13] quality time out of the crate um and [19:15] what you'll start to notice is that when [19:17] it's time to go back in the crate the [19:18] puppy will lie down and go to sleep yeah [19:20] we actually have a great video it might [19:22] be like first day home with your new [19:23] puppy do you remember that when we had [19:25] uker um and we were doing exercises with [19:28] her and you know we put her in the crate [19:30] and you said at the beginning like she's [19:32] might fuss a little bit you know she [19:33] fusses but she's going to lie down in [19:35] like in 10 seconds on camera she just [19:37] lies down and then goes to sleep so you [19:40] know it's not about a definitive amount [19:42] of time you need to work your butt off [19:43] to make sure that puppy has been [19:44] exercised physically mentally you've [19:46] worked on whatever you can and then they [19:48] can go in their crate the reality is and [19:51] talking about this busy household when [19:53] it's the holiday season approaching you [19:56] need those moments to where where you [19:58] can't supervise the puppy no human is [20:00] capable of supervising a puppy 100% of [20:03] the time it's unfair to the dog it's [20:04] unfair to you you know you have a life [20:06] to live as well and it's important that [20:08] you are planning to have the puppy in a [20:11] safe place when you can't be observing [20:13] them same thing comes when it same thing [20:15] comes to the the the situation where you [20:17] have friends and family in your home or [20:19] you're out at friends and family uh you [20:21] know your puppy is going to require 100% [20:25] supervision otherwise they can get into [20:27] all kinds of trouble and maybe [20:29] accidentally you know maybe your puppy [20:31] is not a super confident pup and uh a [20:35] family member who just loves dogs they [20:37] totally get dogs picks them up and [20:38] they're scratching you know scratching [20:40] them and scrubbing them and rubbing them [20:41] all around and your puppy's mortified [20:44] this is why you need to have 100% [20:46] supervision of your puppy maybe even [20:48] more important when kids are involved we [20:51] hear horror stories of you know [20:53] situations where kids have you know [20:55] tried to help or you know gotten into [20:58] funky situations with dogs and because [21:00] their dog at home is okay when they lie [21:02] on top of them or when they hug them but [21:04] these social settings um especially [21:06] during the holiday season when you're [21:07] busy and kind of distracted require [21:09] Extra Care y um one of the um Maryann [21:13] who had given a Super Chat had said at [21:15] what age do uh should puppies be out [21:17] more and have more free time and worry [21:19] my puppy won't learn to be outside of [21:21] the crate which sort of Blends under [21:22] what we were saying um we don't we don't [21:26] um gauge freedom [21:28] by age marann and one of the reasons why [21:31] is it really just depends on the puppy [21:33] and who's training the puppy um Even in [21:36] our own household as professional dog [21:37] trainers we've had some puppies that um [21:41] can be have more freedom much at a much [21:43] earlier age than others you know yeah [21:46] like our most recent puppy who's two he [21:49] had freedom very very early because his [21:51] nature is that he's like a sunbathing [21:54] chill kind of dude we got really lucky [21:57] with him he's really really easy um [22:00] we've had other puppies she's 16 years [22:02] old now but when Funky Monkey one of her [22:05] older dogs now was a puppy um she was a [22:09] wild woman as a puppy and she really was [22:11] curious about chewing things much very [22:14] mouthy type of puppy and so um you know [22:17] she took longer for me to trust her when [22:20] she was free because she had to learn [22:22] more lessons so it's really not about [22:24] the age it's about the behavior of the [22:27] dog [22:28] um and I always say it's quality over [22:30] quantity you should never feel feel [22:32] crate guilt you as a human should not [22:35] feel crate guilt if you are doing what [22:37] you need to do to spend quality time [22:39] with your puppy when they are out of the [22:41] crate if you if they have had play and [22:44] they've eaten and they've exercised and [22:46] they've had a pee and a Poo put them [22:49] away and don't feel um bad about that [22:52] spend some time teaching your puppy how [22:54] to be calm you know when our puppies are [22:55] out of the crate I think somebody said [22:57] well I'm worried that my puppy won't [22:58] learn to how to be out of the crate [23:00] that's that's one of the things you're [23:02] working on when they're out of the crate [23:03] you know we work on on your bed [23:05] exercises we work on response to name we [23:07] work on leave it we work on go and lie [23:09] down we work on all of those things [23:12] that's what we're not just playing with [23:14] the dogs all the time we're teaching and [23:16] training them to do things so that I [23:18] actually have skills under my belt so [23:20] that when my dog's out of their crate I [23:21] I can do that and that goes for circling [23:24] back to other people in the household um [23:27] that we were talking about you want [23:29] everyone to kind of be involved in this [23:31] process because the puppies need to [23:33] learn to listen to everybody but we [23:35] really uh think that you know in the [23:37] household people should be responsible [23:39] for the puppy but if you have family um [23:42] you know family members like uncles and [23:44] you know not people that live in the [23:45] home but other family and friends that [23:46] are coming in it's not their [23:48] responsibility to control or train your [23:51] dog that's your responsibility so when [23:53] we have young dogs or any dogs and [23:56] people come into our home it's my job as [23:59] the owner to control my dog around that [24:02] person and I can either do that by you [24:05] know using some of my obedience skills [24:07] or sometimes I'd love to enlist the help [24:09] of my family and friends when five was a [24:11] puppy we have um very good friends of [24:13] ours that have two young kids um that [24:15] are like you know nine and seven and um [24:19] you know uh last year when five was a [24:21] puppy we did a little um recall puppy [24:24] Circle in the in the remember that in [24:26] the kitchen when they came over so I [24:28] gave the two girls a pile of treats and [24:31] you know the six of us sat around the [24:33] kitchen and we all practiced calling [24:34] five back in fourth and he would run to [24:36] whoever called him and got get treats [24:38] and then so like we got everybody [24:40] involved and five got some socialization [24:42] he learned some recalls we tired him out [24:44] we put him in the crate and then we had [24:46] a little Christmas uh visit so you got [24:48] to be a little bit creative get [24:49] everybody involved but make sure that [24:52] you're keeping control because not [24:54] everybody knows what to do and not [24:55] everybody does the right things so you [24:57] need need to be a good advocate for your [24:59] dog Sue K with a $15 Super Chat thank [25:01] you Sue says Sue says Sue says thank [25:07] you uh thank you for all you do support [25:10] you provide is awesome thank you for [25:12] providing the train station uh for all [25:15] to join and learn and dropped the heart [25:16] dog sticker have a Wonder holiday season [25:18] to you all thank you sue thank you sue [25:20] thank you for coming to our train [25:22] stations so regularly absolutely uh Pine [25:24] Manor Chicago uh weddings hi thank you [25:28] for the super sticker I think Pine Manor [25:30] has question Dan can has started to bark [25:33] to have me pick her up or if I'm eating [25:35] taking the collar not working and gets [25:36] me close to her face and then she bites [25:38] I'm concerned the holiday holidays visit [25:40] visitors will get worse and this is [25:42] going to come down to a lot down to your [25:45] planning your pre-planning your schedule [25:47] and your supervision um I think uh Y [25:52] what sort of advice can you give for [25:53] that so uh for this situation we have [25:55] prevention and we have Corrections we're [25:56] going to talk about prevention first cuz [25:58] that's always our our first um our first [26:01] uh thing so if you're getting a barking [26:04] to have um the puppy um the puppy wants [26:07] you to pick them up uh first things I [26:09] wouldn't I wouldn't pick the puppy up if [26:11] the puppy barked at me for attention I [26:13] would ask my puppy to do something else [26:15] I might say sit um I might give them [26:17] another job to do but I wouldn't pick [26:20] them up because they want up because [26:21] that's sort of the puppy kind of running [26:23] the show there or if you're eating and [26:25] the puppy says okay like hey pay [26:27] attention me that's a little bit [26:28] demanding um so instead um you can of [26:31] course put the puppy in the crate while [26:33] you eat and it's not a problem but you [26:35] could train through this so one of the [26:37] things that we love to do with our [26:39] puppies when we're eating is we have a [26:41] dog a dog mat or a dog bed that's right [26:43] beside where we eat and uh we will spend [26:46] some time prior to sitting down to have [26:48] meals to train the puppies to go and lie [26:50] down on the bed and remain on the bed [26:53] and once our puppies are sort of getting [26:54] the hang that we'll have the house line [26:56] on um we'll have the bed and I'll pull [26:59] it right beside my chair that I'm [27:01] sitting at the table and while we're [27:02] eating I'll reach down and reward puppy [27:05] for laying on the bed and when they're [27:07] young of course there's lots of times [27:08] where the puppies will get off the bed [27:10] because they are still learning and I [27:12] have my my hand on their foot excuse me [27:14] on the house line I can stop them and [27:16] just bring them back and have them lie [27:17] down on the bed and over time the dog [27:19] learns to have sort of a job to do and [27:22] it will get to the point where we would [27:23] go to sit down and five would just go [27:25] and lie on the bed all by himself [27:27] because he kind of learned the routine [27:29] um and he would lay there and watch us [27:31] you know eat but he wasn't jumping up [27:33] and trying to you know get our attention [27:35] or interrupt because he learned that [27:37] there was value of laying on the bed [27:39] because we would reward him for that so [27:42] that would be a first thing to do um [27:43] taking the collar obviously uh near the [27:46] face you want to be careful about that [27:48] so you might just need to adjust your [27:50] Technique um a little bit and maybe our [27:52] instructors can give you a little bit [27:54] more um specifics on that but um you [27:56] could also just practice putting your [27:58] foot on the line instead and keep your [28:00] body posture a little bit more up tall [28:03] but we do we're not going to be as [28:05] effective if we're holding the puppy uh [28:06] near our face so of course having them [28:09] near your face you're going to get a [28:11] higher chance of the puppy nipping but [28:13] uh regardless of that it's just not an [28:15] effective place to try and you know take [28:17] be in a bit more control of the puppy we [28:19] want to try and keep our posture up and [28:21] the puppy uh a little bit lower even [28:23] when using the collar technique but I [28:25] think maybe utilizing the house line uh [28:27] could be a better a better option H for [28:29] you Walter H thank you for the Super [28:32] Chat uh I have a three-month old German [28:34] Shepherd had him since November the 4th [28:36] over the past two weeks he pees this is [28:38] a great uh segue speaking of Segways uh [28:41] he pees while I'm putting on the color [28:43] and Leash On to go out to go for a walk [28:45] into the bathroom how do I stop this so [28:47] this is sort of a multi-tiered strategy [28:50] um first why he's peeing yeah for sure [28:53] so let's talk a little bit before we get [28:54] to some of your house training [28:55] strategies or or you know if you're [28:57] struggling with housebreaking um for a [29:00] holiday season let's talk a little bit [29:01] about the setup the situation that this [29:03] poppy might be in and what I'm thinking [29:05] is should be wearing the collar all the [29:06] time if you're having a struggle like [29:07] this you also have more control if your [29:09] puppy has a collar and a house line on [29:12] all of the time if you're working on [29:14] something like house training or potty [29:15] training it's great this is one of the [29:17] reasons we encourage people to wear have [29:20] the puppy drag a house line all the time [29:22] because then you can take control really [29:23] quickly and that transition from the [29:25] period that they're in the house and the [29:26] time that they're outside is shortened [29:28] dramatically know a lot of people are [29:30] concerned about their dogs wearing a a [29:32] collar all the time or dragging a line [29:35] around the house but I'll tell you a [29:36] properly fitted collar is not going to [29:38] get your puppy into trouble um they're [29:40] only going to be wearing they're only [29:41] going to be wearing that house line we [29:43] we have hous lines at our store it's [29:45] basically you can go to a dollar store [29:46] buy a cheap leash cut the handle off cut [29:48] the loop of the leash off so that it [29:50] drags around but um your puppy is only [29:53] going to be wearing that when you're [29:54] supervising them they're only going to [29:55] be wearing that when they're out of [29:57] their crate so that if they get into [29:59] trouble whether it's house training [30:01] problem or they're chewing on something [30:02] or they're about to run uh up the stairs [30:04] or away with a sock you can step on it [30:06] but also in the situation where you're [30:08] house training your puppy there's no [30:10] delay they're they've already got [30:11] everything they need to on to take them [30:13] outside we we make house lines uh that [30:16] we sell at our Mand dos.
document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,, Part 142/429,store and we [30:18] put a white line on them we do that [30:20] specifically because when our students [30:22] come back if their line is totally white [30:25] we know they're not using their house [30:26] line enough like should be dirty because [30:28] we want you to use it inside outside [30:30] everywhere your puppy goes and um [30:33] there's that's no different than when [30:34] you're dealing with a house training [30:35] situation now let's get back a little [30:36] bit to house training strategies I [30:38] actually this might surprise you but [30:40] when I read this my brain went in a [30:42] completely different direction me too so [30:44] I'm also thinking that if you're waiting [30:46] that long that you're you're while [30:48] you're putting the uh collar and Leash [30:49] on that your puppy's having an accident [30:51] you might not be you might not be [30:52] proactive enough you might not be [30:54] getting them even different than that oh [30:55] interesting okay let's talk a little bit [30:56] about that that for a second um so when [30:59] I read this and I could be totally wrong [31:01] cuz I don't know your puppy but um I [31:04] know Shepherd's going to be a little bit [31:05] sensitive so again this could not be how [31:07] your puppy is but sometimes when you are [31:10] bending over to like reach over to hook [31:12] a collar and Leash On for some dogs that [31:14] actually can be very intimidating and it [31:16] could be what we call submissive [31:17] elimination so the puppy could be peeing [31:20] because they're sort of going wo this [31:21] is's a lot of pressure I'm not too sure [31:23] um so uh just be careful that your um [31:27] body language and your energy is a [31:29] little light if this is the case again [31:32] your puppy could literally just not [31:34] understand house training and just pee [31:35] but when I read that my brain [31:36] immediately went into submissive [31:38] elimination um and in which case when [31:40] dogs are peeing because they're being [31:42] submissive they actually don't know [31:43] they're peeing and so we can't correct [31:45] them for that because we correct them [31:47] and they they didn't know that they peed [31:48] so it doesn't make sense um yeah Robbie [31:52] read it as submissive elimination as [31:54] well sotally you just have to be [31:55] light-hearted I might just get some [31:57] treat out get the puppy up be very [31:59] nonchalant about it try to be careful [32:01] you're not bending over top of the dog [32:03] maybe kneel down when you're hooking the [32:04] leash on a lot of the things Ken said [32:06] were also excellent you could do both [32:08] but if it's a submissive thing um I [32:10] would just go about that differently do [32:12] you not think that there be less [32:13] likelihood for submissive elimination if [32:14] the dog's wearing puppies wearing a [32:16] house line you're not spending as much [32:17] time over top of them creating that kind [32:18] of pressure you can scoop up the line [32:20] and just go outside yeah yeah I'm saying [32:21] the house sign is good I just don't want [32:23] you corre if if it is submissive [32:25] elimination I don't want you correct the [32:27] dog in the house because they don't know [32:29] that they're doing it that was my only [32:31] Point totally I totally agree with that [32:32] the house time will definitely be [32:33] helpful but you just need to be careful [32:36] about how you approach so let's also [32:37] talk a little bit about house training [32:39] schedules in a busy household and why [32:41] it's important for uh Henry uh F who the [32:45] last Super Chat was from for Walter for [32:48] Walter to have a strategy for house [32:50] training as well as anybody who has a [32:52] dog in training needs to have a house [32:54] training strategy especially when it [32:55] comes to the holidays first sure so um [32:58] you know there's some pretty common [32:59] times where the dogs will need to go to [33:02] the bathroom and it's important or the [33:04] washroom we're Canadian we say Bathroom [33:06] potty whatever whatever whatever you say [33:09] whatever it is you know what I mean um [33:12] but uh so you know if woken up from a [33:15] nap that's a common time where they'll [33:17] have to go um you know if they are just [33:19] getting out of the crate um if they've [33:21] just eaten if they've just had a big [33:22] drink but one that a lot of people don't [33:24] um recognize is if the puppy is just had [33:27] a lot of physical activity so if you've [33:29] just trained with them or if they've [33:30] just had a big play you've taken them [33:32] outside and just had a big play with [33:34] them and then you bring them in and then [33:35] people say oh they've just gone to the [33:37] bathroom on the floor well it's because [33:39] once they start to get moving everything [33:41] gets moving and shaking in there and [33:43] then all a sudden they're busy and [33:44] mentally distracted outside they come in [33:46] they calm down and then they go oh I [33:49] have I have to go and then there you go [33:51] so if you can be more proactive to kind [33:53] of um know how to get your dog out at [33:56] common times where they actually need to [33:58] you can often stop a lot of accidents um [34:02] the other thing that's important to note [34:03] too is that you know we really like to [34:05] start to teach our puppies even from a [34:07] very very very young age how to let us [34:11] know when they need to go out and this [34:13] is really helpful um uh so that there's [34:17] a little bit more own um responsibility [34:19] onus on the dog um some puppies will [34:22] just naturally start to give uh signs to [34:24] the to the owners I've had a few dogs [34:26] that were very good about figuring out [34:28] just on their own to go to the door or [34:30] whatever it might be but I've also [34:32] raised lots of dogs that have not had a [34:35] clue how to ask me and I've actually had [34:37] to teach them to do something um in in [34:40] order to do that I don't know if you [34:41] want me to go into that or not but um [34:43] that's probably worth it for those [34:44] people who are struggling with something [34:46] like I was yeah so my favorite way to do [34:48] it just because I feel like it's very [34:49] fast is in the morning usually after a [34:52] long night in their crate um when they [34:54] get up that's a very not normal common [34:57] time for the puppy to have to go to go [34:59] pee um so what I will do is take the [35:02] puppy and I will rather than going right [35:04] outside with them to avoid an accident [35:06] I'll actually go to where the door to [35:08] outside is and I'll just put them down [35:10] like in our house it would be the [35:12] kitchen we have a door that goes outside [35:13] our house from the kitchen um so I would [35:16] just put the puppy down and I would [35:17] watch the puppy for a second and I'm [35:18] going to watch to see that puppy start [35:20] to go start to sniff start to go oh my [35:22] gosh I got to go I got to go I got to go [35:24] and when I start to see that type of [35:26] discomfort Fort from my puppy I can say [35:28] Hey you have to go outside and then I [35:30] can you know Teach an indication or I [35:32] can go to the door whatever your [35:34] situation is going to be our puppies [35:36] come and get us uh or they go to the [35:38] door those are the two things that we [35:40] train our dogs to do and then I can take [35:42] my dog out from there or the other thing [35:44] that could happen which is not the end [35:45] of the world is some puppies will put [35:47] them down and they think goac go to the [35:49] bathroom and then they just go in front [35:51] of you well now you are going to have [35:53] impeccable timing great training [35:55] opportunity yeah because you can say hey [35:56] hey hey hey hey what are you doing and [35:57] you can stop them in their tracks and [35:59] then pick them up and take them outside [36:01] and when they finish outside you can [36:02] praise and let them know outside is a [36:04] better option um but I know they have to [36:07] go in the in the morning so I can kind [36:08] of force the issue a little bit to [36:10] either have a learning opportunity if [36:12] they have an accident and I can catch [36:14] them or we can start the process of of [36:16] getting the puppy asked to go outside we [36:18] have awesome videos that explain this in [36:20] much further detail uh than this but and [36:23] we also have strategies I mean it's so [36:25] nice to be able to sit here with you [36:26] guys and answer your questions that roll [36:28] through the chat but wouldn't it be nice [36:29] to have access to a dog professional dog [36:31] trainer six days a week uh you know that [36:33] where you actually get to communicate [36:35] with a real human you get a support [36:36] advice a community that's like you going [36:39] through through some of the same [36:40] challenges and that's exactly what we [36:42] offer in our online puppy Essentials or [36:43] online life skills program or if you [36:45] live close to us you can join us in the [36:47] uh Mand dog training facility and uh see [36:50] us in real life yeah and I always say [36:52] with our online programs you know many [36:54] of you probably have watched many of our [36:55] YouTube videos um on on YouTube and [36:59] they're fabulous we love them they're [37:01] great but what we do with our our [37:03] YouTube videos is we give you a snippet [37:06] of how to train something we give you [37:08] the general idea but it is not [37:10] individualized for people and dogs and [37:13] that's something that we do different in [37:14] our programs so if you're saying I watch [37:16] your videos and I'm doing this thing [37:17] that it's not working well maybe you [37:19] need to be doing something slightly [37:20] different um because it's not a one-size [37:23] fit all and that's the thing that we can [37:24] do when you come in the program and we [37:25] actually get to know you and your puppy [37:27] we can actually help you know shape [37:29] things and if we give you something [37:31] that's not working we can say okay cool [37:32] now we know now you're going to try this [37:34] instead and we can problem solve and we [37:36] can get those uh those results so it's [37:38] excellent and we can give you strategies [37:40] so that you're not stressed out so that [37:43] that uh ongoing challenge of barking [37:45] overnight turns things into a [37:48] silent [37:50] night [37:52] holy [37:54] night okay you know what I love about [37:56] you what is you don't just sing one line [37:59] and stop you always take it one line [38:03] more than what you should do that's when [38:04] it gets funny to me like the first line [38:06] is like okay he's doing sine and the [38:07] second line he's like he's still doing [38:10] what is wrong with this guy that's my [38:11] favorite part of it now if you feel like [38:14] you are uh you feel like you're making [38:18] progress or I should say if you have a [38:20] puppy that's under um 5 months uh then [38:24] you would look at our puppy Essentials [38:25] program either in person or online [38:27] depending on where you live and if your [38:28] puppy's over 5 months you would be [38:30] looking at our life skills program again [38:32] in person or online [38:34] [Music] [38:36] um one one of the common challenges that [38:39] people have during the holiday season [38:41] are the new oh my God SES and smells and [38:45] sounds but uh if you believe that we can [38:49] make a difference here in the train [38:50] station why don't you Come All Ye [38:55] Faithful Joy [38:57] and [38:58] triumphant okay let's talk about uh [39:01] sights smells sounds I'm just going to [39:02] stare at himly when he this is one of [39:04] the questions that happened early in the [39:06] chat and I think it's an important one [39:07] um because this is like I didn't hear [39:10] anything these are the these are the [39:11] hilarious stories you know as long as [39:13] the dog's safe but where somebody says [39:16] like uh yeah I put the tree up yesterday [39:18] and it's down about 11 minutes later [39:20] what on Earth am I going to do around [39:22] the outside of around the tree you know [39:24] yeah absolutely let's talk about um the [39:27] challenges of new sight smell sounds um [39:29] things in your household that might be a [39:31] challenge for your new dog yeah it [39:32] definitely can be hard when you start [39:34] like putting the tree up and then you [39:35] have presents especially I've heard like [39:37] if people put presents for their dog [39:39] under the tree and then the dogs can [39:41] smell whatever is what a challenge that [39:43] would be um you know I I understand that [39:47] um and I do think that puppy proofing or [39:50] dog proofing maybe a little bit more [39:52] than you normally do at Christmas it's [39:53] just going to make life a little bit [39:55] easier but at some point we need to [39:58] train the dog to be able to not touch [40:00] humans things right um you know they [40:02] shouldn't they should understand that [40:04] the tree is off limits the same way you [40:06] know if they're not allowed to chew the [40:08] couch they also can be trained not to [40:09] chew the the Christmas tree or whatever [40:11] it might be um and the only way that [40:14] you're going to be able to do that is by [40:16] supervising your dog and by having some [40:18] management Tools in place um having that [40:22] house line that Ken has been uh [40:24] referencing so that you know if you're [40:26] decides to go over to the tree and they [40:28] start air scenting and they start [40:29] looking like they're getting into [40:30] Mischief you can use your voice but then [40:32] you can step on the line and you can [40:34] redirect your puppy away from the tree [40:36] and back your voice up so that your [40:38] voice actually has meaning you know [40:40] we're not dragging our dog around the [40:41] house with a leash on we're training [40:44] them when I say leave it you actually [40:46] need to leave it and then I might give [40:48] my puppy something better to do instead [40:50] I might have them go on their bed or [40:52] give them a bone or say go and do this [40:54] over here instead but then I'm going to [40:56] watch watch them because sometimes we do [40:58] that we turn and we go and do something [40:59] else for two seconds and then the [41:00] puppy's right back doing what they were [41:02] doing well that's not the puppy's fault [41:04] that's you're being a lousy supervisor [41:06] so um you know and if you get to the [41:08] point where you're like okay this puppy [41:09] is just on one right now maybe we need [41:11] to be exercising puppy a little bit more [41:13] and maybe we just need to you know put [41:15] the puppy in the crate a little bit more [41:17] for right now because what we don't want [41:19] to do is let the dogs keep rehearsing [41:22] the bad thing because rehearsal leads to [41:25] the dog learn learning the thing because [41:27] dogs learn through repetition doesn't [41:29] necessarily mean they learn through good [41:31] repetitions they also learn things [41:33] through repeating bad behaviors if they [41:35] do that same thing over and over and [41:36] over again that becomes the thing to do [41:39] so it is important that you're setting [41:41] your puppy up for success but you also [41:43] need to take some time to do some [41:45] training you know use the tree as a bit [41:47] of a distraction I love that idea have a [41:50] training session around your thing [41:51] actually we actually have a cool um um I [41:54] haven't shared it on socials uh today [41:56] but we actually have a cool Christmas [41:58] bingo card going around on socials right [42:00] now when does that go out um it's out [42:02] already um but um I think you can find [42:05] it actually really yeah that's a really [42:06] good idea but one of the things actually [42:07] several of the things that we have on [42:09] the bingo card are like we give you some [42:11] training suggestions on what to do with [42:13] the Christmas tree with presents with [42:15] like a bunch of things just so if you're [42:16] not really sure actually how to do the [42:18] training there's a bunch of like fun [42:19] little suggestions on this bingo card [42:21] and why we did it was just to give [42:23] people you know something to do with [42:24] their dog to keep them busy to entertain [42:27] them to exercise them so um uh it's not [42:30] that's last year's but we have a we have [42:32] a new Fresh one for this year but that's [42:34] okay this one's good too um but if you [42:36] go to our Facebook page or Instagram [42:38] Channel um you'll find it there very [42:41] cool um so we've talked a little bit [42:44] about training through some of these [42:45] challenges I think did you finish your [42:46] Nog I did it's delicious I think we need [42:49] to talk about some of the really great [42:50] opportunities that you now have or that [42:52] you can plan for over the holiday season [42:54] actually first kale you mentioned [42:56] mentioned uh you mentioned the [42:58] um uh things that your dog can get into [43:01] you know presents pulling down the tree [43:04] there's also some things that you need [43:05] to be aware of as a uh dog owner holiday [43:08] dog dangers we wanted to go over this [43:11] this is something instructor Shannon had [43:12] created and shared on social somewhere [43:15] some some of these things you'll [43:16] probably know about and some of these [43:17] things you might not know about yeah so [43:19] um chocolate dark chocolate and [43:21] sugar-free candy are especially toxic [43:23] things that Xylitol or there's another [43:25] name for it's called what Birch sugar or [43:27] something like that they've changed it [43:29] so but it's just it's the same stuff [43:31] it's just toxic alcohol ingredients like [43:33] hops grapes and sugars are toxic to dog [43:35] more alcohol for you less alcohol for [43:37] the dog that's right no alcohol for the [43:38] dog decorations shiny and attractive [43:41] they can cause an injury or blockage [43:42] your dog could be quite interested in [43:44] those things poinsettas many of our [43:46] favorite holiday plants are toxic for [43:47] dogs I think sometimes people don't know [43:49] about poinsettas mhm um cooked bones can [43:52] Splinter so as it when it comes to Bones [43:54] things you know like your turkey or [43:55] whatever that you've left up uh can be [43:57] actually really dangerous to your dog so [43:59] you don't want to give them uh cooked uh [44:01] meat like that that has bones in it [44:03] candles this is especially near and dear [44:05] to my heart as a 25 years as a [44:07] firefighter um got to be aware of open [44:09] flames and dogs cats pets knocking stuff [44:12] off of the window sill or you know off [44:14] of wherever can be really dangerous and [44:17] nuts some nuts are toxic nuts and and [44:20] others are high in fat I don't even know [44:22] what the the uh the nuts are that are [44:24] toxic and which are high in fats but [44:25] kind are those I don't know I don't know [44:27] you don't know what kind of nuts those [44:28] are no acorns or something they look [44:30] like acorns but I'm not sure what they [44:31] are oh so did you just say you don't [44:34] know what kind of nuts those are like I [44:35] like I was supposed to know and then you [44:37] don't know so what I was going to do is [44:39] I was hoping that you would know and [44:40] then I would be like yeah obviously but [44:42] you didn't wow wow well you know what [44:46] let's just deck you know my tricks let's [44:48] just deck the halls with the uh next [44:50] slide and talk about what we're moving [44:53] on to next opportunities let's talk [44:54] about sugar is what sugar that's right [44:57] yeah thanks busy with dogs okay uh [45:00] chestnuts they might be chestnuts I [45:02] don't [45:03] know thought I thought you were going to [45:05] let's talk about opportunities working [45:06] on exposure uh working on this is a [45:09] great opportunity to work with your [45:10] family work with your kids work with [45:12] people who are new to your puppy new to [45:15] your dog on like great socialization and [45:18] social socialization doesn't mean just [45:20] meeting people it means like being in a [45:22] space without going completely crazy and [45:24] just experiencing what it's like to have [45:27] people come through your door let's talk [45:29] about uh you know uh uh impromptu [45:32] training opportunity we're having people [45:34] over to the house we have a young dog in [45:36] training what are like a couple things [45:37] that you might want to work on for that [45:39] dog that would give them a great [45:41] experience yeah so if we uh know that [45:44] that situation is about to happen [45:45] there's a couple things that I would do [45:47] depending on where my dog is at in their [45:49] training um number one is sometimes when [45:52] I have a young dog in training I [45:54] actually like to keep that the puppy in [45:57] their crate initially when people first [45:59] start to come in the house because [46:00] that's when the energy is the most [46:02] exciting when people come into the house [46:05] and sometimes you can let them get in [46:06] let everybody get settled and once sort [46:08] of everybody's kind of chilled that's a [46:09] good time to bring the puppy out on [46:11] leash have some training treats ready [46:13] have a training toy ready and um you [46:16] know don't just let them out of the [46:17] crate and let them jump all over [46:18] everybody um you know have a a bit of a [46:21] a control and have a set idea of what [46:23] you're going to do with the puppy when [46:25] they come out um if my puppy's a little [46:27] bit further along in their training or [46:28] if I depending on who's coming and I can [46:30] get away with training my dog as [46:31] somebody comes in the door then I might [46:33] purposely get my puppy out with my [46:36] training leash my you know my treats all [46:38] of those things ready so when people [46:40] come in the door um perhaps Ken can [46:43] greet them and I can stand a little bit [46:45] further back and work a control sit at [46:47] my side or I might have my little dog [46:49] bed there and have my puppy lying on the [46:51] bed and as the people come in I can be [46:52] yes rewarding my puppy for holding uh [46:55] down on the bed and if they get up well [46:56] I have the leash on I can stop them from [46:59] jumping and I can encourage my puppy [47:01] back to jump on that bed and then do [47:02] some rewards again so I can be a little [47:04] bit more proactive um and um not just [47:08] allow my puppy just to run around and [47:10] and be a hooligan um I have my my line [47:13] and and my um training tools ready to [47:17] assist me in working on some more calm [47:19] control behaviors and I find that's a [47:22] really common time for dogs to be [47:23] jumping totally and so if you can have [47:25] leash on and you can work some sits and [47:27] some on yourr beds those are you know [47:30] good two fun things that you can do to [47:31] stop jumping that would be a better [47:33] option um also to to to your point you [47:36] know the time in between those training [47:38] sessions crate training is best done in [47:40] short spurts as well so if you can like [47:43] mix in some short crate training [47:45] sessions throughout that uh Day evening [47:48] whatever um it's a great opportunity to [47:50] get your dog to start to be more [47:51] comfortable in the crate one of the [47:53] greatest challenges that people have [47:54] with crate training is that they only [47:56] puppy they only put their puppy in there [47:57] overnight or they only put their dog in [47:59] there when they're going to work and [48:00] that's not great training for your dog [48:02] because you have to sleep you have to go [48:04] to work you have to do all these things [48:06] you don't have an opportunity to train [48:07] on this but knowing that you want to put [48:09] in a few sessions before the big day [48:12] before Christmas uh you know holiday [48:15] where people come over you want to have [48:16] an opportunity to think about these [48:18] exercises that sit at your side as [48:20] training think about it as training [48:21] because when the you game day comes uh [48:24] you want to be ready and it might not go [48:26] well and that if that happens that's [48:28] okay too you've learned a little bit [48:29] maybe you need to move farther away [48:31] maybe you need to work with less people [48:32] in the room whatever the situation is [48:34] it's okay but you need to know that um [48:37] it's a training opportunity uh I think [48:39] that's really important and I think it's [48:40] something that people often Overlook you [48:43] know like uh or or to your point earlier [48:46] I think it's such a valuable lesson for [48:47] those of you outside of the holiday [48:49] season when you realize that there's a [48:51] problem a behavior you don't like or a [48:53] skill that's not that great identify it [48:56] write it down commit to working on it [48:58] you know make it easier for your dog get [49:00] better at that thing and then you can go [49:02] back out into the real world and you [49:04] know work when it's more difficult but I [49:07] mean this is what dog trainers get that [49:09] um speeds the dogs through the process [49:11] speeds puppy ownership through the these [49:13] processes because we know what those [49:15] lines are that we can't cross yet with [49:17] those dogs uh and we take advantage of [49:19] opportunities during the holidays y [49:22] those nuts were hazelnuts uh they were [49:24] filbert nuts I believe someone said [49:26] isn't that the same thing I have [49:27] absolutely no [49:29] idea I don't know boy I've never heard [49:31] of filbert nuts ever before Oh no have [49:34] you no yeah oh yeah no you're lying uh [49:37] if it was like a little can of Nutella I [49:39] would have immediately known what that [49:40] was are they made a filbert nuts [49:42] hazelnuts what's wrong with you oh I [49:43] don't know oh I didn't I didn't know [49:45] that you didn't know Nutella was [49:46] hazelnuts no no you're you're kidding [49:48] right well this is embarrassing is my [49:49] nose red like Rudolph the red nose [49:52] reindeer guys I can't a very shiny nose [49:57] listen I hope all of you guys have an [49:59] incredible holiday season we're so happy [50:01] that we got to hang out with you uh chat [50:04] about chat about puppy training chat [50:06] about your dog training there will be [50:08] challenges and um you know I hope we've [50:11] prepared you for some of those this is [50:13] our last train station of the year is [50:15] there

he trains at tweet but that was [50:34] actually pretty good though kale I [50:35] appreciate you um but also there's lots [50:38] of familiar names and and whatnot in the [50:40] um in the chat which is great and we do [50:42] love to see that you guys keep coming [50:44] back thank God you find us somewhat [50:46] entertaining because sometimes things go [50:48] off the rails get it toot toot I am on [50:51] fire that's pretty good now and you know [50:53] what I'm I'm watching stuff happen and [50:55] I'm not listening closely enough these [50:56] are great I'm clipping these I'll put [50:59] them as shorts on our channel uh [51:01] remember that we want you to get out and [51:03] do something with your dogs your dog is [51:05] not going to get magically trained by [51:07] itself by hanging out in the backyard or [51:09] being in a crate all day long you know [51:11] you can you can use those tools to help [51:13] you but you need to put the work in in [51:16] order to get results and um it's so [51:20] worth it to live life with a [51:22] well-trained dog honestly it's just it's [51:25] the absolute best thing you will not [51:28] regret putting in a little bit of um [51:30] Blood Sweat and Tears hopefully not a [51:32] lot of Tears hopefully not a lot of [51:33] blood but a lot of sweat um I'm going to [51:36] stop talking now I think you get point [51:37] it's so true it's so true uh because it [51:39] makes a big difference and as you uh in [51:42] this holiday season as you wrap up 2023 [51:44] with your dog I hope you're getting [51:46] those wins uh and

Email HERE: studio905@mccanndogs.com Thanks for watching, Happy Training! ~Ken === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:01] Okay, we need to have a conversation about puppy nipping, [00:05] why it's happening and why the heck you're allowing it. [00:08] But the good news is we can fix this. Actually, you can fix this. [00:12] It's going to take a lot of hard work and consistency, [00:14] but we're going to talk about how to do that right now. Are you with me? [00:18] I'm Kayl McCann. Welcome back to McCann Dogs. [00:24] People constantly ask us how they can solve the nipping problem with their [00:28] puppy, [00:29] and I could give you all kinds of examples on how to correct the behavior. [00:33] But what people don't realize is they're actually doing things at home every [00:36] single day that are promoting puppies to nip and bite. [00:40] So today I'm going to talk to you about all of those things so you can make sure [00:43] that you are not making those same mistakes. Alright, [00:46] we're going to start off nice and easy, [00:48] and we're going to talk a little bit about tone of voice. [00:51] Now I am letting little Stevie be an actual nut job right now because I want to [00:54] show you that the use of our voice can actually encourage our puppies to be more [00:59] wild and crazy. When we see cute puppies, it's very easy for us to say, oh, [01:02] what a cute little puppy. You're so cute. Oh yeah. [01:06] And we have that high squeaky voice, and then it just ramps the puppy up. [01:10] Or we'll have other people that will say, no bite. No bite. [01:13] And they'll point and say, no bite. Now, [01:15] puppies don't come to you knowing what no bite means. [01:18] So it's better if you use calm, more assertive tones."
document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,, Part 146/429,"Now, [01:22] we don't need to yell and scream and be a drill sergeant with our puppies, [01:25] but we do need to speak to them in a calm tone. So I could tell her, settle, [01:31] yes. Good girl. Good settle. Good sit. [01:34] And then I'm going to see if I can just get her to chill out for a second. [01:36] Settle and sit. Yes. Good settle. Good sit. [01:41] So I'm still positive, but I'm not Sit, sit, sit. Good girl. [01:45] This just ramps her back up again. So how you speak... Okay, settle. [01:50] Good. [01:51] How I speak to the dog can really help promote the calmness that my puppy has. [01:55] Yes, good. And that's going to stop her from being more prone to nipping. Yes. [02:00] Good. Now you might be thinking, well, that's all great, [02:02] but what do I say if my puppy is nipping and biting me? Now, [02:05] we would actually suggest that you stay away from the word no. [02:08] It's such a common word that we use every day with one another. [02:11] You're two legged family members in the household. Instead, [02:14] we would have you choose a word that's going to be more specific for the puppy [02:18] when they make a mistake. It could be a low sort of growl, ah, [02:22] sound with your voice. It could be a phrase like knock it off or cut it out, [02:27] cut it out, or that's enough. [02:29] Something that you don't normally use in everyday life with your kids or your [02:33] husband or your wife. That's going to be specific to the puppy. [02:36] And then that's going to be followed by the appropriate discipline. Now, [02:39] there's something that I've been doing during this last segment that you might [02:42] not have noticed and that brings us to our next point. [02:46] Handling is probably one of the most important things that we need to focus on [02:49] with puppies, and unfortunately, [02:50] it's one of the things that a lot of pet owners make a lot of mistakes with. [02:54] Now, when it comes to handling, there's a couple things to think about."
document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,, Part 147/429,"[02:57] Most people when they think about it, [02:58] think about when we want to touch our puppy's paws or look in our puppy's mouth. [03:02] And there's certainly a way to go about doing that. [03:04] If I'm doing a lot of putting my hands on her head like this or just grabbing [03:07] her paw, [03:08] you can see I'm already starting to get the nipping right away. But I could go [03:12] about this a lot more differently to teach her to actually behave herself when [03:16] I'm doing these things. [03:17] And I might start off by having a bit of food on her nose, [03:20] and while she's nick licking and nibbling at the treat, [03:22] I could hold her paw in my hand. Good girl. Yes, [03:25] I could teach her from the start that when I need to hold your paws or when I [03:28] need to hold your ears or do anything like that, you just need to be calm. [03:32] Just a bit of treat association. And obviously as she gets more comfortable, [03:36] I can reduce the use of the food and I can actually go forth. [03:39] But what I don't want to do is just get right in there and be handling her in a [03:42] way that's going to provoke the biting. Now that's another thing. [03:45] A lot of people get a puppy and the first thing they want to do is get down on [03:48] the floor, [03:49] which immediately makes me be a little bit more like litter mate. And they love [03:52] to be really handsy and play with the puppy, like to get down and wrestle. [03:56] And yeah, this is lots of fun. But if I'm having puppy nipping problems, [04:00] all I'm doing is basically treating her like her brothers and her sisters would. [04:04] And look at all the nipping and biting I can have now when she gets a bit older [04:08] and she learns bite inhibition, [04:09] she learns about what she's allowed to use her teeth on and what she isn't."
document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,, Part 148/429,"[04:13] I absolutely could roughhouse and have lots of fun with her because she would [04:16] actually be able to learn to do that without putting her teeth on me. [04:20] But right now, as a baby puppy, I'm giving her mixed messages. [04:23] In one sense I'm saying, don't bite me, [04:25] and I'm getting upset with her about that. And then two seconds later, [04:28] I'm down on the floor and I'm encouraging her to nip and bite. And that is not [04:31] fair. [04:31] So we need to be very careful that we're not putting our puppy in a situation [04:35] where they're going to nip and bite. Now, [04:37] something you might not know about puppies is there are certain situations that [04:41] are more common for them to nip and bite. [04:43] So if I have a puppy who's nipping and biting, I'm not going to take a nippy, [04:46] a bity puppy and hold them up near my face. [04:48] Lots of people like to hold puppies like this. [04:51] Now this is a great way for me to lose the tip of my nose. And again, [04:54] this puppy does not have any malice whatsoever. [04:57] She is a wild and crazy young puppy who doesn't really have a lot of discipline [05:01] in leadership quite yet. It's coming though, my friend, [05:04] but having her up near my face like this is not a good idea. Now can you see [05:08] what I'm doing here? [05:10] Because I don't want to get nipped in the face as I'm talking to you guys. [05:12] I actually have my hand slipped in her collar, and this is a control technique. [05:16] I'm holding her in a way that she can't actually turn and bite my face. [05:20] What I don't want to do is open myself up to get nipped in the face or have my [05:24] ponytail be grabbed. That's happened many times before with young puppies, [05:28] but I'm holding her in a way that's a bit more controlled. [05:30] I have her snuggled into my side. [05:32] I have my hand in her collar for a little bit more control."
document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,, Part 149/429,"[05:34] And you see how much more calm she is in my hands because she feels secure. [05:39] And I'm going to add one more thing to the mix, and that is couches, [05:43] beds and things that are elevated. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on, settle, settle. [05:48] There we go. There it goes. Back to that voice thing I talked about. Good girl. [05:52] If I have my puppy up on the couch or up in the bed, that's another good girl. [05:56] That's easy. Thank you, baby. [05:59] That's another easy place for the puppy to be up near my face and be a little [06:03] bit too elevated. So if you're having a lot of nipping and biting problems, [06:06] I would discourage for the time being to not have them up near your face, [06:10] up on the couch, up on the bed there is going to be become, [06:13] settle a time for all of those things. I'm not saying that it's forever, [06:17] but for now, [06:18] try not to put your puppy in a situation where it's really easy for them to make [06:21] mistakes. Next, [06:23] I want to talk to you about rules and rules that come from family members in the [06:26] household. So you've probably heard this before, [06:28] but dogs and puppies crave consistency. [06:31] And one thing that can be really challenging is when we have some people in the [06:34] household that are trying to reinforce rules that are trying to be consistent [06:37] and following through. [06:38] And then there's other family members that aren't doing the same. [06:41] I just talked about being down on the floor and roughhousing with the dog. [06:44] If you're someone in the household that's really trying to get the puppy to [06:47] listen and then your husband or your kids or whoever comes home and they get [06:50] down and start wrestling with the puppy, [06:52] it can be really hard for your puppy to understand what's okay and what's not. [06:56] So right now because they're young, this is really the most impressionable time."
document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,, Part 150/429,"[07:01] It is important that everybody is on board with the rules and consistency of the [07:06] puppy that's going to make this whole process go a lot faster. Puppies love [07:11] when things are black and white. They don't like gray areas. [07:13] They don't like the sometimes rules or the maybe rules. [07:16] They want to know what they're supposed to do and what they're not supposed to [07:19] do. So it's really important that as a family, you guys sit down, [07:24] talk about what your expectations are going to be of the puppy and work together [07:27] to make sure everybody is following through. [07:30] Your training session is only as good as your training tool. [07:33] So today I'm going to pick up a few items that are going to make my life a [07:35] little easier. [07:36] The first is this house line so that I have good control in the house while I'm [07:40] doing my training session. The second thing I'm going to grab is a treat pouch. [07:44] This is going to make sure that I can get my treats out quickly and efficiently [07:47] and also keep all those slimy treats out of my pocket. Well, no one likes that. [07:51] And then the last thing is going to be a tug toy. [07:55] We're going to be talking about nipping and biting today, [07:57] and I'm going to be teaching you how something like this can help your nipping [08:00] and biting. [08:01] Now you can grab any of these items on our online store or come and check us out [08:05] in person. Come right inside, [08:07] take a tour of the facility and look at all the great stuff that we have. [08:09] In my 20 plus years of training dogs, [08:12] I have really learned over the years that there are two camps in terms of [08:16] playing with toys and how that relates to puppy nipping. [08:19] So there's the first camp that say when puppies are nipping, give them a toy, [08:23] let them get that release out on a toy rather than it being your skin."
document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,, Part 151/429,"[08:28] And the issue that I have with that is that a lot of puppies find tugging on [08:32] toys rewarding. So if she's biting on my arm and just after that I end up [08:36] giving her a toy, she goes, oh, that works well! I nom on mom's arm. [08:41] Or I grab a pant leg and immediately toys come to me and I get to have fun. [08:45] So there's a certain timing that needs to happen if we are going to be using [08:49] toys in that process, and I can expand on that. [08:52] The second camp is that people think that if they play with toys and get the dog [08:57] tugging and being crazy on the toys that it actually is going to cause them to [09:01] be crazy or a nip and bite a little bit more. [09:03] But what if I was to tell you that you can actually use the game of tug to [09:07] establish leadership and to teach your dog actually how to use their mouth in a [09:11] really polite way. So if I want to play with her with the tug, [09:14] I can actually start by getting a bit of control. [09:17] So I'm just going to wait until she relaxes a little bit there. Okay, get it. [09:20] Good girl. So it starts with a bit more of a control start. [09:23] I tell her when it's okay to jump and bite at it. [09:25] Now the other thing is that see how close my hand is to her mouth. [09:29] I want her to understand that if my hand's there look, [09:32] my hands are on either side of where she's tugging, [09:34] she needs to stay latched to the toy and never move to my hand. [09:38] Now if for some reason she was being careless and she moved to my hand and bit [09:43] me, even if it was accidental, [09:44] I would just take her collar and I would stop the game immediately and not allow [09:48] her to have the toy. So I would take her collar, I'd take the toy away, [09:51] I would just stop her for a second. Good try. Biting skin means play stops. [09:56] Okay, let's try again. And then I can offer the toy and then play once again."
document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,, Part 152/429,"[09:59] Now, the other thing that I like to do is teach a little bit of leadership by [10:03] teaching her to give things up to me when I want as well. With young puppies, [10:06] I love to teach by trades. [10:08] So I have a couple treats in my pocket here while she's tugging away, [10:12] I'm going to offer her a trade. [10:14] I'm going to tell her out or drop it or whatever word you want to use. [10:17] And I'm going to trade her for a couple of treats. [10:19] So I just put the treats right on her nose there. [10:21] Once she's sort of caught a whiff of them, [10:23] she released the toy and I can teach her that when I ask her to give things up, [10:27] she needs to do so. Oops, [10:29] I don't want her to grab it without me saying anything there. Okay, get it. [10:32] Good. So again, I'm establishing some leadership, [10:34] which leads to then teaching her not to nip and bite, [10:37] but I can do it while I'm playing with the tug toy so that she's having just a [10:41] grand old time here. But at the same time, [10:44] she's learning about how to use her mouth appropriately. [10:47] Stevie's actually about to start our life skills program, [10:49] which is the class that's happening behind me here. [10:51] Now we have a local facility in Flamborough, Ontario. We're actually Canadian. [10:56] So if you're nearby us, [10:57] come and check out the facility and see what classes would be good for you and [11:00] your puppy. If you're not local to us, [11:02] we actually offer this exact same program online. It's also called Life Skills. [11:06] Now, life skills offers awesome support from our instructors. It also gives you [11:10] access to a community of people who have dogs that are dealing with the exact [11:13] same problems that you are. So if you want to learn about our programs, [11:16] make sure you check out the link in the description below."
document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,, Part 153/429,"[11:19] If you have a puppy that jumps up at you a lot, [11:21] if you have a puppy that grabs your slippers or your house coat as you're [11:24] walking down the hallway and you need to turn and get a hold of 'em, [11:27] or maybe they're underneath the couch trying to grab something or they're [11:31] chewing on a shoe and then you go to grab it and they run away. [11:34] So many people say, this is all fine, [11:36] but how do I even get ahold of my puppy to stop them from nipping and biting? [11:39] Now, you may have realized the moment I brought Stevie out of her crate, [11:42] I put this little house line on. Now this is a little bit different than a leash [11:47] because it's very lightweight. It doesn't have a handle on the end. [11:51] And this is specifically designed to put on our puppies when they are in the [11:55] house, hence house line. [11:57] And what's beautiful about this is that this can help me stop my puppy [12:02] from nipping and biting because it's much easier for me to get control of a line [12:06] than it is to actually get my hands on a nipping and biting and crazy jumping [12:10] puppy. [12:11] So if she decides to grab my house coat as we're walking down the [12:15] hallway, I can just put my foot on the house line and stop her from doing so, [12:20] and then I can address her. If I'm trying, she grabs a sock, [12:23] or if she grabs your remote control and they're taking off, [12:27] I don't have to chase the puppy around the house and lower my leadership and [12:31] control status. I can stop on the line and then I can go and grab it from there. [12:35] So this is going to be able to stop so many problems before they fester into a [12:40] big, huge thing. [12:42] I'm able to get my hand and slide my hand down the line to her collar to work on [12:46] that control hold to get her to stop and settle from there. [12:49] But nipping and biting is very, [12:51] very hard to stop if you do not have control of your puppy."
document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,, Part 154/429,"[12:56] And this is going to be a way that's going to allow you to eliminate a lot of [13:00] the situations where the puppies amp up to a higher state of mind [13:05] and it's really hard to get control. After watching today's video, [13:08] you may have recognized some of the common mistakes that you're making that's [13:11] actually causing your puppy to nip and bite more. Now, [13:14] to make sure that you're not making the biggest mistake that new puppy owners [13:17] make, make sure you watch that video right here. On that note, I'm Kayl. [13:21] This is Stevie.

to do keep away from those chocolate [00:17] treats did you know they aren't safe for [00:20] dogs to eat dogs might jump up high with [00:22] joy have you taught them to be a good [00:25] boy you know better four on the floor [00:28] this is a behavior that we all adore [00:30] door hush up pup no loud sound in this [00:34] silence your peace is found training [00:36] dogs to be real quiet even when they're [00:39] super excited a crate is like their own [00:42] cozy bed where tired dogs can lay their [00:44] head it's your space when things get [00:47] busy a place to rest calm and easy under [00:50] the tree where all the wrapped gifts lay [00:52] have you taught your pup they aren't for [00:54] play trading with them consistently [00:56] every day to not take those precious [00:58] presents away a house line helps in [01:01] festive times guiding pups away from [01:03] holiday crimes on the counters the food [01:06] smells great Steve says leave it sit and [01:09] wait dogs might try to sneak a snack all [01:12] of your training keeps them on track [01:14] with Ken and kale and our whole crew we [01:17] make training fun like a dream come true [01:19] in this season of love and light [01:22] well-trained dogs are a happy sight to [01:24] all of you and your dogs in this season [01:26] so dear Merry Christmas from our crew [01:29] and a happy happy New Year the holidays [01:31] don't need to be stressful and [01:33] frustrating you put in the work now [01:35] enjoy happy [01:38] training remember that just a few [01:40] minutes of training every day can help [01:42] tire out our dogs mentally stimulate [01:44] them when we're so busy with other [01:46] things also remember that Christmas can [01:48] be a dangerous time of the year for dogs [01:51] can be fun but there's a lot of things [01:53] that are not very safe for them so keep [01:55] your dog safe this holiday Merry [01:57] Christmas just want to wish you all a [01:59] very merry Christmas Chistmas hope you [02:00] have a safe and happy holidays and I'll [02:02] look forward to seeing you all in the [02:03] New Year Merry Christmas don't forget [02:06] that a well exercised dog is usually a [02:07] more well- behaved dog as well so don't [02:09] skip on those play sessions in this busy [02:11] season happy training if you're going [02:13] somewhere and you're not used to going [02:15] to that place remember to bring a crate [02:18] also just scan the area or the house to [02:21] make sure there's no danger as in maybe [02:23] some chocolate cookies even tinsel can [02:26] be harmful to your dogs so just be aware [02:29] of that also I'd put my dog on a leash [02:31] go outside to a new area cuz you don't [02:34] know the neighborhood make sure your dog [02:36] is safe over the holiday season We wish [02:38] you a merry Christmas happy holiday [02:40] season and see you in the new year Merry [02:43] Christmas everyone from sinna hippo and [02:45] I my favorite training tip is to set [02:47] your dog up for success and this time of [02:50] year that might mean using your crate a [02:51] little more often with all the new [02:54] people smells and activities a young dog [02:56] can easily become overwhelmed don't [02:59] hesit itate to put them in their crate [03:01] so they can have some quiet time and you [03:03] can relax and enjoy yourself have a [03:05] great holiday everyone Hi everyone [03:07] wishing you a merry Christmas and a [03:09] happy holidays from my four-legged [03:11] family to yours well to all of our [03:15] students who come

have practical uses every single day and [00:06] today I'm going to take one of those [00:08] tricks and show you how to take them to [00:09] the next level so that you can use them [00:12] every single day in your dog's life I'm [00:14] instructor Steve welcome back to myand [00:17] [Music] [00:19] dogs a trick that's really easy to teach [00:21] and really has some benefits down the [00:23] road is teaching a Shake A Paw a Shake A [00:25] Paw is a fun trick to do it can [00:27] transform into a bunch of other tricks [00:29] and one of the reasons I like taking a [00:30] Shake A Paw quite early so I have some [00:32] food in my hand here and you can see [00:34] Stevia is already offering to put her [00:37] paws on me and I'm going to take [00:39] advantage of that what I'm actually [00:40] going to do is I am going to have this [00:42] food here and the moment she raises her [00:44] paw I'm simply going to say yes and let [00:46] her have the treat yes good girl good [00:49] job good so again I'm using that food [00:52] there and the Paw is coming from a [00:54] little bit of frustration she says hey [00:55] give me the treat but that's okay [00:57] because she's trying to figure out how [00:59] to get theat treats so I'm going to try [01:01] again I've just got the food here good [01:03] yes good good girly good job now she's [01:06] switching Paws that she's offering me [01:08] you will find that your dog probably [01:10] tends to offer one more regularly than [01:12] the other and she's being a great dog [01:14] here so I'm going to focus on her a [01:15] little bit and see if I can get some [01:16] better timing on this come on over here [01:17] miss got those treats here I'm just [01:19] going to tuck her into a [01:21] Sit oh yes yes good that's what I want [01:24] good here's the other thing that I want [01:26] you to keep in mind when it comes to [01:27] trick training there's no wrong answer [01:30] she's lying down now she's being a silly [01:32] puppy I'm just letting her because this [01:34] is about fun now you're getting a little [01:36] ramped up Miss so we're going to settle [01:37] you down just a little bit okay girl get [01:39] that good now I also have the house line [01:42] on her so that if she happened to move [01:44] far away or get distracted I would just [01:46] stop her uh she's not allowed to roam [01:48] free I want her interacting with me so [01:50] the house line allows me to do that I'm [01:51] going to get her into a Sit again good [01:54] girl oh you're trying so [01:57] hard [01:58] good [02:00] come here she says I'm not sure what to [02:02] do but we're going to figure it out yes [02:04] good [02:05] girl yes good good girl get that right [02:08] there it's under your floofy paws you [02:09] got a lot of floof [02:11] Miss okay okay oh she's [02:15] exciting and here's the fun things about [02:17] puppies she's having a great time doing [02:20] this she's not doing anything bad she's [02:21] excited to work so I'm just going to [02:23] keep taking advantage of this and we're [02:24] going to see if we can get a few more [02:26] little wins on this [02:28] paw yes good good girl good now yes for [02:33] our dogs is the marker yes says at that [02:35] exact moment you are correct and what I [02:37] want her pairing right now is simply [02:39] just lifting the Paw and getting that [02:41] paw in contact with my hand is the thing [02:43] that tells her she's right so I'm going [02:45] to give her just a second here to try a [02:47] couple more and then we're going to take [02:49] a little break because the other thing [02:50] with puppies is they have a pretty [02:53] short yes good girl that's what I want [02:56] good girl I'm going to reward her again [02:58] and then I can tell her okay get it she [03:00] can have a couple of treats and then I'm [03:02] going to get my toy and we're going to [03:03] have a little fun and I'm going to let [03:04] her be wild and crazy get it get it get [03:06] it get it get it get that thing get that [03:07] thing get it get it get it get it get it [03:09] now I'm going to do a little work to get [03:10] that toy back good girly good girl oh oh [03:14] she's crazy she's crazy out yes good out [03:18] good girl put my toy away and then we're [03:20] going to try it again we're going to [03:21] keep these repetitions really really [03:23] short I want her continuing to try and [03:25] do things now Stevie's a pretty darn toy [03:28] motivated dog and she thought in that [03:30] moment that she should just jump over [03:32] there and go to the toy that's puppy [03:34] stuff that's nothing wrong with that but [03:36] what I am going to do is I'm just going [03:37] to get a hold of her I'm going to do [03:39] another little [03:41] out yes good out good girl there you go [03:44] it's right there good girl and I'm going [03:46] to do a little bit better job of hiding [03:48] that toy to take away that opportunity [03:50] to find something else I don't want both [03:52] Paws now she gave me both Paws that time [03:54] I'm not going to scold her for that I'm [03:55] just going to move my hand until I get [03:57] one [03:58] paw yes good yes [04:03] good oh she likes the [04:08] cheese yes good [04:10] oops hi I know [04:13] Miss good yes good that's what I want [04:17] good girlly I'm not saying the word I'm [04:19] not giving her any command at all for [04:21] this yet she doesn't know what it is [04:23] that I want her to do so the important [04:25] thing that I'm doing is just getting her [04:27] understanding that that marker word that [04:28] that word yes Happ happens when she's [04:30] picking up that paw and especially when [04:32] I have my hand on it and you'll see that [04:35] the wheels are starting to turn in her [04:36] little mind now she's starting to pick [04:38] it up more readily because she says wait [04:40] a minute every time this paw comes up I [04:41] hear that magic word and I get rewarded [04:43] for it so we're going to see if we can [04:44] start to get her to offer that a little [04:46] bit more meaning she starts to pick up [04:48] the Paw on her own with a little bit [04:49] less help from me are you ready to do [04:52] some more I think you are good okay good [04:54] so I'm going to get my treats out here [04:56] I'm going to grab a few less here and [04:57] let's just see what we can do good girl [04:59] Miss [05:00] good so we going to get her turn this [05:02] way yes good so that time without any [05:05] pressure with the food good girl yes [05:08] good girl hooray jackpot [05:14] good miss m one there yes good girl good [05:18] job [05:22] good good girl she's sitting nicely [05:25] she's really trying to figure this out [05:26] yes good girl so she switched Paw I'm [05:28] okay with that there's no wrong answers [05:30] here good girl yes good girl so that [05:33] time that paw came up good [05:36] girl yes good girl that's what I want [05:39] jackpot you get all those treats good [05:42] girly okay get it get it get it get it [05:44] get it good girl hooray hooray hooray [05:46] hooray so that time the food wasn't even [05:48] at her nose it was just present but [05:50] she's putting together if I pick up the [05:53] Paw I hear the word yes and I get the [05:55] food now the reason I'm giving her at [05:57] the toy at the end of this is I also [05:58] want to let her get rid of some of that [06:00] physical energy I want to make this [06:02] training fun I don't want it to be [06:04] boring sit use the use my brain all the [06:07] time I want there to be some fun crazy [06:09] exciting things where we get to get rid [06:11] of that energy and we get to have a [06:12] little tug and play and in the process I [06:14] can also work on teaching her to give me [06:16] this toy back when I ask for it out yes [06:20] good girl this is easiest to teach your [06:23] dog while they're sitting because their [06:24] weight is on the rear end it's easy for [06:26] them to pick up those Paws so I want her [06:27] to know how to sit and if your dog is [06:29] still working on that I would continue [06:30] to work on a sit but if she does happen [06:32] to get a little overzealous and a little [06:33] jumpy I'm just guiding her back into [06:35] that sit position I'm not scolding her [06:37] but I'm removing that reward and saying [06:39] no no no that reward goes away unless [06:41] you're holding that position good girl [06:44] now Stevie's at the point now where [06:45] she's starting to offer this and this is [06:47] where I think about putting a word in [06:49] that she can associate with offering [06:52] that PA I haven't said anything I [06:53] haven't given any command but because [06:55] we're starting to get this I'm going to [06:56] start to add a word in I'm going to use [06:58] the word PA so p paw is going to mean [07:00] give me a paw and I don't care which one [07:02] but my timing is going to be important [07:04] with this so I'm going to get my great [07:05] treats I'm going to do a few warm up [07:07] where I don't say the word but then I'm [07:09] going to give her the word and then [07:10] bring the food close enough that she can [07:13] start to offer the behavior and we're [07:14] going to see what happens here good [07:15] girlly sit good sit yes good girl [07:21] good yes good girl good okay paw yes [07:25] good paw good girly paw yes good girl [07:28] good paw [07:30] paw yes good girl good pa okay get it [07:34] get it get it get it get it hooray you [07:36] used your brain and you start to figure [07:38] out the word and you can see she's [07:40] starting to put together just the [07:41] foundation part of hearing the word paw [07:43] means offer that paw and get a treat [07:46] human nature is to use the word right [07:47] away but often times because the dogs [07:50] don't know how to physically move into [07:51] the position or understand what it is [07:53] that we want we start to repeat the [07:55] command over and over and over again in [07:57] a manner of helping that's human nature [07:59] we think if we just keep saying it the [08:00] dog will get it but I want the dog to [08:02] learn that they hear it one time and [08:04] then do that behavior so spending time [08:07] teaching the physical part of it and [08:09] then adding in that word once they have [08:11] that understanding can make a big [08:13] difference so you might think that went [08:15] really fast or that might have been the [08:16] magic of editing but here's the thing [08:18] okay come on over here miss with good [08:20] timing and giving dogs great information [08:22] they can pick up these behaviors really [08:24] really quickly they can learn how to do [08:26] these things hi Miss how to do these [08:28] things that we want want them to do but [08:29] it all comes down to timing okay now why [08:33] is a Shake A Paw an important thing well [08:35] if I need to teach my dog that I want to [08:37] wipe their paws when they come in [08:39] because it's muddy or I need to maybe [08:41] she's got pretty Furry Paws here I need [08:42] to check and make sure that there's not [08:43] ticks in between those Toes or I need to [08:45] trim her nails I want her so comfortable [08:48] offering me her paw that it's something [08:50] that's second nature not only that she's [08:53] calm while she's doing it yes there's [08:55] moments where I'm letting her get [08:56] excited but the moment I yes and reward [08:58] her everything is is calm in her body [09:00] and she's nice and stable it's a really [09:01] really handy skill going forward [09:03] successful dog training takes good [09:05] timing and if you want help with your [09:07] puppy and your timing check out our [09:09] puppy Essentials online training program [09:10] or better yet if you're close to our [09:12] location come and train with us in [09:13] person and we can help you to have a [09:15] well- behaved four-legged family member [09:17] she's figured this out pretty quick so [09:19] what can I do to take this Shake A Paw [09:21] to the next level well Shake AAW can [09:23] translate into a bunch of other really [09:25] fun tricks the next one could be a high [09:27] five it's really cool when you can see a [09:29] dog sit you ask them to high five you [09:31] get that pawn off you go who doesn't [09:32] like a good high five all I'm going to [09:34] do is actually change my hand position [09:36] instead of putting my hand out and a cut [09:38] for her to put her paw on it I'm [09:39] actually just going to turn my hand over [09:41] now that doesn't seem like a big [09:43] difference to us but it's a big [09:44] difference to the dog CU it's a slightly [09:46] different picture so let's see what I [09:47] can get here now now because we're [09:49] teaching something new again I'm not [09:50] going to say the word I'm going to just [09:51] see if I can get the same behavior first [09:54] I'm going to do a little review so paw [09:56] yes good girl good paw pa PA yes good [10:01] okay now I'm going to see if I can [10:02] change my hand now and see what it looks [10:03] like paw yes good girl good paw [10:09] good yes good [10:11] girl oh good girl good try yes good okay [10:15] why did I not reward her that first time [10:18] well she put her pow on this hand but if [10:21] this is the target hand I want I didn't [10:24] want to reward her for the wrong hand I [10:25] wanted to see this picture here is what [10:28] gets you the reward so she wasn't wrong [10:30] I said yes that she lifted up a paw I [10:32] just didn't give her the treat for that [10:33] one I want her to focus on this hand so [10:35] I'm going to bring it down a little [10:35] lower cuz stev is a little dog and for [10:37] your dog to bring that paw up at that at [10:39] that height they need to be a little bit [10:42] um need to be a little easier for them [10:43] to do that so I'm going to see what I [10:44] can do here sit good sit good sit oh she [10:46] say I'm going to try all the things sit [10:49] good good P good P yes good [10:53] P yes good [10:56] okay yes good PA good [11:00] yes good girl good I got to get some [11:02] more treats because we're on a bit of a [11:03] roll here good now I've been saying paw [11:06] and showing her a slightly different [11:07] picture so I'm now going to change this [11:09] word a little bit and I'm going to say [11:11] give me five good okay good okay well I [11:14] got to get you to sit Miss okay give me [11:18] five yes good five good oh get that [11:22] right there get that right there good [11:25] ah [11:26] five five we got get you sitting Miss [11:32] okay yes good five good girly good I got [11:36] you sitting though H five yes good five [11:41] hooray [11:43] five yes good five you get a jackpot for [11:46] that one because that was very [11:48] deliberate good girl we're going to try [11:50] one more here you're so cute good [11:56] five yes good girl what a good puppy dog [12:03] five her little brain's working now you [12:05] got to sit though girl five yes good [12:07] five Ray get that get that good girl one [12:11] more [12:12] here I know she's trying so hard it good [12:16] girl hear me good yes good five hooray [12:20] excellent there's a little jackpot get [12:22] those get those get [12:23] those okay get it get it get it get it [12:26] get it get it now teaching your dog to [12:28] do these little tricks is very mentally [12:31] draining for puppies one of the things [12:32] that that you know you've probably found [12:34] out already is teaching your dog to use [12:35] the brain tires them out a whole lot [12:37] more than letting them run around and be [12:39] wild all the time she's really thinking [12:41] right now she's not only is she having [12:43] to hold a Sit she's having to think [12:45] about where my hand is where her paw is [12:47] supposed to go what she's being rewarded [12:48] for and what she's not so I'm trying to [12:50] break this into little teeny bits and [12:52] pieces and you'll notice at this point [12:54] I'm letting her have a little bit more [12:55] of a prolonged tug a little bit more of [12:57] a prolonged play cuz I know she's [12:59] getting tired and one of the reasons I [13:00] know she's getting tired is her [13:01] responses and her focus is waning a [13:03] little bit that's puppy so the more you [13:06] do these types of things the more you'll [13:07] realize that short training spurts are [13:09] going to be the most successful but [13:11] they're also going to help with a [13:12] settled puppy it's really cool to teach [13:14] your dog to Shake A Paw or to give you a [13:16] high five or to wave but one of the [13:18] things about dog training is we need to [13:20] look at all aspects of the dog's life [13:22] and people say to me my dogs do this at [13:24] home and I think that's great that's a [13:25] wonderful place to start from but I want [13:27] your dogs to be able to do it everywhere [13:29] I want your dogs to be able to do it [13:31] when you need them to in whatever [13:33] environment you need to you might be out [13:35] on a hike and your dog might get a stick [13:37] or something stuck in that paw and [13:38] having them already have that Foundation [13:40] of you handling their paws then being [13:42] rewarded for you handling their paws and [13:45] you being able to then examine or do [13:46] whatever you need to do can really save [13:48] you lots of grief down the road when you [13:49] go to the vets if they're so comfortable [13:51] offering pause it makes that experience [13:54] so much less stressful so what else can [13:56] we do with a high five we started to [13:58] teacher put pause up but how can that [14:00] help us in other ways well there's one [14:01] more thing that I teach my dogs that's a [14:03] ton of fun and it actually gets me out [14:04] of some awkward situations sometimes I'm [14:07] out on the street and people go by and [14:08] want to say hi to my dogs but I'm kind [14:10] of in a hurry and I don't necessarily [14:12] want to stop and talk I teach my dogs to [14:14] wave hello so if somebody wanders by and [14:16] says can I say hi to your dog sometimes [14:18] I'll say no I can't but she can say hi [14:20] to you real quick we can do a quick [14:21] little wave they love it and it's great [14:24] for Instagram pictures so let's see if [14:25] we can do that real quick here with [14:26] little Stevie now the only thing I'm [14:28] going to [14:30] from our five command is instead of [14:31] letting her hand her paw contact my hand [14:34] I'm just going to pull it away at the [14:36] last second and that's when I'm going to [14:37] say yes so she's actually get yes for [14:39] picking up the Paw but not making [14:41] contact with the hand now you can see [14:44] because of all that we've done in this [14:45] short period of time she says I know you [14:47] want me to do something with these Paws [14:49] and she's putting her paws all over me I [14:51] am not scolding her for that because I [14:53] want her thinking about that so you're [14:54] going to have to look at your individual [14:56] dog and decide is this something that uh [14:58] I need to maybe limit in terms of how [15:00] often I reward that kind of thing good [15:02] girl good that's very nice good now [15:04] let's see I'm going to warm up on her [15:05] five good girl five yes good five good [15:09] five yes good five good now this time [15:13] I'm going to put up my hand but I'm [15:14] actually going to pull it back at the [15:15] last second and I'm going to yes her [15:17] with the Paw up in the air so we're just [15:19] going to see what happens here good [15:21] sness good yes good [15:25] good yes good good girl [15:29] yes good good that's what I want so I'm [15:33] getting some reliable Behavior out of [15:35] this in this moment so now I'm going to [15:37] put the word onto it I'm going to use [15:38] wave wave uh means put that paw up so [15:43] sit girl wave yes good wave good wave [15:47] yes good wave good [15:50] wave yes good good girly good oh we're [15:54] dropping cheese everywhere good girl sit [15:58] sit [15:59] G get your BM on the ground sit wave yes [16:01] good wave good wave [16:06] wave she's figuring it out [16:10] wave wave yes good wave [16:14] hooray yes good girl hooray oh my gosh [16:19] good now I've got three things I can do [16:22] here so here's my little test for her [16:24] I'm going to see if I can work through [16:26] all three back to back I'm going to see [16:28] if Stevie's the little genius that I [16:30] think she is good s good PW yes good paw [16:34] good s five yes good five good girl wave [16:39] yes good hooray excellent good girly [16:42] good job you get a little jackpot and

skills in your dog she [17:02] picked it up pretty darn quickly now [17:03] that does not mean she knows it in every [17:05] single situation she knows it in this [17:07] room in this particular situation today [17:09] and this is something I would spend time [17:10] doing in as many different places as you [17:13] can that's actually going to teach the [17:14] dog to what we call generalized the [17:15] behavior or be able to do it anytime you [17:18] want them to but not only that I'm [17:20] getting some engagement from Stevie I'm [17:22] using her brain and the more I can do [17:23] that in the more situations and the more [17:25] settled she becomes in life if you'd [17:27] like to learn some other tricks that [17:29] you'll use in your dog's life every [17:30] single day click

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,, Part 199/429,~Ken #leashwalkingtraining #mccanndogs === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] do you have a dog that pulls every [00:01] single time you go out the front door [00:02] every time you try to take them for a [00:04] walk do you feel like your young puppy [00:05] is pulling you everywhere they want to [00:06] go do you avoid walks because of it a [00:09] solid foundation in your dog's training [00:10] is key to their success and a solid [00:12] foundation in beginning their loose [00:13] leash walking doesn't actually start [00:16] outside it actually starts before you [00:18] even touch that door I'm instructor Rob [00:20] welcome back to McAn [00:22] [Music] [00:24] dogs so just to begin I'm just going to [00:26] have him walk towards the door let's go [00:29] yes good job and each time I'm saying [00:31] yes I'm releasing a treat yes good job [00:33] yes and I'm just getting comfortable [00:35] moving to the door where he's not super [00:38] interested he's focusing on me and my [00:40] food yes good job that's it yes yes and [00:45] then what I'll start to do is start to [00:46] get a little bit of a sit at the door [00:48] oops dropped a piece of food so I'm just [00:49] going to put this on his nose sit yes [00:51] good sit I'm not even going to oops just [00:54] dropped another treat I'm going to bring [00:56] them back going to provide no sort of [00:58] Correction or Direction on on this cuz I [01:00] dropped that treat and I'm just getting [01:02] him again comfortable moving towards [01:04] this doorway and then into the sit [01:06] position I'm going to release him with [01:08] an okay and we'll do it again so right [01:10] now I'm luring him quite a bit he's [01:12] still just a young puppy but we're [01:14] setting up that foundation for him to be [01:16] successful in the F future I do not [01:19] expect this all to happen in one day we [01:21] might see a little success let's go but [01:24] I'm going to work this for a number of [01:26] weeks with him sit yes good sit good job [01:29] so now I'm going to build a little bit [01:31] of time here where he's holding that sit [01:33] position yes good sit sit good sit I'm [01:37] not even attempting to move too close to [01:39] the door at this point sit good boy good [01:41] sit yes good boy I dropped that treat he [01:44] remained in that sit he still gets [01:46] another treat have one more quick little [01:48] pass and reload up with treats okay I'm [01:50] going to lure him right back [01:53] now let's go andure him into the sit a [01:56] little closer to the door this time oops [01:58] dropping the treats everywhere that's [02:00] going to happen you'll get used to it [02:01] good job yes so I'm not bringing them [02:04] all the way quite to the door just yet I [02:06] just want to create a little bit of [02:07] space because eventually I'm going to [02:09] open this door we're going to head [02:10] outside we're going to open and close [02:11] the door but I want the focus to be on [02:13] me when I add a little bit of distance [02:15] between that door and me it's going to [02:17] help for when we move towards that next [02:19] step what I'm going to do is just bring [02:20] him a little closer to the door increase [02:21] the challenge a little bit and actually [02:23] just touch and hold the door handle [02:25] maybe turn the door handle but not even [02:27] open the door again I'm just setting [02:29] them up for success each time and [02:31] building more focus in on me let's go [02:33] yes good job let's go sit yes good sit [02:38] good job yes good sit not rushing this [02:41] at all maybe touch a door handle yes [02:43] good job so we noticed it yes good boy [02:46] every time I said yes so he looking back [02:48] at me he gets a treat yes so got that [02:50] focus in on me not going to push it too [02:52] far right now because he's still holding [02:53] that sit I'm going to tell him let's go [02:55] and head back to my spot and reorganize [02:58] do one more time [03:01] sit yes good job yes it touch that door [03:05] and the handle [03:06] maybe yes good job the reason why I'm [03:10] going to release him in a second and [03:12] head back and not even try and open that [03:13] door is I'm going to just set up this [03:15] routine over and over again for the next [03:17] couple weeks with him that he sees that [03:20] the value is just holding this sit and [03:21] the door might not even open every time [03:23] let's go yes good job now I'm just using [03:26] his kibble as I mentioned before but he [03:28] finds it quite valuable [03:30] now I want to just kind of go over with [03:32] what I'm working here again I have him [03:33] close to the door I was opening the door [03:35] handle yes good job I'm not going to [03:38] necessarily open that door all the way [03:39] but this is a huge win that's why before [03:42] I just said let's go and head back to a [03:44] spot and reset and try it again if I [03:46] open this door right now he's likely [03:48] just about to bolt out through that door [03:49] now I have that hand on my leash just [03:51] going to do a little test and [03:54] see yes good job what a good boy that's [03:58] it good boy yes now I've built so much [04:01] value for just sitting here in that [04:03] little short time yes you can see that [04:05] he doesn't even isn't really even [04:07] interested in popping outside the reason [04:09] I didn't go outside there even though I [04:11] had the success of the door being open [04:12] and he didn't bolt outside is because I [04:14] don't want him to learn just because [04:16] that door open means he gets to go [04:18] outside as you can see I had a lot of [04:20] success with him in that control [04:21] position but I had a lot of value with [04:23] those rewards for him so we're going to [04:25] just move a little quicker along now and [04:27] I'm just going to show you okay if we [04:29] just kind of take this for granted if I [04:30] just bring him to the door at this point [04:32] and then the first thing he wants to do [04:33] is just pull straight out what you have [04:35] to realize is your training isn't over [04:37] yet with just one little win you need a [04:39] series of wins with your dogs over the [04:41] next couple weeks so again I'm going to [04:43] go back do a little bit of training now [04:45] cuz clearly he understands to sit in [04:48] that control position before the door [04:50] but he doesn't get the whole element of [04:52] not going out until he's released so I'm [04:53] going to bring him over a little closer [04:54] let's go good sit yes good sit again [05:00] using that food each time as a reward [05:02] form building value yes good job open [05:05] the door a little bit Yay good boy yes [05:08] good lots of Praise yes feeding with all [05:11] those paws on the floor yes good job oh [05:15] good boy yes I'm going to just leave [05:17] that door open for a second good job so [05:19] he's looking yes good job going to close [05:22] it one more [05:23] time good boy [05:26] yes then I'm going to yes and feed good [05:29] feed him again there's a lot of treats [05:31] I'm using you can tell again just his [05:33] morning kibble so he's not getting any [05:35] extra this is just his breakfast yes [05:37] good job also building value for [05:39] attention on me yes good boy I'm going [05:42] to leave that door open now but this [05:44] time I'm going to just walk away again [05:46] let's go good [05:49] boy now as we're going here hopefully [05:51] you can you guys run along I'm going to [05:53] leave that door open and not had any [05:55] motion to it yes good job one more time [05:58] this is again just how I set up the [06:00] beginning where I was just walking [06:02] towards the door and then moving away [06:04] having him sit let's go and then this [06:07] time I'm just allowing him to move back [06:09] with me using that food where he [06:12] understands even though that door is [06:13] open or he's beginning to understand [06:14] even though that Do's [06:17] open yes good oh that was tough little [06:20] leaf going by yes good job let's go good [06:24] I'm just going to get a little sit here [06:25] close that door and then we're going to [06:27] work on that next little step which will [06:29] be actually going through the front door [06:32] just going to go outside and show you [06:33] what's going to happen if we rush just a [06:34] little bit too much okay with me I start [06:38] going open the door first thing you're [06:39] going to do dogs going to end up pulling [06:42] you straight outside our training isn't [06:44] over yet p p up up this [06:47] way but our next little step on this for [06:51] his training Just For Today is getting [06:53] him used to all those elements I dropped [06:56] a little treat no big deal get that leaf [06:58] out of his mouth that's going to happen [07:01] let's go yes let's go yes get that sit [07:04] at the door yes good job going to open [07:07] that door yes good boy yes good boy so [07:12] again it's because of the value of the [07:13] treats right now I wasn't using those [07:15] treats that last little round now I'm [07:17] going to lure him outside good job yes [07:20] good boy okay let's go let's go yes oops [07:24] let's [07:25] go let's go let's go [07:31] and we're to close that door sit good [07:34] job so you'll notice that too I released [07:36] him with that okay word that's my [07:37] release word for him and it just allows [07:40] him to know that whatever he's doing [07:41] whatever I asked of him he's done doing [07:43] it and we're moving on to the next thing [07:45] so usually I'll just like even for this [07:47] here hey leave that yes good job and [07:50] open that door one more time going to [07:52] yes and reward him Leaf blowing in he's [07:54] not distracted yes good job I'm going to [07:57] tell him okay to let him know he's allow [07:59] ow to move forward and we reward I want [08:03] you to make sure you end on a win and [08:05] that does look different for everybody [08:06] we ended up on quite a successful day on [08:08] that first little try we were able to [08:10] get back outside but you need to be [08:12] mindful of where your dog can be [08:13] successful if they're struggling make it [08:15] a little bit easier break it down get [08:17] those rewards and then go back try again [08:20] a little bit later we always want to end [08:22] on a win with our dog we don't want to [08:23] struggle and make it frustrating for you [08:25] or your dog you might be watching this [08:27] video and think that this has gone [08:28]

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,, Part 211/429,~Ken #puppytraining #mccanndogs === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] I got an interesting question this week [00:02] and it was if I could only teach a dog [00:05] one skill I got a brand new puppy and I [00:07] could only teach them one skill what [00:09] would that be and I had to think about [00:10] that for a little bit because of course [00:11] we want to teach our dogs all the things [00:13] but when I really got down to it I [00:15] decided there's one very important skill [00:17] I teach a brand new puppy I'm instructor [00:19] Steve this is little Stevie welcome back [00:22] to Maan [00:23] [Music] [00:25] dogs obviously this isn't a real life [00:27] scenario there's no reason why you would [00:29] only teach your dog one particular thing [00:31] and it actually took me a little bit of [00:33] time to think about it and think through [00:35] all the things that I need to teach a [00:36] dog but I did settle on one thing and [00:39] that one thing that I would teach a dog [00:41] is I would teach them to respond to [00:43] their name I bet you're wondering why I [00:45] picked that well I'm going to go over in [00:47] this video why I picked that skill I'm [00:48] going to go over the steps that you can [00:50] go through to help improve your dog's [00:51] response to name and I'm going to go [00:53] over how not using their name can take [00:54] their response from mediocre to one of [00:56] the most valuable successful tools you [00:58] can use every day in your dog's life so [01:00] why is teaching them to respond to their [01:01] name so important well there's a number [01:03] of reasons why we're going to use their [01:05] name every day to get their attention [01:07] and if I can get my dogs attention I can [01:09] get them to do all kinds of other things [01:12] and the steps that I go through to teach [01:14] them how to respond to their name are [01:15] going to be steps that I can use to [01:16] teach all sorts of other things so not [01:19] only is it training for the dog but it's [01:20] training for us as their humans to learn [01:23] the right steps to help dogs have an [01:25] effective response to any cue that I [01:28] give them there have been times in my [01:30] lives where I needed them to respond to [01:31] their name instantly in fact a couple of [01:33] years ago I just got back from the [01:34] agility World Championships in the [01:36] Netherlands and I had arrived back in [01:37] Toronto Airport and I needed to take my [01:39] dog uh to go to the washroom and there's [01:41] an area there where they can but it's [01:43] right next to the driveway where all the [01:45] cars come in and out to pick up [01:47] passengers uh I happened to be a little [01:49] tired and a little foggy and when I went [01:52] to clip as Leon to leave that area I [01:54] missed and that gate was open right to [01:56] where all those cars were going by but [01:58] thankfully because he could respond to [01:59] his name I said his name once he [02:01] instantly stopped outside of the gate [02:03] next to the cars and turned right back [02:05] to me so I can tell you it's a very [02:08] valuable thing from personal experience [02:09] you're going to see some pretty quick [02:11] progressions with Stevie because I've [02:12] worked with her before and she knows how [02:13] to learn and I know what's going to [02:14] motivate her but you might find your dog [02:17] training doesn't go quite as [02:18] successfully it's important that we keep [02:20] in mind that each dog and each person [02:22] are a little bit different and if you're [02:24] working training your puppy join us in [02:26] our puppy Essentials online training [02:27] program where you can get personalized [02:29] feedback from from one of the mechan [02:30] dogs instructors for you and your P the [02:32] other big reason it's important to have [02:33] a dog respond to their name is [02:35] eventually I want my dog to be able to [02:36] be off leash and enjoy life and have the [02:39] freedoms that we want to uh be able to [02:41] go out and enjoy time together and if [02:43] they can respond to their name I can [02:44] always get their attention back to me to [02:46] do other things if there's something [02:47] that's I don't want them to go near if [02:49] they can respond to their name I have a [02:51] better chance of getting them refocused [02:52] to me and also it teaches them that I am [02:54] valuable to them if I'm out in the world [02:56] and my dog can't respond to their name [02:58] how the heck can I expect them to come [02:59] back to me or walk with me or even sit [03:02] when something needs to go by you all [03:04] may have seen Stevie before in some of [03:05] our videos and so for today because [03:08] Stevie does have a little bit of [03:09] association with her name we are going [03:11] to call Stevie [03:13] serious presume okay taru Kima Kima Kima [03:17] okay Grumble arvar Legend cheese [03:20] everybody loves cheese cheese cheese [03:22] cheese let's go cheese cheese is now her [03:25] name the nice thing is Stevie has no [03:27] association with the word cheese and [03:29] chances are she's not going to respond [03:31] and that's actually what I want here's [03:33] the thing when it comes to teaching our [03:35] dogs to respond to their name their name [03:37] is just a sound that's all it is to them [03:40] we as humans understand at a certain [03:42] point that our name is whatever it is [03:44] but dogs don't work that way we we [03:47] condition a response to a sound so this [03:49] is what I need to do with Stevie I just [03:51] need to spend a little bit of time [03:53] teaching her that there's value for [03:54] hearing that particular sound you guys [03:57] gave us some great suggestions on names [03:58] and commands that we could use use for a [04:00] dog so I'm kind of curious comment below [04:02] what the craziest name you have for your [04:03] dog is so like any training session I [04:06] have some great rewards here I have my [04:08] house line on the dog so the dog can't [04:09] just wander off I want to make sure that [04:11] I am making myself valuable and just [04:13] taking away other options for the dog [04:15] now obviously Stevie has some interest [04:18] for this cheese that I have in my hand [04:20] or I'm going to actually change that I'm [04:21] going to say the reward because I don't [04:22] want to say that word over and over and [04:24] over again so I've got this great reward [04:25] here I am going to just say her new name [04:28] and then immediately feed her I want to [04:30] build some value for her simply uh [04:33] hearing that sound so the cheese is here [04:35] it's going to be [04:37] cheese [04:38] cheese [04:40] cheese [04:43] cheese one more time cheese good girl [04:47] good job now she's not actually [04:49] responding to her name but I'm creating [04:51] the association that says when you hear [04:52] this sound this delicious reward is [04:55] coming now you may be noticing that [04:56] Stevie is throwing up this paw every [04:58] time we do work well a couple weeks ago [05:01] we taught Stevie how to Shake A Paw how [05:03] to wave and how to high five and she is [05:06] defaulting to that she's created this [05:08] association with me in this particular [05:10] situation with that particular skill so [05:12] very very cool so you notice I'm just [05:14] ignoring it I'm not scolding her for [05:15] that I'm simply focused on the skill at [05:18] hand so again I've got her set I'm going [05:20] to get this great reward [05:22] cheese [05:24] cheese [05:26] cheese cheese excellent girl

distracted I'm going to wait until she [05:45] looks away from me I'm going to say her [05:47] name and then within a second I'm going [05:49] to put that food on her nose and I'm [05:51] actually

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,, Part 212/429,store now couple of [08:25] things that come up and a couple things [08:27] came up with her I'm in a fairly tight [08:29] space here and I've got some interesting [08:30] things around her and often times dogs [08:33] get a little bit too distracted by [08:35] things that are close by there's a [08:37] bucket of toys over there uh there's a [08:39] bone up on that crate that she was [08:40] chewing on and each time she got too [08:42] close to those her ability to respond [08:44] wasn't as great now I had to be patient [08:47] in those moments use that food to ensure [08:49] she turned but the next couple I simply [08:51] moved a little bit further away so when [08:52] you're practicing this try your best to [08:54] practice this in an area that has a [08:56] fewer distractions now I have my house [08:58] line on her so she can't ignore me I'm [09:01] helping her to respond each and every [09:03] time a number of times when I said the [09:06] word cheese before she had a chance to [09:10] uh be lured into position before I was [09:12] able to in fact get my hand down there [09:14] her head was already turning it was [09:15] already coming towards me she's saying [09:16] wait a minute I've heard that word [09:18] before I should turn to that person for [09:20] a little reward and that's the time [09:22] where i' start to add a little teeny [09:24] test now I will tell you this is where [09:25] our human brain makes a really big jump [09:28] we think okay our dog knows how to [09:30] respond to that name let's go outside [09:32] and see what happens we need to keep the [09:34] environment the same and we need to do [09:35] tests in a little easy manner where that [09:38] dog can be successful over and over and [09:40] over we're working through testing her [09:43] but I'm making the test so easy for her [09:46] to be correct get that that we get [09:48] repetition after repetition of her [09:50] hearing that name or that word cheese [09:52] and turning towards me for a cookie get [09:54] that right there there's not a lot of [09:56] distraction and I'm calling her the [09:59] moment her little eyes leave me you know [10:01] your puppies are busy they're looking [10:03] away from you and if we let them look at [10:05] something too long chances are they're [10:06] going to wander towards it so literally [10:08] the moment her eyes leave me I say that [10:10] word and I'm getting the successful [10:12] responses now what do I do if my dog [10:14] doesn't respond though well if I call [10:16] her name get that thing and she didn't [10:17] respond I would just repeat her name [10:19] give her a little tap on the side hi [10:20] that's better good girl to ensure that [10:22] she does but then I'm going to take a [10:24] step back again I'm going to spend some [10:25] more time conditioning that response [10:27] showing her how to respond to their name [10:30] over time when the dogs understand how [10:33] to respond to their name I'm going to [10:35] wean away from all this food but in the [10:37] teaching phase it's important that we [10:38] teach them that responding to that sound [10:41] whatever that sound is is valuable it's [10:44] really important that we understand that [10:46] dog Creed association with sounds but [10:48] they can just as easily create the lack [10:51] of response to sounds as well when we [10:53] use them over and over and over again so [10:57] if I was to stand here and say that word [10:59] cheese and she didn't respond and I just [11:00] kept saying it she's going to learn that [11:02] she can hear that sound and not respond [11:05] so when you're working through this I [11:07] talked earlier about how not to use it [11:09] to improve the response unless I have [11:12] things set up where I know she's going [11:14] to respond where I can use that food to [11:16] ensure and that I can use my testing [11:18] selectively to help her be right I am [11:20] not going to say that puppy's name I'm [11:21] going to save it and I'm going to keep [11:23] value for it you all have a bunch of [11:25] nicknames for your puppies in fact in [11:26] the comments we got lots of names [11:28] suggested for this video use all those [11:30] nicknames till your heart's content but [11:32] save your dog's actual name for teaching [11:34] them how to respond to it and you will [11:36] get a dynamite response to name every [11:38] time for this video I had to pick one [11:40] skill to teach a puppy but we need to [11:41] teach our puppy all the things and if [11:43] you want to learn all the first things [11:44] that we teach our puppies click that [11:46] video right there on that note I'm [11:48] instructor Steve this is cheese Stevie [11:51] happy training ================================================== CONTENU DE: 2024-01-21_All_Dog_Barking_is_NOT_The_Same_.

for our online classes um but it's [02:15] specifically for in person so that we [02:17] can I mean if you're planning a trip [02:19] face to face time we're about an hour [02:20] from Toronto so if

that with no further Ado um [02:33] let's talk a little bit about the seven [02:35] shortcuts that ruin uh puppy training [02:37] for so many people and um we see this [02:40] often I made these mistakes as a as a [02:42] new puppy owner before I was introduced [02:43] to maand dogs uh the first the first one [02:47] that we talk about so much with new dog [02:51] owners and puppy students is not putting [02:54] in the effort to supervise your dog um I [02:57] want to I want to sort of change the way [02:59] you know what [03:00] we're gonna we're going to list a bunch [03:02] of things here and um I see so many [03:05] comments and we get so much so many [03:07] people reaching out saying like oh you [03:08] know I watched this video and then uh [03:11] it's still not working so I want [03:13] everyone right now to go get a sheet of [03:15] paper get out your phone and so you can [03:17] take notes like grab a pen piece of [03:19] paper we're going to go through the [03:20] seven things we're going to talk a lot [03:22] about strategy high level stuff and uh [03:25] and then I want you to come back we're [03:26] going to give you a minute as we uh [03:28] discuss a little bit about supervision [03:29] maybe your phone's with you you can [03:31] start start getting [03:32] ready oh [03:34] wait you weird no we won't wait no kale [03:38] gets uh frustrated when I wait too long [03:40] on uh on the camera here's the thing I'm [03:43] going to assume that you're back because [03:44] I know how fast you are you're a new dog [03:46] owner and you need to be quick to zoom [03:48] around the house and uh like interrupt [03:51] the behaviors you don't like and [03:53] interrupt the things you don't want them [03:54] to do so now that you're back you've got [03:57] your notepad you've got your pen you've [03:59] got your phone or whatever in front of [04:02] you to take your notes get to the point [04:04] I don't want you to take a single [04:07] note unless you plan on doing something [04:11] about it we always talk about the idea [04:13] that oh knowledge is power knowledge is [04:15] power knowledge is not power the [04:18] application of knowledge is power so as [04:20] we discuss tonight these puppy ideas [04:23] puppy strategies the mistakes you're [04:25] making with your young dog in training I [04:27] want you to be intentional about okay [04:29] I've locked this in and now I'm going to [04:31] do something about it this first point [04:35] um is so important that I will tell you [04:38] it is the main reason why so many [04:40] nuisance behaviors happen it is the main [04:43] reason why people struggle for so long [04:46] with the things that they don't like [04:47] that their dog is doing and it comes [04:48] down to supervision I want you to [04:50] instead of thinking like paying [04:53] attention to your dog invest attention [04:55] to your dog CU it doesn't cost you [04:57] anything this is an investment in your [04:59] your future with your dog so really [05:02] focus on the idea that if your puppy has [05:04] the opportunity they have freedom to [05:06] make choices I want you to be there [05:10] watching them so that when they make the [05:12] wrong choice you can let them know you [05:14] know you stop them or you guide them [05:16] away or you show them what you want when [05:18] they make a great choice this happens a [05:19] lot and actually I have a quick little [05:21] video I can pull up here when they make [05:23] a great choice you're going to cap [05:25] you're going to capture that moment as [05:26] well you're going to tell them you're [05:27] not going to miss it because you're busy [05:28] doing something else it is so important [05:31] I can't stress this enough especially if [05:33] you're struggling with house training [05:35] chewing barking I mean the list is long [05:39] yeah go on yeah I mean there's just so [05:41] many things that can be it's a it's the [05:44] foundation of your training you have to [05:46] be if you didn't see it you can't fix it [05:49] so it is so crucial for you to be [05:51] watching your puppy and I'm going to [05:52] show you I I have a little demonstration [05:54] I just pulled a video up so um if you [05:57] were watching us like year two years ago [06:00] I guess now five if you're watching us [06:02] two years ago with five alive you we [06:04] published a video lot of numbers in that [06:06] sentence yeah one was a dog's name and [06:08] the other one was reference of time but [06:10] everyone now knows that it was a fruit a [06:12] ju a fruit drink that's right yeah um [06:14] fivey so uh you would have seen us talk [06:18] about why supervision is important and [06:21] we're going to talk in a moment about [06:22] house training but there's there are [06:24] critical moments when you can give your [06:26] dog good information and um unless [06:29] you're super vising you're not going to [06:30] see them because I want you to [06:31] understand how subtle some of these [06:33] indications can be so this is a video [06:37] from uh when we had little five when [06:39] we're we were at our house and uh we'd [06:42] set up a camera cuz we're working [06:44] through house training potty training [06:45] and I wanted to be able to show to you [06:46] guys what does it look like this is the [06:49] first time five alive indicated at all [06:53] to go to the door like any sort of [06:55] indication he hadn't had any accidents [06:57] cuz kale and I were really diligent [06:59] about about supervising him and eyes on [07:02] him but watch this this moment is so [07:04] brief I I'll pause it when he when this [07:07] happen so watch I mean just we're Kale's [07:09] doing stuff our house is a mess yeah [07:11] it's a mess we have camera set up like [07:13] you trying to make sure we capture [07:14] everything now watch this he sniffing [07:16] around this moment right here do you see [07:19] that so I paused it but he looks at the [07:21] door for like a brief moment and then he [07:25] turns away and well he turns to check [07:27] back with me actually right exactly and [07:29] and kale saw that kale captured that [07:32] moment and then she took him out so [07:34] let's fast forward like I think it was a [07:37] day it might have been two days it [07:38] wasn't long [07:39] after and when I saw that I just sort of [07:41] thought to myself that was weird why [07:43] would he look at the door for like that [07:45] length of time there was no noises or [07:47] nothing else and I thought hm I wonder [07:50] whether he has to go to the bathroom and [07:51] then just obviously when you have a [07:53] puppy and those things happen it's [07:54] always better to weigh on the side of [07:56] caution and I thought regardless I'm [07:57] going to take him out outside just in [07:59] case and the moment I took him outside [08:01] he peed immediately and I thought okay [08:04] maybe that was a thing maybe it wasn't I [08:06] don't know but like that was cool and [08:08] then and then this happened yeah yeah so [08:11] this is the next uh time we captured [08:13] something um I I don't think I have [08:15] audio from this old video but so let's [08:18] go to this next one so this is the next [08:20] thing watch this see he's moving around [08:22] he's like uh I don't really being goball [08:24] play being a goofball you're like [08:25] something's up and look what he [08:28] does see how we sort of he I was like oh [08:31] you seem a little like disheveled right [08:34] now yeah so that's so important because [08:37] he didn't indicate to the door but [08:38] because kale was supervising him he [08:40] knows he's not just being a goofball [08:42] which puppies will do but because kale [08:44] had been supervising so closely and [08:46] because you could be so supervising so [08:48] closely you're going to start to pick up [08:51] on these things and when you see your [08:52] puppy bouncing around the door like this [08:54] checking in with you you'll know huh and [08:57] it's funny I think on the a audio from [08:59] the video Whatever video was think said [09:01] do you have to go outside do you have to [09:02] go outside and and as you're walking [09:03] through you're like five just indicated [09:05] to go outside yeah I was excited yeah [09:07] absolutely but that's another thing as [09:09] to why it's so important to supervise [09:11] your dog because I was watching him so [09:13] closely on a dayto day it was then [09:15] easier for me to distinguish is he just [09:17] being a goofball and jumping around or [09:20] does he have to go outside and his [09:22] movement the way he was like his head [09:23] was down he was sniffing he seemed [09:25] almost a bit panicky and frantic for a [09:27] second that was um much different than [09:30] his normal everyday demeanor but I [09:32] wouldn't have known that unless I have [09:34] been supervising him so um so closely [09:38] day after day after day you can start to [09:39] read the puppy's body language which [09:41] means you can communicate with them more [09:43] easily and when he starts to indicate [09:45] even a small bit that he needs something [09:47] or he's problem solving I can either [09:49] step in to say whoa that's not cool or [09:52] in this situation I'm like oo he's got [09:54] to go to the bathroom and that just got [09:55] the ball rolling and he was one of the [09:58] fastest puppies that we we house trained [10:00] because he just you know thought about [10:04] going to the door and we were able to [10:05] jump on it quickly and then it was a [10:07] piece of cake after that yeah absolutely [10:09] so don't don't take shortcuts when it [10:12] comes to supervision uh you might be [10:14] thinking to yourself well I have a life [10:17] and a job and things to do uh how on [10:20] Earth can I supervise a puppy 100% of [10:23] the time and the reality is you can't so [10:26] you you need some kind of strategy to [10:28] manage the time manage the moments uh [10:31] when you aren't able to observe your dog [10:33] maybe you've got you know to teach do [10:35] the kids help the kids with their [10:36] homework or you know uh prepare meals in [10:39] the house or maybe you've got another [10:40] dog that needs special care or attention [10:42] or whatever the situation might be you [10:44] can't supervise 100% of the time so that [10:47] Gap needs to be taken up by something [10:49] can I just pause for one second before [10:51] we go on I just want to preface by [10:52] saying you know if you watch that last [10:54] clip and you think well my my dog's [10:55] house trade so like that that step [10:57] didn't really apply to me as we go [10:59] through this list of things we're going [11:00] to be pulling examples for that [11:02] particular topic but with dog training [11:06] um these examples are just one of many [11:10] so I want you to listen to what we're [11:12] saying and think outside the box a [11:14] little bit about how something like um [11:17] that house training example um could [11:19] maybe have been a different scenario in [11:21] you and your dog's life that maybe [11:23] you're missing so um we're trying to use [11:25] these lessons to show you the the bigger [11:27] point so for example poor supervision [11:30] maybe there was a time when your dog was [11:32] showing a bit of extra interest in [11:34] chewing something in your household but [11:36] you just didn't really do much about it [11:37] and then before you know they've wrecked [11:39] that thing well you could have done [11:40] something about it if you had recognized [11:42] the behavior earlier through supervision [11:45] so um again as we go through the list [11:47] think about our perfect ex our specific [11:49] example it might apply completely [11:51] directly to you but also think big [11:54] picture as well because a lot of these [11:55] tips can be used in all kinds of [11:57] scenarios uh with with your dog and also [12:00] many different ages as well yeah [12:03] absolutely so as we I love that like big [12:05] picture approach and to be honest that's [12:07] why we do these train stations we [12:08] publish videos every single week that [12:10] every single day now that um are [12:14] straightforward tutorials that can help [12:16] you to have a well- behaved dog there [12:18] are little Snippets of information or [12:20] you know 8 12 15 20 minutes of [12:22] information they can help you uh solve a [12:24] problem accomplish a goal H solve a [12:28] skill but in our train station episodes [12:30] we're going to dive a little bit deeper [12:31] so to Kale's point we're thinking higher [12:33] level and I know you're uh you know [12:35] might be feeling a little overwhelmed or [12:38] stressed by all that's happening and [12:39] going on but I really want you to to [12:42] think you know big picture uh as we have [12:45] these conversations because [12:46] understanding the big picture is really [12:47] going to help you make choices when you [12:49] don't know exactly what the answer is [12:51] and that's why we have these [12:52] conversations like tonight brings us to [12:54] management you know we need to talk [12:56] welcome to Beth Parks oh welcome Beth [12:58] parks a new heart dog supporter thanks [13:00] for joining us um management and when we [13:04] talk about management this can be a [13:06] whole bunch of different things it could [13:08] be a crate we know the value of a crate [13:11] it could be a house line We Believe very [13:13] strongly in the use of a house line [13:15] because we know that puppies are little [13:17] and quick and they need to be [13:19] interrupted or stopped or saved in some [13:22] cases from getting into trouble and uh I [13:25] mean maybe you need to stop nipping and [13:27] biting or jumping up the house line is [13:28] Do-it all tool to allow you to get that [13:31] kind of control um without having to [13:34] grab and snatch and scare or sometimes [13:37] when people are trying to get a hold of [13:39] their dog if they've done something [13:40] wrong it can Elevate the puppy and then [13:42] you get more nipping um but that house [13:45] line it um deescalate the situation so [13:48] that you can address things very calmly [13:51] and and with control and that elevates [13:53] your leadership as well yeah I love that [13:56] okay so I love the idea of leadership um [13:58] and it's important and we talk a lot [14:00] about um so management is basically [14:03] controlling the situation controlling [14:05] the uh access to choices and then the [14:08] leadership component comes into the uh [14:11] uh uh nurturing of the great choices uh [14:15] I I love that idea and and we really [14:16] want to capitalize on that we talk about [14:18] you know leadership can be like this [14:19] sort of like ambiguous not ambiguous [14:21] like a you know uh complicated term that [14:24] doesn't mean a lot unless you have [14:26] actionable steps but that's a part of [14:27] leadership yeah or people go the other [14:29] way they go like the negative way [14:31] they're like oh you have to be a leader [14:32] you have to dominate your dog and you [14:33] have to do this and like yeah sometimes [14:35] you need to call the shots for sure but [14:37] what a lot of people don't realize is [14:39] that you can have you can show wonderful [14:42] leadership and guidance to your dog by [14:44] being clear and consistent and all the [14:45] things we're going to list but also [14:48] about um having more times in your day [14:51] where you're rewarding those good [14:52] choices like Ken said I often say to uh [14:56] my students if your day is made up of of [14:58] you saying no stop hey do all day versus [15:03] like good choice yes reward oh my gosh [15:05] great choice yes reward um that's what [15:08] you want to do but how do you make that [15:10] happen you manage your dog you manage [15:12] your dog or your puppy better because [15:14] often when we have you know deeper [15:16] conversations with our students about [15:17] how to change the no Day to a yes day in [15:22] when we ask about management tools [15:24] they're usually doing one two three 10 [15:26] things wrong in terms of their man [15:28] management the dog has free range in the [15:30] house they have no crate time they never [15:31] have a leash on there's all these things [15:33] it's like well no wonder the dog is like [15:35] going absolutely mad in the house [15:38] because they have very poor management [15:40] so management can literally turn things [15:43] around um in all aspects of your [15:46] training and that management elevates [15:48] leadership and it's just like a whole [15:50] beautiful Circle that comes around [15:53] together for a perfect puppy moment yeah [15:56] absolutely so um I saw uh Mich sh [15:58] mentioned like I haven't done the house [16:00] line cuz she she would eat the leash and [16:02] this is where's talking about this like [16:04] sort of circular um um thinking when it [16:08] comes to point number one was [16:09] supervision uh you go out of your way to [16:11] supervise your puppy Point number two is [16:13] management and a tool for that is the [16:15] house line now if your puppy or your dog [16:18] in training because remember house line [16:20] isn't just for puppies we use house [16:22] lines on like dogs in training that need [16:24] it or let them drag a leash if they're [16:26] big enough uh in the house because it [16:28] allows you to get control quickly so [16:31] because now you're going to be [16:32] supervising your dog 100% of the time [16:34] when they can make mistakes if they [16:35] start to chew on the line you can [16:37] interrupt that behavior you can take it [16:39] away from them or do do whatever you [16:40] know you take it out of their mouth you [16:42] maybe get them to do something sit lie [16:43] down whatever once they've accomplished [16:46] that then they can get something they [16:48] can chew on so many people say like oh [16:50] this isn't working my dog just chews on [16:52] it and and they chew on it all the time [16:53] and they take it off yeah right exactly [16:55] well that's going to happen I mean [16:57] you've just attached a toy to your to [16:59] your dog's neck so you need to give them [17:00] the information like hey buddy this [17:02] isn't for chewing on the interesting [17:04] thing can I say one thing too is um [17:07] somebody asked me the other day how many [17:08] puppies have you trained Kale like [17:10] yourself um and I counted them and I got [17:14] up to 20 20 puppies that's crazy that is [17:17] crazy um but I will tell you that [17:21] 99.
document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,, Part 224/429,999% of those 20 puppies all cheed on [17:24] the house line yeah when I got them so [17:26] like this isn't unique to your puppy [17:28] almost all puppies when you put a house [17:30] line on it's a new foreign thing just [17:31] like when you put a collar on they [17:33] scratch at it for a little bit until we [17:35] don't take the collar off and they go oh [17:36] it's part of my body cool that's no [17:38] problem the house sign is very similar [17:40] if you just have them wear it all of the [17:42] time you supervise them and you [17:44] interrupt from them for chewing and give [17:45] them something else just like kind [17:46] explain they do get over it but every [17:49] every dog's a bit curious about it it's [17:50] it's not a unique problem or a weird [17:53] problem um but you know I just keep it [17:55] on all the time and usually within the [17:57] first couple days of the first week it's [18:00] just they just think it's like a long [18:01] tail behind them and they're just [18:03] completely over it so you you've got to [18:05] commit to it but it's very normal our [18:07] puppies do it too it's it's just [18:09] something that happens but it's very [18:12] easy to overcome yeah so you know things [18:14] like I mean we're talking about very [18:15] specific um uh uh training tools like [18:19] crate uh puppy Gates like Baby Gates [18:22] house line but management means like [18:24] giving them access to things only spaces [18:27] where you know you're confident you can [18:29] supervise them they can't sneak under [18:31] the couch they can't slip away and have [18:33] an accident they don't have access if [18:35] you're struggling with them chewing on [18:37] shoes like you're not going to put your [18:38] puppy in a situation unless you're [18:40] training it and working on it but you're [18:41] not going to put your puppy in a [18:42] situation with shoes on the floor [18:44] because they're there's a chance they [18:45] could get into them um so you're you're [18:48] really working hard on on being a man [18:50] good manager for your puppy and um we're [18:53] going to talk a little bit later about [18:55] uh uh another way to look at this uh bit [18:58] of a tweak but uh management is a key [19:01] part of your training it's going to [19:03] allow your puppy to make better [19:04] decisions it's going to allow your puppy [19:06] experience in your dog and training [19:07] experience to be way way better there's [19:11] also a bunch of great I don't even want [19:13] to get down this road but there's a [19:14] bunch of great leadership opportunities [19:16] that you have when you're managing your [19:17] puppy using something like a crate uh [19:19] that you're going to start to notice [19:20] your dog naturally choosing you you know [19:22] I had a two and a half-year-old uh [19:24] Labrador Retriever who was out of [19:27] control I started using using a crate [19:29] with her she hadn't used a crate before [19:31] and the first thing I noticed was [19:34] that she started to check in with me [19:37] look to me for information for [19:39] engagement it's because every time she [19:42] came out of the crate I was there every [19:44] time you know she she would get access [19:46] to doing something with her asking [19:47] something engaging playing rewarding [19:50] interacting it there it's just such [19:53] quality time that the dog starts to go [19:55] oh my gosh who are you human this like [19:58] you're just the most wonderful thing [20:00] ever versus the dog learning to seek [20:02] enjoyment and a reward from everything [20:05] else but you yeah yeah um I want to uh [20:09] so someone to mentioned you know my my [20:12] my pole puppy is a genius for some [20:13] things but some sometimes she's just not [20:15] getting it and this could be uh related [20:19] to point number three of your seven [20:21] puppy training shortcuts is you're not [20:24] being consistent you're going out you're [20:26] being too inconsistent not like [20:28] investing the time to make sure easy to [20:30] do as a human oh it's so easy to do it's [20:33] so easy to do but if you could choose [20:35] only one thing to be good at throughout [20:37] this process be consistent because you [20:40] can fix the little be consistent I felt [20:43] like we were about to chance we need to [20:45] get like those signs and like I need arm [20:47] give me a c yay am I doing a c for them [20:50] I don't know I don't know either yeah no [20:52] you're not okay um oh yeah I think you [20:54] were actually yeah that's right anyway I [20:56] mean look right here this is this is [20:58] what we're talking about I'm a [21:00] c being consistent is so crucial because [21:04] whether it is um your consistency your [21:08] consistency in the household maybe [21:10] family members have different rules for [21:12] different things that makes it difficult [21:13] for your dog oh sure does I mean let's [21:16] talk a little bit about the challenges [21:17] of being inconsistent with do yeah [21:19] that's such a hard thing we see that [21:21] quite often where you have one person [21:23] who's like really invested and trying so [21:26] hard to be consistent with the dog and [21:28] then you have other family members that [21:30] just either don't care as much or don't [21:32] want to change their ways or don't [21:34] really understand the importance and [21:36] then what happens is the dogs you know [21:38] takes three steps forward and then two [21:40] steps back and it can be very difficult [21:43] um and uh or sometimes what happens is [21:46] the dog will learn to connect or listen [21:49] to the person who's being consistent and [21:52] then their relationship with the other [21:54] people who are a bit wishy-washy or [21:56] inconsistent starts to diminish a little [21:58] bit and that dog starts to go you're [22:01] confusing or you stress me out or you're [22:03] just a play a playmate but that's the [22:05] big boss over there and I love them [22:07] that's the person I want to be with so [22:09] it can sometimes kind of divide the [22:10] relationships as well so we always like [22:13] kind of joke even though we're not [22:15] joking about like when you get a puppy [22:17] sit down as a family and like talk about [22:19] what your expectations are going to be [22:21] like how do you want the dog to behave [22:23] in this scenario and you know what are [22:25] your goals does every is everybody on [22:27] board by reliable recall is everybody on [22:29] board with all of these things so that [22:32] um you know everybody can be be [22:34] consistent it's not just about using the [22:36] same commands and the same hand signals [22:38] it's much much deeper than that it's [22:40] about expectation and consistency all of [22:42] the things that that we are listing but [22:44] everybody being on board will help the [22:47] process of the dog training and [22:48] understanding to go way faster and also [22:51] it's so much less stressful for your dog [22:53] which it to me is the most important [22:55] thing we want to make training fun yeah [22:57] absolutely well and here's the the [22:59] shortcut angle of it is like it's work [23:02] it's work to be consistent it might mean [23:04] that you're going out with them every [23:05] time they go outside instead of opening [23:07] the back door you're going out with them [23:08] so you know they can do their business [23:10] and you're there with them um you are [23:12] making sure that the whole fam's on [23:14] board you're insisting that your spouse [23:16] is you're like listen I I understand [23:18] that you want to be able to wrestle or [23:20] whatever with the dog but right now we [23:22] need to focus on be good behavior and [23:25] not nipping and biting and not jumping [23:27] up on anyone cuz when Nana comes over [23:29] you know the last thing we want is for [23:30] her to get clobbered by our Bernie [23:33] monster you know tackling her down so [23:37] it's going to take some effort so but [23:39] it's worth it it it's so worth it for [23:41] both you and the dog just for everything [23:44] it's just follow your dogs in training [23:46] exactly and I think that's what I think [23:47] a lot of people are concerned about that [23:49] you know a lot of the information that [23:51] we give to you now at this point with [23:54] your young dog in training or your new [23:55] puppy is uh it sounds sounds like it's a [23:58] lot of effort and it's a lot of you know [24:01] intentional steps and it's going to take [24:03] a lot of time but let me tell you that [24:05] investment is so worth it because in [24:08] three months when you don't have a house [24:10] training problem you don't have a dog [24:11] that jumps up or you know in six months [24:13] when you can go on walks with your dog [24:15] and you can it's exactly what you [24:17] imagined it would be this relationship [24:20] your dog listens when you're outside [24:21] you're not being dragged down the street [24:23] they're not lunging at the end of the [24:25] leash barking at every dog that passes [24:27] because you may [24:28] good choices when it came to [24:30] socialization this kind of stuff is so [24:33] important up front and it's totally [24:34] worth it now uh tonight's your [24:37] opportunity to hang out with us on a [24:39] live stream and sort of answer broad [24:41] questions but if you have more specific [24:43] questions about your puppy and your [24:44] puppy training we do have our puppy [24:46] Essentials program that you can [24:48] communicate with a professional dog [24:49] trainer six days a week and you can we [24:51] can answer the questions specifically [24:53] for you about nipping and biting [24:54] leadership management uh you know [24:57] socialization all those things talk a [24:58] little bit about the program yeah I saw [24:59] a few people asking you know do you have [25:01] you know locations in the states and [25:03] whatnot so we have one location here in [25:05] Canada but um our programs that we run [25:08] in person we also have online and you [25:10] know it took us a long time to come out [25:12] with online classes because it was so [25:14] important that we could replicate the [25:16] quality of instruction that we have in [25:19] person to have that online so that our [25:22] students could experience um you know [25:24] really really good support from the [25:26] instructors so that we can help [25:28] individualize things because after you [25:30] know this is my family's business so we [25:33] just celebrated our 41st or 42nd um [25:36] anniversary after all of these years of [25:38] doing this we know that there isn't one [25:40] way to train a puppy and that um you [25:43] know from all of the students and all [25:44] the dogs we've learned how to tweak [25:46] things depending on the scenario and so [25:48] those are the types of things that we're [25:49] able to help you with once you get into [25:52] the program and we have a chance to [25:53] build a relationship with you and we [25:55] know your puppy then you know when Frank [25:57] and Fifi say hey my dog's not walking [26:00] really well I can say okay I don't know [26:03] why I went with that you know this is [26:05] what we need to do for her because I [26:07] know that she needs a bit more [26:08] motivation I know she needs this so we [26:10] can individualize those things um as [26:12] well we also have um weekly coaching [26:14] calls there everybody gets together you [26:17] have a chance to have face-to-face [26:18] interaction with the instructors and [26:20] also you can interact with all of our [26:22] instructors you don't just use one [26:23] instructor we have a whole team of [26:25] instructors that have um different [26:27] experiences with different breeds um you [26:30] know our online team if you collectively [26:32] put their years of experience together [26:34] it's into the hundreds um it's amazing [26:37] here's a little sneak peek uh you'll see [26:39] instructor Robbie in the chat answering [26:41] questions and people are just like over [26:43] the moon excited about her answering [26:45] their questions you don't even know what [26:46] you guys are getting with her yeah she's [26:48] an online training Superstar so you know [26:50] you'll get to work with people like she [26:51] was Ken's uh my very first instructor I [26:53] actually have video from that I was um [26:55] one of our uh staff members in the uh in [26:59] studio 9905 I was showing them my very [27:01] first puppy day like my very first [27:03] training day yeah it's such a cool uh [27:05] video but um instructor Robbie was my H [27:08] instructor yeah and if you're just [27:09] looking at the links just keep in mind [27:11] our puppy Essentials program is for [27:12] puppies under five months and then if [27:14] you have a puppy that's over five months [27:16] you would be looking at our life skills [27:18] program so they're both great they both [27:19] just deal with slightly different things [27:21] based on your puppy stage one of the [27:23] challenges I think a lot of people have [27:24] when it comes to um you know they watch [27:28] a YouTube video one of our videos about [27:29] training and they're like oh it's not [27:31] quite working for my dog or I mean we [27:34] have a million videos on a tons of [27:35] different skills but they're like it's [27:37] not quite working for me and this might [27:40] come down to one of the shortcuts that [27:41] you've taken and this is this definitely [27:44] the most common shortcut for leash [27:45] walking training is unrealistic [27:47] expectations you you haven't put in the [27:50] work the Bas the foundational work uh to [27:53] get to the point where you're ready to [27:54] do leash walking training but the [27:55] shortcut that so many people take are [27:57] their step Skippers we talked about that [27:59] earlier you know you um you need to be [28:03] intentional about teaching your dog how [28:05] to follow food work on luring because [28:07] some dogs just naturally aren't good at [28:08] it but you also want to let your dog [28:10] know that like even in a little bit more [28:12] challenging scenario if you work just a [28:14] little bit you can be rewarded so [28:17] unrealistic expectations or improper [28:20] expectations is one of the things that [28:21] will set so many people back and I want [28:24] you to be really honest with yourself [28:27] what training to ask yourself what what [28:29] training have I done to get me to this [28:31] point with my dog do they have a [28:32] foundational understanding of what I [28:35] expect of them what other situations do [28:38] you see people who are you know come in [28:40] for like maybe private lessons or you [28:42] know in the middle of a life skills one [28:44] that they're like they've they've [28:45] skipped steps and now their expectations [28:48] are unrealistic yeah um I see it with [28:50] their recalls lots of people have their [28:52] dogs off leash in you know really high [28:56] distracting environment ments where like [28:58] I don't even know the dog but I know [29:00] know it would never come when it was [29:02] called and they're letting their dog be [29:03] in that scenario and they wonder why [29:05] when they say come the dog doesn't [29:06] listen it's because they they've overfed [29:08] the dog and not actually taken the time [29:10] to learn I see it in like greeting [29:12] manners all of the time so um you know [29:14] the dog is being you know jumping all [29:17] over everybody and they've never [29:18] actually and the person's just yelling [29:20] at the dog to get off but they've never [29:22] trained the dog what off means they've [29:24] never trained the dog to do what it is [29:26] instead and then what happen happens is [29:27] the person gets elevated because they're [29:29] frustrated the dog gets more higher [29:31] minded because they're feeding off of [29:32] each other and all of this could have [29:34] been prevented if we had approached the [29:36] situation with some more training and [29:38] you know teaching things in steps but a [29:41] lot of times we put our dogs in [29:43] scenarios where it's like people [29:45] sometimes I wonder I think that like do [29:47] they think dogs just come born knowing [29:50] their name knowing a recall knowing how [29:52] to walk on a loose leash because [29:54] sometimes people handle their dog in a [29:56] way that they just just think that they [29:57] know those things and unfortunately it's [30:00] our dog's behavior is I don't even know [30:03] if I want to say this I don't want to [30:04] upset anybody but our dog's behavior is [30:06] a direct reflection of our teaching of [30:10] them um if you have a dog that's not [30:13] listening it's on you and it could be [30:15] that you just don't know what you're [30:16] doing but you know there are no people [30:18] say well my dog's stubborn or my dog's [30:20] stupid or all these things that makes me [30:22] so sad because all dogs are capable of [30:25] learning you just have to figure out the [30:27] right way to motivate them and how to [30:29] teach them in a way that they can be [30:31] successful we want to try not to put [30:33] them in scenarios where it's really easy [30:35] for them to make a poor choice simply [30:37] because they don't know any better and [30:40] they're just being dogs um so that's [30:42] just something to keep in mind that's up [30:44] to us to to um to fix and to change um [30:48] something else I wanted to mention um [30:50] before on one of the other topics is [30:52] somebody had asked what are you guys uh [30:54] how many dogs do you guys have and when [30:56] are you going to get another dog dog and [30:58] um that question made me think about [30:59] what you had said about like you know [31:01] it's a lot of work when you get a dog [31:03] and and do their training and that's one [31:05] of the reasons why um we space out our [31:08] dogs so much like I know when we're [31:10] about to get a puppy my life for the [31:12] next six or seven months is going to be [31:16] insane the amount of time that you're [31:19] putting into those dogs like now our [31:21] youngest dog is 2 years old and well now [31:24] our oldest dog is 16 and she now is more [31:27] work than having a puppy because she's [31:29] old and all of the old dog things but um [31:32] it's nice when they get to a point where [31:33] I'm like all of that hard work I did in [31:36] his first year of life I just can coast [31:39] along and enjoy um you know developing [31:42] him in other ways but like the basics [31:44] are done they're there so it's not a [31:46] forever thing if you can really work [31:48] hard in the first little bit you just [31:50] get to relax and and reap the benefits [31:52] of your wonderful training but uh [31:55] there's no plans for dogs anytime soon [31:56] for us kale I love speaking of Segways I [32:00] love where you took that part of the [32:02] conversation and I want you at home to [32:04] think that oh thank you it was really [32:06] great someone is sitting in the shade [32:09] today because someone planted a tree [32:11] long ago this exact same thing comes [32:14] down to that was beautiful thanks the [32:17] exact same thing comes down to you set [32:19] setting aside the time to ensure success [32:23] in your training so the effort that you [32:26] put in at this point is what's going to [32:29] pay out over the many years but one of [32:31] the shortcuts people take is that you [32:33] know we've talked about a lot of like [32:34] this uh management and supervision and [32:37] things but making sure that your dog can [32:40] be successful is going to be a critical [32:43] step for you but it's going to take a [32:45] little bit of work you know we so many [32:47] people will say like oh it's so busy [32:49] around my house and I can't you know I [32:51] can't step outside the door uh without [32:54] my dog pulling well maybe that means [32:55] you're going to work your butt off in in [32:57] the uh hallway and maybe that means [32:59] you're going to put your dog in your car [33:01] and you're going to drive to some park [33:03] somewhere where you have space so that [33:05] your dog can be successful just because [33:07] the park is a block away doesn't mean [33:09] you have to go to that Park you go jump [33:11] in your car you figure out some way [33:12] maybe you work in the backyard for a [33:14] little bit longer but the in being [33:16] intentional about your dog being [33:19] successful and not struggling too much [33:21] like we'll introduce challenges that's a [33:23] critical part of using the Maan method [33:25] as we introduce some of these more comp [33:27] licated behaviors uh you know some we [33:29] introduced distraction distance duration [33:32] to these uh exercises but right now as [33:35] you're working on something if it's a [33:37] problem you need to be intentional about [33:39] making sure that your dog can be [33:41] successful you mention briefly like you [33:45] know we're trying to teach our dogs to [33:47] live in a very human world and uh you [33:50] know it's a dog doesn't naturally want [33:51] to walk in at your side where there's [33:53] all sorts of craziness and Chaos going [33:55] around as you walk down the street we [33:57] have to show them why it's valuable to [33:58] be there so it's really important you [34:00] know that you think about those things H [34:03] what's what's the outcome that I want [34:05] and what am I going to do to make sure [34:06] that my dog can be successful here um [34:10] rather than like well let's see what [34:12] happens like we've been working on this [34:14] thing I don't really know how this is [34:16] going to go let's go out there and see [34:18] what happens uh it's worth the extra [34:20] effort it it really is honestly for you [34:24] as as as being invested in your dog's [34:26] training and uh working through some of [34:28] these things it's going to feel better [34:29] cuz you're going to be more successful [34:31] and you're like oh wow I I'll I will [34:33] never forget Robbie was my head [34:35] instructor in uh grade or in life skills [34:38] one you to called grade one and as I was [34:42] working on leash walking training uh I [34:44] came in one uh the beginning of one one [34:46] of the classes and Robbie said like oh [34:48] ken just you mind just go to the other [34:50] side of the room we had like um an [34:52] unbalanced number of students whatever [34:54] I'm like yeah no problem and then I said [34:55] I don't even know where I'm sitting I [34:56] was just like talking to her kind of [34:58] trying to be goofy and silly and Degan [35:00] was in at my side I'd been struggling in [35:02] the first couple weeks Degan was in at [35:04] my side checking in with me and as I [35:05] walked across the room talking to Robbie [35:08] Degan was right at my side like perfect [35:11] leash walking and she said see do you [35:12] see what voice can do do you see what [35:14] your voice can do to maintain some of [35:16] that attention as you walked across and [35:17] I'm like holy crap I get it like I get [35:21] it I I I you know guys are generally a [35:23] little tougher to like draw them out and [35:25] engage with their dogs [35:27] but um you know being intentional about [35:30] choosing the moments and really going [35:32] out of my way going breaking out of my [35:35] shell a little bit to help Degan to be [35:37] successful is what I had to do to make [35:40] sure she's more likely to make good [35:41] choices it's going to you're going to [35:43] recognize these moments as you're [35:45] training your dog and uh it's going to [35:48] change your training totally very [35:50] exciting I like um kev's wind surfing [35:53] Adventures comment educating humans [35:56] about how to act act around my puppy is [35:58] the most difficult thing people think [36:00] dogs don't listen but humans are worse [36:03] um couldn't agree more more Kevin it can [36:06] be very very challenging that sort of [36:08] makes me think about um the next thing [36:10] Ken not taking advantage of natural [36:12] training opportunities um because I [36:15] think sometimes some of the best times [36:17] to train your dog is when you're you [36:21] know out doing the things you're going [36:22] to do anyways and you know a person [36:24] walks up and all of a sudden they say [36:26] hey can I your dog or can I visit your [36:28] dog and sometimes people forget about [36:30] dog training in those situations and [36:32] they're like sure and then the dog pulls [36:34] and jumps all over them but what a dog [36:36] training brain would do is say perfect [36:39] there's someone that wants to say hello [36:40] to my dog I have a chance to work a bit [36:42] of control I could say sure no problem [36:44] give me two seconds and I could get my [36:46] dog into my side I could work some [36:48] greeting manners exercises all of the [36:50] things that we do but that's just such a [36:52] wonderful opportunity to take something [36:55] that just pops up out of nowhere and [36:57] then you have an opportunity to work [36:59] through that because sometimes what [37:00] happens with dogs is they're so [37:02] situational and so [37:04] brilliant that we set up with our bait [37:07] bag and our treats and our leash and all [37:09] those things we do our training and the [37:10] dog nails it and then you know two hours [37:13] later something pops up and we think [37:16] because we're not in training mode that [37:18] people have different expectations or [37:20] they just sort of to let the dog run a [37:21] muck um training happens all of the time [37:25] it shouldn't be you know of course you [37:27] can have designated times in the in the [37:29] day where you're you know trying to [37:31] build skills or or do trick training or [37:33] something like that but the everyday [37:36] interaction with your dog needs to [37:37] happen all of the time and you should [37:39] constantly be looking and using natural [37:41] training opportunities to create wins [37:44] for you and your dog whether that's [37:46] getting them in and out of their crate [37:48] with manners and and respect and [37:49] calmness whether that's going outside [37:52] for a pee and having an opportunity to [37:54] respond to their name a couple times or [37:56] do some look at Mees while there's [37:58] people walking past the end of the [37:59] driveway or a little recall or something [38:02] like that or maybe they have to hold a [38:04] sit in a stay while you you know open [38:06] the door to pick up your Amazon box or [38:08] whatever the situation is there are [38:10] literally hundreds of little moments [38:12] during the day that you can work in a [38:14] little training exercise that doesn't [38:16] take any extra time and allows you to to [38:19] teach your dog how to interact all of [38:21] the time throughout the day so that it's [38:23] not just you listen when we're training [38:25] and then you know you can forget [38:27] everything at all the other times [38:29] training should be worked into your [38:30] everyday situations on all those natural [38:32] training opportunities so opportunities [38:35] don't come with their value stamped on [38:37] them is really the important uh takeaway [38:40] here when we're talking about natural [38:41] training opportunities they are so like [38:44] can you go over let's talk about a a day [38:46] in the life of kale as a puppy owner [38:49] like from you know first thing in the [38:51] morning till noon what kind of natural [38:52] training opportunities are you taking [38:54] advantage of because I think anybody [38:55] who's not a dog trainer can start doing [38:57] these tomorrow uh from the morning on [39:00] yeah definitely um well busy person work [39:03] a lot uh so when we get up in the [39:06] morning I let my puppy sleep in a crate [39:08] right beside my bed for sure so that we [39:10] have that nice little bonding time um we [39:13] work on Sometimes some mornings we'll [39:15] work on house training so instead of the [39:18] puppy going outside I'll play put the [39:20] puppy down by the door and see if I can [39:22] look for some of those signs you saw in [39:23] the video of five alive earlier it's one [39:25] of the ways that I did it [39:27] um that's one thing to do I would work [39:28] on manners going in and outside the door [39:31] with some treats and a leash um coming [39:33] back inside when I'm you know I'm a big [39:36] tea drinker when I'm waiting for my tea [39:37] to to to steep um I might practice say [39:42] um I might practice having my puppy like [39:44] lie and wait on a bed we did a ton of on [39:47] your bed training with five when he was [39:49] a puppy um I worked it in the morning [39:51] anytime I was in the kitchen I was like [39:53] kind of always doing something with five [39:55] whether he was you know chewing on a [39:57] bone or practicing on his bed or [39:58] whatever which made um dinner time easy [40:02] because he would start to figure out you [40:04] know I would literally open the stove [40:06] door and he learned over repetition and [40:09] time to run and lie on his bed that was [40:11] his queue because every single time one [40:13] of us would open the oven the other one [40:15] would be having him lie on his bed to [40:17] keep him safe and he paired that [40:18] together um so again it's just thinking [40:21] about how to integrate your your [40:23] training in and then of course I would [40:25] take some time to make sure that he was [40:26] exercis and I've maybe done a few of his [40:28] tricks or something like that and then [40:30] he would go in his crate and I would go [40:32] to work or whatever the situation would [40:34] be until I you know was ready to spend [40:37] five or 10 minutes or 15 minutes with [40:38] him again um and then I would interact [40:41] with him do some things i' put him back [40:42] in the crate and I'd go back to what I [40:44] needed to do and that would happen all [40:47] day long with different periods of time [40:50] interacting with him and sometimes he'd [40:52] be in his crate for a lot longer than [40:53] that if I was you know busy for a longer [40:55] period of time but it was very highly [40:58] concentrated interactions um so that I [41:01] could teach him the Way of the World um [41:03] and then now he just kind of knows [41:06] what's what he's supposed to do in every [41:07] scenario and I don't have to be as [41:09] intense about it because he just knows [41:10] what to do as um uh we should have [41:12] captured more of that um uh conditioning [41:17] that we did when we opened the oven with [41:18] five like it's really an amazing thing [41:21] when we're at home because now we open [41:22] the oven and he goes and lies on his bed [41:24] yeah I mean we should have done step by [41:26] step in hindsight but at the time we [41:27] were just being dog trainers we just [41:29] doing well we were just trying to make [41:30] sure he didn't go in the oven yeah yeah [41:32] absolutely but like being so we were [41:35] supervising well managing him right [41:36] being really consistent about what our [41:38] expectations were but we had the right [41:41] expectations at the beginning you know [41:42] we knew that okay he's going to go in [41:44] the oven unless we can and it goes back [41:46] to like setting up into for Success like [41:49] instead of like letting him get near and [41:51] having to say ha get away from that yell [41:53] at him I went hm puppies like food he's [41:56] probably likely to be interested in you [41:58] know going near where food is so we got [42:01] ahead of it and said in this situation [42:03] this is what we would like you to do so [42:05] we'd show him the way rather than let [42:08] him do a natural puppy thing that's not [42:10] so good and then yell at them for it [42:13] that's not how we want a dog train we [42:15] want to show the [42:17] dog and we're live again wow so sorry [42:22] guys the challenge of being in the train [42:24] station is that once in a while big [42:26] train rolls through and uh it I'll tell [42:30] you what happened so Sam crenchaw [42:32] Employee of the Month 12 last 12 months [42:33] in a row was [42:36] um I said Sam can you go out I think [42:39] we're getting a little bit of Internet [42:40] interruptions can you go outside and [42:42] knock some snow off of the Satellite [42:44] Dish well Sam goes out there and he [42:46] threw his hat up on the satellite dish [42:48] but unfortunately it didn't knock any of [42:50] the snow off his hat just blocked the [42:52] Satellite Dish I might have video of Sam [42:54] anyway um so [42:57] Sam comes back in and he says my hat's [42:59] on the Satellite Dish I'm going to go [43:01] throw a snowball at it so he goes up and [43:02] throws a snowball at his hat it hits the [43:05] Hat knocks the dish off now we don't [43:06] have a dish so Sam's out there is we're [43:08] GNA we're going to make sure we talk [43:10] about the seventh thing tonight but [43:12] Sam's out there holding it so like nice [43:14] job buddy uh there is nothing I hate [43:16] more than when Ken does this what's that [43:19] you just go on and on about stories that [43:22] are just so silly I don't know what [43:24] you're talking about Silly Willy story [43:27] where is our Employee of the Month 12 [43:29] months in a row you are or Sam is Sam is [43:32] not me oh my good I know you w I could [43:35] never be that amazing you can't pick [43:39] yourself to be Employee of the Month [43:40] also that doesn't make sense right [43:42] that's a good that's right exactly [43:44] that's a good point okay so here here's [43:47] sort of bringing us back around we're [43:48] talking a little bit about um taking [43:50] advantage of some of these natural [43:51] training opportunities I think it's so [43:54] important that you consider yourself an [43:55] optimist especially if you're struggling [43:57] with something because uh a pessimist is [44:01] going to see the difficulty in every [44:03] opportunity uh but an optimist sees the [44:05] opportunity in every difficulty so [44:07] really think to yourself oh boy I'm [44:09] having a challenge what's the [44:10] opportunity to train through here what's [44:13] the thing that I can fix what's the [44:15] skill that I can work on what do I need [44:16] to teach my dog that's going to make [44:19] them uh you know better that's going to [44:21] make our relationship better that's [44:22] going to stop this challenge that I've [44:24] got that's really what I want you to [44:26] consider uh when you run into some of [44:27] these [44:28] challenges we've said this a million [44:31] times here on the channel but if you [44:33] fail to plan you plan to fail one of the [44:35] biggest shortcuts that a lot of people [44:37] take are is that they don't consider [44:39] having some sort of game plan for their [44:41] training uh it is so crucial to have [44:45] some sense of where you're going so it [44:47] allows you to make better choices [44:48] whether it's house training or jumping [44:51] up or skills or you know fetch maybe [44:54] whatever the thing is have some kind of [44:56] plan in place um the key the key is not [45:02] to prioritize your schedule but it's [45:05] about to schedule your priorities so [45:07] knowing that um house training is a [45:09] problem you're going to intentionally [45:11] work on some of those things knowing [45:12] that you know you're you have a busy [45:14] household and you've got to stop the dog [45:16] from jumping on the kids you're going to [45:18] schedule training that into your [45:21] training sessions when you you're [45:23] investing time uh with your dog we talk [45:26] a lot about um schedules and planning uh [45:29] in our online programs that's a huge [45:31] part of you know working through some of [45:32] these challenges with these new dog [45:34] owners but like is there a schedule that [45:36] you can think of when you bring a new [45:37] dog home something that right away [45:39] you're like okay this is one of the [45:40] first things I need to get sorted out [45:43] yeah I mean life is always easier when [45:46] the puppy has [45:48] um a sense of like how to respond to [45:51] their name or like how to respond to [45:53] even even a sound like sometimes what [45:56] we'll do with puppies is before we [45:57] actually do any formal recall training [46:01] we'll use like a nickname or we'll use [46:03] like an an enticing sound something that [46:06] um something that allows us to to be [46:09] playful and to get the puppy interested [46:12] in running over to us but we also spend [46:14] a lot of time doing those types of [46:16] training exercises excuse me exercises [46:18] with our puppy because we know it makes [46:20] the day-to-day ex uh day-to-day [46:23] interaction or control of them easier so [46:25] again one of my favorite exercises that [46:27] we do with puppies is um the hallway [46:29] recall game so um Ken will go to one end [46:32] of the hallway I'll go to the other end [46:33] of the hallway we'll have like a handful [46:35] of the puppies um breakfast or lunch or [46:37] dinner or whatever and we will just [46:39] practice aiming the puppy at one another [46:42] calling the puppy down the hallway we [46:43] shut all the doors the puppy can't do [46:45] anything else but run to the other [46:47] person we jackpot reward when the puppy [46:49] gets to us and then we spin them around [46:51] and hold them facing at the other person [46:53] and we just call the puppy back and [46:55] forth and back and forth and back and [46:56] forth and the puppies think that this is [46:58] the greatest game ever it tires them out [47:01] it builds so much value for their name [47:04] or here here here or P pup or whatever [47:06] you're using in that moment of time but [47:08] I find that that's something that I know [47:10] I spend a lot of time on really early [47:13] because it helps you know PE breaks it [47:16] helps you know getting them away from [47:18] something that they're about to chew or [47:20] whatever it might be so I I would put a [47:22] lot of value in that one personally for [47:23] sure um I think we should mention uh [47:27] again just in case I mean some people [47:28] may have joined us late but our uh new [47:31] poppy seminar yes so something we [47:33] mentioned earlier uh we're very excited [47:35] about we are actually offering a [47:37] in-person [47:39] um puppy training uh seminar uh for dog [47:44] owners for puppy owners new puppy owners [47:46] or um people who have puppies under the [47:49] age of 16 those are the topics we're [47:51] going to be focusing on or maybe you [47:52] don't even have your puppy yet uh and [47:54] you want to learn a bit more so we're [47:56] actually hosting it at McAn dog trainers [47:58] um uh in flambro and uh it is free [48:02] totally free which is super exciting so [48:05] um we're going to spend an hour we have [48:07] um some content that we're going to

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,, Part 251/429,store where we can recommend all [02:44] the puppy things that you'll need for [02:46] Success enough about you let's talk [02:48] about the type of dog that you might be [02:49] looking for it's no secret that [02:52] different breeds of dogs have different [02:54] Tendencies that's why they were [02:55] developed they were developed for [02:56] certain purposes some were for working [02:58] some were for sporting somewh just to um [03:01] be companions but taking account into [03:04] account those Tendencies can really help [03:06] you narrow down what it is you pick um [03:09] people often come and are surprised when [03:11] their dog does ex Behavior but when I [03:13] say well but don't forget that dog was [03:15] bred to do this it was bred to chase [03:17] that thing or her that thing then we can [03:19] start to say okay is that something I [03:21] have the ability and time to train [03:22] through but keeping that in mind right [03:24] off the bat maybe allow you to avoid [03:26] some of those training pitfalls and some [03:27] of the some of the surprise dogs have [03:30] such strong natural tendencies based on [03:32] how they were bred that it is important [03:34] to keep those in mind when picking now [03:36] maybe you instead of picking a certain [03:38] breed or going to a breeder are going to [03:40] go to your local rescue organization or [03:41] Humane Society and adopt a dog um do [03:43] some rech research in that situation too [03:46] you know often times these mixes that [03:48] come in uh again have not only certain [03:51] past history behaviors but also have [03:53] breed tendencies that will come into the [03:54] mix you know we have a lovable Labrador [03:56] that likes to jump on everything well [03:58] that's not surprising part of their [04:00] outgoing end durable nature is being [04:02] those Social Butterflies and jumping all [04:03] over things so be sure you keep that in [04:06] mind before you make that pick whether [04:08] it's a purebred dog or a dog that you're [04:10] rescuing or a rehome dog knowing what [04:13] their makeup is can really make a big [04:15] difference let's talk about grooming uh [04:17] grooming is going to be a big part of [04:18] your dog's life for some dogs of course [04:20] now all dogs are going to need things [04:21] like nails clipped and ears cleaned and [04:24] uh mud and things wiped off them but do [04:26] you have the time or the budget to have [04:28] a double coated or poodle type dog [04:30] groomed monthly making sure they're well [04:33] looked after and bathed making sure [04:34] those coats are not getting matted you [04:36] know if we have some of our more oily [04:37] coated retriever are you comfortable [04:39] with a little bit of that oily coat [04:41] around your house uh or on your hands [04:43] those are all things that really need to [04:45] keep be kept in mind so part of it is [04:47] the budget of looking after them now [04:48] there is great resources to be able to [04:50] do that on your own to save some money [04:52] but that also requires some education [04:53] and some time and practice so do you [04:55] have the time and resources to be able [04:57] to look after the grooming needs of some [04:59] of those dogs does size matter when [05:01] you're thinking about picking a dog you [05:03] know well what kind of car do you drive [05:05] do you drive a small little uh hatchback [05:07] two-seater car then maybe you're not [05:09] going to have room for a Mastiff maybe a [05:11] little smaller dog would be more [05:13] appropriate for that particular [05:14] situation so picking the appropriate [05:16] sized dog can also uh help guide your [05:19] puppy decision about barking are you [05:21] prepared to have a dog that might be a [05:23] little bit more vocal you know things [05:24] like our huskys or our beagles or even [05:26] our little Shelties you know often times [05:28] people are a little surp surpris when [05:30] they make more noise than they were [05:31] expecting but again those are all things [05:33] that you can look at training them to [05:36] not do but that takes time and effort we [05:38] talking about practice we talking about [05:41] practice and it's important to keep in [05:42] mind that we can't be surprised or upset [05:44] with a dog that's doing something that [05:45] they're naturally going to do what we [05:47] have to do is decide do we have the time [05:49] to teach them to do something else [05:50] instead is the puppy you're thinking [05:52] about getting comfortable being alone [05:54] for longer periods of time do they or do [05:56] they need that really close social [05:58] interaction with you and the family [06:00] members there are some breeds that are a [06:01] little bit more settled um being on [06:04] their own being a little bit more [06:05] independent and yet some others really [06:07] really seek out that personal attention [06:10] from their owners there's lots of [06:12] information out there on the internet [06:13] and I encourage you to seek out [06:15] information to help make that right [06:17] decision there are kennel clubs and [06:19] breed clubs which are a fantastic place [06:20] to start um start by going to some shows [06:24] seek out examples of the breed that you [06:26] are interested in and spend some time [06:29] with them uh the more time you spend [06:30] with the breed the more you are going to [06:32] learn what that breed is like and the [06:34] more you can decide if that really fits [06:36] into your life or not picking the right [06:39] puppy takes time and it does take effort [06:41] and if you're in the process of picking [06:43] a puppy um take advantage of our puppy [06:45] prep guide which will give you lots of [06:47] information that get you set up for when [06:49] that puppy comes home the link

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,, Part 267/429,~Ken #leashwalking #mccanndogs === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] do you have a dog that you struggle to [00:01] get focused from out in the world well [00:02] in today's video I'm going to teach you [00:04] a drill that you can do to help your dog [00:06] choose you over those distractions in [00:08] real life but I can tell you one thing [00:10] it's not going to start out here we're [00:12] going to go inside I'm instructor Steve [00:14] welcome back to Mand [00:18] dogs so what do you do if you've got a [00:21] dog that's trying to go everywhere else [00:22] but pay attention to you well there's a [00:24] number of things that we're going to do [00:25] right now to help colani make some [00:27] different choices in life and understand [00:29] that all the value and all the good [00:30] things come not just from the magic bait [00:33] poach but from you from the person [00:35] making sure that you are the most [00:36] valuable thing in the dog's world and [00:38] the first thing I'm going to start with [00:39] is a little bit of a rule out game now [00:41] when I talk about the idea of rule out [00:42] it's just helping my dog to make choices [00:45] I uh offer uh two options for them but I [00:48] limit the negative option the one that I [00:49] don't want them to do and I make it easy [00:51] for them to make the correct choice and [00:53] we know dogs do what most valuable so if [00:55] I help them to continually make the [00:57] correct choice I can start to to have [01:00] them rehearse that over and over and [01:01] that then becomes what they do they make [01:03] that choice more and more we reward [01:05] things dogs do what most valuable and [01:07] that choice becomes the Habit um colia [01:10] has also all of a sudden discovered that [01:11] my shoes are kind of interesting because [01:12] they smell like a lot of dogs and that's [01:14] a good thing we're going to use that [01:15] nose to help her make some decisions [01:17] I've got a little bit of kibble here and [01:19] I'm going to show her that I have it now [01:21] because I have this treat here she [01:23] really really wants it and if I were to [01:25] hold my hand open you can see she's [01:26] pwing at it she really wants toti at the [01:28] streets but I'm going to teach her the [01:30] only way she gets these treats is to pay [01:32] a little bit more attention to me and [01:33] making a choice to kind of ignore them [01:35] you've heard us talk about rule outs and [01:37] other videos and this is what we're [01:38] going to do but it's going to be a [01:40] little bit more specific than just [01:42] ignoring the treat so I've got my leash [01:44] here I've got some food ready to go I'm [01:46] going to hold this food a little bit [01:47] further up to make it a little bit [01:48] easier for her yes good so I moved it [01:52] away from her to make it easier okay if [01:53] I put it right here her mind is totally [01:55] on the treat but if I move it a little [01:56] bit further out she says okay my job is [01:58] just to hold position oh well helps if [02:00] you chew there kid now I'm going to try [02:02] this again I don't want her getting up I [02:04] want her sitting still I going move the [02:05] food away and see if she makes a choice [02:07] now she's trying to pot my hand to get [02:10] this and you may find a lot of your dogs [02:12] do that as well I want her to be a [02:14] little bit more mannerly so I'm just [02:15] going to move that food a little bit [02:16] further away good yes good girly good so [02:20] she's starting to realize that the only [02:22] way she gets the food is by sitting yes [02:25] now I'm holding it far enough away that [02:27] she can't think about jumping on it so [02:29] I'm going to make it a little bit harder [02:30] but I got to make it harder in in a [02:32] manner where it still helps promote the [02:33] right choice good girl so I'm just going [02:35] to lower that hand a little bit yes good [02:37] girl what a good puppers amazing holy [02:40] cow I'll lower it again whoops so I [02:42] lowered it that time she saw it decided [02:44] to go for it I'm just going to close my [02:45] hand good girly excellent good job yes [02:49] good girl very good so she started to [02:52] put together that ignoring the treats is [02:54] how she gets them okay [02:56] girl she's trying to figure out what to [02:58] do her little brain is is going yes good [03:00] girl good job hooray so I got a little [03:03] teeny eye flick from her to say what are [03:06] you doing up there good I get her back [03:07] into do a sit sit please good [03:10] girl good yes good girl that's what I [03:14] want [03:18] excellent now you notice her little [03:19] brain's working yes that's what I want [03:22] girly good job excellent work very nice [03:24] so I got a deliberate look now uh [03:26] Kanani's a teenage dog okay she uh has [03:29] some great skills but she's also [03:31] typically teenager she's partly on your [03:34] program but also partly on her own [03:36] program and that moment she got a little [03:38] distracted her brain says wait a minute [03:39] I don't know what we're doing over here [03:40] so I'm just going to look away and I'm [03:41] going to do something else in those [03:42] moments I'm just patient I'm helping her [03:44] to make the great choice but when I get [03:47] that great choice I'm going to yes and [03:48] make sure that I reward again that [03:50] reward position is so important and [03:52] she's going to learn that looking at me [03:54] yes good girl is actually what gets her [03:56] the treats you may have seen rule outs [03:58] on all of your social media we've seen [03:59] lots of videos of dogs lying quietly [04:01] with treats on their paws and ignoring [04:03] those treats that's a form of a rule out [04:05] one of the things that really makes a [04:07] big difference though is when you start [04:08] to translate that rule out into other [04:10] parts of your dog's life you may do it [04:12] at home with your dog's food most people [04:14] I see say my dog waits perfectly until I [04:17] put the food bowl down and then they're [04:18] allowed to eat they're not dive bombing [04:20] the food bowl that's another rule out [04:22] because when you're at home and doing [04:23] that if the dog dive bombs with the bowl [04:25] we simply pick it up and we remove it [04:26] out of the way dog learns they need to [04:29] make the correct choice or the more [04:30] mannerly Choice before they get the food [04:32] so you're probably doing all these at [04:33] home but how can these simple rule outs [04:35] help you and your dog when you're out in [04:37] the world or when your dog is so [04:39] overwhelmed by distractions well this [04:41] same application or the same process can [04:43] be applied to other things and other [04:45] distractions simply limiting their [04:47] ability to get them and being rewarded [04:49] for checking in with you can really make [04:51] a change in their world now I never [04:54] expect that dogs stare at me entirely [04:56] out in the world I don't think that's [04:58] reasonable they're dogs when I'm out [04:59] with my dogs I want them to take in the [05:01] world I want them to see a kid going by [05:04] on a skateboard or watch that person [05:05] walk by I don't expect them to stare at [05:07] me but I do expect eventually when [05:10] there's something interesting to them [05:11] instead of saying hey I'm going to go to [05:13] that because it looks really really fun [05:15] I want my dogs to say hey there's a [05:16] thing what should you and I do about it [05:19] and I want them to defer to me whether I [05:20] can say yep you can go ahead and go see [05:22] that thing or no come on buddy we're [05:23] going to go the other way now this one [05:25] drill is not going to solve all of your [05:26] dog training issues but if you have a [05:28] young dog or an older dog that you're [05:29] looking to train check out our puppy [05:31] Essentials or life skills in person and [05:33] online training programs where you can [05:34] work directly with Mand dog's [05:36] instructors the link is in the [05:37] description below so how do we make this [05:39] a little bit more real life because yeah [05:41] it's great I'm sitting in a chair I have [05:43] her Unleashed I have treats right in [05:44] front of her face but that's not what it [05:46] looks like when you go out in the real [05:47] world so how do we start to add some of [05:49] those real world or bigger distractions [05:51] and still teach the dog to make the same [05:52] choices well I'm going to give her a [05:54] little bit more freedom I'm going to set [05:55] some really really exciting stuff out [05:57] I'm going to set out a food bowl I'm [05:59] going to put some treats in here I'm [06:01] going to let her know they have them and [06:02] I'm going to put this a little bit [06:04] further away now this is going to vary [06:05] for your dog and your dog's individual [06:07] motivations it might be a stuffed [06:09] squirrel it might be a stuffed rabbit [06:11] you might have your friends and family [06:13] running back and forth you need [06:14] something that's going to catch your [06:15] dog's attention and we're just going to [06:17] Simply pause and wait and see what [06:19] choice the dog makes again as we go [06:21] through this the more she makes the [06:23] great choice to look at me the more she [06:24] realizes the reward comes from me or [06:26] from you with your dog that's the choice [06:28] they're going to make [06:32] so K Kanani's pretty hyped up here and [06:35] she knows that bowl is out there so I'm [06:38] really hoping she kind of struggles with [06:40] this a little bit so I've got my leash [06:41] on as always I need to be able to take [06:43] away her ability to reward herself I've [06:45] got my leash gathered up I'm going to [06:46] start real close she sees it and I'm [06:49] just going to wait and see now I'm going [06:50] to praise her good girl good sit but I'm [06:52] not going to feed her just yet good girl [06:55] good sit yes good girl hooray that that [06:59] was a good girl what a good puers so [07:01] step one she saw that thing wanted to go [07:03] to it her brain said I can't get to it [07:05] so I'm just going to sit but I'm still [07:06] going to stare at it longingly and I [07:08] just praised her good girl good sit when [07:10] she heard my voice she went oh right [07:11] you're there I forgot and I yes and [07:13] rewarded it now um she uh is going to [07:16] now start to make that decision more [07:18] readily I know cuz we're at a great [07:20] distance I'm starting with this in an [07:22] area where I know she's going to be [07:23] right but I also want to make it real [07:25] life like what does it look like if we [07:26] go too close so I'm going to move a [07:27] little closer and see what happens [07:29] here's the thing I need to make sure I [07:31] stay far enough away that she has no [07:33] ability to get to that that is not [07:36] available to her her only choice is [07:38] going to be to pay attention to me for a [07:39] reward good okay oh she's excited she's [07:42] excited so a little too much so I'm just [07:44] going to back up a little [07:49] bit yes good girl that's what I want [07:52] there you go Miss that's better what a [07:54] good girl yes good [07:58] okay [08:00] oh you're strong back up a little bit [08:03] yes that's better good girl excellent [08:06] job hooray good good [08:15] okay good girl good job yes that's what [08:19] I want good excellent girly good job now [08:22] uh important thing to keep in mind here [08:24] when she is making a decent choice now [08:27] what I mean by that is she's not pulling [08:28] to the thing anymore but she's not [08:29] looking at me I'm praising her I'm [08:31] telling her she's a good girl but I'm [08:33] saving my yes or that marker moment that [08:35] marker word for the moment she looks at [08:36] me that's the thing that's going to tell [08:38] her she's right okay there's a [08:40] difference between a marking and a [08:41] marking a behavior and praising a [08:42] behavior I'm praising her letting her [08:44] know she's on the right track but I save [08:45] my yes when everything's perfect so [08:47] right now I'm just using Kanani's kibble [08:49] the food that she's going to eat anyway [08:51] she's a pretty food motivated dog so [08:53] that's a great currency for her but you [08:54] may find for your dog that that's not [08:56] enough currency now um You may have to [08:59] level up your game find something a [09:00] little bit more valuable it might be the [09:01] cheese it might be those chicken hot [09:03] dogs there's lots of different things [09:04] that you can use if she was not [09:06] interested in these treats at all then I [09:08] would have to change gears or I might [09:10] have to go back to that toy and let her [09:11] know that the toy is the reward in that [09:13] situation I want her to look at that [09:15] food container and decide to look back [09:17] at me a lot quicker than she is she's [09:18] still really focused outwardly and this [09:20] is why I haven't pushed any further I [09:22] haven't gone to something that's a [09:23] little bit harder but because her brain [09:25] is working she says oh my gosh I don't [09:26] know what's happening over there so I'm [09:28] just going to check out your shoes for a [09:29] little bit she's avoiding a little bit [09:30] which is okay hey Miss come on hi [09:33] where's my girl good girl that's better [09:35] yes good girl that's [09:37] better yes good girl there we go so I'm [09:40] going to put a little bit more energy [09:41] into it okay good [09:45] okay yay good girl good job did you chew [09:49] that one again did you chew that one [09:51] again did you chew that one again good [09:53] girl yes good that's what I want [09:57] hooray good girl okay [10:02] Yay good girl that's what I want yes [10:04] what a good puppers hooray excellent [10:06] excellent [10:08] okay yes that's my girl hooray you're so [10:12] cool good job okay we're going to go a [10:14] little closer and see if we can get end [10:15] on a win here [10:16] okay oh you got to chew it miss you got [10:19] to chew it you got to chew it good good [10:23] girl yes that's what I want good girl [10:27] good job very nice ready [10:29] okay I chose with colani to stop at that [10:32] particular distance from that particular [10:33] distraction in that moment because that [10:35] was a big progression she went from [10:37] pulling herself almost choking herself [10:39] on the leash 15 feet away to sitting [10:41] nicely at my side uh about four four and [10:43] a half feet away and that to me was a [10:45] really really big progression and each [10:47] distraction and each dog are going to be [10:49] a little bit more individual now because [10:51] she had made such great choices three or [10:53] four in a row that was the time I said [10:55] okay that that's enough for now if we [10:57] start to push and do this too much the [11:00] dogs can start to get a little [11:01] frustrated so I like to do this for [11:03] short periods of time look for those [11:04] little winds along the way and then say [11:06] great we're done for the day we're going [11:08] to head off we're going to make [11:08] something a little bit easier I know the [11:10] first comment that's going to come up [11:11] when this video gets published is of [11:13] course the dog's going to make that [11:14] choice you're inside there's no [11:19] distractions and that's absolutely the [11:21] point we need to spend time teaching [11:23] these skills away from distractions and [11:25] then eventually the dog learns to make [11:28] those choices in busier situations so [11:30] would I stay inside forever with this [11:32] particular exercise no my next [11:33] progression would be getting her right [11:35] near that particular distraction and [11:36] making the choice so that my leash [11:38] wasn't preventing her from getting there [11:40] she was absolutely making the choice and [11:41] she had the opportunities to and my [11:43] level UPS would be change the [11:44] distraction have a family member run [11:46] back and forth and then I might do this [11:48] out in my backyard you know what I want [11:50] my dogs to do is again see a squirrel go [11:52] by and say hey that's a cool squirrel [11:53] what should you and I do about it not [11:55] hey there's a squirrel squirrel and I'm [11:57] going to head on out so that's where [11:58] things like your leash or your long line [12:00] can really help take away the choices [12:02] that we don't want the dogs to make and [12:03] help direct them to make the choices [12:05] that we do which is ultimately to choose [12:07] you if you want more tips on how to get [12:09] more focused from your dog and

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,, Part 279/429,store I like that it's [01:48] called blueberry and not blue yeah [01:51] that's [01:51] fantastic anyway I wanted to mention to [01:54] our live stream uh train station [01:56] passengers because uh I don't I don't [01:58] want I'd love for you guys to get get [02:00] them and who knows how long till we run [02:02] out I know anyway okay let's dive into [02:05] this we need to talk about the three [02:06] elements that you need to be aware of be [02:09] thinking about oh for those of you that [02:11] went to go get your notepad I appreciate [02:13] that or maybe you've got your phone out [02:15] to take notes now I don't want you to [02:17] take a single note oh unless you plan on [02:22] doing something about it because so [02:24] often we'll sit down with you in the [02:25] live stream or you know we'll see on [02:27] videos there's all sorts of uh you know [02:29] educ ational content suggestions and and [02:31] training and then people say like well [02:33] you know I I haven't tried that yet but [02:35] it's probably not going to work or you [02:37] know oh yeah I watched the whole video [02:39] but I haven't practiced it yet the most [02:41] important you know education uh um is [02:44] nothing without action you know it's [02:46] really the application of knowledge is [02:49] power is really where we're going with [02:51] this so whatever we talk about tonight [02:53] as we go through our Tri teaching plan [02:54] you need to be aware of the fact that [02:57] you can take it in but you're going to [02:58] have to practice it especially if you [03:01] have a dog who's struggling with the [03:02] nuisance behavior and has had an [03:04] opportunity to rehearse the bad stuff so [03:06] be aware of that um why don't we talk [03:10] about we had a super chat right off the [03:12] top of the show why don't we talk about [03:14] Lisa's challenge uh thank you for the [03:17] Super Chat you should add James to that [03:19] Lisa to that channel um he's in okay hi [03:24] there Lisa here from Katie Texas with my [03:27] eight-month-old border collie uh Milo [03:30] how can I stop my pup to start barking [03:33] at can you make it a little bit bigger [03:36] for me oh oh yeah sorry uh at everything [03:40] people walking by Shadows dog next door [03:42] laugh out loud thanks so much yep I [03:44] think it's pretty normal for especially [03:46] um bordoli or any of those hurting [03:48] breeds actually a lot of breeds not even [03:49] specific hurting breeds um to bark at [03:53] things that they see walking by Shadows [03:56] um that type of thing they can be very [03:57] easily stimulated by anything that has [03:59] to do do with motion um especially with [04:01] bord col specifically um they can get a [04:04] real internal high off of reacting to [04:07] those things so the most important thing [04:09] you want to do right now Lisa is try to [04:11] stop the opportunity for your puppy to [04:14] rehearse doing those things so for [04:17] example if your puppy is in the living [04:19] room with the you know Windows wide open [04:21] curtains wide open and people are [04:22] walking by and your puppy just has free [04:23] access to the uh window to see those [04:26] things and is barking barking barking [04:28] reaction before you can do anything [04:29] you're really making your job a little [04:31] bit harder because you're um addressing [04:34] it even maybe you're not addressing it I [04:35] don't know but if you are addressing it [04:36] you're doing it after the dog's already [04:38] in this really heightened state so you [04:41] want to try and make sure that you're [04:42] not allowing the dog to um to the best [04:44] of your ability to rehearse those types [04:46] of things um as often because it will [04:49] become more um of an ingrained behavior [04:52] um so prevention is going to be [04:54] important so think about all of the [04:55] typical scenarios where your puppy May [04:57] react that you would prefer them not to [04:59] and try to avoid those or to try to um [05:02] get ahead of the storm by uh um getting [05:05] your dog's um mind on something else [05:08] further to that and this is a a comment [05:10] that can be generalized to all kinds of [05:12] unwanted behaviors so if those of you [05:13] are listening don't have this particular [05:15] problem this answer can can solve many [05:18] problems and that is when you're in a [05:20] scenario um where your dog is is doing a [05:22] bad behavior one of the best things to [05:25] do is to teach your dog to do something [05:28] else instead of that bad behavior teach [05:31] them to do something else and one of the [05:32] easiest ways to do it is to use some [05:34] type of motivator that's going to get [05:35] their attention so using this as an [05:37] example if I'm walking down the street [05:39] and my dog typically is going to lock [05:41] onto something and start barking I might [05:43] you know start to anticipate that thing [05:45] happening and I might move off to the [05:47] side and get my dog to sit um and maybe [05:49] work some attention with some treats or [05:51] maybe my dog likes to be a little bit [05:52] more active I might call my dog and pull [05:54] out their favorite tug toy or maybe [05:55] their Frisbee and have a little game of [05:58] tug and then have the dog sit and look [05:59] at me and then play tug again kind of [06:01] distract the dog as that um thing goes [06:05] by to redirect my dog's attention and [06:08] what we often find happens if the person [06:10] has good timing which more on that later [06:12] is some dogs will start to go there's a [06:16] person coming but I know that when that [06:18] person comes typically my mom gets my [06:20] attention then we play and before you [06:22] even ask them they start to generalize [06:25] that that means I turn and I interact [06:28] with my mom um and you can start to [06:30] change the narrative a little bit but [06:31] again that um formula of training can be [06:35] applied to many different problematic [06:37] behaviors but there's using barking as [06:39] an example yeah um you could also if [06:42] it's barking in the house and uh it's [06:43] sort of like abrupt noises outside you [06:45] can always use something like music to [06:47] uh fill your space we actually um [06:49] created music with a bunch of music [06:50] producers uh specifically for dogs with [06:53] a few you know um very intentional [06:56] choices that were made with the music [06:58] whether it's the pace or the tones um to [07:00] fill your space you can see Mand Do's [07:02] music on Spotify or apple music or [07:04] there's even a YouTube channel Mand Do's [07:06] music watch how much Freedom the dog's [07:07] getting and how much opportunity they're [07:09] sort of doing their own thing and being [07:12] able to kind of make up their own agenda [07:13] while they're young like that because [07:15] they're just so impressionable and if [07:16] you leave them with nothing to do they [07:18] will find something to do so you have to [07:19] be careful about that yeah good um let's [07:22] talk a little bit about the three steps [07:24] sort of the three things that you need [07:25] to be aware of to make sure you're [07:28] giving your dog the best information [07:30] this is also the kind of thing that is [07:32] that is going to speed up the training [07:35] uh and it's going to be essential if you [07:37] have a dog that's rehearsed whatever [07:38] this problem behavior is for any length [07:40] of time the first and a crucial one I [07:44] mean all of these are crucial but I [07:45] really want you to think about this is [07:47] foundation and [07:49] fairness this is something that comes up [07:51] a lot when we talk about dogs who are [07:53] jumping up dogs who are pulling on leash [07:55] I mean that's an unwanted Behavior a [07:57] little bit more of a skill but it's so [07:59] common when I hear someone say oh my dog [08:01] just was won't ever stop pulling un [08:03] leash so won't we go out the door he's [08:04] pulling or he's never really walked very [08:07] well I want you to think to yourself [08:09] whatever you know what drop your problem [08:11] in the chat what's one thing that you'd [08:13] love to solve tonight drop it in the [08:14] chat let's I'd like to see the variety [08:18] of challenges that you're having um but [08:21] if you could fix one thing let's talk [08:22] about that drop it in the chat so [08:24] specific specifically to with um walking [08:28] unleash you know if you're going out and [08:31] you are struggling with your walks and [08:32] you're it's never going well and you [08:34] think to yourself like gez I don't know [08:35] if I'm going to ever overcome this um I [08:38] want you to really consider what [08:39] Foundation does your dog have and the [08:41] reason we included fairness in this is [08:45] if if you're putting your dog in a [08:48] situation where they're likely to fail [08:50] then you're not being fair about the [08:52] situation and this can mean uh maybe [08:56] leaving them alone too long uh giving [08:58] them access to your house in places [09:01] where they keep having accidents or they [09:03] continue to chew on stuff or you know [09:05] whatever the case may be uh maybe it's a [09:08] busy environment that you're really [09:10] struggling with well the worst thing you [09:11] can do is take that dog and put them in [09:14] that situation and have any expectation [09:16] that they're going to be successful that [09:18] by chance this time it's going to work [09:21] I'll give you a a one that I've heard [09:23] and seen is you go out to the park uh [09:26] unfortunately in this specific instance [09:28] I'm thinking of someone who went out to [09:29] the dog park and they say whenever I [09:31] call him he will never come back I mean [09:34] that's an unreasonable expectation [09:35] number one Foundation what's the [09:37] foundation of that skill that you're [09:39] looking for think about that whatever [09:41] your problem behavior is and is it fair [09:43] to expect your dog to this time make the [09:47] right choice when historically they [09:49] haven't when they keep failing over and [09:51] over again foundation and fairness is [09:53] going to be a really important I love [09:55] when kale um I forget I honestly I [09:57] forget what we were talking about when [09:59] when you got to this point but you [10:00] talked a little bit about an [10:01] incompatible Behavior you know maybe [10:03] it's jumping up but you you get the dog [10:05] to do something so that they can't do [10:07] the thing that you don't like that's a [10:09] great foundational step for you um I [10:13] think another thing to remember too what [10:15] Ken's saying is so good I'm just going [10:16] to sort of make it really blunt for you [10:20] and that is dogs don't come to us [10:23] knowing how to walk on a loose leash how [10:26] to come when they're called reliably [10:28] that is all up to us to teach them and [10:31] often what we see happens is people put [10:33] their dog in a university level [10:36] challenge when they've never taken their [10:39] dog to kindergarten which kindergarten [10:40] is Canadian I don't know what they say [10:42] in in the States or other places but you [10:44] know from the beginning so um you know [10:47] walking is a great example A lot of [10:48] people say well my dog just pulls me [10:50] around the the street what do I do well [10:52] have you trained him to know how to keep [10:55] a leash loose leash Lo a loose leash say [10:59] do they uh do they know how to stop and [11:01] sit at your side on a loose leash do [11:02] they know how to respond to leave it do [11:04] they know how to look at you on command [11:06] do they know how to turn away from [11:07] distractions do they have leash respect [11:09] there's so many things that we train our [11:13] dogs to do in our programs and in our [11:15] training methods before we even have [11:17] somebody go on a walk which is shocking [11:20] to people and the reason why we do it is [11:23] I can spend a half an hour working on [11:25] training my dog how to have walking [11:27] unleash skills in my house in my [11:30] driveway in my backyard rather than [11:32] going for a half hour walk around the [11:33] block so when I get to the point where [11:35] I'm ready to take with the show on the [11:36] road I actually can go for a pleasant [11:39] walk with a dog that you know knows that [11:42] I'm alive and and wants to check in with [11:44] me and doesn't pull on the leash but a [11:45] lot of times and we don't even know that [11:47] we do it um we put them in a scenario [11:50] where it's so easy for the dog to fail [11:52] because we kind of expect the dog should [11:53] just do the thing but we've not done any [11:56] of the foundational work to make sure [11:57] that the thing works and every dog is a [12:00] little bit different there are some dogs [12:01] out there that are a bit more easygoing [12:03] than others um but I've seen a lot of [12:05] dogs that have Natures like that but if [12:07] they have poor information um you know [12:10] they get worse with things because [12:12] they're really just as good as what what [12:14] information they're getting uh from us [12:16] so it's really important that you [12:17] understand that um I've grabbed two uh [12:20] heart dog supporters comments and [12:22] they're kind of they're comparable that [12:24] we can address so Paula says my [12:26] 2-year-old golden doodle has incredible [12:28] pre Drive how do I get her attention [12:30] when she's zeroing in on a squirrel [12:32] Moira has a comparable challenge chasing [12:36] leaves on a windy day when out walking [12:39] now as dog trainers we can see the [12:40] relationship between these two um [12:42] challenges that you guys have um and [12:46] this is where we need to talk a little [12:47] bit about F A foundational exercise I [12:50] mean those situations could be very [12:52] different if you're not out both on a [12:53] walk but um the foundation for this [12:55] exercise and the fairness and [12:57] expectation that you can have is you can [12:59] start to work on something like a [13:00] leaveit command this is something that [13:02] we teach our dogs fairly early it's [13:04] certainly something that we talk a lot [13:06] about in our in our life skills program [13:08] and um let's talk a little bit about why [13:10] the leave it is a valuable skill and how [13:13] these guys might be able to use it and [13:14] we can get a little bit deeper into the [13:16] next two steps for sure leave it [13:17] teaching a dog to leave it is so [13:19] important and so our expectation of [13:21] leave it is when our dog is um looking [13:25] at something thinking about going to [13:27] something we use the demand leave it and [13:30] we expect our dogs to say okay that's [13:32] off limits for me and they redirect [13:34] their attention back on us we um you [13:37] know if the dog has gone and the thing [13:40] is in the mouth and they've caught the [13:41] squirrel or they've got the leaf or [13:43] whatever um leave it is kind of no it's [13:46] not really it's sort of redundant at [13:47] that point because they have the thing [13:48] now they not going to leave it um you [13:50] would ask them to drop it or whatever [13:52] but that's a different um Direction so [13:54] leave it the expectation is you don't go [13:56] to that thing in the first place so um [13:58] when we're teaching such thing we like [14:00] to again work on the foundation of the [14:03] lesson when we are not stuck in the um [14:08] actual problem so the first time my dog [14:11] hears leave it is not going to be when [14:14] I'm outside with squirrels around you [14:15] know it might be in the kitchen of the [14:18] living room where there's like nothing [14:20] going on and there might be one [14:22] distraction that I have pre-placed I've [14:25] I've pre-thought about to put on the [14:27] ground that might be like kind of [14:28] interesting for my dog but maybe not [14:30] that exciting and then I might be armed [14:32] with something that I know my dog loves [14:34] like their favorite treat their favorite [14:36] toy whatever it might be and I would [14:38] spend some time teaching the dog that [14:40] when you look at that thing that I've to [14:42] put as a distraction out for you and I [14:44] say leave it and then I then show you [14:46] something of greater value it does not [14:49] take long before their ears start to [14:51] perk up and they check in when they hear [14:53] the word leave it because they [14:54] understand if I leave that something [14:56] better is going to come my way from my [14:58] person um and then of course you can [15:00] build more distractions you might change [15:02] the environment that you're training in [15:04] but there's a lot of foundational skills [15:06] that will go into that so that if you [15:08] are out in real life scenarios you're [15:11] you've got some money in the bank with [15:12] that leave it command they've heard it [15:14] you know 5060 70 80 times and they've [15:16] done so much turning back to you um I'm [15:20] always amazed at at my young puppy [15:23] responses to leave it when I have them [15:25] outside because of the foundational [15:27] stuff that that I'll do first and you [15:29] know by the time they're you know 12 14 [15:31] 15 16 weeks old um you know if they go [15:34] to picking a stick up on the yard or [15:36] whatever it might be and I call their [15:37] name or I say leave it the puppies are [15:39] already turning back to me and it's not [15:41] because they're some brain child it's [15:44] because I've practiced in other [15:45] scenarios so the dog actually learns [15:48] that leaving it and coming to me is a [15:50] valuable thing so that's where that [15:52] Foundation really comes in we need to [15:54] spend some time um putting value on the [15:56] behavior we want so that the thing that [15:58] the dog wants to do doesn't become as [16:01] exciting anymore I I really love how you [16:04] gave that example because you talked [16:06] about foundation and fairness at the [16:08] same time um you're setting the dog up [16:10] in a situation where you're kind of [16:12] controlling the environment and if you [16:14] were to expect to go out on your walk as [16:17] you regularly do and uh try to work [16:20] through the leave it you your [16:22] environment might be too stimulating and [16:23] it would be unfair to try to introduce [16:26] your dog to this new skill brand new [16:28] thing they've never heard of and you're [16:29] s you're kind of figuring out how you're [16:31] going to train through this and your dog [16:33] doesn't have a chance um Shannon always [16:35] makes a comment about uh learning math [16:38] or teaching math or learning math in an [16:40] amusement park or something like that [16:41] this would be a situation like that [16:43] you're already trying to teach your dog [16:44] a relatively complicated thing that they [16:46] naturally don't want to do like your dog [16:48] is bred or they want to chase the right [16:51] well they want to get the thing you know [16:53] uh through years and years and years uh [16:55] that the dogs have been bred to do that [16:57] kind of thing so um teaching them to [16:59] choose you and to listen to you over [17:02] getting that thing which is they just [17:04] naturally want to do it's going to be [17:06] difficult however with the right steps [17:09] uh and good timing you can be very [17:11] successful the next most important thing [17:13] to think about when we're talking about [17:15] stopping some of these nuisance [17:17] behaviors is your timing the amount of [17:20] struggle that I went through as a [17:22] student or as a before I was a student [17:24] like as a an average dog owner who had [17:26] lots of problems with my dog before I [17:28] went to Mand [17:29] dogs was I just didn't understand the [17:33] timing thing and once you figure out the [17:36] timing that's required for these [17:39] situations to to Really intervene when [17:42] you need to to give your dog the right [17:44] information um when you need to it's [17:46] going to change this Behavior entirely [17:48] it's going to allow you to intercept the [17:51] dog's thinking they're you're going to [17:52] be amazed so an example would be the [17:54] leave it command when should you give [17:56] the leave it [17:57] command uh when your dog is thinking [18:00] about going to the thing yeah and tell [18:02] me at home how do you think you're how [18:05] how would you know that your dog's [18:06] thinking about going to something we [18:08] give Pur said thinking and not the other [18:10] word yeah yeah you know what Cue are you [18:13] going to have that your dog's thinking [18:14] about leaving you your dog thinking [18:16] about getting after something you know [18:19] what what is what's that Quee going to [18:20] be for you because timing is going to [18:23] lead to uh it's going to allow you to [18:26] train the dog more quickly it's going to [18:27] make more sense for the dog but it's [18:29] also going to allow you to be more [18:30] successful um and when you especially [18:33] with something like a leave it this is [18:34] going to be so important but it's also [18:36] going to be timing is important so that [18:38] you don't become dependent on food as an [18:41] example if you do things out of order or [18:43] if you do things with poor timing you [18:45] are going to become dependent on the [18:46] food and we talk we use a lot of food in [18:49] training at the beginning um you know [18:51] that's on purpose we work really hard to [18:54] make sure that we have a resource that [18:55] the dogs naturally want but the whole [18:58] point of the McAn method is to work away [19:00] from the food so that we're using the [19:02] dog's motivation uh that is you know [19:05] that's why they're making those choices [19:07] we'll still reward we'll randomly reward [19:09] great choices we'll still use food but [19:11] we we're not dependent on it it's going [19:13] to be really important so Karina says [19:16] the right [19:17] answer looking at the thing looking at [19:20] the thing you got it yeah that's going [19:22] to be your first indication that your [19:23] dog's thinking that they're going to go [19:25] after something and then you and then [19:28] you would react then you would react [19:29] with leave it or you might react by [19:32] stepping on your house line if you're in [19:33] the house or you might react by shorting [19:36] up on your leash and changing direction [19:38] away from the distraction um you might [19:41] say leave it and pull out your high [19:43] value reward and lure your dog's [19:45] attention away from what they're [19:47] distracting there's lots of things that [19:48] you can do but it all starts with that [19:50] first cue followed by some type of [19:52] follow through yeah and I mean it's [19:54] going to be different for each situation [19:56] and this is where we can get into a [19:58] little a little more specifics like in [19:59] the online training programs and that [20:00] kind of thing for your dog and for your [20:02] I know someone said like coordination is [20:04] challenging too tot yeah and we can [20:06] appreciate that but um the big picture [20:09] here is that you need to use good timing [20:11] the moment your dog's thinking about [20:12] jumping up on the counter the moment [20:14] your dog's thinking about how about if [20:16] you're having house training problems [20:18] body training problems the moment you [20:20] see your dog start to Circle or they [20:23] start to squat if you can interrupt that [20:25] moment boy what a great training [20:27] opportunity is for your oh okay I don't [20:31] know how she knew that's what I was to [20:33] do but I get it now this is the wrong [20:35] thing magician absolutely but you know [20:38] this is exactly this is how you're going [20:41] to make sure that your dog's not [20:43] self-rewarding getting that thing some [20:45] dogs are completely satisfied just [20:47] chasing you know just running after that [20:50] that squirrel or running after those [20:51] leaves might be enough to be satisfying [20:54] enough that's going to make it harder to [20:55] train through but if you if you see the [20:57] them uh their mind Focus or attention [20:59] focus that thing you drop your leave it [21:02] this is going to require one thing it's [21:04] going to require that you are [21:07] supervising or you have control of your [21:10] dog in one way or another whether it's a [21:12] six foot leash or maybe it's a long line [21:14] or house line in the house supervision [21:17] is going to be a really important part [21:18] of this because if you don't catch them [21:20] in the act you can't do anything about [21:22] it you know especially if it's chewing [21:24] and house training problems and all of [21:26] these other things it requires some [21:28] supervision and um that is how you're [21:30] going to have great timing now this [21:32] isn't forever you're not going to have [21:34] to be eyes on your dog all of the time [21:36] but when you're struggling with [21:37] something it's worth your time to invest [21:40] in watching the dog closely really [21:43] focusing knowing that hey they might [21:45] make a mistake here I'm going to make [21:46] sure that I have some control with my [21:47] leash or line maybe it's a long line and [21:50] I'm going to be ready to issue that [21:52] leave at command or you know give them [21:53] the information that that's not what I [21:55] want sometimes you know leave it as a [21:57] relative L specific example we sometimes [22:00] we use a negative verbal verbal [22:02] reprimand something like an ah or hey [22:05] something to Mark the moment when [22:06] they've made surprise them almost that's [22:08] right yeah it's so valuable especially [22:09] with house training MH yeah that can be [22:11] really really helpful um you know I [22:14] sometimes if I'm house training puppies [22:17] I will um not yell but sort of like hey [22:19] hey what are you doing and I'll clap my [22:21] hands the puppies are like who whoa what [22:22] that's that but very quickly I turn from [22:25] you know surprising the puppy to say [22:27] whoa we stop what you're doing [22:28] and then I scoop them up and then take [22:30] them outside right away but um you know [22:32] timing is so important because you know [22:34] if the dogs had the mistake and then [22:36] they're off having a nap in the other [22:37] room and you happen to walk in and be [22:39] like ah this is annoying this is here [22:41] you know dogs don't really think like [22:43] humans do they they live in the moment [22:45] so if they you know did a bad behavior [22:47] number one they might not know it's bad [22:49] and number two if it's you know one [22:51] minute later 30 minutes later 4 hours [22:54] later they're not going to correlate [22:55] that you're angry because they you know [22:57] you know had an accident on the floor [22:59] they just don't understand that so then [23:01] we end up getting upset with our dogs [23:03] and we confuse them because they don't [23:04] even know why which means they can't [23:06] change the behavior um in the future [23:09] because they don't even know why you're [23:10] upset in the first place but if you're [23:12] able to interrupt or acknowledge uh a [23:16] bad behavior or good behavior in the [23:18] moment the dog can go oh this reaction [23:22] is for this behavior that I'm doing I [23:24] get it now I understand what I'm [23:25] supposed to do and then we can you know [23:27] show them if it's potty accident I can [23:30] say no this is wrong out we go puppy [23:33] finish excuse me finishes outside and [23:36] then I can you know change my tune and [23:37] praise and make a big deal for my puppy [23:39] to go outside so it's very easy for them [23:42] to understand this is not an acceptable [23:44] behavior this is an acceptable behavior [23:47] but I think a lot of people um they um [23:51] give information to the dog as if um you [23:54] know the dog is a human or it's you know [23:56] the the timing is so late and then they [23:59] get frustrated why isn't the dog [24:00] changing their behaviors why isn't it [24:02] working and so many times it comes down [24:07] specifically to timing because people [24:10] just give the information way too late [24:12] and the poor dog just doesn't have a hot [24:14] clue what you're talking about because [24:16] it just doesn't make sense to them so um [24:19] you can't have great timing if you don't [24:22] have good supervision so if there are uh [24:24] any unwanted behaviors whether it's you [24:26] know in the house or outside the or [24:28] whatever it might be if you're not [24:29] watching your dog you're not able to [24:31] give great information with good timing [24:33] so those two things really go hand in [24:36] hand if it's you know trying to stop an [24:37] unwanted Behavior but the same thing [24:39] goes for um you know going back to our [24:41] walking on leash talk you know if I'm [24:43] walking my dog and I'm walking by you [24:46] know a neighbor's house that maybe has a [24:48] wild and crazy dog and my dog starts to [24:50] react and I continue to walk down the [24:52] street doing absolutely nothing to my [24:54] dog and then eventually my arm gets [24:55] tired and I get irritated and then now [24:57] I'm I'm upset with the dog well you know [25:00] the reaction to the dog's Behavior [25:02] should have happened the moment the dog [25:04] started to make a poor reaction not [25:07] three houses down the down the block [25:09] because your dog's going to go okay I [25:11] can react for you know 15 seconds and [25:13] then I'm not allowed to anymore um [25:15] you've got to make sure that your timing [25:17] is really really um quick now I'm giving [25:20] you um suggestions for um you know [25:24] correcting your dog but if you want to [25:26] be a great dog trainer your timing [25:28] better be awesome when you're rewarding [25:30] your dog because what we know from [25:32] training dogs is dogs repeat what they [25:35] feel is rewarding to them and sometimes [25:38] those rewarding behaviors are not what [25:40] we love it's what what gets them excited [25:42] like jumping barking lunging those are [25:45] things we don't like but those are fun [25:46] for them what we want to do is try to [25:49] capture good behaviors and quickly [25:52] reward them with good timing so our dog [25:54] goes wait a second this choice is a [25:57] better thing thing to do instead we [25:59] really believe that when we're trying to [26:00] fix a behavior we want the dog to do [26:03] whatever they whatever we want them to [26:05] do right as many times as possible and [26:09] that should outweigh the amount of times [26:11] that the dog is doing that thing [26:12] incorrectly and if the balance is off if [26:15] the dog is making more errors than [26:17] successes we need to change what we're [26:20] doing about our our information timing [26:23] um level of distraction what whatever it [26:25] might be but your your timing needs to [26:28] be that you can catch things quickly if [26:31] there's a mistake but I would argue even [26:33] more importantly you need to be on the [26:36] money when you're wanting to reinforce [26:38] something because that if you can do [26:39] more of that number one it's way more [26:42] enjoyable for your dog and for you to be [26:43] training together and number two it [26:45] builds a stronger bond between you and [26:47] your dog because they go gosh you're so [26:49] clear you're so fun this is great I'm [26:51] getting rewards I'm getting play like [26:53] life is just wonderful when we can spin [26:56] it that direction I think that dropping [26:59] knowledge bombs I was gonna I was gonna [27:01] say preach uh editor James in studio 905 [27:05] who's unfortunately not with us tonight [27:07] uh is working in uh he's creating some [27:10] uh environments for us to use uh on the [27:13] live stream I think one's going to have [27:14] to be like a uh what's it called is it a [27:17] what's a Pew in in front of a church [27:19] it's not a lecturn it's like a whatever [27:21] it's called you know what it could be a [27:23] soap box and we put you on it because [27:25] that [27:26] that bomb and then a bomb explodes yeah [27:30] and and all kinds of here's the problem [27:32] we just got demonetized on YouTube [27:34] because he said that just kidding oh [27:35] because I said I said the b word yeah oh [27:38] crap no but in all seriousness in all [27:39] seriousness I mean the value of that [27:42] that last minute um you know this is [27:44] these are the kinds of things that I [27:45] went to Mand dogs for when I was a [27:47] student and um they really changed the [27:50] way I saw dogs how I understood how they [27:53] learned and I found it so valuable and [27:55] the more when I became an instructor at [27:56] McAn dogs this is the kind of [27:58] conversations I had to have with people [28:00] who are struggling if you're struggling [28:02] with your dog training this is the kind [28:04] of thing if you have to rewind this [28:06] after the show or whatever pay attention [28:08] to to to what kale mentioned really [28:10] valuable information I want to say a [28:12] huge thank you welcome to the heart dog [28:14] team Jess Kristen uh and David thank you [28:17] for joining us here welcome everybody [28:19] got pre sedat has dropped a Super Chat [28:22] I'm just going to grab it here and then [28:23] I'll put it up on the [28:25] screen PR sedat oh let me just get a [28:28] better picture of it there okay uh at [28:31] home I'm torn whether to keep my dog on [28:33] a leash near me or let him wander when [28:35] I'm still in the room I feel like he's [28:37] active uh when he's free and I I I I [28:39] hav't been close uh close to me in his [28:43] kennel so much so it's basically a [28:44] balance of like read that last sentence [28:46] again I feel like he's active when free [28:48] because I have him so close to me in his [28:51] kennel so much okay yeah so this is [28:53] basically a question about like [28:55] management of that time yeah great [28:57] question yeah um so yeah it can be hard [29:00] to know uh how much Freedom you should [29:01] give a dog um uh what we suggest that [29:04] you do when you have um a young dog in [29:07] your home is have a balance between [29:09] giving the dog some free time which I'll [29:11] talk about what free time is in our eyes [29:14] um versus some crate time I think a [29:16] really common mistake that people will [29:17] make and it sounds like you're not doing [29:18] this which is awesome um but people will [29:21] only put their dog in a crater or a [29:23] kettle when they're leaving or when [29:25] they're going to sleep and then [29:26] sometimes the start to build a a sour [29:29] association with the crate because they [29:30] just think you're going to leave them so [29:32] um it sounds like you are using it when [29:34] you're at home which is amazing uh but [29:35] we do need to have some balance because [29:37] we can't have a dog in a crate all day [29:38] long as well so um there's a couple [29:41] suggestions I I have for you number one [29:43] when your dog is out of the crate you do [29:45] need to have them on a leash or a line [29:48] it doesn't mean that you need to hold it [29:50] though so it should just be dragging [29:51] around behind your dog what we would [29:53] recommend though is um use some [29:56] barricades or or some blocks uh blocking [30:00] things to stop your dog from be able to [30:02] have free range of a big area of your [30:05] house like baby gates yeah baby gates or [30:06] xen or or something like that that you [30:08] can put across the doorway or close the [30:10] door so your dog's free in the room with [30:12] you or whatever it might be um and you [30:14] give them something productive to do but [30:15] I'm going to tell you that I always have [30:18] more luck with my dogs when I'm when I'm [30:20] working on free time if I've done it [30:23] after I've walked them or after I've [30:24] trained them or after I've done some uh [30:26] retrieving some Fetch with them or [30:28] something like that and then they've [30:30] come in they've had a drink they're kind [30:31] of ready to like kind of come down a [30:33] little bit because we've just done [30:34] something active that is a great time to [30:37] start working on free time because free [30:40] time in the house is not like let's have [30:43] a party and get into everything and jump [30:44] over here and like act like a crazy dog [30:47] it is like learn how to chill out and be [30:49] in the house um I might um have the dog [30:52] on the line and it's been many times if [30:54] I'm on the computer and I want to give [30:55] my dog some free time I'll have a dog [30:58] bed with like a you know one of their [30:59] favorite Che bones and I'll have the [31:01] long uh the house line on and I'll pull [31:04] the bed right beside my chair at my desk [31:07] I'll put my foot on the house line I'll [31:08] put the dog on the bed put the chewbone [31:10] on and I'll just let them chew away on [31:12] the bone or I'll give them a Kong or [31:13] something while I'm typing away and I [31:15] can kind of keep my eye on the dog but [31:16] that way they don't have free range and [31:18] if I'm typing away and the puppy is [31:20] driving me absolutely bananas because [31:22] they're just not able to settle that [31:24] tells me that they're not really in the [31:27] mind frame where they are able to to [31:29] chill there so I might be like hey I [31:31] have to get these 100 emails out so in [31:33] the crate you go or I might say okay I'm [31:35] going to take you outside we're going to [31:36] do something active and then we're going [31:37] to either come back in and try again but [31:39] typically you won't see us giving our [31:41] dog in the early stages just freedom to [31:44] do whatever in the house they usually [31:46] have some type of job that they are uh [31:49] doing or they're tired enough that like [31:53] going and chilling on a bed is kind of [31:55] what they want to do already um and that [31:58] really makes life so much easier um you [32:02] know we really work on a lot of settle [32:04] skills in our um life skills program [32:06] actually we do in our puppy Essentials [32:07] program as well um but teaching the dogs [32:09] how to do like a bed stay and and how to [32:11] go and lie down when they're told um I [32:14] think leave it name and go and lie down [32:17] are things that we work on so much in [32:19] the early stages for sure because they [32:21] allow you to manage the dog a little bit [32:23] more without getting frustrated with [32:24] them and then not having to Crate them [32:26] quite as much but if they can't behave [32:28] they can't have freedom out of the crate [32:29] so the more I can train the dog to [32:31] behave the less I'm I'm worried about [32:33] having to use the crate yeah uh you [32:35] mentioned life skills and puppy [32:36] Essentials talk briefly about that how [32:38] we can specifically help uh you and your [32:40] dog at home briefly our puppy Essentials [32:43] program we have one in person and we [32:45] also have one online it's for puppies [32:47] under four uh months of age and um we [32:51] work on a lot of exercises that are [32:54] going to prevent problems from down [32:56] thead road so um it's about building [32:59] relationship we work on nipping and [33:00] biting we work on leadership we work on [33:03] problem solving we of course we talk [33:04] about Basics and things like that but [33:06] really we're trying to get a um actually [33:08] the program used to be called Head Start [33:10] I was welln named because we get a head [33:12] start on things to stop them now um [33:14] obviously we have in classes starting [33:16] new every single every few weeks [33:18] actually um but our online classes have [33:20] no start and stop date in terms of when [33:22] you can begin you can literally start [33:24] tonight if you want to um and uh we work [33:27] really hard on our online programs to [33:29] try and offer as much personal support [33:32] as we possibly can um a lot of people [33:34] just think it's going to be like our [33:35] YouTube videos where you watch and you [33:36] try and decipher everything on your own [33:38] and that could not be further from the [33:40] truth there's a very structured program [33:42] that shows you exactly what to do but [33:44] the big thing about our online classes [33:46] is that if you get into a trouble where [33:47] you're following something and you're [33:49] like well it's not really working for me [33:51] you just get to you know contact one of [33:53] us and we can say actually you know Barb [33:55] and this dog you need for your you're [33:57] dog you need to do it this way so we get [33:59] to know you and then our life skills [34:00] program is for dogs over four months um [34:03] and we are going to get more into the [34:04] nitty-gritty things like walking and [34:06] recalls and things like that um manners [34:09] uh self-control all of that but the same [34:12] uh great support that you get for puppy [34:13] Essentials but a lot of big picture you [34:15] know the conversations that happen every [34:17] day in those programs talks about the [34:18] why you mentioned really quickly like [34:20] you know uh you might be letting your [34:22] puppy out of their kennel or your dog [34:24] out of their kennel or letting them in [34:25] the house or whatever and having some [34:27] expectation that they're just going to [34:28] go lie down on a bed when that's fairly [34:31] unreasonable but if your plan is you get [34:33] your dog out of their kennel or whatever [34:35] you take them outside for the pee bring [34:36] them back in and then you have a game of [34:38] tug or do something that's engaging with [34:40] them maybe work a little skill some [34:41] skills or something now you've tired [34:44] them out and now you've got 30 minutes [34:46] maybe an hour whatever that amount of [34:47] time is where you can work on a settle [34:49] on your bed where you can do your work [34:51] and and watch a movie or whatever the [34:53] thing is but I think the struggle that a [34:55] lot of people have is that they'll uh [34:57] you know have walked their dog earlier [34:59] in the day and um their dog is still [35:01] full of beans and then they'll go on to [35:03] sit down and watch a movie and their dog [35:04] just can't help themselves but like [35:06] pester them the whole time or you know [35:08] bark in their kennel or bark in the [35:10] other room or whatever so um you know [35:13] understanding the order of operations in [35:15] this case uh but really understanding [35:17] the why like why why is it a good idea [35:19] to H why is it a good idea before bed to [35:22] do physical exercise uh mental [35:25] stimulation at exercise and then take [35:28] them out so that you can sleep all night [35:29] we talk a lot about that in those [35:31] programs absolutely I want to speak to I [35:33] saw a lot of people when we asked you [35:35] know what sort of challenges are you [35:36] having at home a lot of people mention [35:38] jumping up and jumping up is a great one [35:42] to uh apply these three steps too when [35:44] we talk about foundation and fairness uh [35:46] we have to talk about have they has your [35:48] dog learned to sit in at your side has [35:49] your dog learned to sit when someone was [35:52] was approaching them that's obviously [35:54] the foundation the fairness part would [35:56] be [35:57] you're not walking them right up to [35:58] strangers on the street you're not [36:00] letting them run uh around your house [36:02] when family's coming in uh without a [36:04] house line or a leash or even you know [36:06] not separating them from those people [36:08] because they're probably going to jump [36:09] up it's really exciting when people come [36:11] in the house but the timing part is the [36:13] part I really want to talk to you about [36:15] right now what indication we talked [36:17] about this earlier but what indication [36:19] is your dog going to give you that they [36:20] might jump up on the counter you know [36:23] what are they going to do before they [36:25] jump up on the counter what are they [36:26] going to do before they jump up on uh I [36:28] believe Shannon calls uh Aunt it aunt [36:31] Ida the person aunt Ida in the podcast [36:34] uh make sure you check out uh Mand Do's [36:36] podcast actually she may have just [36:37] launched it um but they talk a lot about [36:40] you know when you have an elderly family [36:42] member that comes in the home all of a [36:44] sudden the environment's changed your [36:45] choices have changed because you don't [36:47] want to put your aunt Ida in a tough [36:49] situation and you definitely don't want [36:51] your dog to hurt anybody but um what [36:54] might you see your dog do before they [36:56] jump up because this is going to allow [36:58] you to use good timing whether you're [37:01] out in the street or you're in the house [37:03] whatever it might be I'll let you guys [37:06] answer that I thought maybe you wanted [37:08] me to answer it oh I mean we probably [37:10] can start um just we'll wait see what [37:12] it's great Shannon said it's great and I [37:15] oh okay yeah [37:18] um super chat from Mischief manager I'm [37:22] going to grab that I don't see anyone [37:23] that's got any uh I don't think anybody [37:26] know I think we're a little ahead no one [37:28] suggested give him a second I think [37:29] we're a little ahead we'll see because I [37:32] I might not recognize this if I weren't [37:35] looking for it as a as a dog trainer [37:38] like I you know one of those things [37:39] David says they'll be looking look there [37:41] air sniffing okay Karina yeah that's [37:44] good you're right so all you know both [37:47] of those answers are correct but you [37:48] might even notice something else not [37:50] specifically looking though but like be [37:53] more detailed about looking cuz dogs [37:55] could look at somebody and not have any [37:57] interest in going to them so you're on [37:59] the right track but like there's [38:00] something a little bit more more [38:03] specific that's good though um did you [38:06] read that Super Chat uh no I was let's [38:09] answer this and then we'll get back to [38:10] it um air senting yeah back legs go up [38:14] yep or perhaps front legs go up yeah uh [38:18] yeah so we um sometimes will describe um [38:23] describe this as like um uh like a coil [38:27] so sometimes when dogs are really [38:28] excited and they're thinking about [38:29] jumping up they'll actually like kind of [38:31] go into a bit of a playbow and then um [38:34] they look like they're about to launch [38:36] them themselves into the air or some [38:37] dogs will like get really Wiggly or [38:39] their ears will pin back or their spine [38:42] kind of goes in a sea because they're [38:43] super excited and they're wiggling um [38:46] you know looking for sure those of you [38:47] guys that said looking is good but they [38:49] will look with sort of um a curiosity or [38:52] an intensity and there is like looking [38:55] and there's like looking it's like two [38:57] totally different types of things um [38:59] that they'll do their eyes will lock off [39:01] on for sure um and that's when that's [39:04] when we need to react because I think I [39:07] mentioned this earlier if you guys were [39:09] listening at the um uh beginning of our [39:11] our live tonight and that is there are [39:15] some on unwanted behaviors on our list [39:18] that dogs will do that are just glorious [39:21] and self-rewarding to a dog and [39:23] unfortunately jumping is one of those [39:25] things and a lot of people [39:27] struggle with jumping up because they [39:30] often don't react until the dog has [39:33] already jumped up on top of somebody and [39:35] they've jumped up and they're wiggling [39:36] and they're launching they're bopping [39:38] the person in the nose or whatever it [39:40] might be and then we're trying to get [39:41] the leash and pull the dog off and the [39:43] dog's like this is awesome this is so [39:46] fun and then you know you'll go through [39:48] the proper steps to get your dog to go [39:49] off but then you think start why is my [39:51] dog continuing to jump well it's because [39:54] your timing's off they're allowed to to [39:56] to jump for a few moments in the first [39:58] place because perhaps um you didn't have [40:01] them on leash or you didn't maybe [40:03] predict that scenario very well or maybe [40:05] you had your dog a little too close to [40:07] that person where it was too easy for [40:09] them to jump maybe you didn't have your [40:10] leash gathered up maybe you didn't have [40:12] your drg's attention there's like [40:13] countless countless things clearly um [40:15] that you can do but a lot of the time [40:17] it's because U our timing is off and if [40:19] you can stop your dog from jumping by [40:22] replacing it with a different Behavior [40:24] like sit for example again like I've [40:27] mentioned before take an unwanted [40:28] behavior and replace it with something [40:30] that you do want and then build value [40:32] for that behavior so the dog actually [40:34] really enjoys to do that instead um that [40:37] will be a better way to um to fix your [40:40] problem yeah and uh I was just thinking [40:42] as you were talking about that we're [40:44] talking a little bit about the dog being [40:46] pretty gratified by jumping up on [40:48] someone or jumping up on the counter [40:50] jumping up in general it isn't it [40:53] difficult when you have a friend a [40:55] family member a stranger who you meet on [40:57] the street and they're like oh it's fine [40:59] I love dogs and you you've been working [41:01] on this and you're like oh I can't [41:03] believe this is happening and they're [41:04] like oh just petting up your dog and [41:06] just having a great time the third thing [41:08] you need to think about the third step [41:11] factor that you need to think about when [41:12] you're trying to stop these unwanted [41:14] behaviors is consistency yes consistency [41:17] is key no matter where you are the [41:20] environment what time of day it is [41:22] whether you're tired or not maintain the [41:25] same expectations for your dog and this [41:27] comes down to consistency now with that [41:28] situation if a dog's jumping up on a [41:30] person it's in your best interest to say [41:33] oh no no you know they say oh it's fine [41:36] I love dogs say oh you know actually [41:37] we're trying to work on could you help [41:39] me train for a second there's a video we [41:41] have on I don't even know where it is [41:44] but it'll be really good if you're [41:45] struggling with uh your dog jumping up [41:47] on people I forget what it's called [41:48] people are ruining your training or [41:50] something like that um but it talks a [41:52] lot about you need to be consistent so [41:54] you ask that person you get them engage [41:56] and say hey can you help me train just [41:58] don't pet him right now you know I don't [41:59] really want him or her jumping up on you [42:02] uh can you just stay right there and [42:03] we're going to work on something I [42:05] actually have a personal story that I [42:07] can tell you about this that's sort of [42:08] funny yeah um it has to do with a border [42:11] colleague that I used to have years ago [42:12] uh named Jitterbug which maybe I should [42:14] have never called her that because she [42:16] was very much a jitterbug and um she [42:20] loved people loved people um so much and [42:25] she would wiggle then sometimes she [42:26] would even submissively pee because she [42:28] was a bit of a softy and she just had [42:32] very poor emotional control when she was [42:33] a puppy and I would uh try to do this I [42:37] would take her to different places where [42:38] people would be around and she was very [42:41] cute little border colly puppy everybody [42:43] also because she was so friendly people [42:45] just were naturally attracted to her [42:47] which made my job harder but I remember [42:50] telling people I would be working on her [42:52] sitting in control at my side with a [42:54] nice loose leash with attention and [42:55] people would walk up and I would have to [42:57] say to them stop right there don't come [43:00] any closer don't even look at her [43:02] because they would stand there and if [43:03] they made eye contact with her well she [43:05] would melt and start wiggling all over [43:08] again so I had some people really help [43:10] me they were so great CU I said will you [43:13] just help me just stand there for a [43:14] second turn your back to us Pretend [43:15] We're not here and they would just stand [43:17] there turn their back and then Jitter [43:18] would kind of be like okay they're not [43:20] really paying attention and she would [43:21] relax and sit at my side and then I [43:23] would reward and she would go oh okay [43:25] and then we would get the person to turn [43:27] around but look at me rather than look [43:29] at Jitter and again she'd wiggle for a [43:31] second and then she'd settle in her sit [43:33] under control and then I could reward [43:35] her and over a few weeks it did take a [43:37] few weeks not in one training session [43:39] that's important to remember yeah and [43:40] this is why consistency is so important [43:42] yeah we got to the point where people [43:44] could you know walk up and stand close [43:46] and get to the point where they could [43:47] pet her um but it took me a really long [43:50] time to get to that point because her [43:53] drive for greeting people was so immense [43:57] I had I had to really uh break that down [43:59] but it yeah it took weeks and weeks and [44:01] weeks and weeks um but it also took [44:03] getting those people to make it easier [44:06] on me because if I was working my butt [44:08] off to get her to be calm and not jump [44:10] and wiggle and pee everywhere and they [44:12] were leaning over top of her and oh [44:13] you're so cute like it's like no but if [44:18] you can kind of get ahead of the storm [44:19] and just give the person some coaching [44:21] on what to do you can have just the most [44:24] amazing training session [44:26] um and you can't beat that because it's [44:28] it was natural situations that this was [44:30] happening versus me like um setting it [44:33] up and uh it was excellent and you know [44:37] to speak to the consistency I know a lot [44:39] of people struggle because they think [44:40] like oh well you know we just got home [44:42] from dog school or you know oh he hasn't [44:44] had much fun today because we only went [44:47] one for one walk and you know I should [44:48] probably let him jump up this time this [44:51] is really where you can create a lot of [44:52] confusion for your dog this is [44:54] especially important for leash pulling I [44:57] struggle when students say something [44:59] like oh you know he pulls he he's great [45:01] the first half of the walk and then the [45:03] second half is an absolute disaster or [45:05] he's terrible while we're walking to the [45:07] park and then he's pretty good on the [45:08] way home well this is creating confusion [45:11] from in your dog you know it's not fair [45:13] to um have an expectation that they're [45:16] not going to pull un leash if half of [45:18] their walk you're allowing it you know [45:20] you can chalk it up to whatever the [45:21] situation is he's uh tired I'm tired uh [45:25] he wants to get to the Park but your dog [45:27] doesn't really rationalize that way you [45:28] know you need to make sure that you're [45:30] giving them great information 100% of [45:32] the time and this goes back a little bit [45:34] to talk about your the investment of [45:36] time and energy and it's going to be a [45:38] lot it's you know it can be a lot no [45:40] one's saying it's easy no or that it's [45:42] just a piece of cake for sure it is a [45:45] lot of work but if you put the work in [45:47] the type of enjoyment that you get from [45:51] a dog that listens well and you know [45:54] wants to hang out with you wants to [45:56] please you it's just there's really [45:59] truly nothing like it it's it's just so [46:01] much more enjoyable to live life with a [46:03] dog that has good manners and likes to [46:04] listen you can take them more places you [46:07] can give them more freedom they have a [46:09] better life you have a better life but I [46:11] think sometimes when you're in the deep [46:13] dark depths of Despair in the first like [46:16] 12 months really it's like oh my God [46:18] like I why did I sign up for this but it [46:21] does it makes a real sharp corner when [46:24] you get you know all the Foundation uh [46:26] Parts done and then it's so fun it is so [46:30] fun y yeah you know um I had a dog who [46:33] was 2 years old and um she was crazy and [46:37] this is before two years before she came [46:39] to yeah she was the reason that too that [46:41] I went to M and uh you know she it was [46:43] frustrating you know I just wanted to go [46:45] home from work and take her for a nice [46:47] walk and go play fetch at the park well [46:49] I didn't have a chance because she [46:50] didn't have the listening skills I'd [46:51] given her bad information all up until [46:53] that point and then I went to my vet at [46:55] who who had trouble assessing her cuz [46:57] she was just so much wild and crazy [46:59] energy and he said listen you have to go [47:01] over to Mand dogs like I can't even [47:03] assess her you need to get some skills [47:05] um so that's exactly what I did and now [47:07] uh you know 17 or 18 years later I uh [47:10] wear the shirt you got a blue shirt on I [47:11] got a blue shirt um from Mischief [47:14] manager thank you for the Super Chat [47:16] discovered you guys tonight while uh [47:18] looking for puppy biting videos can't [47:20] wait can't wait to binge watch your [47:21] content my 14we old Dolby is driving me [47:24] and my kiddos crazy is biting and [47:26] jumping thank you a yeah very cute well [47:30] there'll be no uh no running out of [47:32] videos for you to watch so uh Kristen uh [47:37] mentions oh here's a really good topic [47:38] for the future how to get family members [47:40] used to the same to use the same [47:41] commands consistently how to train the [47:43] human and this is going to be a big step [47:45] in your consistency um plan you know [47:47] we've talked about foundation and [47:49] fairness we've talked about timing but [47:51] consistency might require more of the [47:53] family members in this and it is [47:54] important we get this question often and [47:56] it's usually something like can you [47:58] train husbands can you train us what the [48:00] question is yeah can you can you put a [48:01] Gentle Leader on my husband right you [48:03] know can you train my husband or get him [48:05] to to can you convince him to not let [48:07] the dog jump up or not nip and bite uh [48:10] everyone's hands or his hands and I'll [48:13] tell you you know I think just being [48:15] really honest with your spouse family [48:17] member friend whoever the person is [48:19] that's setting you back say you know I'm [48:21] working really hard and trying to fix [48:22] whatever this problem is and you know I [48:24] know I watch the train station last [48:26] night and they said there the [48:28] consistency is really important and Ken [48:29] and kale will personally come to the [48:31] house and kick your butt if you don't [48:33] listen yeah they uh you know I'm hired [48:35] out as a muscle or look how scary he is [48:37] yeah aren't they scary I will say this [48:39] often I get this question a lot from [48:41] spouses that are frustrated with one [48:43] another sometimes we feel a little bit [48:44] like psychiatrists um but something that [48:47] I always try to like have them think [48:50] about is that this isn't this is really [48:52] all of these decisions that we're making [48:55] about you know consistency it's because [48:57] we all want the best for the dog it's [49:00] really about the dog so if you can kind [49:02] of spin it that way that it's like more [49:05] fair more clear less stressful all of [49:08] those things for the dog if everybody's [49:10] on the same page because at the end of [49:11] the day everybody in the family loves [49:13] the dog everybody in the family wants [49:15] the best for the dog and if they're if [49:16] they can understand that you know being [49:19] on the same page and and being [49:20] consistent is all going to leave to lead [49:23] to the dog having less stress getting [49:25] trained faster um being happier all of [49:28] that type of thing then it's easier to [49:30] kind of get everybody on board make it [49:32] about the dog and less about you yeah [49:34] and uh statistically train dogs live [49:36] longer did you know that yeah yeah I [49:38] mean for obvious reasons of course yeah [49:40] I can believe it when we're talking [49:41] about solving some of your you know um [49:45] most [49:46] persistent frustrating uh struggles the [49:50] the the uh behaviors that drive you [49:52] crazy you have to focus on the three [49:54] steps foundation and fairness what have [49:57] you taught your dog should they [49:59] understand this at this point and are [50:00] you putting them in a situation where [50:02] they could be expected to make a good [50:03] choice if not you need to change some [50:05] things around timing is it happening [50:07] when you aren't watching well that's not [50:08] your dog's fault that's your fault you [50:10] need to make sure that you're putting [50:11] yourself in a position where you can [50:13] have great timing where you're looking [50:15] for that problem Behavior whether it's [50:16] digging in the yard barking at the [50:18] neighbor whatever it is you need to be [50:19] giving your dog great information with [50:22] you know in a in an absence of [50:24] information they're going to think what [50:25] whatever feels good whatever tastes good [50:28] is the right thing so you need to be [50:29] sure that you're there to get show them [50:31] what is the right choice and consistency [50:34] it's going to be work but it is so very [50:37] worth it tonight we talked a little bit [50:40] about um those three challenges we have [50:42] uh both inperson and online programs [50:44] available for you uh visit Mand do.

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,, Part 284/429,~Ken #puppytrainingmorning #mccanndogs === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] every day is a new day with your puppy [00:01] and each morning your day starts off [00:03] getting ready getting that dog ready for [00:05] the day and getting yourself ready for [00:06] the day but I can tell you there are [00:08] five common mistakes that you don't [00:09] realize you're making in your puppy [00:11] training in today's video I'm going to [00:13] go over those I'm instructor Steve [00:15] welcome back to Mand [00:19] dogs you just woke up you got to get [00:22] your puppy outside so what did you do [00:24] you picked that puppy out of their crate [00:25] went downstairs popped him outside and [00:28] then went inside to make your coffee the [00:30] puppies outside doing their business but [00:32] what happened when they were outside do [00:34] you know you think they may have gone to [00:36] the bathroom and now they've come back [00:37] inside and now you're enjoying that [00:39] wonderful cup of coffee but you turn [00:40] around and all of a sudden there is a [00:42] mess on your kitchen or your living room [00:44] floor well it's important that when we [00:46] have a puppy we really keep an eye on [00:48] what happens when they're outside [00:49] puppies are very easily distracted so [00:51] instead of just popping them outside and [00:53] hoping they go to the bathroom get along [00:55] line on them head outside with that [00:57] puppy see what they do the world is a [00:59] pretty pretty darn distracting place [01:00] they might have been distracted by the [01:02] wind or the grass or the snow or [01:03] whatever happens to be encourage them to [01:05] go to the bathroom if you're using a [01:07] command to have them go to the bathroom [01:09] calmly repeat that command when they do [01:11] praise them pet them don't feed them for [01:14] that though the big thing we want to [01:15] make sure is that a they are going to [01:17] the bathroom they're getting rid of all [01:18] that stuff and B that they understand [01:19] that there's no cooking involved it is [01:21] just your praise what that's going to do [01:22] is allow you to then come back inside [01:24] and know that they don't have to go to [01:26] the bathroom sometimes the lottery of [01:28] whether they did or not kind of bites us [01:30] because we think they've gone but they [01:32] haven't and that's when those messes [01:33] happen so what's next on our puppy [01:35] morning routine well we need to feed [01:37] them so what did you do you picked up [01:39] the bowl you filled it full of their dog [01:40] food you put it down on the ground and [01:43] let them have their breakfast while you [01:44] wandered off and did other things so [01:47] what happened your dog jumped up smashed [01:49] their face into that food bowl knocked [01:51] food everywhere ate everything as [01:53] quickly as they could or even not maybe [01:55] that severe maybe they just are a little [01:57] antsy they're jumping all over the place [01:58] they're learning to to be hyperactive in [02:01] getting that food we want to teach them [02:02] to be a little bit more mindful in those [02:04] moments if you go to put that food bowl [02:06] down and they get a little too excited [02:07] just stand up remove that food for a [02:09] second wait till they offer something [02:11] else maybe it's a sit and once they're [02:13] sitting calmly then you can put it down [02:15] the dogs will learn that they need to [02:17] wait for your permission so what you [02:18] should have done instead of just putting [02:20] the food on the ground put the food in [02:22] their crate teach your pup that all the [02:23] good things come in that crate killing [02:25] two birds with one stone a um we're [02:27] getting them comfortable with the crate [02:28] we're getting that great association [02:30] with the food in the crate and they also [02:31] learn that's where they go now do your [02:33] old dogs need to eat in their crate no [02:36] but what a great opportunity to [02:38] reinforce how great that space is by [02:40] simply changing the process in the [02:41] morning in reality every meal time can [02:43] be training time and if you work those [02:45] training bits into each time you feed [02:47] your dogs you're engaging their brain [02:49] you're helping them to be a little bit [02:50] more settled and also value you and your [02:52] information everybody has busy lives and [02:54] it's even busier when you have a puppy [02:55] so you need to get ready for your day [02:57] and get ready to go to work so what did [02:58] you do well you you could have done one [03:00] of two things maybe you just popped that [03:01] puppy into the crate and you went up to [03:03] have a shower but we haven't really done [03:04] as much crate work as we would like so [03:06] that puppy's a little chaotic maybe [03:07] they're barking and whining while [03:09] they're in the crate or you didn't put [03:11] them in the crate and you went up to [03:12] have a shower and you're frantically [03:14] trying to shower as fast as you can [03:15] because you have no idea what that puppy [03:17] is doing what chaos they're causing down [03:19] in your living room or your kitchen so [03:21] what happened your dog had the freedom [03:23] to do whatever they wanted which let's [03:25] face it in puppy terms could be anything [03:27] it could be they had to go to the [03:28] bathroom all of a sudden again so went [03:30] in the carpet uh down in the living room [03:31] or it could be that they discovered the [03:33] leftover of your breakfast on the table [03:34] and they're up there having a great old [03:36] time so how can you prevent that mistake [03:39] from happening well setting your [03:41] timetable to help that puppy settle in [03:43] the mornings especially can be very [03:45] beneficial getting that extra 10 or 15 [03:47] minutes in the morning to help Tire your [03:49] puppy out and engage them a little bit [03:51] before you have to get the shower can [03:52] make a big difference so let's say I've [03:54] set my clock 10 or 15 minutes earlier [03:56] we've taken care of the bathroom we've [03:58] now fed them I've saved a little bit of [04:00] that food and I'm going to practice a [04:01] little bit of training maybe I teach [04:02] them to respond to their name for 2 [04:04] minutes maybe I teach them to sit while [04:06] there's a a toy or another person in the [04:08] house wandering by over there I can use [04:10] some skills to engage their brain get [04:12] them a little bit tired that way when I [04:15] say okay now I need to go shower I can [04:17] pop them into that crate they're much [04:18] more settled their brains are more tired [04:20] and I can go shower in peace not [04:22] worrying that my house is going to be [04:23] destroyed now if you have a puppy or an [04:24] older dog that's new to you and your [04:26] family and you want personalized [04:28] feedback from aand dogs instructors [04:30] check out our puppy Essentials or life [04:32] skills online or in-person training [04:34] programs where you can get feedback from [04:36] me and all the other Mand dogs [04:37] instructors you're showered you're ready [04:39] to go the pups had their food they've [04:41] had the bathroom so what did you do well [04:42] you popped them into their crate like [04:44] you should and you went to work so what [04:46] happened they're unsettled they're still [04:48] ready to go and you're locking the door [04:50] heading off to work listening to a [04:51] crying howling puppy who's not that [04:54] happy it makes you feel real guilty so [04:56] what could you have done instead having [04:58] them get rid of some of that physical [04:59] energy in a controlled manner can help [05:01] them be much more settled while you're [05:03] gone for the morning or however long you [05:05] need to be out there so get some toys [05:07] out take a little bit of that extra time [05:09] that you got in the morning teach them [05:10] to tug teach them to play teach them to [05:12] retrieve practice some recalls with [05:14] those toys uh have your dog burn off a [05:16] little bit of that excess physical [05:18] energy so that when you do need to leave [05:20] their brains are settled their bodies [05:21] are much more settled and they're much [05:23] more apt to just sleep and be ready when [05:25] you get home now your puppy's in their [05:27] crate and you're getting ready to walk [05:28] out on the door but what did you do well [05:31] you've got them in an enclosure that's [05:33] got a big giant comfy bed a bucket of [05:35] water all kinds of toys and possibly [05:37] even too much space for some people that [05:39] are using pens and what happened well [05:42] your puppy had a party they played with [05:44] all the toys they chewed on the bed and [05:46] maybe ingested some of that material [05:48] they went to the bathroom in the corner [05:49] because they could and just shoved some [05:50] stuff over top of it because that's the [05:52] way the dogs work all of those things [05:54] don't create a settled puppy they create [05:56] a puppy that really doesn't know how to [05:58] settle so what could you have done well [06:00] when you're puty your puppy in your [06:01] crate it's important to make sure that [06:03] there are nothing that's going to be [06:04] dangerous for them so soft toys things [06:06] that they can chew and tear apart even [06:07] though that seems like a great idea it's [06:09] actually creating a very serious Hazard [06:11] where the dog could ingest some of that [06:12] and create a blockage too many toys [06:14] don't allow puppies brains to settle [06:16] down even a bed for young dogs can [06:19] really set your house training back [06:20] because they learn to go to the bathroom [06:22] in one corner and just shove that stuff [06:24] off to the side to cover up the smell so [06:26] get rid of any beds uh any toys that [06:28] they might be able to tear apart and [06:29] inest get yourself a Kong a nice durable [06:32] chew that you can stuff with some frozen [06:34] foods some things that can occupy them [06:36] for a while and maybe one other safe [06:39] durable chew that's going to allow them [06:41] to have a little bit of entertainment [06:42] but then also settle and just relax [06:45] which puppies need to do they need to [06:47] relax and develop let their brains and [06:49] bodies grow now I said there was going [06:50] to be five things I was going to talk [06:52] about in this video but I'm actually [06:53] going to give you one bonus tip and [06:56] actually it's just going to roll back to [06:57] point number one bathroom breaks taking [06:59] your dog to the bathroom your puppy's [07:00] been up for probably I don't know an [07:02] hour hour and a half and they've done [07:04] some things they've had some food [07:05] they've had a little play you've done [07:07] some training with them and you want [07:08] them to settle for the day so you're [07:10] going to go right back to that first [07:11] point I talked about you're going to put [07:13] them on a line you're going to take them [07:14] outside and you're going to watch see [07:16] that they go to the bathroom again that [07:17] way when they do again you can calmly [07:19] pet you can calmly praise and reinforce [07:21] that you can head on inside put them in [07:23] that crate and you can head off to work [07:25] knowing that all their needs are met for [07:27] the day I talked about five mistakes [07:29] that you don't even realize you're [07:30] making with your puppy every morning but [07:31] if you want to avoid making other common [07:33] mistakes click that video right there on [07:35] that note I'm instructor

Email HERE: studio905@mccanndogs.com Thanks for watching, Happy Training! ~Ken #mccanndogs #exerciseyourdog === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] Why are new dog owners always so eager to take their dogs for long walks before [00:04] the training or getting them off leash at the park before they're ready for it? [00:08] Why is that the immediate goal?"
document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,, Part 296/429,"[00:11] What if I told you that you're actually setting your dog back and creating worse [00:14] behaviors by going outside? In today's video, [00:17] I'm going to show you three skills that you can work on and master inside so [00:20] that you can take your dog outside and transform your training. [00:23] I'm Ken Steepe and welcome back to McCann Dogs. [00:26] The first skill you're going to learn is called targeting. [00:29] Targeting is having your dog choose to focus their attention both mentally and [00:33] physically on something that you choose in the face of distraction. Now, [00:36] this can be a really useful skill to teach when you're outside and a skateboard [00:41] goes by or there's a squirrel up in a tree, [00:43] or you just simply need your dog to check back in and leave all of the other [00:47] distractions behind. [00:48] Instructor Kayl is going to show you how to break down this skill and teach it [00:51] to your dog with her puppy five alive. [00:53] Now, there are a couple different ways that you can teach this, [00:55] but I'm going to show you guys a really simple and fast way, [00:58] especially if you have a really keen dog that likes the food. Now, [01:02] I have a bunch of small treats in one hand here. [01:04] I'm going to take one and I'm just going to pinch it between two fingers so that [01:07] my hand can be flat because this is going to be the hand cue I'm going to use [01:11] later. Now, I'm not going to worry about saying any words. [01:13] I'm literally going to present my hand to five, [01:16] and naturally he's going to smell the treat in my hand and when he touches my [01:19] hand yes, to get the treat from it, I'm going to mark that with a yes. [01:24] I'll show you again, simply putting it in front of his face. Yes, [01:27] good boy and letting him steal the food. And you're going to repeat this step? [01:31] Yes. Good boy. Many times I'm guessing, as soon as I feel him, yes, [01:36] make contact with my hand."
document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,, Part 297/429,"[01:38] So once I've done a bunch of repetitions of offering my hand with the food in [01:41] it, the next step is teaching him to do this a little bit more independently. [01:45] Now he's going to assume there's going to be treat in my hand, [01:47] except this time I'm going to pull a fast one on him and I'm not going to put [01:50] any food there. However, [01:52] I need to be ready to quickly reward him before he has a chance to think about [01:56] other things. So if he touches his nose to my hand on this one, [01:59] I'm going to say yes, and I'm going to quickly deliver the food. [02:02] I know you're excited. [02:04] I'm going to quickly deliver the food to my tap hand to make sure the value [02:08] stays here. So I know I'm holding food in this hand, [02:10] but I don't want him to do an exercise with this hand and then me feed him with [02:13] the opposite hand. [02:14] It's going to make him think about paying attention over here. [02:16] So it's going to look something like this. Yes. Good boy. [02:21] Yes. Good boy. Yes. Good. [02:25] So do you see how I mark the moment I feel him touch my hand? [02:28] I say yes and then reward. Now I have done this a little bit with five before, [02:32] so he is touching pretty easily. [02:34] But there are some dogs that you might present your hand. [02:36] They'll smell your hand from a distance and say, I don't see any treat there. [02:39] I don't smell any treat there. [02:41] So you might have to do more repetitions of going back to putting the food in [02:45] your hand. So if you try this and your yes, [02:46] good boy and your puppy or your dog doesn't touch your hand immediately, [02:50] don't worry about it. It just means you need to put a little bit more money in [02:53] the bank. [02:53] You need to go back fewer repetitions of actually putting a physical piece of [02:57] food. Yes, good boy in your to build a little bit more value. [03:01] But the name of the game here is You touched me. Yes."

[03:05] Five is starting to get the idea that he should tap his nose to my hand, [03:08] which is great, [03:09] but there's two progressions I want to make before I can start to utilize this [03:12] in situations where it's going to be helpful. Number one, [03:15] I need to put it on a cue, so some type of command. And number two, [03:18] I need to make sure that he can touch my hand regardless of where I put it so [03:22] that I can use it in different circumstances to either refocus him or to get him [03:27] a little bit closer to me. [03:28] I'm going to start off by just offering my hand in a few different places and [03:31] see if he can seek it out. Again. I'm not going to add a word quite yet. [03:34] I'm just going to do one step at a time. Yes, good boy. [03:38] I might try it over here. Yes. Good. Oops. Freebie. Yes. [03:43] Good boy. Yes. Good. Yes. [03:47] Good boy. Here's a hard one. Yes. Oh, good. [03:54] Okay, so he didn't offer, so I'm going to try it again. Yes. Yay. Good boy. [04:00] Very good. [04:01] So try practicing in different positions to ensure that your dog understands [04:06] that the behavior is going to earn a reward. And then once you do that, [04:09] you're ready to add a command. Adding a cue to this exercise is extremely easy, [04:13] provided your dog is offering the behavior very quickly and reliably. [04:17] All you're going to do is just before they're about to touch your hand, [04:20] you're going to throw in the command that you're looking for to play a little [04:23] word association. So I'm pretty confident that when I flash my hand, [04:26] he's going to touch it. So watch the timing of when I give my cue. Tap. Yes. [04:30] Good boy. Tap. Yes. Good boy. [04:34] Do you see how I throw it in there just before he does the behavior tap? [04:38] Yes. Good boy, tap. Yes, good boy. [04:43] So my timing of the yes is still the same."
document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,, Part 299/429,"Once I've done that a few times, [04:46] then I can put it all together. Tap. Yes. Good boy. [04:50] Now I just did something wrong. [04:56] Maybe I shouldn't tell you what it is. [04:57] Maybe you should go back and try and figure out what it is and post in the [05:00] comments below. I don't even want to give it away. You tell me what? [05:04] I just messed up. Now I'm going to do it. Correct. Tap. Yes. Good boy. This. [05:09] Next skill is really helpful for teaching your dog a little bit of listening and [05:11] control exercises, and it's actually something that we call the game of tug. [05:15] Now, you may have heard all kinds of things about playing tug with your dog, [05:18] and I'll tell you probably most of those things aren't true. In this next clip, [05:22] we're going to show you how to make your game of tug a little bit better. [05:24] With this high energy lab named Kelani. [05:27] I'm going to have her choose to hold a sit before she gets the toy. [05:31] You can see she likes this toy and she's also very typical Labrador, jumpy, [05:36] bouncy, super friendly and outgoing. But when I ask that toy back, [05:39] if she doesn't give it to me, we are going to have her sit. [05:43] So I'm going to do a little food trade for this. Good girly. Good job. Hooray. [05:46] Good, good, good. Sit. Good girl. Good job. Yes. [05:51] Good. Sit. Good. Now. She's making a great choice right now. [05:54] She is nice and stable in this. So how am I going to this? [05:58] I'm going to give her this toy back. Okay. Get it. Good girl. Get it, get it, [06:01] get it, get it, get it. Good girl. Get it. Get it. Get it out. Sit. [06:06] Good. Sit. Good girl. Good. Yes. Get it. Good girl. Good. [06:11] So first time she saw it, she was quite stable. So I upped my game a little bit. [06:15] I made the toy a little bit more interesting out. Sit. [06:20] Sit. Good. Sit. Good job miss. [06:24] Very nice. I'm going to make it a little harder. Good. Sit. Good. [06:30] Yes. Get it."
document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,, Part 300/429,"Good girl. Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it. [06:32] Now I want her to actually commit the sit. [06:34] I don't want her vibrating and half jumping. I want her sitting solidly out. [06:40] Sit. Yes. Good girl. Good. Sit. [06:45] What a good girl you are. Good job. [06:53] Yes. Okay, get it. Good girl. Yay. Good girl. Her what a good girl. [06:56] Excellent job. Good. Hooray. You are so exciting. Good. Okay. Out. [07:02] That's it. Oh, we got tangled up in the leash. Good girl. Good job. Now, [07:06] I took a long dramatic pause there, but I wanted to see what Kelani would do. [07:11] I was waiting to see if she would look away from that toy and look at me, [07:14] and her eyes came up to me. That's the moment I said yes, [07:18] and that's the moment she was allowed to have the toy back. [07:20] So she's starting to pair together to look at me to get the reward. Good girl. [07:25] Miss. [07:25] If you're still working on having your dog give up a toy or still hold a sit in [07:28] the face of it, [07:29] then I would make this easier. I would work on the tugging out separate with the [07:33] toy, and I would also work on sit. [07:35] Sit means sit for my dogs or any dog I work with, [07:38] and it means sit until I ask you to do something else. [07:41] If they happen to get up out of the sit, I'm going to place them back in. [07:43] But if my dog can't hold a sit in the face of the distraction, [07:47] I need to work on the sit first, [07:48] which is another skill you can do that helps with focus. [07:51] When it comes to the idea of rewarding these choices, [07:53] it's imperative that the thing that you're going to reward with is more valuable [07:57] than the thing that they are trying to get to. [07:59] We want dogs to understand where the value is, [08:02] and that means being able to overcome value elsewhere and make sure that you're [08:06] the most important thing. Now, [08:08] the other thing to keep in mind is all of you is a reward."
document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,, Part 301/429,"[08:11] You'll notice when I was tugging with her, I was exciting, I was engaging, [08:14] I was talking to her in a nice way. I was really exciting. [08:17] But the moment I want to have a little bit more calm from her, [08:21] I calm myself down. So it's not just the food, it's not just the toy, [08:25] but it's all those things, including you. [08:26] If you're interested in getting a fuzzy ball tug, [08:28] like the one we just used in the last clip, [08:30] make sure you check out McCann Dogs store. [08:33] Something that dog trainers do with their puppies that a lot of average dog [08:36] owners wouldn't know to do is something called shaping. [08:39] Essentially shaping is having the dog choose a behavior, [08:42] and then we're rewarding them for making the right choice. [08:45] This is a great way to teach your dog to problem solve. And down the road, [08:49] this is going to be a very useful skill for your dog to have. [08:52] Check out this next clip where Kayl works with a mixed breed dog named Lucy, [08:55] and she shapes Lucy to get all four paws into a cardboard box. [08:59] I have a box here, and my goal is that I can train Lucy to get inside the box. [09:04] So I'm going to start off by just having a couple pieces of food ready here, [09:08] which she can see she's super excited about. I'm going to have my box nearby. [09:11] Yes, good girl. And then anything that Lucy has to do with the box. [09:16] Yes. Good girl. I'm going to yes. And reward her for sniffing. Yes. [09:20] Putting her head close to the box. Putting a paw in. Yes. Oh yes. [09:25] Good girl. Now, every time she gets closer to my final goal, [09:29] I'm going to increase the grade reward. Yes. Good. Girls, [09:34] we got two little pauses there. Yes. Good girl. Now, [09:38] what's super important for this one? Okay, [09:40] just going to have a reset for a second. Come here with this."
document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,, Part 302/429,"[09:42] What's really important for this one is when you say the word yes, [09:45] you need to make sure that when you yes, when you say yes, [09:49] it's exactly the point that you're trying to reinforce. Good girl. Yes. [09:54] Now she's starting to offer two paws pretty easily. [09:57] So I'm going to go for the gusto here, [09:58] and I'm going to wait for her to do a little bit more before she gets any more [10:01] rewards. [10:06] Try again. So isn't this interesting? [10:10] I'm getting a few different behaviors. She's actually offering to bow now, [10:13] so I'm going to reward her for that because I don't want her to get frustrated. [10:16] And what I'm going to do now is help her out a little bit. Two feet. Good. [10:18] I'm just going to lure her so that, yes, yes. Oh, [10:22] we got back feet and the front feet came out. Yay. Good girl. [10:26] But this is sort of the fun thing about shaping. [10:27] You don't have to get the dog to climb the mountain in order to get the reward. [10:31] I'm just going to reward all the little increments along the way. Yes. [10:34] Good girl. Yes. [10:39] Yes. There we go. Good. [10:41] And now I'm going to use the food to try and get these back feet in. Yes. Good. [10:45] Yes. Good girl. Yes. Three for four in about a couple minutes. [10:50] That's pretty good, Lulu. Okay, let's try one more. Yes. [10:55] Good girl. [10:55] Do you see how she's offering to go in the box without me even asking dogs going [10:59] through positive reinforcement. So if they get reinforced for something, [11:02] they're much more likely to offer it again. Yes. Good girl. [11:05] Let's try and get that third foot again. Yes. Oh my goodness. [11:10] Jackpot. And once you get that final goal, [11:13] what a good girl you want to really reward generously. Wow, Luc, [11:18] that was so good. [11:20] Now let's talk about a few challenges that you might have while you're training [11:23] this exercise."
document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,, Part 303/429,"Now, number one, [11:24] sometimes if you just put a box down and just stand there, girl Luc, [11:28] a lot of dogs. And initially what she would've done is just stood there and [11:31] stared at the box. [11:32] And you don't just want to be having a staring contest for too long with your [11:35] dog. Shaping is about creativity and offering behavior. [11:38] So make sure that you help your dog to do a little bit more guessing. [11:42] When I first brought the box into the room, [11:44] Lucy was a little bit unsure about it, [11:45] so I actually started off by just throwing a couple treats into the box just to [11:48] get her to investigate, to sniff it a little bit, [11:51] just to build her confidence about it. [11:52] But don't let your dog stall out for too long without offering something. [11:56] Step in and make it a little bit easier so you can keep the pace moving along [11:59] with your dog. It is so funny. [12:01] The other thing that's important to note too is what you use for your shaping [12:05] exercise. I picked a box that is Lucy size. Hey, Missy. [12:09] It's big enough that she can easily get inside. It's not too high, [12:13] it's not too intimidating. Yes. Good girl, you're so funny. [12:16] Now that she knows it's good, she just wants to keep doing it. [12:19] So you want to use a box that's properly sized for your dog to make sure it's [12:22] really easy to get into, [12:24] make sure it's stable and it's not going to tip around or slide on practicing on [12:28] a carpet to give it a little bit more friction. [12:30] And those are things that are just going to help your training session go a [12:33] little bit more smoothly so you're spending more time rewarding your dog and [12:36] building their. [12:36] Confidence. Now that you can see the value of training your dog indoors, [12:39] check out this video that talks about three exercises that tire your dog out [12:42] without walking. On that note, happy training."

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,, Part 314/429,~Ken #mccanndogs #dogteenagephase === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:01] it's going to be a long night oh Sam all [00:05] right let's talk about the first few [00:07] weeks with your puppy and what that [00:09] looks like feels like uh what that [00:11] experience is like and how dramatically [00:14] different that's going to get for you [00:16] let's talk about uh I know several [00:19] people had said that they've watched the [00:20] Vlog so you probably saw a couple of our [00:22] puppy uh Vlogs where we shared with uker [00:24] or five alive and um let's talk about [00:27] puppy General puppy behavior during [00:30] first few weeks home cuz if they could [00:32] always be like that oh they're so cute [00:34] so [00:35] snuggly obviously they're a bit curious [00:37] and there's like the normal puppy stuff [00:39] but a lot of the times when we first [00:40] bring a new puppy home because they're [00:43] in unfamiliar territory they tend to [00:45] lean on us a bit more they um follow us [00:48] around the house a little bit more they [00:50] depend on us a little bit more they're [00:52] in a new situation uh for the first time [00:55] they maybe haven't got their bearings [00:56] yet and they're just a little bit more [00:58] in tuned to um to the humans in the [01:02] house and unfortunately often we find [01:05] that gives um the uh dog owners a little [01:10] bit of a false sense of [01:13] um what's the word not security but like [01:17] yeah I mean just like a false sense of [01:18] what having a dog is actually like [01:20] because it seems like totally oh I don't [01:22] need to put a leash on him he just [01:24] follows me around oh I I don't need to [01:25] put him in a crate he just naps all the [01:28] time I didn't don't need to do this just [01:30] does this because I think people think [01:31] that what's what they get in the first [01:33] one two 3 weeks home is sort of what is [01:37] going to happen over the next few months [01:38] or two years and I hate to break it to [01:41] you but it really couldn't be further [01:43] from the truth um as your dog goes [01:46] through different phases of their growth [01:50] um everything changes and we have to [01:53] change along with the dog and uh we need [01:55] to kind of know what's coming so that we [01:57] can adapt and make better choices but um [02:00] often the the puppy stuff in the [02:02] beginning is so fun but uh for most dogs [02:06] it's not it's not there to stay [02:08] unfortunately yeah the reality is and [02:10] and think about this you are the center [02:12] of your puppy's world at that point you [02:14] know they they know nothing else they've [02:16] come home with you uh you know you are [02:19] uh the bringer of all good things you [02:22] are the center of attention you're [02:23] probably taking time out of your day to [02:25] make sure that your puppy is uh you know [02:28] cared for played with with uh you know [02:31] the experience is just so [02:34] entric and this can be this can lead to [02:37] a little little bit of um I don't know [02:39] you get too comfortable with the idea [02:41] that the puppy's probably going to be [02:42] making good choices they're probably [02:43] just going to follow you around the [02:44] house uh you know they're they're just [02:46] they're not going to get into trouble [02:48] and we lull into this false sense of [02:50] security because there's two [02:52] developmental thresholds specifically [02:55] that you're likely to see a dramatic [02:57] change at or or you know they're going [02:59] to they're going to uh give you a [03:01] different response uh that's going to [03:03] create some challenges now those two [03:06] developmental thresholds we're we're [03:08] going to give you like a range and again [03:09] these aren't specific like once we get [03:11] to the 8we mark as an example but uh [03:14] about four months and about 7even months [03:16] there two developmental thresholds where [03:17] you might see some of this adolescent [03:20] Behavior now I noticed someone in the [03:22] chat earlier said I have got a 9month [03:24] old that um you know I'm struggling with [03:26] or something to that I'm paraphrasing [03:27] but uh so I mean it's not specifically [03:30] at these times but around these ages is [03:33] when you might see this kind of behavior [03:34] we're going to talk about some changes [03:37] that you need to make in your day-to-day [03:39] that are going to um solidify for your [03:42] puppy that's learning or solidify for [03:44] your dog that they need to listen [03:47] because that's going to give them more [03:49] opportunities and um it's almost like a [03:51] point it's not you know when I say [03:53] they're testing you it's sounds like you [03:55] know they have some sort of like evil [03:57] plan hatched but they're kind of figur [03:59] fing out how how are we going to exist [04:02] together those are important times to be [04:04] focused on um I just want to mention one [04:07] thing uh we're sort of giving you guys [04:10] um a general example of time frames four [04:12] months and seven months but um keep in [04:16] mind that that's very general I I don't [04:19] sometimes I we're apprehensive to give [04:21] like exact timelines or dates because [04:24] every dog is different and sometimes it [04:26] has to do with the dog itself and [04:28] sometimes it has to do with the human [04:30] and what they're doing um I noticed [04:32] someone in the chat said what happens if [04:34] um the puppy has been in other homes [04:37] first before they get to mine so maybe [04:38] you're getting that puppy a bit older um [04:41] you know what if you get um you adopt an [04:43] older dog um great a lot of this stuff [04:46] um actually will apply to all ages of [04:49] dogs depending on where they are in [04:51] their Journey with you um so don't get [04:54] too hung up on the age especially if [04:56] you're listening and you maybe have a [04:58] dog that's a bit older uh I assure you [05:01] that something that we say tonight [05:03] regardless of the dog's age is going to [05:05] connect with you and your dog absolutely [05:07] so don't get too stuck on the age but [05:08] generally speaking we'll we'll talk [05:10] around it because it's sort of the norm [05:13] but um sometimes with dogs there is no [05:16] Norm this is yeah this is such an [05:17] important point and and I guess we [05:19] should talk about it more I mean we just [05:21] understand it as dog trainers but there [05:22] are so many times when I see someone uh [05:25] who is struggling with a rehome dog or [05:27] you know however the dog came into their [05:30] life and they're struggling with uh [05:32] puppy problems yes dog doesn't have a [05:34] response to name dog you know has [05:37] absolutely no recall it's chewing on [05:39] things and they're confused as to why [05:40] that's happening based on the dog's age [05:43] they don't realize that those two things [05:45] are not related yeah so remember over [05:47] the course of this it you know these [05:49] behaviors and how you fix some of these [05:51] problems have nothing to do with the [05:52] dog's ages has everything to do with [05:54] their level of understanding so as we [05:57] discuss tonight's adolescent dog stuff [05:59] if you can if you have a dog that's you [06:01] know three years old and you're seeing [06:03] some of this adolescent Behavior the [06:05] same tactics are going to apply we're [06:07] going to talk a lot about big picture [06:09] dog training stuff for people exactly [06:11] like you but I want to bring us back to [06:14] that four-month old Mark and some of the [06:17] challenges that a puppy might have or a [06:18] dog might have at this age and why why [06:22] around that age do we start to see some [06:24] of these changes yeah four months um [06:27] between four and seven months can be uh [06:29] can be a tricky one because they don't [06:32] have any World experience yet and so in [06:36] some cases they can be overly confident [06:39] because they don't have any previous [06:42] experiences to pull from to create um [06:44] you know feeling in opinion about and [06:47] sometimes they can just be so [06:49] inexperienced with things because they [06:51] really don't know a whole lot yet they [06:54] haven't had um you know time to be [06:57] trained or they haven't been with you a [06:58] long time to develop a really deep [07:00] connection so it's sort of a a bit of an [07:02] awkward stage you know in some senses [07:05] because they can um you can't always [07:07] read exactly how um how they're going to [07:10] be um and it can be I sort of touched on [07:13] this before but it can be really [07:14] different for some dogs when they're [07:15] used to a certain type of environment [07:18] when they're in their litter with their [07:20] uh buddies and the breeder and whatever [07:22] that's happening and then you take them [07:23] out of that and you plunk them in a new [07:25] household with kids or no kids or other [07:27] dogs or no dogs um you know people who [07:30] travel people are live in an apartment [07:32] people that go to Parks whatever it [07:34] might be it's just all so different for [07:36] them to take in and for some dogs it [07:39] there really is a bit of an adjustment [07:41] period and dogs will adjust differently [07:44] depending on their um temperament or [07:47] their confidence level some dogs will [07:49] kind of go through that with um a bit of [07:52] caution and uh sometimes you don't see [07:55] dogs come out of their shell until they [07:57] get a little bit older because they sort [07:58] of go oh okay I think I'm starting to [08:00] figure this out and there's some dogs [08:02] that just bold their way through it and [08:06] go first ask questions later and uh in [08:09] some ways that can be really helpful [08:10] because they tend to be a bit more [08:12] confident in other ways those dogs can [08:14] be really challenging because they get [08:16] into situations and they just aren't [08:18] very mindful about what's going on [08:19] around them so it is sort of a a funky [08:22] stage because you can really get to two [08:24] different sides of the story at this [08:27] point you are controlling uh dogs access [08:31] to a lot of things they aren't going out [08:33] we hope that you are yeah we hope that [08:34] you are um they're not going out into [08:37] these wild scenarios with a bunch of [08:39] other dogs around they're not going out [08:41] into the parks and streets and things [08:43] that you know the dogs's this young and [08:45] it this is the perfect time to teach [08:47] your dog how to learn because you're [08:49] you're controlling access to all of [08:51] these places you're controlling a lot [08:53] more access to resources CU you're not [08:55] really sure what's going to happen if I [08:57] leave them with this stuffed animal or [08:58] what's going going to happen if you know [09:00] they're in the kitchen without [09:01] supervision you know you're naturally [09:03] making better choices for that dog at [09:05] that age and um this is when you want to [09:07] get on these things this is really when [09:09] you're going to pattern some of these [09:10] initial behaviors yeah I would argue [09:12] that between you know four and 7 months [09:15] it could be one of the most [09:18] important um age gaps in in a dog's life [09:23] what happens and I would even say [09:25] earlier than 4 months what happens [09:27] between 10 and 7 months [09:30] um really sets the tone for what's going [09:33] to happen after s months and there's [09:35] this saying that has been floating [09:37] around for years and years and years it [09:38] says you can't can't teach old dog new [09:41] tricks and um that is not true you can [09:43] teach old dog new tricks you can teach [09:45] older dogs uh things but it's just [09:48] harder because you now have to uh undo [09:51] things and then reteach things which is [09:53] always more difficult but it's doable so [09:56] if you can give them the the best [09:59] information from the get-go so they're [10:01] learning the right things first um it [10:05] completely changes your dog training [10:07] Journey which is why we highly recommend [10:09] that if you're thinking about training [10:11] your dog do not wait some people say I [10:14] want to wait till my dog grows up a [10:15] little bit I want to wait till this [10:17] don't do it get your butt into classes [10:19] or get your butt online or whatever it [10:21] might be do it early because the earlier [10:24] you can start the more success you're [10:26] going to have the faster you're going to [10:28] get to that success um and plus as [10:31] you're going through these Rocky Roads [10:32] especially when we get into the next [10:34] phase that we're going to talk about [10:35] it's so much better to do it with the [10:37] guidance of professional instructor that [10:38] has seen this happen you know we've seen [10:41] dogs go through this journey thousands [10:44] of times so when you know dogs do this [10:47] Behavior dogs do that behavior well [10:48] we're not seeing it for the first time [10:50] we're seeing it you know we've seen it [10:52] so many times of that it's really easy [10:54] to be able to guide you through it so [10:56] it's it's important to to not wait yeah [10:58] uh uh and and I mean there's all sorts [11:00] of resources available on our channel [11:02] that can get you started right at the [11:03] beginning as well like really get you [11:05] started along the right track but when [11:06] things start to fall apart there's a [11:08] word that we use a lot and I'll tell you [11:11] one of the biggest um not deficits one [11:13] of the biggest uh weakness weaknesses [11:16] that uh new dog owners have is [11:19] understanding leadership what does [11:21] leadership mean um we talk a lot about [11:23] it and it you know it's not it's a [11:24] pretty uh it's not a very specific term [11:27] so we need to break it down a little bit [11:28] especially when it comes to the uh [11:31] Teenage phase and when it comes to you [11:34] struggling with whatever the thing is [11:36] whether your dogs 19 months old or 9 [11:39] months old or you know four months old [11:42] whatever that is exercising good [11:44] leadership in your dog training is going [11:46] to give your dog better information it's [11:48] going to be more fair to your dog and [11:50] it's exactly the maybe the changes but [11:53] certainly the choices that you want to [11:54] make I I actually have a clip on on here [11:57] somewhere I'm not going to leave this to [11:58] Sam cuz I just don't think he's going to [12:00] get us there but I have a clip on here [12:02] of an old video yeah um that I think it [12:06] is old I think we shot it with a potato [12:07] that's how old it is um that that that [12:10] talks a little bit about leadership and [12:12] if you are struggling with something [12:15] right now uh I want you to think to [12:17] yourself you know am I am I seeing the [12:20] world people often appr can I think [12:22] about this to go through some of the [12:24] steps that are needed to provide good [12:25] leadership over their dogs when we start [12:27] to ask people to imp structure or rules [12:30] or things like that sometimes people [12:32] think that the dogs are going to not [12:35] like them if they take away some of the [12:36] luxuries that they've already been [12:38] giving their dog but the truth is it's [12:40] actually the humans that are a little [12:42] bit more worried about these steps than [12:43] the dogs are what we need to remember is [12:45] that dogs are not babies they're not [12:47] kids they have a completely different [12:49] way of thinking so it's really important [12:51] that we treat them like dogs and then [12:53] eventually once they understand the [12:54] rules of where they fit in and that you [12:56] are a good leader you get to spoil them [12:58] rotten just like you've wanting to from [13:00] the beginning so uh we you know we [13:02] mentioned doing all that training up [13:04] front such a great uh shot to stop [13:07] wonderful it's actually how do you know [13:09] looks like I'm about to uh sing a song [13:12] or sneeze chew I look very tand in [13:15] comparison to Old C this is an important [13:16] thing to think about is you know I I'm [13:19] at this point what what resources can I [13:22] control in this situation um has is my [13:26] dog ready for this kind of freedom is my [13:28] dog ready for or this kind of whatever [13:30] uh luxury as you refer to it in in their [13:33] life this is when you really need to [13:35] make the right choice for them and some [13:38] of the symptoms of having a leadership [13:40] struggle or the dog being in the teenage [13:41] phase might not be terribly obvious [13:44] we're going to talk a little bit about [13:45] some of the things your dog might be [13:46] doing that should indicate to you like [13:48] oh okay we have a this is an adolescent [13:50] problem we need to we need to make some [13:52] changes I'll just finish this C more [13:54] leadership or not well it's actually [13:55] pretty easy you just need to look at you [13:57] know how are they handling the freedoms [14:00] and the luxuries that you're giving them [14:02] already um how good of a listener are [14:05] they how well do they make good choices [14:07] in your house around distractions or [14:09] your furniture or your kids how well do [14:11] they listen when they're when you take [14:13] them outside and there's a lot of [14:14] distractions right there is going to [14:16] tell you how much respect and how well [14:19] do they listen to you when there's other [14:21] things that could tear their attention [14:24] apart from you know being a good dog and [14:26] making good [14:27] choices [14:29] well said people often Oh I thought we [14:32] were back yeah there we are Sam nice try [14:35] buddy that was really close um talking [14:38] about leadership and uh why it's [14:41] important at this phase oh Fifi Freedom [14:44] dropping the Super Chat thank [14:46] you let's get back to this let's just [14:48] close this thought or or or finish this [14:49] thought before we get to uh the super [14:51] chat um talking about leadership being a [14:54] being prepared to make some changes in [14:56] your life in the dog's life that because [14:59] you're starting to see you know slower [15:01] responses uh nuisance behaviors yeah [15:04] this can be a hard PE thing for people [15:06] to wrap around because uh wrap their [15:08] head around because a lot of us want to [15:10] you know give our dogs the world and [15:13] sometimes people don't really recognize [15:15] that uh by giving your dog a lot of um [15:19] freedom and not having a lot of [15:20] restrictions and not having follow [15:22] through and um having low expectations [15:25] also to teach the dog that they kind of [15:28] run the show a little bit which means [15:29] you know if they're a Cooperative dog [15:31] they're probably going to listen 50 60% [15:33] of the time but when push comes to shove [15:35] in situations where something that they [15:37] would rather do like bark at something [15:39] you know tear something apart Chase [15:41] something run away from you whatever it [15:44] might be if they truly don't think that [15:46] they have to listen because you've shown [15:48] them through um lack of follow through [15:51] or poor training bad information bad [15:54] timing those types of things the dog [15:55] will say well I know I don't actually [15:57] have to listen so I'm just going to go [15:59] chase this deer in the forest for a [16:00] couple hours and I'll be back when I [16:02] feel like it or perhaps not back at all [16:04] um and that can be really uh be a really [16:07] hard thing what I always try to remind [16:10] people is that you know when you're [16:11] trying to be maybe a little bit more [16:13] strict and structed when you're um [16:16] raising a young dog and you're trying to [16:18] really be clear with your expectations [16:20] have good follow through all of that [16:21] stuff is that pretty soon once you sort [16:23] of get your dog understanding where they [16:26] sort of fit in the household and get [16:28] them learning that listening to you is [16:31] actually a really great thing to do then [16:33] you actually get to relax a little bit [16:35] you know people ask us all the time like [16:37] oh my gosh how do you manage all of [16:39] those dogs how do you get them all [16:41] listen to you off leash why do they all [16:43] just stand there and stare at you all [16:45] the time like why aren't they taking off [16:46] and running and playing with one another [16:49] and they do run and play with one [16:50] another but they all stand and wait for [16:52] me to say okay go play and then when I [16:55] want them to stop I just say come on [16:56] guys and they all run back it's it's [16:58] just it's that easy and it's because [17:01] when they're young I provide structure [17:03] and follow through and I do not allow [17:05] them to be in situations where they can [17:08] ignore me until I've done the work that [17:11] I need to give them the luxury of being [17:13] off leash or being loose in the house or [17:16] going for a hike in the forest and [17:17] feeling absolutely confident then when I [17:20] take the leash off and I ask them to do [17:22] something not only are they going to [17:24] listen to me but they're going to want [17:27] to listen to me and and um that's a [17:29] really important thing to say because [17:31] again some people say leadership and [17:33] they just sort of a assume it's like [17:35] this like big strict thing that you need [17:37] to be whatever uh but that's not the [17:39] case it's it's just that you're a fair [17:42] firm leader that follows through you [17:45] make things fun you make things easy to [17:46] listen uh easy to follow um and then the [17:50] dogs just sort of fall right into line [17:52] and they actually think oh gosh this is [17:55] so easy I don't have to make any [17:56] decisions this is so stressfree this is [17:58] perf perfect um and then the dogs are [18:00] actually happier in the end yeah great [18:03] it's confusing when you don't know what [18:04] you're supposed to do for sure I got to [18:06] Great uh question um before we get to [18:08] verified Freedom Super Chat uh can [18:10] 11-month-old who's previously well [18:12] behaved suddenly this oh decide to [18:13] misbehave on purpose this is a great [18:16] question let's let's talk about what on [18:19] purpose means yeah uh yeah I wouldn't [18:21] even restricted to 11 months uh no this [18:24] applies to everybody yeah this applies [18:25] to everybody so when you get to a point [18:27] where feel that you've trained your dog [18:31] there are points in everybody's [18:34] relationship with their dog even [18:36] professional dog trainers where the dog [18:39] tests you they know what to do they know [18:41] the [18:42] expectation um it's been a certain [18:45] amount of time you say come or you say [18:48] whatever and the dog goes hm I wonder if [18:51] that rule like is still is still there [18:54] and they might respond a little slower [18:56] or um you know not respond at all or [18:59] whatever it might be and sometimes they [19:01] test us a little bit to see what we do [19:03] and unfortunately the average human uh [19:07] fails the test because when the dog [19:09] starts to listen um a little bit less or [19:11] they start to push boundaries a little [19:13] bit we tend to say well you should know [19:16] this so we repeat the command again or [19:18] we raise our voice or whatever it might [19:20] be or we go oh we pull out the cookie [19:22] bag and we bribe the dog and the dog [19:24] goes sweet now I know exactly what I can [19:26] do I just don't listen until somebody [19:29] begs me to do it but you know what we [19:31] would do as a a strong leader and [19:33] someone who you know sees the dog [19:35] starting to test boundaries again we [19:37] don't get upset about it we know this [19:38] happens with dogs no big deal we just [19:40] get you know the long line back on we go [19:42] through you know a week or so of [19:44] reminding the dog what they need to do [19:46] and the dog goes ah okay things haven't [19:49] changed the rules are still there got it [19:51] no problem and then it's smooth sailing [19:53] and then often sometimes that comes up [19:55] again you know months or years later [19:57] where the dog just starts to fall off [19:59] you know dogs are not robots they're [20:02] animals and I always equip it to if you [20:05] what is it equate it to equate it to my [20:08] favorite thing is kale getting and I'm [20:10] going to say her off balance here but uh [20:12] my favorite thing is kale getting the uh [20:14] I guess Dums or or whatever like those [20:15] short saying that's great um let's just [20:18] equip it [20:19] a uh that like putting gas in the car [20:22] you don't put the gas in the car once [20:24] and then you can drive your car forever [20:26] eventually the gas runs out and you got [20:27] to put gas back in dogs are exactly the [20:29] same way you can get a really excellent [20:32] solid foundation trained on your dog and [20:34] that will ride you for months and months [20:36] and months and months and months of [20:37] really good listening but then things do [20:40] start to slip a little bit and then you [20:41] just have to do a little bit more [20:43] training with them and then you get [20:44] right back on track but unfortunately [20:46] when people don't really know what [20:47] they're doing they do some training or [20:49] maybe they don't do any training at all [20:51] and then things start to slip and then [20:53] people don't do anything about it and [20:54] now you have a dog that says well I [20:56] don't really need to listen anymore [20:57] because clear clearly the rules have [20:58] changed because you don't follow through [21:00] um so that teenage part where they start [21:03] to push boundaries is a huge test for [21:07] your leadership what are you going to do [21:10] about it because the decision you make [21:13] in the next little bit is really going [21:15] to change the course of of how your dog [21:18] listens to you after that yeah and to uh [21:21] rahul's question or Point um what can we [21:24] do with a young puppy before they hit [21:25] the teenage phase in order to set them [21:26] up for the teenage months year [21:28] as well as possible well part of that is [21:32] make training a ritual it's a habit it's [21:35] something you're doing all the time so [21:36] that it's not like you you're not [21:38] waiting for problems to come up and then [21:39] having to address them then just make it [21:41] part of your everyday routine we talk a [21:43] lot about natural training opportunities [21:45] that happen like multiple times a day [21:47] whether it's you know allowing them to [21:49] get to their food bowl or you know [21:51] insisting that they remain in a sit [21:52] while you go out the door it's not about [21:54] being the heavy-handed leader it's about [21:56] hey buddy if you put in a little bit of [21:57] work for me then you get something that [21:59] you want but building that into your [22:01] dayto day is exactly what you need to [22:04] allow you to prepare for these periods [22:06] in your dog's life where things are [22:08] going to get a little bit more [22:09] challenging because behaviorally your [22:10] dogs's changing you know you're [22:12] introducing them to tougher distractions [22:13] and more difficult situations but you [22:16] know these um that's a great way is to [22:18] sort of establish the routine now we [22:20] need to get to a couple super chats I [22:22] see our friends Jess from gond to the [22:24] Snow Dogs hey Jess dropping the Super [22:26] Chat uh we need to get a vilified [22:28] Freedom uh really quickly good question [22:31] um uh I have three cats just got a 12we [22:34] old pit uh is it is Tug going to fe uh [22:36] feed prey drive or just good fun he's [22:39] okay with the cat so far so basically [22:41] just asking about tug uh play is Tug [22:44] going to feed prey drive or just good [22:47] fun uh okay that's a good question [22:50] um short answer and I'll give you a long [22:52] answer too but the short answer playing [22:55] tug um will have no no um it will have [23:01] no influence on whether your dog is [23:04] going to be interested in the cat or not [23:05] those live to totally separate from each [23:08] other um if your dog's going to decide [23:10] to be excited about the cat that's going [23:11] to happen you can tug all day long [23:13] that's still going to happen but here's [23:15] the good news if you are playing tug and [23:17] you're playing engagement um games where [23:20] your dog is actively using their mind [23:21] and their body it will help Zen the dog [23:25] out so that they are easier to manage in [23:28] other situations that's why ex physical [23:31] exercise for a dog is immensely helpful [23:34] for their overall behavior in your house [23:37] on walks or whatever most dogs are [23:39] severely under exercise because people [23:42] think going for a walk is exercise and [23:43] that is not the case um so playing tug [23:46] all of that stuff is great um we do a [23:49] ton of tug with our dogs we absolutely [23:51] love it there's so many benefits to [23:54] playing tug with your dog that can allow [23:56] you to um show your dog that you're a [23:58] good leader by having them you know not [24:01] touch the toy until you give them [24:02] permission to teach them to give the toy [24:04] up to you when you ask them to um to [24:06] teach them about bite inhibition so that [24:08] when you're holding the toy they know [24:09] how to be very careful around your hands [24:11] and your clothing there's just endless [24:13] benefits to playing the game in terms of [24:16] the cat though um tugging will be great [24:19] um lucky there's no issues now but if [24:21] you do start to see that there is then [24:23] you just need to make sure that you keep [24:25] a line or a leash on your puppy or on [24:27] yourg dog around the house so that if [24:29] the dog is showing any interest and you [24:31] want to use phrases like leave it or [24:33] things like that you can use the line to [24:35] follow through to ensure that the dog [24:38] actually does leave it and then of [24:39] course you can redirect them uh to [24:41] something else you just need to control [24:43] the two things so although they don't [24:44] have a direct relation both things will [24:47] be great I so and uh actually Fifi [24:51] Freedom dropped a second Super Chat [24:52] asking same question about squeak toy [24:54] I've been removing the squeakers thanks [24:56] for responding so uh to this point um [24:59] now squeak toys are just annoying so I [25:01] appreciate why you do that anyway well [25:03] Al also my my head sort of go makes me [25:05] think about I love the interactive toy [25:07] regardless of if it squeaks or uh not um [25:11] the beautiful thing about an interactive [25:12] toy is that it's only fun with you and [25:16] if you're struggling with a dog who's [25:17] distracted by everything and they're [25:19] starting to make uh decisions that you [25:20] don't like and you want to get more [25:22] focus and attention on you imagine what [25:24] can happen when you have a toy that's [25:26] only fun with you you and you get to [25:29] work on you know a leave it or or you [25:31] know some emotional control and you get [25:33] to work on a drop it or an out and you [25:36] get to exercise your dog and and and and [25:39] that's the beautiful thing about these [25:41] interactive toys is that it's about you [25:43] and your dog and that's the only way [25:45] it's fun the squeaker thing uh whe if [25:48] the squeaker in the in the uh tug toy I [25:49] mean I wouldn't be so worried about the [25:51] fact that it's squeaking but and maybe [25:53] that's what you're asking but if you're [25:55] asking about like a sque just a squeaky [25:57] toy that the dog can chew on I would be [25:59] thinking about I would be i' would be [26:01] wondering do I want do I want my dog to [26:04] have all sorts of fun things that they [26:06] can do on their own independently or do [26:08] I want more things that are only fun [26:09] with me so if this squeaker is in [26:11] something like an interactive toy I mean [26:12] our puppy you we actually have uh oh [26:15] yeah those are pretty old toys but like [26:16] this well this is a very well this was [26:19] actually one of the very first McAn dog [26:21] fuzzy ball things ever made so I'm going [26:24] I'm going to drop a a bit of a this is [26:26] probably like 15 years I'm going to [26:28] there's a secret I okay I'm I'm going to [26:31] say it so we have we have our uh I don't [26:35] even know what he's about to say I have [26:36] we have our treat tug pouch available at [26:37] Mand dos.
document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,, Part 315/429,store we're working on the [26:41] best toy for dogs who aren't interested [26:44] in toys available it's an interactive [26:46] squeak tug food and crunch pouch that's [26:51] exactly what's coming down the line you [26:52] guys are the first people to know about [26:53] this I might I'm not sure I feel like [26:55] you might be getting in trouble for [26:57] saying I might I might but but this is [26:59] exactly what I mean this is why we know [27:01] like this interactive toy if it's got a [27:02] squeaker in it that's okay it's not [27:04] going to entice the dog to go I mean it [27:07] might entice your dog to get even more [27:08] energetic and enthusiastic but I'd leave [27:10] the squeaker in an interactive toy I [27:12] might depending on their behavior I [27:14] don't know how many opportunities I'd [27:16] have or I'd give them to you know selfs [27:19] satiate and go do their own thing and be [27:20] satisfied by that simplify is we don't [27:23] give our dogs toys like these to go and [27:26] play with on their own and chew would [27:27] never give our dog a squeaky toy to just [27:29] go off and play with on their own it's [27:31] either played with us if we want to give [27:33] them things that they are are safe to go [27:35] and lie on their own and chew and play [27:37] with it would be something that they [27:39] couldn't um destroy like uh uh chewbone [27:43] uh Kong something like that nothing that [27:46] they can defuzz or depuff or desak or de [27:50] eyeball or whatever it might be um two [27:54] totally different things that we do for [27:56] safety but also for relationship and [27:58] control yeah very cool thank you [28:00] vilified freedom for the three super [28:01] chats Jess from Gone to the Snow Dog she [28:05] asks uh what if uh what are your [28:08] thoughts on a dog who's full of anxiety [28:10] when she isn't with her sisters and I [28:12] saw that there's a little bit longer [28:13] form of this I think I just don't have [28:15] it in the oh uh Elanor needs her sisters [28:17] also are you coming to see us in Toronto [28:19] at the end of the month the uh Toronto [28:21] pet show happens just maybe you can drop [28:23] the dates I took a quick look at it I [28:25] might be working fire that weekend but [28:26] I'm not sure [28:28] um but uh Jessica and G to the snow dog [28:30] and the Snow Dogs uh as well as maybe [28:33] some other cast people on the uh from [28:36] the channel might be there um at the end [28:38] of this month in Toronto at the [28:40] International Center so Jess can you [28:42] just drop the date so that everybody can [28:43] see in case you're local and you want to [28:45] check that out um so Jessica asked did [28:49] you get that uh thoughts Elenor needs [28:51] her sisters uh what are your thoughts on [28:53] a dog's full of anxiety when she isn't [28:55] with your s her sisters yeah I mean this [28:57] is [28:58] a this question opens a big can of worms [29:01] I think um there's lots of different [29:03] directions that you can go but what I [29:05] read from this is that um the thoughts [29:09] are sometimes this is created when you [29:12] have and I know you have multiple dogs [29:13] uh Jess but this is often created when [29:16] people have multiple dogs and when they [29:17] bring a new dog into the household they [29:20] have the new dogs spend a lot of time [29:23] with all of the other dogs because dogs [29:25] bond to dogs very very quickly much [29:28] faster than humans um bond to dogs and [29:31] depending on the nature their [29:32] personality of the dog sometimes that um [29:36] some dogs can get really attached to the [29:38] other dogs and when you separate them [29:40] this happens we see this with litter [29:41] mates all of the time when people get [29:43] two puppies at the same time or puppy [29:45] people get young dogs and keep them with [29:46] the older dogs when you try and separate [29:49] them there isn't a really strong [29:51] onetoone bond with the person and the [29:53] dog because the dog is just so focused [29:55] on the other dog that it can actually [29:58] create a lot of people think oh they're [29:59] friends they're they're all this great [30:01] stuff but you go to separate them and [30:03] then the young dog is very anxious and [30:05] then it becomes challenging to like send [30:08] them to the vet or you know if you have [30:10] to divide them up for babysitting or [30:11] whatever it might be can be really [30:13] challenging [30:15] um I I will be totally transparent there [30:18] is not a quick fix for it um anytime [30:21] you're dealing with anything to do with [30:22] anxiety everything needs to be very slow [30:24] but what I would begin with is just [30:26] start with some very small separation [30:30] things um and that might be you know [30:33] creating the dog in a different room um [30:35] while they you know eat their meals so [30:37] they're doing something that's fun and [30:39] it only lasts like 30 seconds or 2 [30:42] minutes and then bring them back [30:43] together or um you know have puppy or [30:45] young dog be in the crate or whatever [30:47] dog it is that's showing anxiety let the [30:50] other dogs have some freedom but then [30:51] switch put the other dogs out and then [30:53] spend way more oneon-one time with the [30:56] dog who's a bit uh more anxious um and [30:59] by one at one time do something together [31:01] that keeps the dog engaged whether it be [31:03] a little bit of training something that [31:05] involves you know whatever the dog is [31:07] motivated by whether it's food or toys [31:09] or whatever it might be um slow [31:12] separation until you can start to have [31:14] more and more and more and more and then [31:16] the great thing is is once all of that [31:18] is sort of settled then you can put the [31:21] family back together again and you'll be [31:23] fine it's not like um it's not like a [31:25] constant thing um um but just for for [31:28] everybody listening if you know you are [31:30] in a situation where you have multiple [31:32] dogs or you do want to bring another dog [31:34] into the home our recommendation to you [31:36] is to spend the first 6 months to nine [31:40] months to the a year with a bit more [31:42] separation than you think you would need [31:44] to until all of the the bonds are formed [31:47] between the humans and the dogs um we [31:50] find that that really makes a big [31:52] difference in um the confidence of the [31:56] young dog of of of the or or new dog to [31:58] the household uh and Jess if you uh need [32:01] some followup you can always call us [32:02] down here in the train station on the [32:03] pay phone uh you know how to reach us um [32:06] I I we also have a super chat I mean are [32:09] there still payones it' be awesome if I [32:12] don't think [32:13] so uh from I don't know GSD random um [32:19] put a put put my five month old GSD on a [32:21] line outside in the morning find it [32:23] there yeah it's just not very long the [32:25] preview isn't very long is it uh on line [32:27] outside in the mornings for a little bit [32:28] but when I go to bring her inside she [32:30] jumps and tries to bite [32:32] help so what's what sort of advice would [32:35] you give in this situation um well it's [32:37] great that you're putting your dog uh on [32:39] a line which is great um oh you know [32:42] what I just want to clarify is this like [32:45] on a tie out line or are they out on [32:47] like a line mean by on a line yeah cuz [32:49] that's going to change how to address it [32:51] on a line outside in the morning for a [32:53] little bit but when I go to bring her [32:54] inside yeah I bet you're absolutely [32:57] wonder I wonder uh okay yeah I I'm [32:59] curious to see what you say in the chat [33:01] but we're reading this a little bit [33:02] differently if you're putting your dog [33:04] outside um and putting them on a line or [33:07] tying them out or whatever might it [33:09] might be and then going inside and [33:10] leaving the dog that's the first thing [33:12] that we're going to have you change we [33:13] actually don't recommend that you do [33:15] that with dogs um you know when you're [33:17] outside especially if you have a [33:18] five-month old dog that's young [33:19] impressionable probably isn't very well [33:21] trained yet because it's just just a [33:23] youngster you need to go outside with [33:25] your dog and um when I initially went to [33:28] answer the question I thought you were [33:30] having the dog on like a long line which [33:33] is what we use so my brain just went [33:35] right to what we would do so um it's a [33:37] Tio yeah so uh if you can stop with the [33:41] Tio we do not recommend that uh take [33:43] your 20ft line attach it directly to the [33:45] dog's collar and go out with your dog um [33:49] you know encourage them to go to the [33:50] bathroom spend a few minutes outside [33:52] playing with the dog maybe do some [33:54] training maybe do some tug some chase [33:56] that type of thing um and then you can [33:58] take the dog in uh from there but you [34:00] know when your dog doesn't have uh any [34:02] training or any manners yet because it's [34:05] young um and you have it tied out and [34:07] you walk up towards it if you don't now [34:08] have the ability to say settle sit or um [34:12] leave it or lie down or anything like [34:14] that you're just setting your dog up to [34:16] rehearse bad behaviors and to fail so [34:18] not until your dog has some skills [34:21] underneath their belt should you be be [34:23] putting your dog um in that situation [34:25] and the good news is is um you know once [34:27] they're trained you don't need to tie [34:29] them to anything because they just [34:30] listen to you and they won't run away so [34:32] we we don't use um any Tiote training to [34:35] be perfectly honest my dogs have never [34:36] been tied out at all I have zero [34:38] experience with it because it's just not [34:40] the methods that we use but we love the [34:43] idea of a long line so it sounds like [34:45] you have one that hopefully you can use [34:46] anyways um put it on go outside with the [34:49] dog and if the dog decides to get [34:51] rambunctious and jump up you are right [34:53] there already to take control you could [34:55] step on the line you could take the line [34:57] in your hands and place the dog into a [34:59] sit and get them to settle for a moment [35:01] before going inside you can bring your [35:02] bait bag out with some treats inside and [35:05] you can um you know teach the dog to [35:07] come and sit in front of you so you have [35:09] a little bit more control so there's [35:10] lots of things you can do but [35:11] unfortunately the scenario that you're [35:13] in does not lend itself to allow you to [35:16] have control in any way no and also at [35:18] this point you know we're talking a [35:20] little bit about um Teenage behavior and [35:22] um the Adolescent periods in a dog's [35:24] life um and your life [35:27] here because you're struggling with [35:29] something in fact in the chat let me [35:31] know is there one Behavior that's gotten [35:33] worse for you and your dog is there one [35:35] thing you're really struggling with [35:35] you're like oh this must be you speaking [35:37] to everybody everybody everybody yeah [35:39] everybody I want to know like what [35:40] what's your struggle with the teenage [35:41] phase um but when we're talking about [35:44] setting a dog up to be able to like [35:45] train through these things more easily [35:47] or giving a dog great information uh [35:50] that involves uh you a lot more than the [35:53] tie out so it's important to take [35:55] advantage of these opportunities this is [35:57] a natural training uh uh opportunity [35:59] where you can go outside and um do their [36:02] uh potty break or whatever and then work [36:04] on the things that kale talked about but [36:06] you're always there um I think a lot of [36:09] people this see I I say this because [36:11] this was a bad choice I made with my [36:12] first dog that before I came to McAn [36:15] dogs is I did the fence thing I did The [36:17] Invisible Fence thing and I just let her [36:19] out whenever she needed to go out and [36:20] then you had go check on her and [36:21] whatever but that was not good [36:23] information for that dog specifically [36:26] they just learn so many bad behaviors [36:29] that way because you're not there to [36:31] give them any guidance or instruction [36:33] they you know can dig they can bark run [36:36] charge dogs you know walking by the [36:39] street and and learn to bark there's [36:41] just so many things that your dog can [36:42] learn to do wrong and then what happens [36:45] is you wonder why like bad behaviors are [36:47] popping up in other aspects of the dog's [36:49] life and it's directly because we're [36:50] tying the dog out in the backyard um and [36:53] then and then we have to fix those [36:55] things rather than prevent them from [36:56] happening in the first place yeah so um [36:59] it's it's a little bit more work but [37:00] believe me it's worth it you know it's [37:02] that ounce of prevention is worth a [37:03] pound of cure idea uh you just don't [37:05] want to have to untrain some of these [37:06] bad behaviors and you're going to build [37:08] a relationship faster moving on to that [37:10] second um developmental threshold and [37:13] it's it's around the seven-month Mark [37:15] and the challenge that comes along with [37:17] that age or at least in that I mean it [37:19] depends on the uh breed of dog size of [37:21] dog but at that age they've done a [37:24] couple things number one they may have [37:26] learned to re curse some of the bad [37:27] behaviors that you don't like because [37:28] you think oh you know we did training [37:30] when they were a puppy or when they were [37:31] a young dog but we don't need to do [37:33] training anymore kale talked about how [37:35] many of your dog training skills are [37:37] perishable skills that'll get worse if [37:39] you don't do some maintenance of them [37:41] you don't you don't practice them every [37:43] once in a while but now your dog's a [37:45] little bit older seven eight nine months [37:47] and they're just they're big and strong [37:50] maybe your dog is you know now at a size [37:52] where you know it's cute when the puppy [37:54] jumps up the puppy uh golden jumps up [37:56] not so cute when they're 70 pounds you [37:58] know or 65 pounds and they're jumping [38:00] seven feet in the air yeah that's an [38:02] athletic golden uh who can come to our [38:04] doc diving pool this spring when we open [38:05] and have our grand open cation but uh [38:08] this these are some of the new [38:09] challenges that you have and the problem [38:11] with this is that trying to fix these [38:14] problems is so much more work than uh [38:18] understanding that you know you continue [38:20] that training throughout uh dogs bigger [38:22] faster stronger than they were before [38:23] you've also not been training in a while [38:25] so now you've got to go back and you've [38:27] got to almost start from the beginning [38:29] you got you have to establish you have [38:32] to establish that foundational [38:34] skill did your dog ever really get it [38:37] did they ever truly understand walking [38:40] on leash I see a lot of people are [38:42] struggling with the recall or the hear [38:44] I've seen that a lot did your dog ever [38:45] really know it or are you putting them [38:47] in a situation now where they're free at [38:49] the park because they're and do they [38:52] like sometimes know it or do they know [38:53] it because you like had treats in your [38:55] hand or you were like holding their ball [38:57] or their frisbee or there was literally [39:00] no one else around or they're young and [39:03] they haven't really learned to ignore [39:04] you yet you know is that what they knew [39:07] because if that's the case they didn't [39:08] actually really know it and which is [39:10] fine this is just what most people do [39:13] and you know what we try to do when [39:14] we're training something is we set the [39:17] dog up for Success we try to get the dog [39:19] rehearsing the behavior whatever we're [39:21] working on correctly as many times as we [39:24] possibly can in an Environ where it's [39:27] super easy for them to do it right but [39:30] that is not a trained dog and that's [39:32] where the the false sense of security [39:34] sometimes happens for the person you [39:36] think oh my gosh look how awesome this [39:38] this dog's listening that's great but [39:40] now we need to go through a proofing [39:42] phase can they do it when you're farther [39:43] away can they do it when there's [39:44] distractions can they do it in this [39:46] location this location that location um [39:49] are they listening on the first call [39:51] every single time or are you saying it [39:52] 10 or 12 times before the dog actually [39:54] listens and then go hey look you listen [39:56] it's like well no he kind of did it when [39:58] he felt like it rather than when when [40:01] you said it so there's a level of [40:03] criteria and that's something that we [40:04] try to instill in in our students of our [40:08] programs is take your expectations and [40:11] bring them up to here raise your [40:13] expectations of how well the dog should [40:15] listen to you because the dogs are just [40:17] so freaking capable of doing it if [40:20] they're getting good information and if [40:21] we have high expectations you know I [40:24] want my dog to respond to the C command [40:26] the first time that I say it every [40:28] single time no matter what's happening [40:30] if they are chasing a deer if they are [40:32] running towards the road and I say name [40:34] come they better put on those braks whip [40:37] around and race back to me that is the [40:40] type of knee-jerk reaction that we are [40:42] looking for and if I get anything else [40:44] other than that I train through it if [40:47] you want to know how to train through it [40:48] you should sign up for our classes [40:49] because it's way for too long for me to [40:51] tell you to do but that's what we're [40:52] trying to get out here Su uh you know [40:55] all the problems listed here [40:57] here uh are things we work on life [40:59] skills life skills one yeah thanks Su um [41:01] and these are the kinds of things that [41:03] we we work on I love the idea that you [41:05] identify things someone was saying uh [41:07] can you talk a little bit about what [41:08] happens when the responses become slow [41:11] then you train them then you you write [41:13] them down in your Journal your work your [41:15] training journal and you say next time [41:17] we go outside next time we're going to [41:19] go for a walk instead I'm going to work [41:21] on response to name I'm going to work on [41:22] the recall I'm going to make a note make [41:25] note of this thing it's not where I want [41:27] it to be and this is when things start [41:29] to slip and it's a slippery slope you [41:31] know your dog gets worse at them they [41:33] start to they they quickly learn that [41:34] you know what I don't have to respond [41:36] you I can do my own thing um and this is [41:39] you you've got to get on it early Sharon [41:41] mentioned lots of trouble with our seven [41:43] months old putting his teeth on us or [41:44] biting our clothes well at seven months [41:46] old this is exactly where the leadership [41:50] factors need to come in you know you [41:51] need to re-evaluate where am I in my [41:54] training what opportunities does my dog [41:56] have to make these mistakes does am I [41:58] putting a house line back on to get more [42:00] control what's your Technique like right [42:03] I mean uh how much am I giving the dog [42:05] an opportunity to be like up on the bed [42:07] up on the couch all of these things that [42:09] at this point are you still using a [42:10] crate right Absolutely I'll tell you [42:13] that uh I wasn't using a crate my dog [42:16] was 2 years old uh I went to maand dogs [42:19] I learned about the value of a crate and [42:21] very quickly she started to figure out [42:25] that uh I was worth listening to here's [42:28] the beauty of a crate is the you are the [42:33] you are everything to that dog you know [42:35] you exercise them you do your thing you [42:37] pop them in the crate while you go do [42:38] your work or you go do you know whatever [42:40] in the house when you can't uh monitor [42:42] or supervise them and then when you come [42:44] back and you go to let them out you're [42:45] there again you are the F their focus [42:48] you are the center of the world to that [42:49] dog and that's even more important as we [42:52] get to these adolescent phases because [42:55] as we talked about when your puppy's a [42:56] little teeny thing they don't have you [42:58] aren't competing with [43:00] the enormous giant Grand world around [43:03] you but when they get a little bit older [43:05] you are so you need to [43:07] control you know what is how are they [43:10] being rewarded what are being gratified [43:12] by are they learning that barking in the [43:15] backyard for an hour while you know you [43:17] have a bath or whatever um is super [43:21] satisfying it's going to be pretty hard [43:23] to untrain that barking Behavior if [43:24] you're not out there to work on [43:27] maybe manage them a littleit really [43:30] valuable and it was something that [43:32] absolutely turned around my dog training [43:34] in an instant understanding the value of [43:36] good management um I just want to [43:39] quickly say um I'm can't I don't read [43:41] everything in the chat but I'm trying to [43:43] read as much as I can and um I just want [43:45] to remind everybody who's um asking [43:48] questions and inquiring about things in [43:49] the chat um anybody who has a name [43:52] highlighted in blue works for Mand dogs [43:55] they're a professional dog trainer um [43:57] that follow maand dog methods and [43:59] whatnot there's lots of other people [44:01] offering suggestions in the chat which [44:03] is so lovely um however I am seeing that [44:06] some of the suggestions are not in line [44:08] with Mand dog methods which is totally [44:10] fine there's more than one way to do [44:12] things but if you've come here to get [44:14] some advice or some guidance on what we [44:16] do here just keep in mind that um if you [44:20] unless you hear it from somebody in blue [44:23] it might not be what we do oh come on [44:26] that was good sorry I missed it [44:28] something about what we do I never make [44:29] up good oh name in blue never mind what [44:31] we do really well done anyways I just [44:33] wanted to say that just because I wanted [44:35] to make sure that people you know [44:36] there's we have strong feelings about [44:39] certain things and we would just want to [44:40] make sure that people aren't getting [44:43] guidance and going off and doing it when [44:44] it didn't come from us yeah uh Sharon [44:47] says we always have a host line on them [44:48] and we use a crate I've watched numerous [44:49] videos too um Sharon I think you a [44:52] student uh I reach out to the office you [44:54] know as a student you get to reach out [44:56] to professional dog trainers uh in our [44:58] office give the office a call and they [44:59] can they can follow up with you Sunny H [45:04] my puppy cries if she's more than two [45:05] steps from me she follows me everywhere [45:07] I can't go to the restroom alone without [45:10] putting uh without putting her in a [45:12] crate covered up I guess there's a few [45:15] questions we need to follow up with [45:16] sunny how old is your puppy uh and you [45:19] know what's the experience been like up [45:21] until this point is this a new behavior [45:23] is this an adolescent teenage phase [45:25] thing how long have you using the crate [45:26] for yeah yeah these are all important [45:28] questions and this is why joining us in [45:30] our online program is a great [45:32] opportunity because we get to work with [45:34] you uh you know we get the the trainers [45:36] in the online program get to know your [45:38] puppy uh instructor Robbie is one of our [45:40] superstars in the online training [45:41] program and uh you know they'll be able [45:43] to give you specific advice for your uh [45:46] situation and specific advice for your [45:48] dog makes a little bit difficult on [45:50] YouTube but I'm going to keep my eye on [45:52] yeah keep your eye on that for and mods [45:53] if you can just keep your eyes peeled [45:55] for sunny h [45:57] um talk here we go 11 weeks oh just a [46:00] baby uh two weeks since we've had her [46:03] okay cool yeah so she's super young [46:05] still which is great you know and and [46:07] I'm glad you asked about the age because [46:09] an 11 week old uh puppy is very [46:11] different than you know an 8-week old [46:14] dog or whatever so um you know in the [46:17] early stages the crate training in dogs [46:19] that get really attached to us can be [46:21] difficult in terms of uh trying to do [46:23] some separation um and some times when [46:26] you have [46:27] um uh when she's tired but not otherwise [46:30] okay great Sunny that's that's helpful [46:32] thank you for filling in those gaps um [46:35] so what I would recommend that you do is [46:38] actually for a little while start using [46:41] your crate more Sunny um and try to use [46:44] it in you know maybe every meal for the [46:46] next couple weeks um your puppy gets in [46:49] the crate with the crate door closed um [46:51] uncovered and you know when they're done [46:53] eating uh when your puppy's done eating [46:55] the crate you can let them out out or [46:56] perhaps just leave them in a little bit [46:57] longer but try and use the crate a [46:59] little bit more often when you're both [47:01] in the room and when you're out of the [47:03] room um because what we don't want to do [47:05] is only use the crate when they're [47:07] sleeping or they're tired the dog also [47:09] needs to learn that they have to go in [47:11] their crate when we have to quickly jump [47:12] on a call or we need to run out the the [47:15] door to talk to the neighbor or go grab [47:17] milk or you know long periods of time [47:20] short periods of time random times our [47:22] dogs have to learn that the crat is no [47:24] big deal you just go in it's your place [47:26] you got all your things in there you can [47:27] relax you're comfortable all of that but [47:30] sometimes we have to use the CRP more in [47:32] the early stages um to kind of get over [47:34] that hump and it would not be [47:37] unusual for it to get worse before it [47:40] gets better because you're changing the [47:42] dog's regular routine all of a sudden [47:44] it's like oh my gosh you know this is [47:46] different uh but if your puppy um you [47:49] know has gone to the bathroom they've [47:51] been mentally and physically um [47:55] exercised in some way yeah that's a good [47:58] focus on that for a minute because so [48:00] much of crate training people don't [48:01] understand the why that's even important [48:03] yeah I think sometimes people just pop [48:05] their dog into crate and expect they're [48:06] going to be okay with it and you know we [48:08] always think to oursel like why do we [48:10] never have crate training issues why [48:12] does that happen I've never ever ever [48:15] had a dog that hasn't just figured it [48:17] out almost instantly like their crate [48:20] after a couple days has just never been [48:21] a thing and if I think about it it's [48:23] because they have so much inter traction [48:26] when they're out of their crate that [48:28] they are ready to just chill out by the [48:30] time they go in they've been trained [48:32] they've been exercised they've had play [48:34] they've tugged they've done all of these [48:36] things they've gone to the bathroom all [48:38] of that stuff they can go in from there [48:40] so I would just raise the engagement a [48:42] little bit beforehand and then start to [48:44] use your crate a little bit more but the [48:45] good news is you have a very very young [48:48] puppy at this stage um 11 weeks really [48:50] isn't very old and um there's lots of [48:54] room for for Improvement and to get on [48:56] the right track we talked a little bit [48:58] about those two developmental [49:00] developmental thresholds where you might [49:02] encounter some problems um as you're [49:04] working through those specific [49:06] challenges in your training uh there's [49:08] some things that you can do that will [49:10] help you to avoid any further [49:12] complications that will help you to [49:14] maintain those great responses whether [49:15] it's a a beautiful walking on leash uh [49:18] or great recall and these are things [49:21] that we do in our daily lives as dog [49:23] trainers we'll do them randomly whether [49:25] the dogs 7 months 7 years 17 years [49:28] whatever um things that we'll do on our [49:31] on our walks as an example like what [49:33] sort of thing would we do just to [49:34] maintain a little bit of spring in the [49:36] step yeah for for our like Le offleash [49:39] walks yeah I'm not listening to you oh [49:42] sorry uh what would we do during our [49:44] offleash walks to like reward those dogs [49:47] offleash walks yeah yes um in our [49:49] offleash walks we'll do all kinds of [49:51] things to reward our dogs for good [49:53] attention and for listening um we'll you [49:55] know bring some of our dog's favorite [49:58] rewards and sometimes I'll like walk and [50:00] hide a frisbee in the back of my hoodie [50:02] so nobody knows it's there yeah and then [50:04] I'll call my dog and when they come [50:05] racing back they get about a couple feet [50:07] away and then I'll Whip the frisbee out [50:09] and we'll have a grou play a tug or I'll [50:10] throw for them a few times and then I'll [50:12] you know put it back up my sweatshirt [50:14] and then walk for a few minutes again um [50:16] we also play a game with our dogs I love [50:19] playing this with my young dogs where um [50:22] I just call it the look back game so [50:24] basically we'll walk forward and every [50:26] time my dog like stops and checks in [50:28] with me to like look back to see where [50:29] I'm going without being asked I will [50:32] start hooting and hollering and I will [50:34] run the other direction screaming and [50:38] making all kinds of fun noises and the [50:40] puppy will CH turn the afterburners on [50:43] and chase after me and when my puppy [50:45] catches me we have play We I reward [50:48] immensely and so what happens is I [50:51] actually teach the dog always pay [50:53] attention to where I am pay attention to [50:55] where I am don't get too far check in [50:57] often because sometimes if you're not [50:59] paying attention you are going to miss [51:01] the party um and what happens is the [51:03] dogs will start walk and stiff and all a [51:05] sudden they'll turn hey where are you [51:07] going and then sometimes I'll take off [51:08] and run and sometimes I'll just hey good [51:10] dog good checking in I'll praise with my [51:12] voice and I won't run away but I love [51:15] that little look back game uh we keep it [51:17] really fun and interesting when they're [51:18] in the early stages so that you know [51:20] when the dogs walk they're not [51:22] interested in running away they're [51:23] they're engaged with us yeah [51:26] um leash walks randomly rewarding you [51:28] know you the Maan method were focused on [51:31] working you away from food so that you [51:33] don't have to have food with you but you [51:35] can always use it to randomly reward [51:37] your dog for great attention uh a great [51:40] response to name you know when we have a [51:42] young dog in training and when they [51:43] first start to get a little bit more [51:44] freedom we'll always have treats [51:46] available as well you know whether it's [51:48] a toy or treat some way to reward them [51:50] so that when we get that Snappy response [51:52] to name we can call them in on our on [51:54] our uh recall finish we can call them in [51:56] have them sit under control and then [51:58] reward them a bunch all of these [52:00] exercises all of the aspirations you [52:02] have with your dog be sure to reward the [52:05] good stuff even after you're done [52:08] training which most which most people [52:09] consider as dog trainers we know it's a [52:11] lifelong uh Journey yeah um Smokey and [52:14] Juno thank you for the Super Chat I'm [52:17] just going to open that up yeah the look [52:19] back game I don't know why I haven't [52:20] talked about that before it's like one [52:21] of my favorite things yeah I think I [52:23] might uh put that little game in a new [52:26] program that we're putting together I [52:27] feel like it would be a fun little good [52:29] idea um hi guys my I'm Jared My Husky [52:32] and palsky struggle with impulse control [52:34] unleash what's a good technique to help [52:36] them out I'm also in Channel jum start [52:37] and plan to make lots of content with my [52:39] pups well thank you for the Super Chat [52:42] Jared we talk a little bit about I'm [52:44] wondering what the best video is for [52:46] this because understanding impulse [52:48] control and uh uh leaping like jumping [52:52] out um I can't think of what the word is [52:55] uh uh like reactivity on leash comes [52:57] down to uh timing is one of the factors [53:01] rehearsing good stuff uh controlling the [53:04] uh distractions controlling whatever [53:05] that challenging uh object person thing [53:08] is um I can't what's that video we [53:11] talked about with the um the concentric [53:14] circles we call it like the training [53:16] Target that training Target video maybe [53:18] I think that one is related to like uh [53:20] greeting manners but it could be applied [53:22] with the exactly the same thing yeah so [53:24] can you talk just about the training [53:25] Target briefly for impulse control yeah [53:27] so um first of all I would I think you [53:30] mentioned maybe two dogs um uh Husky and [53:33] palm SK yeah so first of all I would um [53:36] and perhaps you're doing this already [53:38] Jared so forgive me if you are but um uh [53:41] have the dogs work your leash uh [53:43] training separate so not both dogs [53:45] together especially if you're getting [53:47] any um impulse control stuff or the dogs [53:49] are being super impulsive they'll feed [53:51] off of each other and then we'll make it [53:52] worse so absolutely need to work this [53:54] into individually um one dog at a time [53:58] and um I would really work on making [54:00] sure that you have some type of control [54:02] position that you can fall back on that [54:04] gets the dog into a nice calm mind frame [54:07] and that's what we talk about in this [54:09] video hopefully um Dan can find it for [54:12] you uh but it's working on teaching the [54:14] dogs to do a controlled sit at our [54:16] leftand side on a loose leash and we [54:18] train the dogs to hold a sit on a loose [54:22] leash beside us until we release them [54:24] and that control position can be used in [54:26] all kinds of scenarios but what this [54:29] position does is it teaches your dog [54:31] about having impulse control and when we [54:34] train it we don't train it around you [54:35] know other dogs and highly stimulating [54:37] distractions to begin with we start [54:39] super simple with very calm minor [54:42] distractions so that the dog doesn't [54:44] have to use a lot of impulse control [54:45] they can just simply learn to sit on a [54:47] loose leash and hold the sit for some [54:48] dogs that's Harden itself and once the [54:50] dog gets the understanding that they [54:52] have to stay sitting beside us until we [54:54] tell them that they can move then we [54:56] start to ramp up the stimulation and the [54:58] excitement around them um so that they [55:01] are learning to maintain that impulse [55:03] control and then we can of course fall [55:05] back into that position um out in the [55:07] real world when we need it but it needs [55:09] to start with some foundational training [55:11] with the dogs individual yeah and uh if [55:13] it's one instead of the other you might [55:15] be take you might be taking one dog for [55:16] a walk and then training your other dog [55:18] to walk remember taking your dog for a [55:19] walk and training your dog to walk are [55:21] two different things so uh maybe you do [55:23] maybe you're training both of them [55:25] they're both reactive keep that in mind [55:26] there that's sort of a different way of [55:28] looking at the same problem Mark with [55:31] the Super Chat oh my goodness I've lost [55:33] the Mark Mark Mark there it is um hi [55:37] there I walk by dog and she is an [55:38] eight-month old Jack Russell she walks [55:40] nice with me but with my sister when she [55:42] walks her she pulls and sits down and [55:45] won't move so this This lends itself a [55:49] little bit to some of that leadership uh [55:51] those leadership things that we've [55:52] talked about what what kind of [55:53] suggestion would you have for Mark to uh [55:56] fix work on this problem yeah it can be [55:59] difficult when dogs are going from [56:00] person to person because they um will [56:03] often size that person up and kind of [56:05] decide whether they think that they're [56:07] worth listening to or not and um you [56:09] know it would be great if uh your sister [56:12] could learn a little bit about [56:15] um some good techniques on how to use [56:18] the leash and um you know timing of [56:21] reward how to motivate the dog um [56:24] perhaps they need to spend a little bit [56:25] more time doing other things together [56:27] that's not walking to build a bit of a a [56:29] common relationship um taking a dog for [56:32] a walk is um it's a hard thing to do [56:35] yeah and uh it requires a bit of [56:37] relationship it re requires some [56:39] leadership and some control and so often [56:42] um we would suggest that you know a a [56:46] person and a dog are able to conquer [56:48] other things that are easier to walk [56:50] than walking before going for a walk so [56:53] I think it might be important that b [56:54] spend some other time together um [56:57] working on maybe more stationary type [56:59] exercises with limited distractions um [57:02] to build on a bit of a rapport from with [57:05] one another build a bit more of a [57:07] relationship because that will make it [57:08] easier for your sister to get your dog [57:10] uh to listen to them it's not a matter [57:12] of like oh just take this treat or you [57:14] know use this leash or do it this way [57:16] and it'll be fine um so much of this is [57:19] about how the person and the dog works [57:22] together and very often that needs to be [57:25] accomplished away from walking walking [57:27] is like a university level skill to do [57:30] it's very very difficult to take a dog [57:32] for a walk prior to training um so [57:34] there's other things that you can Master [57:36] first that will help the walking become [57:38] easier in time we have whole families [57:41] that will take uh are in class in person [57:44] and online training program so if that's [57:45] an option for you that might be [57:47] something that could help um remember [57:49] it's not about the dogs age it's about [57:50] their level of understanding we have [57:52] peopley Sumer we have we have people [57:54] from all over uh dogs of all ages that [57:57] are in our life skills program as an [57:59] example you know if trying to uh trying [58:02] to work on a specific skill you get a [58:05] professional dog trainer to help you [58:06] through that we are in overtime I [58:08] actually

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,, Part 318/429,~Ken === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] after 25 years of being a dog trainer I [00:02] have heard thousands of horror stories [00:04] from students about places that they've [00:06] taken their dogs now so that you don't [00:08] make these same mistakes here are some [00:09] of the top places you should never take [00:11] your dog I'm kale mccan welcome back to [00:14] mccan [00:16] [Music] [00:17] dogs first place you should never take [00:20] your dog and I'm going to start right [00:21] off the bat with something controversial [00:23] you might not want to hear this go on [00:25] but it's dog parks no no no no no no no [00:27] no no no no no no no no [00:30] I get it a lot of people want to take [00:32] their dogs to dog parks because it's [00:33] like this wonderful picture of going in [00:36] and letting your dog meet all kinds of [00:37] dogs you know getting a bunch of new [00:39] friends you can sit on the uh bench [00:41] drinking your coffee or you know [00:43] scrolling through Tik Tok or whatever it [00:45] is that you want to do and you know your [00:47] dog will be tired out at the end of the [00:48] day and then you can go home and enjoy [00:50] you know a lovely a lovely day with your [00:52] dog being calm unfortunately that's [00:55] often not how it goes so what's the harm [00:57] in going to a dog park well you need to [00:59] think about about dogs that are at a dog [01:01] park you probably don't know a lot of [01:03] them that are there number one are they [01:05] vaccinated properly that's a good thing [01:06] to know especially if you're going with [01:08] a young dog number two what is [01:10] everybody's temperament and personality [01:12] and um social etiquette like you want to [01:16] kind of think about a dog park being um [01:19] I think people think about it as being [01:21] socialization but unfortunately [01:23] sometimes what happens is if you have a [01:24] dog that is a bit on the more shy side [01:27] maybe they're a little bit nervous [01:28] around other dogs or maybe you have the [01:30] it maybe you have a dog that's like [01:31] really boisterous and like wants to play [01:33] really rough you can't guarantee that [01:35] when you take your dog to a dog park [01:36] that every dog in the park is going to [01:38] be able to play appropriately with your [01:41] dog and unfortunately although we go [01:44] with good intentions to help our dog to [01:45] be more social often dog parks can [01:48] actually do the opposite I know a lot of [01:51] people who have taken their dogs to dog [01:53] park to socialize them when their dogs [01:55] have had dog aggression issues or a [01:58] number of other issues and I certainly [02:00] wouldn't want to go and have my dog be a [02:02] guinea pig for those dogs to you know [02:04] experiment with so I'm not saying that [02:07] dog parks are hard no altogether if you [02:10] wanted to go to a dog park when there [02:12] was no other dogs there and you wanted [02:13] an opportunity to let your dog have some [02:15] off leash time maybe you and a friend or [02:17] a family member who have dogs that are [02:19] buddies that actually play really nicely [02:21] together and have a good recall um want [02:24] to go on off hours where there's less [02:26] going on and then it's a completely safe [02:28] situation to me that's a totally [02:30] different idea but to walk into a dog [02:32] park blind to the people and dogs that [02:34] are there I think sets your dog up to be [02:36] very very much at risk to having them [02:39] get hurt or um whatever else happen not [02:43] to mention the dog training aspect of it [02:45] if your dog doesn't have a reliable [02:47] recall and you're letting them off into [02:48] the Yonder and having a grand old time [02:50] when it's time to call them back they [02:52] don't want to listen to you you're [02:54] basically ruining your recall so you [02:55] want to make sure that you have great [02:56] control and that you're exposing your [02:58] dogs only to dogs that you absolutely [03:00] trust are going to give your dogs a [03:02] great experience so I'm telling you that [03:04] you shouldn't take your dog to a dog [03:05] park so how are you going to exercise [03:07] socialize expose your dog because those [03:10] are all the things that we feel we we [03:11] benefit from from going to that place [03:13] well there's lots of things that you can [03:15] do number one you can exercise your dog [03:17] other ways like teaching them to play [03:18] fetch you could um take them biking you [03:21] could uh run with them you could do all [03:24] kinds of things that would incorporate [03:25] you and your dog together so there's [03:27] more of a bonding um situation happening [03:29] there [03:30] in terms of socialization or exposure [03:32] you could do that for you know a half an [03:34] hour easily by standing at the end of [03:36] your driveway let people walk by reward [03:38] your dog for checking out the sights The [03:40] Sounds the smells all of those things [03:42] while maintaining control again it [03:44] teaches your dogs to um see what's going [03:47] on around them and learn how to act [03:49] appropriately because you can train them [03:51] through those different situations [03:53] there's lots of ways to socialize your [03:54] dog that have absolutely nothing to do [03:57] with dog to dog interaction remember [03:59] remember socialization also needs to be [04:01] paired with the word exposure so getting [04:03] them out to different places on leash [04:05] and training situations are going to be [04:07] a much better way to teach your dog how [04:09] to navigate those new situations with [04:11] confidence and also to be able to lean [04:13] on you for control and Leadership second [04:15] place I would never take my dog would be [04:17] to Doggy Daycare oh did she just she did [04:21] now again I get why you would want to [04:23] take your dog to a Doggy Daycare maybe [04:25] you work really long hours you're you [04:27] know feeling apprehensive about leaving [04:28] your dog at home for long periods of [04:30] time without getting walked exercise you [04:32] know bathroom breaks those types of [04:34] things um or maybe you also are looking [04:36] to use it as an opportunity for your dog [04:38] to get tired out for the day or a little [04:40] bit of socialization but there's a [04:41] couple things you need to think about um [04:43] in terms of the harm that a Doggy [04:45] Daycare can bring so what's at risk in [04:49] Doggy Daycare you have to really do your [04:50] research because there's a bunch of [04:52] different styles out there some can be [04:54] really detrimental to the dog you know [04:56] when you take them to a Doggy Daycare in [04:58] some situations they are you know set [05:00] loose with a bunch of different dogs and [05:02] they're essentially just playing in [05:03] rough housing all day long and in some [05:05] cases um you know they're going to the [05:08] bathroom in the place that they're [05:09] playing so they're not actually even [05:10] going outside this can lead to lead to [05:13] confusion for house training again [05:15] you're not necessarily in control as to [05:18] the type of dogs that your dog is [05:19] interacting with um and again no one's [05:23] really making your dog do anything all [05:25] day so you also have the training aspect [05:27] that sometimes goes down the toilet as [05:29] well um it's very easy as a dog trainer [05:31] to see when students come to classes the [05:33] dogs that go to Doggy Daycare and the [05:35] dogs that don't because the dogs that do [05:37] are typically very distracted by the [05:39] other dogs all they want to do is play [05:41] and they don't really have much regard [05:42] for their person the other thing you [05:44] want to think about is that your dog [05:46] could be in a room with a bunch of other [05:48] dogs and think about like kids that go [05:49] to school you never know what they're [05:51] going to be exposed to um it's a great [05:53] place to get kennel cof or other things [05:55] like that just things that you need to [05:56] be mindful of so what should you do [05:59] instead again we're looking to exercise [06:02] our dog we're looking to make sure that [06:03] our dogs get let out on a regular basis [06:06] um you know perhaps you trust somebody [06:08] that could come into your home to take [06:09] your dog out a few times a day or maybe [06:11] could take your dog for a walk again [06:13] make sure you hear me there somebody [06:15] that you trust make sure that whoever's [06:17] going to be looking after your dog while [06:18] you're at work is going to be making [06:20] sure that they are exposing your dog to [06:22] Safe situations um you know that [06:25] understand the commands that you use all [06:27] of that for consistency uh for your dog [06:29] so what's the alternative here you [06:31] actually have a couple options number [06:33] one if your dog is Crate trained and you [06:36] can get up 30 minutes or earlier in the [06:38] morning you could very easily get out [06:41] make sure your dog's gone to the [06:42] washroom you can do a quick little bit [06:43] of training you can do some exercise and [06:45] your dog should be able to be crated [06:48] until you come back from work depending [06:50] on your your work life and and how long [06:52] you're gone but if they've had proper [06:54] exercise they've gone to the bathroom [06:55] they've been fed all of that they they [06:57] should have no trouble um being created [06:59] until you're back if you are in a [07:01] situation where you must you know [07:03] utilize some type of Doggy Daycare out [07:05] there I know I I knocked it before but [07:08] there are some um businesses that [07:10] actually run Doggy Daycare very well and [07:12] this means that you need to go and do [07:13] your research you need to ask questions [07:15] like you know how many dogs do they have [07:17] in a session do they have crate time do [07:19] they take their dogs to go outside to [07:21] the washroom uh most importantly if [07:23] there's play um sessions do they divide [07:26] the play sessions do they have dog [07:28] behavior knowledge where they're able to [07:30] put dogs into specific play groups so [07:32] that if you have a Chihuahua they're not [07:35] being left to you know play with a wild [07:36] and crazy chocolate lap um you know they [07:39] need to make sure that they have a lot [07:41] of knowledge behind them so that you [07:43] know 100% when you drop your dog off [07:45] that your dog is going to be getting [07:46] great information and they're going to [07:48] be safe but again if you Circle back to [07:50] the first thing if your dog is CR [07:52] trained and they're happy and safe in [07:53] their crate and you've just done a [07:54] little bit of extra work in the morning [07:56] and then when you get home from work [07:57] there should be no reason why you need [07:59] utilize the Doggy Daycare I've built an [08:01] amazing online and in-person program [08:03] that's specifically about teaching your [08:05] dog life skills now what's great about [08:08] the program is that we're not really [08:09] teaching your dog our job is much harder [08:12] and we are teaching you this is really [08:15] important because you need to learn how [08:16] to have the skills to help your dog in [08:19] all of these different locations and [08:20] places so that you give them great [08:21] information you're a good leader and you [08:23] feel confident about what you're doing [08:25] with your dog so join me and the rest of [08:27] our amazing professional dog training [08:29] team either for our online or in-person [08:31] life skills program the link for that is [08:33] in the description below another place [08:35] that you should never take your dog [08:37] would be any type of event so I'm [08:40] talking your kids soccer games uh [08:43] friends barbecue festivals or fairs [08:46] anything where you're going to have a [08:48] lot of people around potentially other [08:50] dogs that you don't know distractions [08:53] noise um all of those types of things [08:56] and I get why you would want to take [08:57] your dog to these places you want to [08:59] have your dog be incorporated in you [09:02] know fun family things um you feel [09:04] guilty about leaving them at home while [09:06] you're out doing those things um maybe [09:08] you want your your friends and family to [09:10] meet your dog and you want them to be [09:11] able to hang out with you uh but I want [09:14] to go over all of the reasons why taking [09:17] them to these places before they're [09:19] ready could be a huge mistake I'm going [09:21] to break it down to make it very simple [09:23] for you and that is by taking your dog [09:25] to these places before they are ready is [09:27] going to allow them to rehearse back bad [09:29] behavior think about all of the [09:31] distractions that are there all the [09:32] people that are going to be engaging [09:33] with your dog um there's going to be [09:36] lots happening it's going to be easy for [09:38] them to jump on people not come when [09:39] they're called pull on the leash eat [09:41] things because you're would rather be [09:43] sitting watching your kid jump in and [09:45] out of the pool or you know you're [09:47] distracted by this you're not actually [09:48] paying attention to the dog when they're [09:50] young and they don't have a lot of life [09:52] experience or a lot of training a lot of [09:54] dogs aren't going to naturally be [09:56] inserted into those types of situations [09:58] and just behave perfectly that's for us [10:00] to train our dogs how to do so you kind [10:02] of have two choices here number one [10:04] don't take the dog in the first place so [10:05] you can go and enjoy those events [10:07] without the stress of the dog or number [10:09] two go there with the intention of [10:11] teaching your dog how to actually behave [10:14] wouldn't it be nice if you could go to a [10:16] uh you know your kid soccer game and [10:18] your dog would actually lie beside you [10:20] at you know at your lawn chair quietly [10:22] for like the entire game or if you could [10:24] take your dog to a friend's house and [10:26] have them you know just chill out with [10:28] you is you're you're hanging out with [10:30] your friends and family that is [10:32] absolutely possible but it's going to [10:34] take a lot of hard work and training and [10:36] it's certainly not a situation we want [10:37] to be putting our dogs in before they're [10:39] ready because then you're going to have [10:40] to erase all kinds of bad behavior I [10:43] said don't take your dog to an event but [10:45] I am somebody who you know loves to take [10:48] my dog to certain events once they're [10:49] are trained so let me tell you how I [10:51] actually do this if I'm going to go to a [10:53] soccer game friend's house whatever it [10:55] might be um sometimes what I'll do with [10:57] a young dog in training is bring a [10:59] travel crate with me or maybe an xen [11:01] somewhere that I can set my dog up so [11:03] that you know they're away from the [11:04] action and I can bring them out do very [11:07] short Spurs of training and then put [11:08] them away I know they're safe and quiet [11:10] and I can return back to the party and [11:12] do my thing or maybe you know add a [11:14] soccer game or whatever the situation is [11:16] maybe I can pull my car up um somewhere [11:18] close where I can have the hatch open [11:20] and the dog and the crate in the back [11:21] again I can bring the dog in and out for [11:23] short periods of time where I can do [11:25] some training and then put them away [11:27] where they're safe and happy and I can [11:29] continue on with whatever I'm doing at [11:30] the event as a dog gets more trained and [11:33] then I can get to the point where I can [11:34] incorporate my dog for longer periods of [11:36] time knowing that I'm giving good [11:38] information also don't be that friend [11:40] with that annoying dog that doesn't [11:42] listen that comes over and just wrecks [11:44] everything jumps on everybody steals [11:46] food you know barks obnoxiously that [11:48] type of thing don't be that friend if [11:50] you learned anything from today's video [11:52] it should be that you need to set your [11:54] dog up for Success you could take your [11:56] dog to any of these places that I've [11:57] talked about and it go swimmingly you [12:00] could also take your dog to these places [12:02] and it could be an utter disaster but it [12:05] really comes down to you and your [12:07] leadership if you want to learn more [12:09] about how to be a great leader for your [12:10] dog check out this video right there on [12:13]

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,, Part 337/429,~Ken #dogtraining #puppytraining === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:01] something that we talk about very often [00:04] is supervision now I let's lead off with [00:08] this because we have lots of videos on [00:09] the channel that talk about supervision [00:11] I know one of the biggest excuses that I [00:13] hear is that like oh I can't watch my [00:15] dog every second of the day and we'll [00:17] get to you know some strategies around [00:19] that but why is supervision so important [00:22] if you're if you're a new dog owner or [00:24] have a dog in training but especially if [00:26] you're a new dog owner or have a dog in [00:28] training that's having problems why is [00:30] supervision important supervision is is [00:34] essential really for Success because [00:36] dogs are learning every single second of [00:40] the day whether you're involved or not [00:44] unfortunately and um you know if we're [00:46] not supervising our dog we're not able [00:48] to give them information and often bad [00:52] behaviors are created because the dog um [00:57] dabbles in them and nobody's around to [01:00] tell them no you shouldn't do that um or [01:04] if you want to go in the more positive [01:05] route if you're not supervising you're [01:08] also not around to you know throw a [01:11] party when your dog makes a miraculous [01:13] Choice as well um you know we don't just [01:15] want to be there disciplining the dog [01:17] all of the time we also want to be there [01:18] to mold and shape them towards doing the [01:21] right thing and it's impossible to do [01:22] that if we can't supervise and I think [01:25] also it's important to talk about what [01:26] we mean by supervision supervision is [01:29] not not you know your dog is in your [01:31] office and you're typing a bunch of [01:33] emails or you're talking to your sister [01:34] on the phone or whatever it might be not [01:36] paying attention supervise Supervision [01:39] in our mind in the early stages while [01:41] your dogs learning is active situation [01:43] literally looking and paying attention [01:46] to and thinking about the dog um what is [01:49] the dog thinking about um engaging with [01:52] them giving them good information not U [01:55] being distracted and what's cool about [01:56] it is if you can start off with really [01:59] good supervision skills and good [02:01] management skills you will be able to [02:04] get to the point quickly where your dog [02:07] can be busy doing something while you're [02:09] cooking dinner or you're on emails or [02:11] whatever it might be and you're kind of [02:12] paying attention but you're kind of not [02:13] you can get to that point but so many [02:16] people skip the level of supervision [02:19] that we suggest they start with and they [02:21] go right to the multitasking thing and [02:23] then they you know oh well he's he's [02:25] jumping on the counter or he's stealing [02:27] things or he's barking at the window [02:30] well how are those things happening in [02:33] the first place if you're supervising [02:35] because if you're supervising the way [02:36] that we want you to the second the dog [02:39] is you know air sniffing the counter [02:41] thinking about jumping up boom we're on [02:43] it um you know we're not waiting for the [02:45] problem to occur and then saying oh bad [02:48] dog you shouldn't do that I am [02:49] supervising so well that I go huh my dog [02:52] looks like she's about to jump up on the [02:53] counter and then I can step in and [02:55] address it so that she doesn't actually [02:57] know that jumping on a counter is a [02:58] thing because I've never let her do it [03:01] how do I never let her do it I'm a good [03:02] supervisor so supervision is not just [03:05] watching your dog I I I I we say that [03:08] sometimes but it is the act of doing it [03:10] needs to be like top tier you need to be [03:14] a top tier supervisor yeah the reality [03:17] is and the thing that you need to [03:18] remember is that if it if it in an [03:21] absence of information if it feels good [03:23] if it tastes good your dog's going to [03:25] think that it's right whatever it's [03:27] doing that's the right thing and uh you [03:30] know if it's a problem Behavior if you [03:31] don't see it happen then you can't fix [03:34] that problem like you have no business [03:36] uh your puppy goes in peas in the corner [03:37] or you know around the corner and uh you [03:40] know you step in pee and you're like oh [03:42] darn dog darn you you know you were the [03:45] reason that that dog had an opportunity [03:47] and what's so interesting about when you [03:49] when we help people to discover these [03:51] moments actually catching your dog in [03:53] the act of doing the wrong thing is [03:55] sometimes like the game changer so [03:58] catching your puppy in the act of [03:59] squatting to pee is really what makes [04:01] the difference if you have a house [04:02] training problem catching them in the [04:04] act of starting to nibble on your gym [04:06] bag on the floor is the thing that gives [04:09] them all the information remember your [04:10] dog your dog doesn't know they don't [04:12] know what the right choice is if it [04:14] feels good if it tastes good it's got to [04:15] be the right thing unless you're there [04:17] to train them you're there to give them [04:19] the information hey hey that's not what [04:21] you chew on this bone or this other [04:23] thing you can chew on that same goes for [04:25] the house line that the you know we talk [04:27] a lot about house line we can get to [04:28] this in a minute but I will tell you the [04:31] the the biggest difference people see [04:33] when it comes to Tool stuff for your dog [04:35] is the puppy training house line just [04:37] because it gives you a six you know 5 [04:40] foot arm extension I would never train a [04:42] puppy without one ever absolutely [04:43] absolutely but the thing uh so my skin [04:46] crawls when I see videos of puppies [04:47] without a house I know it just it just [04:49] doesn't set them up to be right and um [04:52] the where I'm kind of going with this is [04:54] to the supervision point the only time [04:56] your puppy has her house laying out on [04:58] is when they're out of the kennel and [04:59] the only time that they have their house [05:00] line on is when you're supervising them [05:03] and people still complain about the fact [05:05] that their puppy has chewed it or has [05:06] chewed on the end of it well if you're [05:08] supervising them appropriately you can [05:10] interrupt that behavior it's the same [05:11] chewing on a house line is exactly the [05:13] same as them chewing on your $200 boot [05:15] abolutely it's exactly the same thing MH [05:18] and you would you would stop them from [05:20] chewing on your boots I bet if you saw [05:21] them doing that you wouldn't just stand [05:23] there and go oh there he's chewing on my [05:24] boots again you know for some reason [05:27] people don't take the house line I want [05:28] to say something else what you [05:30] it's [05:32] notching the Ken said [05:35] that you catching your dog in the can be [05:38] game Chang changer and he's absolutely [05:40] right and I'm going to go one more layer [05:41] on top of that oh okay we're layering [05:43] this up yeah if you CH can catch your [05:45] dog in the act the first time they try [05:49] that wrong thing boy is that going to [05:52] make a difference because sometimes if [05:54] they do that thing over and over and [05:56] over again and then you you catch them [05:58] in the act you do you do that but [06:00] they've already done it five or six [06:01] times before now you have to erase a [06:04] behavior that they've sort of learned [06:05] that they kind of like doing whether [06:07] that's cheing the thing whether it's [06:08] barking at the thing whe whatever it [06:10] might be so if you're such a good [06:12] supervisor that the first time your dog [06:14] decides to seal something the first time [06:16] they decide to you know bite at the cat [06:18] or whatever it might be that's when you [06:21] can catch them it makes such a [06:24] difference in your dog's decision- [06:25] making from from there on in absolutely [06:28] on there on out I me say I just want to [06:30] add not so good with the things excuse [06:32] me I'm just going to add actually I had [06:33] one of those moments with five today [06:35] okay so I was this a great example who [06:36] is five oh five sorry just like you guys [06:38] know who he is uh five alive is our [06:40] youngest dog he's two years old um and [06:43] he's a little bordoli whipp it terrier [06:45] mix cute as pie um so I was taking my [06:48] dogs for a walk on the um what cutest [06:51] pie he's cutest pie sweet as pie cute as [06:53] button whatever yeah that's right I [06:54] don't even know I don't get that cuz [06:55] buttons aren't keepable um anyways I was [06:58] uh taking my dogs for a walk um uh our [07:01] business is um located on 22 Acres of [07:04] property um it's beautiful opportunity [07:06] to take my dogs for some offleash walks [07:08] and he's been walking off leash for [07:10] quite some time listens well um I have a [07:12] couple other dogs that like to eat poo [07:15] while we're walking drives me absolutely [07:17] crazy um but five's never done that [07:19] before and I just happened to be paying [07:22] attention and he actually tried today [07:24] and he went over and I thought he is not [07:26] going to do that and as soon as he went [07:28] in I went ah you leave that and I kind [07:30] of startled him and he turned and looked [07:32] at me with his eyes open he was like oh [07:34] my God and every single pile of rabbit [07:38] poop coyote poop whatever it might be [07:40] from the walk after that he took like a [07:42] big wow he avoided it by feet if he [07:45] could and I thought yes I caught him on [07:47] the first try and now it's going [07:49] actually make such a difference I was so [07:51] proud of myself um but if I wasn't [07:53] paying attention if I wasn't supervising [07:55] I would have had to battle that a little [07:57] bit more that's a really disgusting [07:58] example but it's very real life because [08:01] abut this is these are the gross things [08:03] that dogs do sometimes and you know you [08:06] got to catch them quickly you know I was [08:08] walking past the Cinnabon uh just on the [08:10] other side of the sunglasses shop when [08:11] we came down here to the train station [08:13] if you're going to try and compare [08:14] Cinnabon to dog poo right now I'm out [08:17] and I you know there's the old you know [08:18] the old alley where the gym used to be [08:20] but they haven't put a new store in yet [08:21] and I thought this is gross but this is [08:22] real life exactly you you you basically [08:25] you're just repeating what I was [08:27] thinking at that time but that is the [08:28] that is the reality think get gross but [08:30] um you know because you're supervising [08:32] you were able to interrupt that behavior [08:34] and the fact that people struggle over [08:36] and over and over again barking is [08:37] another one you know oh my I let my dog [08:39] out in the backyard and they bark and [08:41] they bark and I just can't stop it and [08:43] what do I do well I if you're really [08:45] invested in this is something that's [08:46] real really creating friction in your [08:48] relationship with your dog or you you [08:49] know you're just so um you know [08:51] disappointed that every time you let [08:53] them out there they bark like crazy then [08:55] go out there with them and stop The [08:56] Barking you know work through it have [08:57] them on a long line that you can read [08:59] direct them and get them engaged you [09:00] know be out there to interrupt the [09:01] behavior it's so important I can't [09:04] stress it enough that's why we talk [09:06] about it so much but I do want to move [09:08] on to the next point one of the second [09:10] sign um that you might be having a a [09:14] leadership problem in your dog training [09:16] uh and just before I do that vilified [09:19] Freedom drop in the Super [09:21] Chat uh thank you for the Super Chat [09:24] I'll just put it up here stand by one [09:28] second uh uh you're 100% correct playing [09:31] tug was a major help still gets along [09:33] with the cat's 14 week old pit uh this [09:35] would might have been from uh we ever [09:37] did we talk about Tu on our last show [09:39] yeah I remember I remember this person [09:41] absolutely very cool we need we need to [09:44] talk about the second Point made our [09:46] lights go crazy yeah turn the lights on [09:48] in the train station um we need to talk [09:51] do you have a management plan what or [09:53] what is your management plan and you [09:56] might be thinking well gez you know I uh [09:59] uh put them in a kennel when I go to [10:01] work or my management plan is to make [10:03] sure the kids are watching them when or [10:05] my you know one of my kids is watching [10:07] the dog when I take my other kid to [10:09] soccer practice or whatever your life [10:11] situation may be management is going to [10:13] allow you to be a better supervisor it's [10:15] going to allow you to have great [10:16] leadership and here's why because your [10:19] dog's not getting into these situations [10:21] where they can make a bunch of choices [10:23] on their own especially if they're the [10:24] bad ones they make a bunch of choices on [10:25] their own but they're also not getting [10:27] themselves into a situation where [10:29] you look like you have zero control once [10:32] your dogs learned that they don't have [10:34] to come back when you call their name be [10:36] prepared to chase them around the park [10:38] you know this is all it takes is kale [10:40] talked about that one event the dog just [10:41] if you've interrupted these nuisance [10:43] behaviors the first time your dog never [10:46] gets a chance to learn that I don't have [10:47] to listen you know I can chew on the [10:49] baseboards I can go pee in the living [10:52] room these the your management plan is [10:54] going to help you to be a great leader [10:57] for your dog here's the other thing that [10:58] I love about a management plan when you [11:00] talk about leadership we mean method is [11:03] focused on getting your dog motivated to [11:05] listen and the thing that I I I wasn't [11:08] using a uh a crate with my Labrador [11:11] Retriever at all I just didn't know to [11:12] use a crate and when I started to use a [11:15] crate immediately even before I got into [11:17] like the really into the skills stuff [11:19] and started to get a bunch of good [11:20] techniques uh in mend dog training I [11:23] noticed that what was great although it [11:26] was a bit of a process you we have lots [11:27] of videos on the channel to talk about [11:28] crate training was a bit of a challenge [11:30] cuz she was fussy and whatever it was [11:31] new to her but every time I let her out [11:33] of the crate she was engaged with me I [11:36] brought everything that was good and [11:38] exciting and worth uh you know engaging [11:41] with I was always there I gave her great [11:44] information I was able to get her tired [11:46] out we could go for walks we could play [11:48] fet do stuff together but she didn't [11:50] have an opportunity to just ignore me [11:52] and wander around the yard which is how [11:54] I used to uh you know think she'd get [11:56] exercise or that's what she wanted to do [11:58] I was more focused but it's all because [12:00] of a good management plan what other [12:02] management tools do we insist that you [12:04] have at home uh to you know uh have a [12:08] good training have a a rather linear [12:10] straight line training plan with a new [12:12] dog owner yeah there's a couple things [12:14] in terms of like management restricting [12:16] Freedom obviously the crate is one thing [12:18] Ken just mentioned or often we'll use [12:21] like baby gates or things that don't [12:23] allow our dogs just to have free access [12:25] to parts of the house where it makes it [12:26] harder for us to watch them um K also [12:29] touched base uh touched on um using a [12:31] house line so a lot of people just think [12:33] management ohow a leash and you you take [12:36] use a leash you take your dog for a walk [12:38] but we actually also use a different [12:40] style of leash in the House for um you [12:43] know getting control of our dog more [12:44] easily if we need to follow through if [12:46] they don't listen or if they've picked [12:48] up something in the house that they're [12:49] not supposed to or whatever they're [12:51] jumping up and tugging on our house coat [12:53] we have a way of getting control of the [12:55] dog without actually having to grab them [12:58] um grab their physical body and and [13:00] scare them or or make them think that [13:02] we're having a play game I can use the [13:04] the line to immobilize my dog and you [13:06] know pull them up into a sit and tell [13:07] them hey settle that's enough I can take [13:09] control quickly and then I can praise [13:11] quickly once they settle I would say [13:13] that one of my favorite management tools [13:15] though is a long line and I love using a [13:18] long line um outside with my dog because [13:22] there's this awkward stage that you will [13:24] be in when you have a puppy you know [13:26] through puppy stages all the way through [13:28] to when your dog understands not to pull [13:30] on leash at all um you know it takes [13:32] quite a while to get from point A to [13:34] point B and what I prefer not to do when [13:37] my dogs are in training is practice you [13:39] know if I taking my dog out for a pee or [13:41] whatever it might be I don't want to [13:43] practice months and months and months of [13:44] my dog pulling and yanking me all over [13:46] my yard to find somewhere to go to the [13:47] bathroom or to do this or to do that so [13:50] um what I will do is I'll use my six [13:52] foot leash my my go for a walk leash for [13:55] training um where I started setting out [13:58] with a specific expectation of of making [14:00] sure my my dog is not pulling on that [14:02] leash because I'm working on it but if [14:04] we're just going out for a casual play [14:06] or to play tug or to play fetch or to go [14:08] to the bathroom I will take my dogs out [14:10] on a long line that's like about 20 feet [14:13] long and that way they have a little bit [14:15] of freedom to run around and move but [14:16] they're not off leash which means if [14:18] they decide to pick up sticks or not [14:21] come when they're called or what [14:22] whatever whatever it might be I still [14:25] have a leasher line attached but it's [14:27] much easier for me to keep tension on [14:29] that line when it's nice and long versus [14:32] having them practice pulling and pulling [14:34] and pulling and pulling on a six foot [14:35] leash because like I said it does take [14:37] time to get to that point so I love a [14:40] long line and my training bag you'll [14:41] always see a house line a regular leash [14:43] for training and you'll see a long line [14:45] my young dogs spend most of their life [14:49] on a long line uh while they're outside [14:52] until they're verbal control is reliable [14:55] and they can listen um to me without me [14:58] having to repeat myself or raise my [15:00] voice or anything like that um and not [15:03] until I get to that point which takes [15:04] months and months and months and months [15:06] uh do I uh give them offleash [15:08] opportunities yeah I love that I also [15:10] love honestly what this comes down to [15:13] and this is for uh puppies dogs any dog [15:15] uh you know whether it's in training or [15:17] not you want to give them the illusion [15:19] of Freedom you want to let them think [15:20] that like oh I I can make choices here [15:23] and then when they make the wrong choice [15:24] you can interrupt it by you know using [15:26] that house line or using that long line [15:29] or whatever but you know you're not [15:30] getting dragged around you're not [15:32] they're not on a tight leash the whole [15:33] time they think they're getting to make [15:35] choices that the beauty of this with [15:37] your management plan I mean let me know [15:39] do you have a management plan let me [15:40] know in the chat because um I you know [15:43] um and actually tell me if you have a [15:45] management plan and let me know what it [15:47] includes just like little points below [15:48] I'd love to see what you're using at [15:50] home right now for [15:51] management but the other side of things [15:54] when you're managing well kale talked [15:56] about this at the top of the show you [15:57] get these opportunities to celebrate the [16:00] wins when your dog when a when a a goose [16:03] flies by or something I don't know why I [16:05] say Goose it reminds me of one time we [16:06] were walking on the Mancan property like [16:08] on the training facility property and a [16:09] bunch of geese were flying were flying [16:11] by um and hippie shake like came to us [16:14] eventually um I I just thought it was an [16:16] interesting choice but those kind of [16:18] choices when your dog leaves that [16:19] distraction and comes to you you know [16:21] without running halfway uh down the [16:23] street you know when they make those [16:25] great choices you acknowledge them your [16:27] management plan reduces the risk or [16:29] eliminates the risk of your dog to get [16:31] themselves into trouble so we're talking [16:34] about house lines whether that's a puppy [16:37] or a little bit older dog you know we've [16:38] used house lines on dogs that weren't [16:40] necessarily poppies older than 16 weeks [16:42] if you have problem behaviors in the [16:43] house use a house line it can be a [16:46] simple we we sell house lines because we [16:48] we used to suggest that people go and [16:50] get like a dollar store leash and then [16:51] cut the loop cut the loop of the handle [16:53] off so that it doesn't get caught on [16:54] things but the thing we ran into is like [16:56] you know some pretty crappy Hardware [16:59] yeah some quality problems so we felt a [17:00] little uncomfortable so we made our own [17:02] so you know we have house lines [17:03] available or you can try the dollar [17:04] store version um but having a house line [17:07] on your dog gives you that little bit of [17:08] control so we've talked about house line [17:10] we've talked about a crate we've talked [17:11] about uh a long line which is a super [17:13] beneficial tool regardless of the dog's [17:15] age gives them the illusion of Freedom [17:17] allows you to keep them out of trouble [17:19] what are some other things we use for [17:21] management uh well there's lots of other [17:24] things that we will do and my brain goes [17:26] towards um like what we're getting the [17:30] dog to do so when our dogs are out of [17:33] the crate in in the house um they [17:36] usually have uh like an expectation or a [17:40] task and sometimes it's that we're [17:42] training and we're engaging with them [17:43] but if we want to give them free time we [17:46] never really give them full free time so [17:48] like if I have my dog um barricaded in [17:51] the kitchen with me for example and um I [17:53] might give them something to do I might [17:55] give them a chew to toy so that they're [17:57] a little bit busy um or I might train [18:00] the dog to do productive things while [18:03] I'm busy so for example one of the [18:04] things that we like to do um is train [18:07] our dogs that when we do things like [18:09] open the oven or we sit down to have [18:11] dinner we train our puppies to go and [18:14] lie on a bed oh I love that yeah I [18:15] didn't think of this yeah so again this [18:17] is like it sounds like an obedient skill [18:19] but it's it's a management technique and [18:21] so initially when five was a puppy every [18:24] time I knew that I had to get something [18:25] out of the oven I would take him to his [18:27] bed lure him with some tell him on your [18:29] bed reward him and then in the early [18:32] stages I would you know go to put my [18:33] hand on the oven door and if he held the [18:35] down I would go back and give him a [18:37] treat on his bed his bed wasn't too far [18:38] I'd throw a treat to his bed and then I [18:40] would open the oven and then go back and [18:42] reward him for staying on the bed if at [18:44] any time he left the bed to come over I [18:46] would stop what I would doing was doing [18:48] I would take the house line I would [18:50] guide him back to the bed have him lie [18:52] back down and then I would perceive what [18:53] I was going doing so I wouldn't let him [18:55] come off um and we played that game for [18:57] a few weeks and it got to the point [18:59] where I remember one morning one day I [19:00] was like Hey Canen watch this I would [19:02] literally go to touch the oven and [19:04] without even saying anything five would [19:06] go and run on his bed because he went [19:08] okay every time she does this I go on [19:10] the bed and I get rewards so it was a [19:12] nice positive way to control him and he [19:14] would lie on the bed like so proud of [19:17] himself um because you know he thought [19:19] he was doing something really good which [19:20] he was but I trained him to think that [19:23] way and not transferred to you know us [19:25] eating dinner so you know we don't just [19:28] let the dogs [19:29] do whatever they want we give them [19:30] something productive to do so that when [19:32] our dogs are old enough that we don't [19:34] necessarily want to have our dogs in the [19:36] crate all of the time our dogs are [19:38] really well-versed in what um decisions [19:41] they should make in different situations [19:43] and we try the best to do that try our [19:45] best to do that um through positive [19:47] reinforcement showing the dog we don't [19:49] wait wait until the dog magically lies [19:51] on the bed when I open the oven I've got [19:53] to train him to do that um so again [19:56] management isn't just about [19:59] um tools it's also about the decisions [20:03] you make about uh how your dog shows up [20:06] to certain situations 100% uh I know a [20:09] couple people have mentioned tools a [20:10] couple of our heart dog members bunny [20:11] crafts uses baby gates great idea [20:13] control the freedom that your dog has uh [20:16] Su uses Gentle Leader we I mean this we [20:18] haven't even started talking about gent [20:19] leash walking training but something [20:21] like a Gentle Leader is a good [20:22] management plan because it's like power [20:24] steering for dogs the other thing that [20:26] you mentioned that we don't talk about [20:27] enough uh uh controlling your dog's [20:30] freedom things like a dog door would [20:34] never use a dog door right and why so I [20:36] would never use a doggy door because I I [20:40] don't really want to give my dogs an [20:42] opportunity to choose on their own when [20:46] they get to go outside or not because if [20:49] the dog isn't um well Tred um it gives [20:54] them too much opportunity to go and um [20:58] satisfy themselves without going through [21:01] me first so I miss that opportunity to [21:04] be the one that they come to to say can [21:06] I go outside or because I control the [21:09] resources the other thing that um and I [21:11] know for some people they're going to be [21:12] like that sounds like a dictatorship [21:14] it's not about that it's about me being [21:16] able to use something that my dog likes [21:18] like going outside and teaching them if [21:21] you come and connect with me and you [21:23] come and sit you come and pay attention [21:24] then we'll go outside together it [21:26] elevates my status the second thing is [21:29] that if my dog has freedom to go in and [21:31] out whenever they want to that means [21:34] that I need to be paying attention all [21:36] of the time because if I'm not paying [21:37] attention and they've gone outside and [21:39] they're fence running against the [21:41] neighbors um with the neighbor's dog or [21:43] they're chasing squirrels or they're [21:45] digging a hole in the garden or whatever [21:47] they're doing and like I'm not paying [21:48] attention because they've gone out the [21:49] doggy door I'm literally setting my dog [21:52] up to have you know an easy way of of [21:55] having bad choices so um it's just not [21:58] something that we would do um we would [22:01] literally just take the dog outside [22:04] spend 5 or 10 minutes with them and then [22:05] bring them back inside whatever the [22:06] situation might be having a dog is work [22:09] and this is something that I had a [22:10] conversation with the other day it's it [22:13] surprises me this day and age people [22:16] have changed with dogs and I think it's [22:18] because of how we live our day-to-day [22:21] life everybody is looking for a quick [22:24] fix just use this tool your dog will be [22:26] trained just do this one thing and in [22:29] minutes your dog will be trained and [22:32] that's not true dogs do training a dog [22:35] takes a very long time to do it takes [22:38] weeks it takes repetition it takes good [22:40] timing it takes consistency all of those [22:42] things so you want to try and understand [22:45] that if you want a well-trained dog and [22:48] I'm hoping that you do since you're [22:50] sitting here listening to this live [22:51] stream that you're also willing to do [22:53] the work if you're not willing to put [22:55] the work [22:56] in go get a goldfish yeah that's the [22:59] reality of it right they're living [23:00] animals they they they deserve more than [23:03] that they're dogs you know you want them [23:04] you want to be able to take them to [23:05] those your uh nephew's soccer game you [23:08] want to be able to go play fetch with [23:09] them you want to go on walks it's [23:11] relaxing for you it's relaxing for them [23:13] it's rewarding for both of you you know [23:15] this is this is why you got your dog [23:17] it's going to be it's going to be work [23:19] uh but it's going to be worth it yeah um [23:21] vilified Freedom droping another Super [23:23] Chat this speaks to management maybe a [23:25] little bit kale soon we're going to have [23:26] chickens any recommendations on a dog [23:28] chickens he'll be a aboute one by then [23:30] well I don't have chickens so I'm just [23:33] kidding I me we don't have chickens but [23:35] I can talk about it course we did have [23:36] chickens beside the training facility [23:38] though uh oh yeah we still do actually [23:43] sometimes our neighbor has freerange [23:44] chickens and they freerange themselves [23:46] all the way over to the dog uh dog [23:48] facility that is true um so whether you [23:51] have chickens or cats or whatever it [23:53] might be um in order to have dogs dogs [23:58] and those types of animals live together [24:00] in harmony your dog has to have a great [24:02] recall and they have to have really good [24:04] verbal control um so you know when [24:07] you're working on this before the [24:09] chickens come make sure that you have a [24:12] solid recall that you could tell your [24:13] dog leave it you could call their name [24:15] you could use come you could say sit or [24:17] down and your dog will respond very [24:19] quickly because those are all tools um [24:21] or skills that you will need to use uh [24:23] around the chickens um and when the [24:26] chickens actually come you need to [24:27] manage the dog just kind like what we [24:28] were talking about have the long line on [24:30] you know keep your distance if your dog [24:32] is not able to listen to your commands [24:34] on the first try while they're on a line [24:37] 30 or 40 feet from the chickens you got [24:40] to know that if your dog's off leash [24:42] they're going towards the chickens so [24:44] you need to start with distance um you [24:46] need to get some reliability and then [24:48] you can slowly move closer to where the [24:50] chickens might be um in order to have [24:52] success but you've got to train put a [24:54] lot of value into some of those verbal [24:55] control exercises that I that I listed [24:58] there [24:58] yeah I saw I've seen a couple good [25:00] questions I've just pulled aside uh and [25:02] the third thing you need to consider it [25:05] one of the five symptoms signs you have [25:07] a leadership problem is do you [25:09] anticipate problems are you thinking [25:11] ahead okay I've made this Choice what [25:14] trouble might I get into with this young [25:16] dog just did that uh yeah absolutely [25:20] chickens are coming how do I deal with [25:21] it I love it exactly yeah are you [25:23] anticipating problems this is this is [25:25] going to help you make better [25:27] supervision choice better management [25:29] decisions I know that um so Grace [25:32] Fleming uh said great question so what [25:34] are some good chew toys to engage my [25:36] puppy on her bed while I'm eating dinner [25:38] okay I love that the fact that you are [25:40] thinking ahead and and wondering like [25:41] what are the chew toys to use uh maybe [25:44] more importantly though do you [25:46] anticipate the puppy's going to be [25:47] successful the young dog's going to be [25:48] successful while you're eating dinner so [25:50] where what I'm getting to and what kale [25:52] sort of eluded to but didn't state is [25:55] that when you're working on these skills [25:56] at first you're not actually getting e [25:58] dinner you know you're going to set [25:59] things up so that you know your your [26:01] dinner's ready I mean you could even [26:03] have your dinner out maybe you can get a [26:04] bite or two in but the your focus is on [26:07] training so when you set up these examp [26:09] or these exercises you're going to be [26:11] working on having your puppies stay on [26:13] their bed remain on their bed and you're [26:15] going to be rewarding them you're going [26:16] to be doing training without worrying [26:18] about getting into dinner at at some [26:20] point you're going to get to the point [26:21] where you put your hand on the uh oven [26:23] handle and your puppy goes and lies down [26:24] and they're fat they're just totally [26:26] comfortable there that's what they're [26:27] doing but what in the beginning you're [26:29] anticipating the fact that this dog [26:31] doesn't understand yet that my puppy [26:32] doesn't quite get it so this is a [26:35] training moment then when you've worked [26:36] on this for a few minutes you know [26:38] you've had a short training session [26:40] depending on how much um endurance you [26:41] know your puppy has or your willingness [26:44] to work your dog has you're going to end [26:46] that exercise put your puppy in their [26:48] kennel or some place that they're safe [26:50] and they're not going to get into [26:50] trouble and then you're going to have [26:52] your dinner uh this is how you're how [26:55] you're anticipating problems maybe you [26:57] have a problem with you know I don't [26:59] know um barking at uh people or [27:02] something are you anticipating people on [27:04] your walk are you changing your time of [27:06] day that you're walking so that there's [27:07] less CH likelihood to run into people [27:09] are you changing the location that [27:11] you're walking are you anticipating [27:13] problems good leaders know exactly what [27:16] their dog is capable of or at least have [27:18] a good sense of what they're capable of [27:21] and sure they're going to work through [27:23] these things it's going to take some [27:24] work and you're going to be you know [27:26] working through some challenges but not [27:28] putting them in a situation where you're [27:29] they're definitely going to lose you [27:32] want to avoid those kinds of situations [27:34] great leaders can coach and we've [27:36] probably all if you've done any sports [27:38] or had a You music teacher somebody Who [27:41] You're not you know that coach that just [27:43] drew the most out of their students or [27:45] or you know their players or whatever [27:47] they're not about being an authoritarian [27:49] dictator they know how to make you work [27:51] a little bit harder they figure out what [27:53] drives you maybe for your dog it's food [27:56] maybe it's play Maybe It's you know time [27:58] out whatever doing doing something [28:00] outside whatever that thing is you're [28:01] going to use that to your advantage to [28:03] get a little bit more out of your dog [28:04] and when they get those wins you make a [28:06] big deal out of them but you need to to [28:09] do that to to be you know put your dog [28:11] in the right level of distraction in the [28:13] right for the right amount of time [28:15] you're going to have to anticipate these [28:17] problems and that's a good thing great [28:19] leaders do and that's that's that's an [28:20] important thing about your leadership [28:21] which a lot of people sort of think like [28:23] well you know it's probably handled [28:24] under the management section but I can [28:26] think of lots of times here's a great [28:28] one somebody comes to the door or uh [28:31] okay how about this we have a friend [28:33] coming over uh to our house and I know [28:36] that every time someone knocks on the [28:38] door or new comes in the house the dog [28:39] goes absolutely Bonkers what am I going [28:41] to do to anticipate problems to be a [28:43] great later so if you know something's [28:46] coming that's the best thing because [28:48] then you can do something about it if [28:49] you know a behavior is going to happen [28:51] that's really uh really the best bet um [28:55] in Ken's specific question if you have a [28:58] dog that does Go Bananas when people [29:00] come to the door uh especially if it's [29:01] somebody that that you do know have them [29:03] text you when they're in the driveway to [29:05] say like hey I'm here and then you have [29:07] um you know a couple options uh there [29:10] for you number one you could um not [29:13] allow the dog to rehearse the behavior [29:15] by maybe putting them in their crate [29:17] like up in the bedroom or wherever it is [29:20] away from where the view and the energy [29:23] of the front door might be so that [29:25] they're just not rehearsing that let [29:28] your friend come in you know spend a [29:30] half hour just sort of chilling out when [29:32] sort of the excitement of a new person [29:34] comes coming in the house goes uh it [29:36] over then go and get your dog out on [29:39] leash and um you know work through the [29:41] dog being calm at that point um or maybe [29:45] it's a situation where you do want to do [29:46] a little dog training at the same time [29:48] so they're in the driveway and um you [29:50] know what do you do with your dog I [29:52] personally would put my dog on a leash [29:55] i' probably get some high value rewards [29:57] with me whether it be toy or treats um [30:00] and then I really love to use um like [30:02] threshold training in this situation so [30:05] um we will do a couple things number one [30:06] we'll have the dog wait on a bed so have [30:08] a place that the dog will hold position [30:10] or in our house we have like um like a [30:13] thresold uh um our kitchen goes a couple [30:16] steps down to our sun room where people [30:18] would come in so when people people come [30:20] to the door our dogs are not allowed to [30:23] step foot into the sun room they have to [30:25] keep with their paws up on the kitchen [30:27] and if one paw com down we will [30:29] encourage them to go back up and we [30:30] train them to do that by one of us [30:32] standing in the kitchen with the dog on [30:34] leash and reward the dog for being you [30:37] know in that position as somebody comes [30:38] in the house and of course they're when [30:40] they're young and they don't know any [30:41] better they're over excited they try to [30:44] go and jump on the person that's on the [30:46] door but I'm ready because I I know it's [30:48] going to happen so my leash is on I can [30:50] stop the dog with the leash I can [30:51] encourage the dog to come back I can ask [30:53] them to sit I can move them further away [30:55] to lessen the temptation of going to [30:58] that person I can work through it but [31:00] what a lot of people do is they don't [31:01] even know where the dog is they open the [31:03] door dog flies out of nowhere jumps all [31:05] over the person for you know good 30 [31:07] seconds and then you're like oh sorry [31:09] you know he he's really bad or blah blah [31:11] blah blah blah well you're really bad [31:13] because you're just letting the dog just [31:17] rehearse that behavior so if you can get [31:19] ahead of the storm and you can train [31:21] through it um dogs are so smart when [31:23] they have good information and if you [31:25] make you know lying on a bed or [31:28] um you know staying behind a threshold [31:30] fun because they get reinforced for [31:32] doing that um and that's just as [31:34] enjoyable as jumping on someone you will [31:36] fix your problem um vilify Freedom [31:39] dropped another Super Chat saying hey [31:41] thank you all uh question and then [31:43] vilified Freedom became a heart dog [31:45] supporter Oh yay very cool so thank you [31:47] for joining usting the Chanel asking [31:49] your questions um there was something [31:52] there uh that I just lost that I thought [31:53] was really important oh I hope it comes [31:55] back to me uh oh so that was a very [31:58] specific example uh we gave to an [32:00] imaginary situation imagine you had [32:02] access to dog training information that [32:04] was that specific for your problems yeah [32:07] for all of your problems uh all week [32:09] long in fact we can offer that to you [32:11] whether it's our in-person training and [32:13] uh flambro Ontario or our online [32:15] programs talk really quickly about what [32:17] our puppy Essentials programs look like [32:19] for both yeah so um for puppy Essentials [32:21] is for puppies that are under 5 months [32:23] if you have a dog that's over 5 months [32:25] then you'd be looking at our life skills [32:26] program to sort of different contents of [32:29] um of uh [32:32] formats um so in terms of the programs [32:36] um we work on all kinds of life skills [32:40] puppy Essentials is really based towards [32:41] um setting your dog up for success we're [32:44] working with puppies at a young age [32:45] before they developed a lot of problems [32:47] so we're really helping you get started [32:49] on the right foot so we can mold and [32:50] shape your your journey with your dog to [32:52] be a less frustrating one um and what's [32:55] really great about uh both programs is [32:58] the level of support and coaching that [33:00] you get from our professional trainers [33:02] Ken and I are just two of about 40 [33:05] instructors that uh that work for McAn [33:07] dogs that have a vast amount of um [33:11] experience and um you know one thing [33:14] that I always like to say is you know a [33:15] lot of you probably come to us because [33:16] you've seen our YouTube videos uh online [33:19] and we give great information great [33:21] videos uh on YouTube for sure but um the [33:24] YouTube videos are like a snippet into [33:27] the [33:28] that we actually do class because it's a [33:31] very different experience when I'm [33:32] working with you every single week and I [33:34] know you and your dogs I can give you [33:36] specific feedback um you know when this [33:39] happens you're not in your living room [33:41] by yourself trying to figure it out [33:43] we're there to say hey well when this [33:45] happens you need to do XYZ and when that [33:47] happens you need to do XYZ it's a very [33:49] very different experience um it's also [33:51] very progressional so we actually show [33:53] you exactly where to start how to build [33:55] um build progressions every single week [33:58] so that it just sort of makes a lot more [34:00] sense I'm going to let you guys in on [34:01] something that uh you may or may not [34:03] know you're going to see some of the [34:05] names in blue in in the chat uh you'll [34:06] see instructor Aaron you'll see uh Sam [34:09] crenchaw uh you'll also see instructor [34:11] Robbie instructor Robbie was my first [34:13] life skills one instructor she's the [34:15] person the the very first instructor [34:17] that I ever had at Mand dogs which is [34:19] very cool and strangely enough uh Sam [34:21] crenchaw was the janitor at my grade [34:24] school and if you take online puppy [34:26] Essentials and life skills you can [34:27] Robbie will be your instructor yeah yeah [34:30] which is very cool um but you know the [34:32] reality is you there are lots of [34:34] questions that you'll have throughout [34:35] the course of your dog training I I've [34:37] been there I know what it's like I know [34:39] when you're you think to yourself like [34:41] okay I think I understand everything but [34:43] this one problem I can't stop the [34:44] jumping up or whatever the thing is you [34:47] talked briefly earlier on and this comes [34:49] to anticipating problems but preparing [34:52] to be ready to do something if you're [34:54] going to be a leader you have to be able [34:56] to redirect your dog [34:58] help them to get out of the situation [35:00] cuz they'll just get locked in sometimes [35:02] whether that's pulling or whatever you [35:04] know how long should you be waiting to [35:06] redirect a dog when they're doing the [35:07] wrong [35:08] thing no amount of time immediate right [35:11] immediate um and I think that that's uh [35:15] something that people get hung up on [35:17] sometimes they're like well I'm doing [35:18] exactly what you say and when you watch [35:20] them do it they are taking 5 10 30 [35:23] seconds to make a reaction and that's [35:25] why it's not working so dogs really need [35:28] immediate information whether that's [35:31] positive or negative feedback they need [35:32] it right away um because dogs really [35:35] think and learn in the moment and um you [35:39] know they will repeat things that are [35:41] rewarding to them and sometimes things [35:44] that are rewarding to them are not the [35:45] thing that you want them to do so to [35:48] give you an example of that when you're [35:49] walking your dog on the street and your [35:51] dog starts barking at another dog that's [35:54] actually a self-rewarding behavior for a [35:56] dog because they get a lot of energy and [35:59] um and adrenaline in their body and [36:01] maybe they bark at that dog and when [36:03] they do the other dog reacts and backs [36:05] off and now your dog says woo I know [36:07] exactly how to control the neighborhood [36:09] um and you know and then it's a [36:11] self-rewarding behavior so those types [36:14] of things are really hard for people the [36:17] average person to fix because they allow [36:19] that behavior to happen for a long time [36:22] um you know in the moment several [36:25] minutes in the moment then and then you [36:27] times that by walking the dog a couple [36:29] day a couple times a day you know seven [36:32] days a week months years all those [36:34] things of rehearsal think about how [36:35] ingrained looking at a dog and barking [36:38] at them or whatever it might be is in a [36:40] dog so we want you to try and make sure [36:42] that you're um addressing things [36:45] immediately uh before things snowball [36:48] into a much bigger Pro problem and like [36:50] doing something about it the amount of [36:51] people what do you do about yeah like [36:53] what you know uh the amount of people [36:55] that will repeat over and over again get [36:57] out a piece of food do I don't care [37:00] exactly like you need to interrupt the [37:02] behavior whether that's using your leash [37:04] redirecting you know doing distance [37:06] between you and the distraction [37:08] absolutely and you know this is where [37:10] your leadership crumbles is when you are [37:13] in a situation where you're calling your [37:15] dog's name and you've done it so much [37:17] that they just don't care anymore it has [37:20] zero value well then you know geez I'm [37:22] going to have to get that house line or [37:24] a long line or a leash or something back [37:26] on that dog and we're going to have to [37:27] work on this you know this is something [37:28] that we're going to have to fix because [37:31] you know giving your dog the opportunity [37:33] to blow you off too many times let's say [37:35] you're at the park and your dog's just [37:36] not coming when called because this is [37:38] what I did you know you and it's not [37:40] working eventually you figure out well [37:42] if I shake the cookie bag or if I hold [37:44] up the Frisbee and shake it around [37:45] eventually they're going to come to me [37:46] and somehow you think you got a win that [37:48] is not a win your dog is training you at [37:50] that point so understanding that as you [37:53] are supervising all as much as possible [37:56] now that you you are uh have a good [37:58] management plan you're anticipating the [38:00] problems when you do have a problem [38:03] you're ready to do something about it so [38:05] do something about it a lot of that [38:08] comes back to sort of Full Circle back [38:09] to the training you're interrupting [38:12] redirecting these behaviors that you [38:13] don't like you identify the problems the [38:16] the holes in your training the problems [38:17] that your dog may have the distractions [38:20] that they find [38:21] irresistible training are do you have a [38:24] training plan when a problem comes up is [38:26] is one of the the most important parts [38:28] of leadership again we talked a little [38:29] bit about maybe your coach you know you [38:32] had for some sport or some teacher a [38:34] music teacher or something that really [38:36] um motivated you got you excited about [38:39] work this is what we need to do with [38:41] your dog you need to get them excited [38:43] about work let's talk about what a [38:45] training plan that would look like you [38:47] know uh a good leadership training plan [38:50] and part of that is going to be [38:52] understanding what the steps are you [38:54] know what the what the progressions are [38:55] which is part of what we talk about in [38:57] online in inperson programs but um we [39:00] need to talk a little bit about what [39:02] training looks like for good [39:03] leaders um I'm distracted by the fact [39:06] that I can tell funky has to go outside [39:09] okay so do you want me to let her [39:11] outside or do you want me to answer the [39:12] question well you answer the question [39:13] I'll I can go let her outside okay okay [39:15] uh Ken was teeing me up in a way that I [39:18] totally did not understand what he's [39:19] wanting me to say so I'm just going to [39:21] go in my own [39:22] Direction sometimes he does that when [39:24] you live stream with someone they they [39:27] you up wanting you to go in a Direction [39:29] but uh he confused me on that one so I'm [39:31] not really sure what he was wanting me [39:32] to say there um but you know having um [39:36] having a specific training plan is going [39:38] to be really important and sometimes [39:40] what that means is not necessarily um [39:43] having like a certain amount of time [39:45] during the day that you're like going to [39:46] train your dog it means that you [39:48] understand how to build in your training [39:51] with your dog through everything you're [39:53] doing with them already or taking [39:55] opportunities like you know what you let [39:57] your dog out in the morning versus the [39:59] time that you do that versus the time [40:00] that you leave for work what does that [40:03] what does that situation look like with [40:05] your dog um because I think sometimes [40:08] people think oh well I don't have time [40:09] to do all this training like this sounds [40:11] like so daunting and so overwhelming um [40:13] but you can actually take um take [40:16] everyday situations and work your [40:19] training into it that sort of gives you [40:21] a natural management plan you know when [40:23] I take my dog out for you know their [40:25] very first bathroom break or potty break [40:27] break in the morning I have so much [40:29] opportunity to um get some training in [40:33] whether it's making my dog sit at the [40:34] door or you know maybe when they go to [40:36] the washroom I I do a couple responses [40:39] to name after or work on them not [40:41] pulling on the leash or whatever it [40:43] might be I might only be outside for 5 [40:45] or 10 minutes because I've got to go to [40:47] work but I'm not just out mindlessly [40:49] letting my dog drag me around and [40:51] missing an opportunity to to get some [40:53] good information in there so you kind of [40:55] have to look at your whole day and think [40:56] about how how you can build a management [40:59] plan in that doesn't allow your dog to [41:01] kind of go off and do their own thing [41:03] and then you miss out on really valuable [41:06] training opportunities yeah did you talk [41:08] about um natural uh training [41:11] opportunities kind of yeah so that [41:13] that's so key because this is the this [41:15] is the bridge between you know your [41:17] structured obedience you know formal [41:19] stuff and real life you know letting [41:22] having your dog sit and wait before you [41:24] head out the door having them sit and [41:26] wait or what it Li down away it doesn't [41:27] matter as you put their food down these [41:30] little leadership wins are exactly how [41:32] you become a great leader having [41:35] insisting that they don't jump up on the [41:37] couch unless they're invited up on the [41:39] couch and knowing that if you start to [41:41] have trouble maybe it's in like their [41:42] General Behavior or if you know they you [41:44] have a nipping and biting problem or you [41:46] know they won't get off when you ask [41:47] them a good leader knows that hm I [41:49] probably shouldn't give them this [41:51] opportunity again until we work on this [41:53] a little bit I can give you a really [41:55] simple one too sit means sit until you [41:58] tell them to get up this is another one [42:00] that that drives me bananas sometimes [42:02] people ask their dogs to sit and lots of [42:05] dogs will sit until the dog doesn't feel [42:07] like sitting anymore and then they get [42:09] up and the person says Hey sit they do [42:11] the old snap and point dog gets up hey [42:13] sit and they snap and point well the dog [42:16] doesn't give two Hoots about you in that [42:18] situation they're just doing their own [42:20] thing versus a leader who the dog gets [42:23] up and you'd say oops and you'd place [42:24] the dog back and you'd make them hold [42:27] sit until you went okay now you can get [42:29] up and the dog goes oh I'm actually [42:31] supposed to wait for you to say it okay [42:34] um versus me repeating myself or having [42:36] to get more angry with my tone of voice [42:38] I can actually have great great [42:40] leadership and now if my dog knows how [42:42] to hold a sit until I release them well [42:44] now I have a tool to use when I'm on the [42:46] street around distractions I have a tool [42:48] to use when you know somebody comes to [42:50] the door and my dog gets too overwhelmed [42:52] because my dog has a really good [42:54] understanding to sit until I release [42:56] them um that's a leadership that's a [42:59] leadership exercise right there it's so [43:00] simple but the amount of people that [43:02] just ask their dog 5 million times and [43:05] they don't follow through and the dog [43:07] sits and then the dog lies down and [43:09] they're like oh well well they're [43:10] technically just still staying there [43:12] let's raise our expectations a little [43:14] bit here and um have some follow through [43:16] because that completely changes how your [43:19] dog views you and how they listen to you [43:21] absolutely and you know it's it reminds [43:24] me of uh situations where you know the [43:27] dog doesn't quite the dog knows how to [43:30] sit but they don't know they need to [43:32] remain in the sit and it's that's the [43:34] valuable win and it's not like you don't [43:35] know the rules of a and you're not mad [43:37] about it you're not like oh the damn dog [43:39] is doesn't remain in a Sit you [43:41] understand that like huh this is [43:43] something we're going to have to work on [43:44] I'm going to have to you know make them [43:46] sit uh you know when I'm doing something [43:48] distracting and then reward them for [43:50] that it's the understanding as as a as a [43:52] leader that like okay we have something [43:53] to work on here uh but insisting that [43:56] they do the thing you asked of them [43:58] that's going to be so important whether [43:59] it's response to name walking on leash [44:01] uh coming when called whatever the thing [44:04] is you have expectations remember you're [44:06] a leader you have expectations and [44:08] you're going to help them build them up [44:10] bit by bit so that you can get them [44:11] there because that's exactly how you're [44:13] going to get to the dog that you you [44:14] thought of or you wanted when you got a [44:16] dog you know I I just this is the [44:19] realization that I had I just didn't get [44:21] it I and I honestly I really set the bar [44:23] really low I thought like uh you know [44:25] maybe she just doesn't want to listen or [44:27] maybe she just you know she'd rather [44:29] pull out a she's not capable or she's [44:31] not capable absolutely cuz I had excuses [44:33] about breed oh I'll wait till Labs [44:36] mature late so I'll wait till there [44:37] she's three and maybe it'll get better I [44:40] don't I didn't have to I wasted so much [44:42] time and uh I mean you know that time is [44:45] really valuable I wasted so much time [44:48] making the wrong choices and that I wish [44:51] and I see these students who come [44:52] through these adorable little black lab [44:53] puppies now and I'm I'm so envious of [44:56] them but um um you know they're getting [44:57] the dog started off on the right foot [44:59] and so can you by making great [45:01] leadership decisions in your dog [45:03] training because you are supervising [45:06] enough you have a great management plan [45:07] you're anticipating the problems you're [45:09] really thinking about redirection as [45:12] it's you know uh when it's needed and [45:14] you understand that when you have [45:17] problems there's training that needs to [45:19] be done and you're willing to do it it's [45:21] going to it can be challenging it can be [45:22] frustrating but boy oh boy is it worth [45:24] it in the end want to say huge thank you [45:27] to all of you for joining us here [45:29] tonight we have a video coming

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,, Part 341/429,~Ken === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] what if I told you that the majority of [00:01] dog owners out there are free feeding [00:03] their dog and also the majority of dog [00:06] owners don't even know what free feeding [00:08] is this free feed ought to get me a lot [00:10] of votes and actually how detrimental [00:13] that can be to your dog's training to [00:15] your relationship with your dog and [00:16] actually to your dog's overall health so [00:18] today I'm going to talk to you about [00:20] exactly what free feeding is all of the [00:22] risks that go along with it and what you [00:24] should be doing instead I'm kale mccan [00:26] welcome back to McAn [00:28] dogs [00:31] so what is free feeding free feeding [00:33] essentially is when you have a certain [00:35] amount of food you put it down in your [00:37] dog's bowl and you let your dog get to [00:39] it or eat it graze uh anytime they want [00:42] to throughout the day so it's basically [00:44] the dog's Choice as to when they eat or [00:47] they don't eat and unfortunately there's [00:49] a a lot of risks or a lot of um uh cons [00:53] to feeding your dog this way uh in my [00:56] opinion one of the most important uh [00:58] things that that this will cause is it [01:01] teaches your dog that food really isn't [01:04] that valuable because it's something [01:05] that they can have sort of any time that [01:07] they want it and in our methods of [01:09] training we love to utilize food to [01:12] motivate the dog to work and if the [01:14] dog's not really that interested in food [01:15] because they can just kind of get it [01:17] whatever they want to it makes it really [01:19] really difficult to use food as a [01:21] motivator in order to get your dog to [01:23] learn new things or get excited about [01:25] training with you so that's one thing [01:27] that opens a whole other trickle effect [01:30] into the idea of leadership another [01:32] thing that really can be impactful for [01:34] dogs is knowing that the value of food [01:37] that that resource that they should love [01:39] so much comes from me if the bowl is [01:42] down on the ground and the dog just gets [01:44] to have access to it whenever they want [01:46] to it doesn't make me as the um leader [01:49] or you know as their owner or whoever [01:51] who however you want to look at it it [01:53] doesn't make me as valuable to them so [01:56] that can be a pretty um unfortunate [01:59] opportunity that we're missing in our [02:01] dog's relationship especially in the [02:02] early stages when they're young and [02:04] we're developing and we're we're we're [02:06] creating a bit of a a training journey [02:07] together the other thing that uh can be [02:10] a huge risk is watching um my dog eat or [02:15] understanding their schedules in terms [02:16] of when they eat when they go to the [02:18] bathroom when they're hungry all of that [02:19] stuff I will learn a little bit about my [02:22] dogs um schedule when that happens and [02:25] if I have a dog that eats regularly um [02:28] that's pretty motivated by food and all [02:31] of the sudden we wake up one morning and [02:33] my dog doesn't want to eat food that [02:36] will be a huge red flag to me to say hm [02:39] something might be off actually I can [02:41] use this dog as a bit of an example this [02:43] is beine she's my seven-year-old bordoli [02:46] and um she actually has lme disease and [02:49] one of the ways that I was able to tell [02:51] that she had Lyme disease is because her [02:53] schedule changed all of the sudden some [02:55] of the things that she started to do [02:57] were very different her appetite changed [03:00] a little bit her energy changed a little [03:02] bit because I'm so aware of her schedule [03:04] because I'm so in control of her [03:06] schedule the second something changes it [03:08] alerts me immediately especially with [03:10] the food thing um does she have a [03:12] blockage has she eaten something that [03:13] she's not supposed to is she sick in [03:15] some way um you know when is she going [03:18] to go to the bathroom versus when she [03:20] eats I'm able to care for her and um you [03:23] know I was able to get her into the Vet [03:25] very very quickly we were able to to [03:27] determine a problem very quickly all all [03:30] because of the change in her schedule um [03:32] so the health aspect is really helpful [03:34] as well not to mention um you know the [03:37] weight a lot of dogs that are freef fed [03:39] typically are overweight because we [03:41] don't necessarily have control over how [03:43] much they're eating some people just [03:45] throw a you know whatever amount of food [03:47] into the bowl and let their dog eat not [03:49] that you need to be a kibble counter I [03:51] am a proud kibble counter you go girl I [03:54] know exactly how much my dogs are eating [03:56] at every single meal and I'm constantly [03:58] adjusting it um to make sure that [04:00] they're at the proper weight but also by [04:02] meal feeding versus free feeding I know [04:05] exactly how much they're getting um at [04:07] what time and that sets my schedule up [04:09] for the rest of the day I want to break [04:11] down the idea of leadership and [04:13] relationship versus free feeding or meal [04:15] feeding your dog because to the average [04:17] person those two things seem very [04:19] unrelated now as I mentioned we use food [04:22] as a motivator and one of the things [04:24] that we'll often see with our students [04:26] is that it can be really difficult to [04:27] teach the dog new things or to get their [04:30] attention away from distractions or um [04:33] help them to be more confident in [04:34] situations where they're nervous if we [04:36] can't use food as the motivator to go if [04:39] the dog's not really interested in the [04:40] food um you know we we then have to lend [04:43] oursel to using other methods to get our [04:45] dogs to to listen and in the early [04:48] stages we really want to build on [04:50] motivation we want to get the dog happy [04:52] and excited to listen to us um also if [04:55] I'm going to be practicing around [04:57] distractions if I'm taking my dog out [04:58] for a walk if I'm I want a teacher to [05:00] come when she's called and I'm in a yard [05:02] with squirrels and birds and people [05:04] going by if I don't have something that [05:07] she wants in order to motivate her to [05:08] listen to me um to combat those [05:11] distractions my life is going to be a [05:13] lot more challenging now that leads into [05:16] the leadership piece one of the things [05:17] that makes a good leader is somebody [05:20] who's able to actually affect change [05:22] with their dog in the moment um you know [05:25] I've seen some dogs who lack motivation [05:27] of food because they're freef fed or [05:29] number of reasons and you know the [05:31] person will go to show them the food and [05:34] to get them to do something and the dog [05:35] will sort of look at them and the food [05:36] and say talk to the hand you're not [05:38] really worth my time um and the reason [05:41] why that happens is because the dog [05:42] really hasn't really hasn't really [05:44] learned that the food is something that [05:47] is worth um working for therefore you're [05:51] worth working for those things sort of [05:53] go together you know when I'm training [05:55] my dog initially before we have a [05:57] relationship before we have a mutual [05:59] respect [06:00] um the only thing I can get her to do to [06:02] listen to me is use something that she [06:04] wants and an easy thing could be toys [06:06] and a really easy thing could be food [06:08] and if I have a dog that's really not [06:10] that interested in food it makes my life [06:12] so much more challenging so let's talk [06:14] about a dog that's currently freef fed [06:16] that you're looking to either change [06:18] over to meal feeding or perhaps you're [06:20] trying to build a little bit more [06:21] motivation for food uh first things [06:24] first think about what kind of schedule [06:25] you want to feed your dog on and um I [06:28] will say this first before I get into [06:30] anything deeper any Healthy dog will [06:33] never go without eating so often when [06:36] you're trying to change a dog from free [06:38] free feeding to meal feeding they're not [06:40] used to having um a restrictive time in [06:42] order for them to eat their meals [06:44] they're used to you putting the food [06:46] down they sort of see it and say h okay [06:47] I'll get to it when I feel like it so it [06:50] would not be strange for you to put the [06:51] food down and you know give your dog 15 [06:53] 20 minutes to eat your dog not touch the [06:55] meal at all and this is where it gets a [06:57] little bit difficult for the average [06:59] person because we feel bad for the dog [07:01] we certainly wouldn't want them to go [07:02] hungry and a lot of people go oh well [07:04] they haven't really eaten anything I'm [07:06] just going to leave it out for them or [07:07] you pick it up and you put it down you [07:09] know 15 20 minutes later big mistake [07:11] what I would actually recommend you do [07:13] is pick it up and not put it back down [07:15] until the next meal time now if your [07:17] dog's on the younger age still getting [07:19] three meals a day then of course you can [07:21] put it back down at lunchtime if you [07:22] have a bit of an older dog so I would [07:25] say you know 60 four four months and [07:27] older basically um then I would wait [07:29] till dinner to put the the food down and [07:32] uh typically in my experience when you [07:34] do this when you put the food down your [07:35] dog's hungry now because they haven't [07:37] had much to eat throughout the day and [07:39] they're going to eat um very quickly now [07:42] there are some dogs that again are just [07:45] not that crazy into food you'll put the [07:47] dinner down and they're like uh not [07:49] really interested in that case I would [07:51] pick the food up after about 20 minutes [07:53] and I might then put it down a little [07:54] bit again um later in the evening maybe [07:57] a half hour hour later and let them have [07:59] another try um and if they don't eat I [08:01] would just pick the food up and and be [08:03] done with it if a dog goes a whole day [08:05] without eating that would be very [08:07] unusual I'm not going to say that it [08:09] doesn't happen but it would be very [08:10] unusual typically by the morning the [08:12] next day when you put the food down [08:13] you're good to go and you can get [08:14] yourself on a on a bit of a better [08:16] schedule um the other thing you want to [08:19] be careful about when you're trying to [08:20] change a dog from free feeding to meal [08:22] feeding is what is your dog eating [08:24] between meals you know are they getting [08:26] a lot of extra treats are people you [08:28] know [08:30] cutting up food and then you know [08:31] dropping it down for the dog are they [08:33] getting lots of biscuits for coming in [08:34] from outside you know that type of thing [08:36] as well you want to try and stop with [08:38] the extra food for a little bit until [08:39] you can get your dog back on the right [08:41] track but as I said a healthy dog is not [08:43] going to go with out without eating um [08:46] you know for more than 24 hours that [08:47] would be very very strange now there's [08:49] only so much I can cover in a YouTube [08:51] video and that's why we developed an [08:53] entire program dedicated to puppy [08:56] training called Puppy Essentials we [08:57] offer it both in person and online now [09:00] of course we cover a lot of the basics [09:02] like teaching your dog basic obedience [09:04] skills responding to their name all of [09:06] that kind of stuff but we might not [09:07] realize is we also talk a lot about the [09:09] big picture stuff too um things like how [09:12] to utilize food in your training to [09:14] build more focus and motivation and to [09:17] help you be a stronger leader for your [09:18] puppy we talk about using a house line [09:21] in order to control your dog and all the [09:23] in betweeny times in the house when you [09:25] know life is crazy you have lots of [09:27] things on the go how do you raise a [09:29] puppy successfully and do it all if [09:31] you're interested about our puppy [09:33] Essentials program check out the link in [09:34] the description below another tip if [09:36] you're trying to change your dog to free [09:38] feeding to meal feeding or perhaps [09:40] you're just trying to create a a a [09:41] better schedule more regular schedule [09:43] for your dog I would also avoid adding [09:46] different Toppers to your dog's food [09:48] sometimes in an effort to get our dogs [09:50] to eat we want to add things to the food [09:52] to make it a little bit more exciting [09:54] and um I've seen many situations where [09:56] the dogs will just leave the kibble and [09:58] wait for something more exciting to be [09:59] put on top and it actually works against [10:02] you rather than for you um you know you [10:05] need to consider what food you're giving [10:06] your dog you know not every food is [10:08] suitable for every breed of dog you know [10:11] sometimes changing the brand can be [10:12] helpful uh but often um if the dog just [10:16] learns that if they wait it out they're [10:17] going to get treats or they're going to [10:18] get the gravy on top or the yogurt or [10:20] whatever you're doing uh some dogs will [10:22] will learn to do that so you sort of [10:24] need to be strict for a couple days get [10:26] everything on the right track and then [10:27] once you get your dog on a more healthy [10:29] regular eating schedule if you want to [10:31] add a couple things to their food here [10:32] and there as an extra little treat have [10:34] add her that's no problem at all but in [10:36] the early stages I would suggest you [10:39] avoid doing that in order to get your [10:40] dog to eat you know if you're going a [10:42] while and the dog is not interested in [10:44] the food that you're um offering them [10:46] there could be other things that uh that [10:49] are at stake here or that are affecting [10:51] the dog um and then maybe a conversation [10:53] with the vet would be your next best [10:55] step we've talked a lot about the risks [10:57] of free feeding your dogs but actually [10:59] want to leave you with thinking more [11:01] about the benefits of meal feeding your [11:03] dog you know what if I told you that [11:06] meal feeding your dog would help you [11:08] with teaching your dog to have a greater [11:10] desire for their crate um for example if [11:12] I go to feed my dog at their meal part [11:15] of my dog's meal or all of my dog's meal [11:18] every single day when they're young I [11:19] feed my dog in their crate you know I [11:22] get to the point where my dogs are so [11:24] excited about getting their meals that [11:25] when the kibble hits the bowl they race [11:28] to their crate even as like a 13 14 week [11:30] old puppy they race to their crate and [11:32] they wait you know patiently inside for [11:34] me to bring their bowl over because [11:36] they're excited about feed time and I'm [11:37] training the dog to think going in their [11:39] crate is a wonderful positive situation [11:42] you know also if I'm trying to improve [11:45] training time rather than leaving the [11:47] food out for them whenever they want it [11:49] Meal Time can be a little bit about [11:51] training together I can take half of [11:53] their meal and spend five or 10 minutes [11:55] working on walking on a loose leash [11:57] maybe some fun tricks with with my dog [12:00] uh maybe a little bit of socialization [12:02] um and then I can you know put the rest [12:04] in their bowl and let them eat in their [12:05] eat it in their crate or maybe I put the [12:07] rest of their food and put it into a [12:09] Ziploc bag with some extra goodies and [12:11] use it for training throughout the day [12:12] so I can take that meal time and I can [12:15] use it towards building a little bit [12:17] more focus and attention from my dog [12:19] because I'm banking on a time where my [12:22] dog is hungry another tip that we often [12:24] tell people if they're trying to get a [12:26] little bit more focus and attention from [12:28] your dog feed eat your dog train your [12:30] dog on the hard things when they're [12:32] hungry if they're a freef Fed dog when [12:35] are they hungry you would have no idea [12:38] you know I know that when it's around [12:40] like between 5 and 600 p.

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,, Part 355/429,~Ken #rescuedog #mccanndogs === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] when I get a rescue dog I want to make [00:02] sure that the fit is going to be right [00:04] and we're set up for Success because I'm [00:06] going to get attached to the dog they're [00:08] going to get attached to me and the last [00:10] thing I want is to yet rehome that dog [00:13] again and there's three things that I [00:16] think are so important to make sure I'm [00:21] successful people ask about getting a [00:23] rescue um I always caution as much as [00:26] I've loved my rescues um some of it's [00:30] been a whole lot of work I also have [00:32] known when I've gone in with any of my [00:35] dogs or my very first start with my pig [00:38] that I don't want to fail and have to [00:41] rehome that that dog again um that's not [00:45] going to be in their best interest so I [00:46] want to make sure that I'm able to [00:49] support them and this is going to end [00:51] well for the two of us because we need [00:53] to have a great relationship so they can [00:54] have freedom I don't want them locked in [00:56] my basement because they've got a [00:58] problem and I can't deal with that so I [01:01] need to know and you need to know that [01:04] that dog is the fit for you and you're [01:06] able to work through whatever that dog [01:09] needs to be successful I also caution [01:12] people that um getting a rescue dog is [01:14] sort of gotten to be this cool thing um [01:17] and so many people have done that and it [01:19] seems even cooler when I get my rescue [01:21] dog um from another country rather than [01:25] a shelter down the street so it's gotten [01:27] sort of Vogue that way um and and [01:30] there's because of that there's people [01:31] looking to make money off that so [01:33] there's people that breed dogs to sell [01:35] them as rescue dirt bags so I want to [01:37] make sure I'm not supporting that and [01:39] causing more of a problem and dogs not [01:42] having good homes um I also want to make [01:45] sure that I do my research that there's [01:47] not going to be a problem that's [01:48] insurmountable for me um you know if you [01:51] have a family um young kids or a spouse [01:54] that's really not into the dogs um you [01:56] need to understand what behavioral [01:58] problems can you support you know if you [02:00] got a dog that had some aggression you [02:02] know are you willing to find a trainer [02:04] and spend a fair amount of time baby and [02:06] money to work through that that problem [02:09] or be able to say I'm good managing my [02:13] dog and that you know they're not [02:15] getting together with the rest of the [02:16] family's dogs uh because they're just [02:19] not going to be happy so really [02:21] understanding um that the costs involved [02:24] you know what's the medical background [02:26] um with that dog because in some cases [02:28] rescues are to have um higher costs [02:31] associated with them and are you ready [02:32] for that so rescue dogs can be [02:35] phenomenal it's great to give a dog um a [02:38] home I've had phenomenal relationships [02:40] with my rescue dogs but making sure when [02:43] you go forward your eyes are open [02:45] knowing that you may get some baggage [02:47] you likely are some of it you're going [02:49] to change and some of it you may not um [02:51] and are you set up and is that the path [02:54] you want to take first thing I want to [02:56] establish is relationship I have three [02:57] main goals when I'm building [02:58] relationship one I want to build the [03:01] dog's confidence and especially their [03:03] trust and confidence in me uh with [03:06] animals um it's a little different than [03:09] people people always say oh I want my [03:11] puppy to love me or I want my older dog [03:13] I want the rescue to love me but what [03:15] dogs need because their animals is to [03:17] feel safety above all else so they need [03:20] to know that I've got their back they [03:23] need to be confident especially for a [03:25] rescue puppies that clean slate for a [03:27] rescue dog they may have some baggage [03:29] Maybe they weren't treated well or maybe [03:31] they weren't supported at all they were [03:33] just left to roam um and they don't know [03:36] um how to trust somebody else so it's [03:38] really important I'm building their [03:40] confidence their trust that I've got [03:42] their back and that I'm not going to [03:44] hurt them and I'm not going to ask them [03:45] do anything they're not ready for so I [03:47] also want to build value specifically [03:49] for the dog having value for me um if I [03:53] want a dog that can be off leash and is [03:55] going to be my future dog that looks to [03:57] me gets tons of Freedom it's important [04:00] they want to please me they want to [04:04] exhibit the desired behaviors that I'm [04:06] looking for so they need to find me [04:08] valuable and a lot of people I know what [04:10] you're saying it's all about this is [04:12] where she pulls out the treats um and [04:14] yes I'm going to use food because I'm [04:17] going to use every tool available to me [04:19] and and food can be a great way to build [04:21] value for work for myself but in some [04:25] cases those rescue dogs may not be that [04:28] interested in treats cuz they have [04:29] haven't been sort of learned that early [04:32] on they may not be that interest food [04:35] motivated or toy motivated so I may [04:38] build value a little bit differently [04:40] than I do with my puppy with rescue dogs [04:42] one things I've seen is that often they [04:45] don't have that intrinsic value for toys [04:48] or treats so I may need to spend some [04:51] time building a little bit of value for [04:55] um food in some different ways and we've [04:57] done some YouTube videos on that um and [05:00] I may need to teach them um in case in [05:03] fact all of my rescues none of them have [05:05] had a natural instinct for toys so I [05:09] need to teach them um and build that [05:12] drive to chase so that we can use those [05:15] toys in the future with a rescue dog [05:17] just like a puppy but even more so I [05:19] need to teach them how we're going to [05:22] communicate and I'm going to communicate [05:24] in a few ways um with touch and with [05:26] some rescue dogs they're not going to be [05:27] comfortable with that so I need to build [05:31] that trust in me and the understanding [05:34] that my touch is going to be giving them [05:37] information and doesn't mean anything [05:39] bad I need need them to know that [05:41] they're going to have to be groomed and [05:43] I don't want them to be stressed by that [05:44] and I don't want to be stressed having [05:46] to groom my rescue dog for the rest of [05:48] their life I also need them to [05:50] understand that a leash is going to be [05:51] something I'm going to use that leash to [05:54] guide them so they need to be [05:55] comfortable with that because they may [05:56] not have felt that pressure or they may [05:58] have felt it inappropriate Seely in the [06:00] past I'm also going to use you know [06:02] signals or hand gestures um to show my [06:06] dog what they want and many dogs haven't [06:08] had any guidance in the past so this is [06:11] going to be very new I need to build [06:12] that trust this is a good thing that I'm [06:15] showing them and most older dogs that's [06:17] what they want dogs want a leader that's [06:20] going to show them how to behave it's no [06:22] different than us you know you go to a [06:23] new school a new job you're very [06:25] uncomfortable if you don't know what how [06:27] to behave in those situations so I want [06:30] to show my dog how I'm going to um [06:33] describe that to them I also want to [06:36] understand how my dog communicates I [06:38] want to learn when they're feeling a [06:41] little bit of pressure when they're [06:43] uncomfortable or important signs like [06:45] they need to go to the washroom I need [06:47] to start to pay attention to those [06:49] things so that I can understand the [06:51] dog's communication to me not just mine [06:53] to them it is really important to be [06:55] patient when we get an older dog a lot [06:58] of times they come from a bad situation [07:00] or even if it's not that bad they're in [07:02] this whole new situation and a lot of [07:04] times people think this is the time [07:07] especially if my dogs had a bad [07:08] situation I'm going to make it up to [07:10] them but we don't need to make it up to [07:12] them in the next 10 minutes because it [07:14] can be very very overwhelming so my [07:17] experience is we need to let those dogs [07:19] have a little bit of time just to get [07:21] used to the new environment used to me [07:24] being around um and I need to learn a [07:27] little bit about them so that I am not [07:29] uh by accident um overwhelming them or [07:32] in any way making them uncomfortable so [07:34] trying to pet that dog hug that dog um [07:39] start to do lots with it um is not the [07:42] best way to build my relationship and [07:44] yet you know with a little tiny puppy [07:46] I'm not looking to go get my disc and do [07:48] disc freestyle or a lot of high level [07:50] training but I get that new dog I may be [07:53] saying wow he's he's built for this and [07:55] he's old enough to do it safely but I [07:58] need to know that hardcore training is [08:00] going to come down the road um taking [08:03] them out meeting lots of new people [08:04] going to lots of new environments is [08:07] going to happen they're going to have a [08:08] great life but not that first little [08:11] while I'm going to let them just get [08:13] their legs underneath them I also need [08:15] to understand my new dog um you know [08:18] what are their strengths and weaknesses [08:19] or where are the opportunities I need to [08:22] understand you know where their [08:24] thresholds are for me me touching them [08:27] you know if we're doing a little bit of [08:29] found foundation training work you know [08:31] how much time before they get mentally [08:34] tired I need to understand those things [08:36] um you know I made the mistake early on [08:38] not necessarily really understanding the [08:41] dog I had one that came that looked like [08:43] he was so so chill um and he was out [08:47] with my other dogs and everything was [08:49] successful um and then when I started to [08:52] one day um do some disc with another dog [08:56] um he turned out of stimulation he just [09:00] got so excited and grabbed one of my [09:02] other dogs and um I had no idea how much [09:07] he lack that impulse control and how [09:09] fast he would stimulate so I put him in [09:11] a situation without truly understanding [09:13] him so taking that time different [09:16] situations where it's not quite as [09:18] intense to understand that so really [09:21] being patient and saying I've got a [09:24] whole life to live with this dog and to [09:26] make his life so much better but I [09:28] really want to understand him a little [09:30] bit more also understand you know is it [09:32] impulse control he lacks is it he's very [09:35] pressure sensitive um I had one rescue [09:38] dog um that was just used to um not [09:42] being cared for and um if he was [09:45] offleash he liked to run 500 yards [09:48] Straight Out full speed regardless of [09:51] what was out there um and then come back [09:53] so yes he's coming back but that's not [09:57] very safe in my world what if there's a [09:59] road or if there's other people he's [10:01] going to dis disturb or if there's other [10:04] loose dogs um we need to understand that [10:07] I want a barrier around me when he's off [10:10] leash um so I need to understand his [10:13] tendency is to want to go 100 miles an [10:15] hour or some of those um hurting dogs [10:18] they're going to want to have distance [10:20] for me other dogs are wan to be close so [10:23] they're going to be uncomfortable if I'm [10:25] getting too far away so I need to [10:27] understand that before I put them in [10:28] situations where they're going to get [10:30] really nervous or hurt if you're like me [10:33] uh the Burke was my last new dog and he [10:37] was over four um looked like he would be [10:41] a phenomenal disc dog really really cool [10:44] so I just wanted to start doing things [10:48] with him again I want to be my dog my [10:50] new dog to see me as their Advocate and [10:53] if I'm putting them in that situation [10:55] too early I'm really not their that [10:58] person that they're going to look up to [10:59] and say you keep me safe and you keep me [11:01] comfortable the other thing is um so [11:04] many adult dogs that we get especially [11:07] if they're rescues and they come from [11:08] not great situations will suffer from [11:10] separation anxiety and I learned that [11:12] the hard way with an early rescue so [11:15] I've learn now with those new dogs as [11:16] much as they need to decompress I also [11:19] need them because even if they're going [11:21] to love all this if the dog's not [11:23] overwhelmed and they say yes this is [11:26] fantastic Carol is spending time with me [11:28] we're training we're doing cool stuff or [11:30] hiking um that now the minute I'm away [11:33] from them they're going to freak because [11:35] suddenly they're in this good situation [11:37] so separation anxiety is one of the [11:40] worst things for dogs and people to go [11:42] through um that I've ever experienced so [11:45] I don't want that to happen so the first [11:48] uh several months with my young dog is [11:51] going to be um a little boring and I'm [11:54] going to keep myself in check from doing [11:56] all those fun things I said I don't do a [11:58] lot of you know training per se when I [12:02] first get a rescue dog um but I do do [12:04] foundation work no different than when a [12:07] puppy puppies um I want to build that [12:10] foundation so with my older dog I want a [12:12] few key things one is the idea one key [12:16] word is I use the word yes when they're [12:19] right so it really helps my pup if I'm [12:21] teaching them some handling and I'm [12:23] touching them and they're nice and calm [12:26] as I'm reaching down that leg Yeah yes [12:29] so I can show them that hey being calm [12:32] so that word pays off so many times so [12:35] I'm going to teach them that the other [12:36] thing I'm going to teach them is to [12:38] respond to my commands first time every [12:41] time something that's key to the McAn [12:44] method you know you've heard people out [12:46] there maybe you've done it spot spot [12:48] spot spot you know calling their dog and [12:52] that can be really dangerous or sit sit [12:55] sit and it always drives me nuts my [12:58] students know that because people do it [13:01] and then and the dogs learn not to [13:03] listen and then they um you know they go [13:06] off and um sometime they need their dog [13:09] to hold that position or to respond to [13:11] their name and then we get mad we've [13:13] never taught them so I want my dog to [13:16] learn how to respond first time every [13:18] time and how is that going to happen so [13:20] one with my new dogs they're not going [13:22] to get a ton of Freedom one most of [13:25] those new dogs may not want that and I [13:27] want to teach them we now a team and I'm [13:29] giving them information so they're going [13:31] to be on leash with me they're going to [13:33] be fairly close so when I say things [13:35] like their name I'm never saying except [13:38] when I can help them to get it right now [13:42] that might be with food absolutely [13:44] that's a great tool so I'm going to say [13:46] that name and one second later I'm going [13:48] to show them to respond to that name [13:51] might be with a toy it might simply be [13:53] with some touch it might be saying that [13:56] name giving them a touch so they turn so [13:59] that I can yes and acknowledge them and [14:01] again that could be food that could be [14:03] my touch or for those rescue dogs that [14:05] may not be comfortable with my touch or [14:07] want a big playtime just my voice in a [14:11] uh you know appraising manner is going [14:13] to be rewarding to the dog because they [14:15] may not have gotten that feedback before [14:17] this I also need my new dog no different [14:19] than a puppy to look to me for how to [14:23] behave uh cuz I've had rescues where um [14:27] you know one came from a in situation [14:30] that um so no guidance or supervision at [14:33] all just figure it out cuz you're on [14:35] your own um another one who lived in a [14:39] kennel for four years so not a lot of [14:41] problem solving going on because nothing [14:44] changed in life um so in both cases they [14:47] haven't looked to people for guidance [14:49] there hasn't been a lot of input and [14:51] most rescues not all but most probably [14:53] haven't had a lot of good guidance or [14:55] positive guidance so I want to teach [14:57] them to look to to me again um meaning [15:01] that they're going to spend time they're [15:02] going to be close to me not have a lot [15:04] of freedom away from me um teaching them [15:07] how to learn how to problem solve and [15:09] how to take those cues from me there's [15:12] one huge mistake puppy owners make and [15:15] you know what most rescue dog owners [15:17] make the same mistake so whether your [15:19] new dog is very young or older this [15:23] applies to you don't make that mistake [15:25] check out this video on that note I'm [15:28] instructor Carol happy training ==================================================

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,, Part 365/429,~Ken #leashwalkingtraining #mccanndogs === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:01] we're just sort of flying by the seat of [00:02] our pants here I you know I didn't have [00:05] anything loaded up I was in the back of [00:07] my mind I'm trying to work through a um [00:10] Rhyme or something I just I couldn't get [00:12] there couldn't get there it's been a [00:13] busy day it has been a busy day the [00:15] first thing that we have to talk about [00:17] and this is about um a sort of a uh a [00:21] way something you're always thinking [00:23] about your training it is a [00:26] perspective that you need to keep in [00:28] mind regardless of how much training [00:30] you've done inside regardless of how [00:32] much training you've done in different [00:33] locations for your dog especially at the [00:36] beginning of your training and even you [00:38] know as you're working on skills making [00:40] skills better you have to keep in mind [00:43] that taking your dog outside taking your [00:45] dog to a new environment is going to add [00:47] a layer of difficulty it's going to be a [00:50] little bit more challenging because you [00:52] which you want you know attention and [00:54] focus or at least checking in on you [00:56] have to compete with all of the other [00:58] things in the world and your dog uh has [01:01] evolved to be hyper sensitive to those [01:04] things I mean that's what's kept them [01:05] alive for so long over years and years [01:07] and years so they're really good at [01:10] seeing changes in their environment very [01:12] aware absolutely so you know really [01:15] think about that so let's say you [01:17] someone's struggling with their leash [01:20] walking and um they are you know are [01:23] getting some success in the hallway at [01:25] home maybe they're getting some success [01:27] in the driveway how would would they [01:30] change what they're doing in their [01:31] training when they go when they get onto [01:33] the sidewalk when they get to the park [01:35] yeah definitely I think sometimes people [01:37] think that just because dogs can do it [01:38] in one location they can automatically [01:40] do it in others and uh what people [01:42] really need to know about dogs and [01:44] training dogs is that they're very very [01:46] situational animals so that means they [01:49] can learn to do something very very well [01:51] in one situation and by situation I mean [01:53] it can even be like room to room in the [01:57] house versus like the you know inside to [01:59] outside it can be it can be very [02:01] specific um they you know they're [02:03] reading everything so they're very [02:05] situational and often we suggest with [02:07] people when they're first um you know [02:09] going to train some things start inside [02:12] start inside where there's less [02:13] distractions but then when you do go [02:16] outside don't just go right for like the [02:18] full the full goal you know maybe it's [02:21] that you're not just going to walk out [02:22] the door and like be able to just take [02:24] your dog magically for a walk maybe go [02:26] outside and start something easy will [02:29] they look at you when you ask them to [02:31] will they respond to their name will [02:33] they sit on a loose leash the first time [02:35] that you ask start with some simple more [02:38] simple behaviors um and test out your [02:41] dog's listening skills before you take [02:42] the show in the road because if you are [02:44] standing outside your front door and [02:46] your dog won't look at you they won't [02:48] sit unless you pull on the leash or pull [02:49] out a treat chances are when you take [02:52] them for a walk on the Block they're [02:53] going to pull they're going to get [02:54] distracted they're going to pick things [02:55] up off the ground they're going to bark [02:57] at the dog that you walk next uh next to [03:00] um so we always suggest that people need [03:02] to start off close to home and test to [03:05] see where your dog's listening skills [03:07] are at and if you're not getting good [03:10] Focus that's going to let you know what [03:13] your next 20 minutes is going to look [03:14] like you know you might spend 20 minutes [03:16] outside with your dog but instead of [03:17] going for that walk around the block you [03:19] might spend it just in front of the [03:21] house working on getting your dog's [03:22] attention so that you know when you go [03:24] out and do the thing um it it goes [03:27] better what you don't want to do is let [03:28] them rehearse it rehearse doing anything [03:31] uh poorly because then that becomes the [03:33] way that they do it yeah I love that and [03:35] I love that way of thinking you know in [03:37] terms of like actionable Steps if [03:39] someone's let's say you are having some [03:42] success in your driveway um where you've [03:44] gotten to the point where you don't have [03:45] to keep a treat on your dog's nose the [03:47] whole time to go for walks you know [03:48] you've got time you've got five 10 steps [03:50] whatever that whatever the level of [03:52] accomplishment is you might need to take [03:55] one step back when you go to that new [03:57] environment the idea of getting [03:59] attention is so valuable it is something [04:02] it will change the way your dog trains [04:05] by just slowing things down for a moment [04:08] reminding them that you're valuable that [04:10] that it's worth listening to you can and [04:12] again it doesn't just have to be treats [04:14] you know sometimes we use toys in our [04:15] training for some exercises and um you [04:18] know engaging with them and reminding [04:20] them like hey even though we're in this [04:22] new place tug is just as much fun when [04:24] you check in with me tug is just as much [04:26] fun when you respond quickly to your [04:28] name but you must remember that when you [04:32] get into this new environment if it [04:34] starts to fail if things start to go [04:36] wrong because you're in a new [04:37] environment you have to take a step back [04:40] you know identify that moment as a [04:41] training opportunity and take a step [04:44] back in your training and work on the [04:46] leash walking work on the response to [04:48] name you know work on the things that [04:50] are you find challenging because your [04:53] dog doesn't know it until they know it [04:55] in this location you know can I add [04:57] something I'd love for you to yeah go [04:59] ahead um you know I mentioned before [05:01] about like asking for a sit or calling [05:04] your dog's name or whatever getting [05:06] attention and I think it's really [05:07] important that when you are trying to [05:09] get your dog's attention you keep [05:11] working at it until you get your dog's [05:14] attention I can't tell you how many [05:15] times I've seen people when they don't [05:17] know that I'm watching and they try to [05:19] get the dog's attention they try and say [05:20] sit they try and say look at me the [05:22] dog's not paying attention they dog is [05:23] just blatantly ignoring them and they're [05:25] like h fine and then they just proceed [05:27] with doing the thing because they don't [05:28] want to make the EXT effort to like [05:30] follow through and then the dog goes I [05:33] know if I just ignore long enough [05:34] they're going to give up and I'm going [05:35] to get to pull my way over to grab that [05:37] stick or check out that dog or whatever [05:39] it might be people eventually just give [05:41] in so it's really important that you [05:43] don't through follow through goes such a [05:46] long way in your relationship and your [05:48] dog's um respect for you and with that [05:51] comes a dog that is like eager to listen [05:53] to you they actually want to do it the [05:55] other thing that you want to think about [05:57] when you're trying to work on getting [05:58] your dog's attention especially if [06:00] you're trying to get a dog not to pull [06:02] you around on the leash and a tight [06:03] leash all the time is when you get them [06:05] to listen it's important that you're [06:07] doing it without pulling the leash and [06:10] keeping the leash tight so if you're [06:12] trying to get them to respond to their [06:13] name or or trying to get them to sit [06:15] this is a token one people say sit the [06:18] dog doesn't listen and they just pull [06:19] the dog into a sit and then they hold [06:20] the leash tight and then they say good [06:22] dog well you're the one pulling the dog [06:25] into a Sit the dog's not really sitting [06:26] they're just doing it because they [06:27] happen to be being held into place with [06:29] a tight leash so what we want you to [06:31] think about is you could use the leash [06:33] to help them get into a Sit especially [06:35] if they're not listening to you there is [06:36] nothing wrong with that but once they're [06:38] sitting try putting slack in the leash [06:40] try making the leash a little loose for [06:41] a moment and then see what your dog does [06:43] because that's going to be the the um [06:45] the sign that you have them under [06:47] control or not if you tell them to sit [06:49] they're not listening and you use the [06:50] leash to get them to sit again that's [06:52] okay and the second you put slack in the [06:53] leash your dog just gets up and ignores [06:55] you that tells you that you haven't [06:57] really you haven't really made the [06:59] change yet but if you can say sit you [07:01] can put slack in the leash and your dog [07:02] continues to sit all by themselves and [07:04] they check in with you now you know [07:06] you've made a bit of change that would [07:07] actually be an awesome time to reward [07:09] your dog whether you have um affection [07:11] of voice praise um petting treat tug [07:16] whatever it might be but that would be a [07:17] good time to praise but pay attention to [07:19] your leash because a lot of the time [07:21] people just think their dog's listening [07:23] but if you actually look closely they're [07:24] just pulling their dog around like a [07:26] puppet and the dog's not actually doing [07:27] any listening whatsoever then you take [07:29] that same dog off leash and you wonder [07:31] why they run away or they don't listen [07:32] it's because they don't have you know [07:34] somebody pulling and dragging them [07:35] around with the leash anymore so leashes [07:37] need to be on because they allow us to [07:39] have control but the goal is that the [07:41] leash is on but it's not actually being [07:44] tight on the dog's neck they are the [07:46] leashes lose the dogs engage with us [07:48] it's really important yeah the other [07:50] thing I was just thinking as you were [07:51] mentioning that is how people start to [07:53] falter when um they say the command once [07:56] so maybe it's their dog's name or maybe [07:57] it's sit and then they repeat it over [08:00] and over and over and over again and [08:02] then they say it the 10th time the dog [08:04] sits and they go oh good dog he got it [08:07] our goal is for you my goal for you is [08:09] to have your dog do it the first time [08:12] every single time that's the level of [08:14] expectation that we're setting and if it [08:15] doesn't happen then we're going to show [08:17] you how to how to make that happen yeah [08:19] but um you know maintain high standards [08:22] I was reading Shannon and I were reading [08:24] this interesting study talking recently [08:26] about high how high expect how important [08:29] High expect [08:30] are in terms of like [08:32] authoritative leadership dog training [08:34] how how important that is and how much [08:36] more social your dog can be how much [08:38] more confident they are how much better [08:40] their problem solving is when you take [08:42] an authoritative position uh you know [08:44] when working with them it's so valuable [08:47] and that means things like you go [08:49] outside you're making sure that you have [08:52] clear expectations of your dog and if [08:53] it's not quite going to plane you're [08:55] taking a step back and making sure you [08:57] can show them how to be right mhm with [09:00] that said um I we we have something I [09:03] wanted to mention we just got a note [09:05] from some of our mods that we have a [09:09] free puppy training seminar it's [09:11] happening in person this Saturday April [09:14] the 6th at our training facility train [09:16] facility I think it's 1 p.

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,, Part 367/429,com go to the puppy on the first [10:02] page you can find there's a puppy [10:03] seminar thing and sign up for it's good [10:04] for if you don't have a puppy yet or if [10:06] you just have a puppy and you have like [10:07] a million in one questions about what to [10:10] do it's for you yeah we talked a moment [10:12] ago about how using food in your [10:15] training the value of it because it's a [10:16] resource your dog generally understands [10:18] but Point number two in getting more [10:20] Focus from your dog when you're outside [10:23] is that high value food is a powerful [10:25] tool MH but it won't fix everything so [10:28] let's talk a little bit about uh you [10:30] know the situations you've seen with [10:32] dogs where it's like they're they're in [10:34] a situation or a scenario environment [10:36] where they're like y couldn't care less [10:38] don't really care about food yeah I mean [10:40] every dog has um a different um a [10:44] different level natural level of [10:46] Motivation by food and obviously the [10:49] dogs that are a little bit more [10:50] naturally food motivated they're a [10:51] little easier to work with in [10:53] distracting environments if they have a [10:54] lot of love for food dogs who are less [10:57] food motivated there's actually lots of [10:58] tricks that you can do to increase their [11:00] motivation for food however I have seen [11:03] many dogs that love treats that love [11:06] food but they're in a distracting [11:07] environment where there's a squirrel or [11:09] there's a deer running or there's like a [11:12] kid on a b bike bicycle that they want [11:14] to Chase or whatever it might be and you [11:16] could you know Wag the most tasty steak [11:18] in front of their nose and they just [11:20] would not care so you know at the end of [11:22] the day what we want to do is the food's [11:23] great a great motivator and you'll you [11:25] know if you watch our videos you'll know [11:26] we do use a lot of food in our training [11:29] but but we also want to get to the point [11:31] where the food isn't the only thing that [11:33] we have sometimes we just have to use um [11:36] other tactics in order to affect change [11:39] and one of the things that's going to be [11:40] really important I kind of mentioned [11:42] this before is um you know you need to [11:44] make sure that you have good equipment [11:46] on your dog like you have you have a [11:47] good leash or a long line whatever it [11:49] might be because if you don't have [11:51] anything attached to your dog to allow [11:53] you to follow through with things your [11:54] dog's just running loose um they're [11:57] going to hear you call them 18 times and [11:59] they're they're not going to respond so [12:01] it is really really important um the [12:03] other thing you need to think about is [12:05] if you're in a situation where the food [12:08] is not really a good motivator perhaps [12:11] you need to start in an environment [12:13] start off in an environment that is not [12:16] so difficult to compete with in terms of [12:19] of the food so um you know what I want [12:21] to do is I want to train my dog [12:23] initially in a more controlled [12:25] environment so that I can get them doing [12:27] that behavior really well so take the [12:30] recall for example so teaching your dog [12:32] to come when they're called you know I'm [12:34] going to start off you know in the house [12:35] or in the backyard where it's completely [12:37] controlled and the dogs on a long line I [12:39] have all their favorite rewards and I'm [12:41] building a lot of value for coming [12:42] towards me so that it's not just the [12:45] treat that the dog is excited about it's [12:47] the actual word come that they love or [12:49] their name that they love or getting to [12:51] me and playing that they love I'm doing [12:53] it enough that I'm really building a lot [12:55] of value and then another thing that we [12:57] like to do is take that same environment [12:59] that the dog is totally comfortable in [13:01] now and make that environment harder so [13:04] for example maybe I practice a recall [13:06] and you know I get a family member to [13:09] bounce a ball over there or um you know [13:11] wag a toy or something that's exciting [13:13] and work on teaching my dog sometimes [13:16] there's a distraction but you're still [13:17] going to come or still going to have fun [13:19] and I'm going to work through some of [13:21] that stuff and then from there perhaps I [13:23] do go out into the world but I might go [13:26] you know not to the park when you know [13:28] the school and all the kids are being [13:29] let out at you know 3:00 I'm going to go [13:32] when you know it's a Sunday morning or [13:35] you know a time when there's not much [13:36] going on so I know that it's going to be [13:38] fairly quiet and I can ease into those [13:41] distractions because we have to remember [13:43] that dogs are I said this before dogs [13:45] are very situational I can't just go [13:47] from one situation where the dog is [13:49] acing it in my house and then expect [13:52] them to be able to you know go for a [13:54] 2hour walk you know with a bunch of dogs [13:56] around a park that's just not going to [13:58] be a normal progression so think about [14:00] your reinforcement that you have but [14:02] also think about how that compares to [14:04] the environment that you're in and is [14:06] are you actually ready to conquer that [14:09] um distraction um based on the amount of [14:11] training that you've done prior okay so [14:14] P so important um let's talk about some [14:17] people will say like well you know I [14:19] don't have a family member to bounce a [14:20] ball or well my dog doesn't care about [14:22] somebody bouncing a ball why what does [14:25] your dog care about then yeah why why [14:27] would they why would they do that [14:29] training anyway like what's the value of [14:31] the exercise it's not about bouncing a [14:33] ball it's about introducing new [14:35] distractions it's about challenging your [14:36] dog and raising that bar bit by bit by [14:40] bit just to make it a little bit more [14:41] challenging so that when the time comes [14:44] that there's a new distraction that [14:45] they've never seen before their tendency [14:48] is hey you know what I've encountered a [14:50] bunch of new things multiple times now [14:52] over the course of my life and I've [14:53] always chosen you um that's that you [14:56] want them to default to you as the [14:58] decision I can give you a really simple [14:59] example of this and then we do this with [15:01] all of our puppies so when we first when [15:04] we get a brand new puppy I spend so much [15:07] time in the first few weeks teaching [15:10] them their name and not just using their [15:12] name Here There and Everywhere I teach [15:13] them that when you hear your name run to [15:16] me run to me it's so much fun so when we [15:19] begin we'll start off with Ken at one [15:21] end of the hallway me at the other end [15:22] of the hallway we'll both have you know [15:24] a fist full of treats or maybe it's [15:26] sometimes their breakfast or their [15:27] dinner and we'll call the puppy back and [15:29] forth all the windows um all the windows [15:32] all the doors are closed windows too [15:34] guess High floor yeah um and so there's [15:36] the dog really but puppy can't be wrong [15:38] there's really nothing else to do we'll [15:40] do that once the dog gets the game then [15:43] we'll add a little bit of distraction [15:45] and then what we'll do is work up into [15:46] the point where um you know Ken will [15:48] hold the puppy in one part of our [15:51] downstairs floor and then I'll go hide [15:53] I'll hide somewhere in the down so the [15:55] puppy has no idea where I am and I'll [15:57] call the puppy's name and then you can [15:59] hear the puppy running over here running [16:00] over here running over here and then [16:01] when they find me I throw a huge party [16:03] and we play and the puppy thinks it is [16:06] the most fun little game but what starts [16:08] to happen is I'm challenging their [16:10] recall uh they can't see me they can't [16:13] see that I'm holding treats they can't [16:14] see that I'm running away all they can [16:17] do is go off of my voice and that's what [16:19] I'm trying to work on but it's a fun [16:21] little progressional game that the [16:23] puppies do very very well at this is all [16:25] about building value I play this same [16:29] game when you guys don't have an agility [16:31] Arena but you know I train high level [16:33] agility and before I train my dog to do [16:35] agility my puppies spend months doing [16:39] obedience training in the agility Arena [16:41] and it's a huge huge huge huge facility [16:44] with equipment and stuff everywhere and [16:46] I put hold have somebody hold my puppy [16:48] in one area of the arena and I go hide [16:50] behind the equipment I call my puppy so [16:51] the same game that we play in the house [16:54] I play in different locations so you [16:56] could play it obviously it needs to be a [16:58] safe situation [16:59] but play these fun little games that [17:01] build value so that your dog actually [17:03] likes to listen to that word um but [17:05] that's sort of the progression you can [17:07] take the same steps the same process and [17:09] you can apply to any exercise yeah um [17:12] drop a like on the video if you've seen [17:14] our puppy videos especially like our [17:15] puppy Vlogs where kale and I did we do a [17:17] lot of these kinds of activities so many [17:19] fun games and there's there's a there's [17:21] a ton of like little things that it's [17:23] funny when I look back at them I think [17:24] like each each every section could be an [17:27] entire video where we talk about could [17:29] take a deeper dive I mean we love taking [17:31] deeper Dives in the train station our [17:33] recorded content's pretty vanilla pretty [17:34] like short condensed you know it solves [17:36] one little problem for a very specific [17:38] dog but um we could definitely uh you [17:41] know draw out a lot more information [17:43] from things like these fun little games [17:45] that build value for you and don't give [17:47] your dog the opportunity to fail yeah [17:50] really really important the other thing [17:52] we were talking about uh uh oh I wrote [17:54] it down so I wanted to say it kale was [17:55] talking about you know if the the [17:57] environment is overwhelming your dog's [17:58] not interested interested in food you [18:00] might need to change the space and I I [18:01] use the term if there's too much [18:03] Temptation change the location simply [18:06] that rhy yeah I know that's why I wanted [18:08] to say it um simply doing that can you [18:11] know bring your dog down to a state of [18:13] mind where they're willing to take food [18:15] and a lot of people say like oh my dog [18:16] doesn't care about food well there could [18:18] be a whole bunch of reasons why your dog [18:20] isn't interested in food I mean maybe [18:21] they're just generally not that food [18:23] motivated but it could be usually [18:25] there's a reason yeah it could be it's a [18:27] stressful environment there's stressed [18:29] for some other reason uh overfed they're [18:31] overfed for sure you've chosen you've [18:34] chosen the wrong food for this training [18:35] situation not boring food right yeah not [18:38] that food's the only choice we we again [18:41] I say you know we'll use a few other [18:43] things as well as like pet and preise [18:46] you know toys we use all kinds of things [18:48] what we'll figure out what the dog likes [18:50] and then we'll use that as a reward but [18:51] food can be a valuable tool especially [18:53] if you're looking for very precise uh [18:55] reward positions it's quite valuable so [18:57] consider that can you just let me know [19:00] when I can bring funky in yeah let's go [19:02] through this really quick uh we just had [19:03] a super chat from GSD random GSD random [19:07] ask what do you guys think about shock [19:10] cers you want me to take this one sure [19:12] if you want to I can bring her in if you [19:13] want um we um we don't use shock cers in [19:17] our training um they're a little bit [19:19] more adversive um than we really like to [19:23] do um you know there's lots of different [19:25] ways to train a dog there's lots of [19:27] different methods out there to to train [19:29] a dog um you know we don't we don't use [19:31] them in our training we um try to build [19:34] a little bit more value for the exercise [19:37] um we do use some form of Corrections [19:40] with the dogs um but we you know believe [19:44] that it's not necessarily about how firm [19:47] you do corrections it's about the timing [19:49] it's about the communication that's [19:50] given before and after um those um those [19:54] Corrections or redirections or [19:56] placements or whatever it might be um [19:58] but we don't use we don't use shot [20:00] collar in our training we also do not [20:02] use any pinch collar in our training um [20:05] prong collar we just don't believe it's [20:08] necessary to use something that [20:10] adversive and again this just our [20:11] opinion there's lots of different [20:12] opinions out there um but um it's it's [20:16] not our not our Vibe never has been [20:19] never will be yeah no it um you know we [20:21] actually don't allow those tools on the [20:22] property but there are way better tools [20:24] like starting with a flat Buckle collar [20:26] it gives you a good foundation a good [20:28] starting point and then if you feel like [20:29] you have a dog that's really struggling [20:31] and you can't quite get control and you [20:33] need power steering we offer something [20:34] that's called A Gentle Leader it's [20:36] actually made by a company uh named paba [20:39] and um we get ours custom made directly [20:41] from them because this tool is so good [20:43] the beautiful thing about um The Gentle [20:46] Leader is that it's a tool that uh gives [20:49] you a not like muzzle control head [20:50] control of the dog without being painful [20:53] or whatever but the best part about the [20:55] Gentle Leader it's not like a halty that [20:57] slides back and forth you can slip the [20:59] nose Loop of the Gentle Leader off and [21:00] immediately you have a flat Buckle [21:02] collar so for those of you with a dog in [21:04] training this is what I loved about it [21:06] because I would I was able to take you [21:07] know my as I as I was learning I was [21:10] able to take my dog for walks and when [21:12] we were like far away from people or [21:14] with less distractions I can slip the [21:16] nose Loop off and just train her you [21:18] know I it's a tool that's built so that [21:20] you don't have to use the tool anymore [21:21] and I love that about the Gentle Leader [21:24] so so powerful the goal is to try to [21:25] work a lot on relationship and and and [21:28] build a good understanding and respect [21:31] between you and the dog so that you [21:32] don't have to go to something as um [21:36] painful as a as a shot caller in order [21:39] to get the job done we're hoping we work [21:41] out all of that stuff before we would [21:43] ever need to get to that type of Point [21:45] Claudia vogle super sticker thank you [21:47] for that thank you that's a cute super [21:49] sticker and I got to toot first toot in [21:51] several live streams what does it say my [21:54] hero well uh let's celebrate that's your [21:56] first uh super on a live stream well [21:58] thank you and congratulations on your [21:59] first super um we have to talk you [22:02] talked a little bit about uh you know [22:04] different things that we'll use to um [22:07] you know not only reward the dog but [22:09] sort of get their attention naturally we [22:11] want to tap into some of those dog that [22:13] your dog's Natural Instincts and um [22:16] natural behavior so that you're not like [22:17] working extra hard to try to convince [22:20] them that they should listen to you one [22:22] of those tools we talked about food [22:24] straightforward you probably heard it [22:25] before another one that people under [22:28] utilize so much is motion motion when we [22:33] talked about uh some of these puppy [22:34] exercises that we do in the house so we [22:36] have a brand new puppy teeny tiny little [22:38] thing that we want to get the [22:40] foundational skills and steps uh with um [22:43] we use a lot of motion you know moving [22:45] away from your puppy brings them toward [22:46] you calling a puppy down the hall and [22:48] moving away brings them toward you and [22:50] they naturally start to think like oh [22:52] they this is always good when I'm moving [22:54] towards my owner valuable valuable thing [22:57] I actually pull and I don't quite [22:59] remember what this is cuz we we got into [23:01] the train station late but I pulled a [23:02] clip uh that talks about using motion [23:05] for focus and uh I recorded this clip 15 [23:09] minutes before I got to the train [23:12] station I guess I was already here this [23:13] then I cut my hair then I cut my hair [23:15] and then went then we went on screen so [23:17] pay no attention to the hair but um this [23:19] clip will be valuable for you guys let's [23:22] talk a little bit about how you can use [23:23] Motion in your training and I think if I [23:25] remember correctly this clip a really [23:27] common challenge this people have and it [23:29] makes it more difficult for their this [23:31] clip might be uh about walking [23:33] specifically we'll talk we're going to [23:34] talk about some more exercises though is [23:36] they don't know what the right pace of [23:38] walking is it's pretty easy for you as a [23:41] Handler to get focused on all of the [23:42] technique when you're teaching this [23:44] skill you're you're trying to keep the [23:45] leash loose you're trying to reward in a [23:47] in a specific position you're trying to [23:49] keep an eye out for uh all of the [23:51] distractions in the real world so it's [23:53] not uncommon for people to really slow [23:56] down their pace and the problem is that [23:58] that this actually makes it a lot harder [24:00] for your puppy what you need to do is [24:02] find the right pace and it's not too [24:04] fast and it's not walking too slow but [24:07] it's a pace where your dog's paying a [24:08] little bit more attention to you I want [24:10] you to walk like you're late for [24:12] something the great part about this is [24:14] that your dog finds it motivating and [24:16] and entertaining if you're walking at a [24:18] very specific pace and you're way more [24:20] likely for the next 10 or 15 ft to get [24:22] that great attention the other thing it [24:24] does is it doesn't allow your puppy to [24:27] uh discover those things on the ground [24:29] or be so focused on a leaf that blows by [24:32] or a car that drives by off in the [24:34] distance and it allows you to really [24:36] maintain some of that attention for [24:38] these short walking sessions so make [24:40] sure you pick a good Pace while we're [24:42] talking about attention and focus don't [24:44] be afraid to use turns in your okay we [24:47] can come back to that uh that you know [24:49] that's specifically for yeah cute dog uh [24:52] specifically for walk is is walking your [24:55] big struggle is that where you were [24:56] really um is that really where you find [24:59] your dog loses Focus the most let us [25:01] know in the chat we can talk about that [25:04] um I want to say something I was having [25:06] a conversation with somebody the other [25:07] day who just got a new puppy and um they [25:11] were chrisc crossy arms cute um we were [25:16] talking about like um she had made a [25:19] comment on a video I had done with five [25:21] and how fast how fast five comes to me [25:24] or even like when he brings a toy to me [25:26] like how fast he comes to me and five [25:27] alive is your five alive is my our [25:29] youngest dog so he's he's two now but um [25:32] all his puppy videos are on our Channel [25:34] you can watch them but she was [25:36] commenting and you know when you call [25:37] him he comes so fast or when he brings a [25:39] a toy back to you he comes so fast like [25:40] how did you get him to do that and I [25:42] said to her oh I did like so many chase [25:45] games when he was a puppy and um she [25:47] said oh well I do I do chase games with [25:49] my puppy all the time and I asked her [25:51] about them and uh her version of Chase [25:54] games was that she would chase her puppy [25:56] oh no yeah so but it's so funny because [25:59] in my brain like I would just never do [26:01] that because I just know that it's wrong [26:02] but I often my brain's different brain [26:05] my brain's a dog training brain um so [26:07] she was like oh so the she would chase [26:09] after the puppy and the puppy would play [26:10] bound and she chase the puppy over here [26:12] um but then she was also unsure about [26:15] why the puppy would get to her and then [26:17] like play bound and run away or it would [26:18] get the toy and then would come and like [26:20] stop and not want to bring it to her and [26:22] she didn't realize that all of these [26:24] like chase games that she was doing the [26:26] reverse to what we wanted was actually [26:27] teach teaching her dog that coming into [26:30] her was not very valuable so when we say [26:32] chase games we mean puppy is chasing you [26:37] so you can call them and run away from [26:39] your RI puppy when they almost catch you [26:41] de can run the other direction and you [26:43] know do lots of little games but then [26:44] remember to let them catch you let them [26:47] catch you and have a little play give [26:48] them a jackpot of treats play a game of [26:50] tug we do this so much with our puppies [26:54] Chase Chase Chase Chase Chase that it [26:56] really helps recall it also really helps [26:59] walking so that when you pick up your [27:01] pace or when you change direction your [27:03] puppy goes woo I like chasing after you [27:05] and they want to get nice and close to [27:07] your side and they want to keep up pace [27:09] with you when you change direction they [27:10] want to change with you because from the [27:13] beginning they've had so much value [27:16] learning to Chase and run after you that [27:18] it helps a lot of other exercises so and [27:21] it's never too L uh uh never too late to [27:24] start these chase games it's never too L [27:26] to stay never too L to start [27:28] um but if you do have a a young puppy I [27:31] would highly encourage that you start [27:32] doing that now also it tires them out [27:34] but make sure that it's always puppy [27:36] chasing you we never go after puppies [27:39] because it it the roles are too inverse [27:42] it sort of lets them be in charge of the [27:44] situation and then we're trying to chase [27:46] them down so we're the dog that gets [27:48] chased is always the leader so if you [27:51] see a pack of dogs chasing after a dog a [27:54] lot of times people don't realize that [27:56] the dog who is being chased the one [27:58] calling the one calling the shots unless [28:01] of course the dog's like running away in [28:03] it's different scenario but like when [28:04] you see our pack of dogs running in a in [28:07] a a pack you usually see the poodle out [28:10] in front she's our little toy poodle and [28:12] she's running the show and the Border [28:13] Coles are chasing after her and she [28:16] knows exactly what she is doing um so [28:19] anyways food for thought there well you [28:21] know someone had mentioned in the chat [28:22] that uh their real challenge is their [28:24] dog sniffing all the time sniffing the [28:26] ground because it's it's it's a smaller [28:27] breed dog a little poke give them a [28:29] little leash leash pop and run the other [28:31] Direction when they catch you play with [28:33] them so they're sort of go wo there's a [28:34] party over there I'm I'm missing out I [28:36] better get there quickly also [28:38] maintaining a bit faster Pace doesn't [28:40] allow them yeah doesn't allow them to [28:42] get distracted I I understand entirely [28:45] that there's a lot going on when you're [28:46] first trying to teach your dog to walk [28:48] in a leash especially in you know a new [28:50] scenario whether it's outside or your [28:52] backyard or there's all kinds of things [28:54] but and so we're thinking about [28:56] everything we're thinking about okay got [28:57] to keep a leash loose want to maintain [28:59] connection with my voice you know uh and [29:01] that you start to slow down we just [29:03] naturally forget that we're in the [29:05] middle of training and like I'm looking [29:07] around trying to remember all the things [29:09] if you keep that PA Pace up your dog [29:11] doesn't have an opportunity to get [29:12] distracted by that stuff on the ground [29:14] um and I'm not talking like full Sprint [29:16] you saw in uh that quick video we had [29:18] that dog was named uker and uker found [29:21] that like too exciting you know she lost [29:23] control um but the right pace walk like [29:26] your what is it what is it saying your [29:28] going you're late for something yeah [29:30] walk like you're late for something [29:31] that's a great Pace to keep your dog a [29:33] little bit more attentive to you doesn't [29:35] allow them a lot of time to like you [29:37] know peruse the ground or the sidewalk [29:40] or whatever so really use motion to your [29:42] advantage by uh keeping the pace up I'm [29:46] laughing at the chat because they're [29:47] talking about who would win in a 40- [29:48] yard dash muu oh it's not even close and [29:51] I got several uh points and then [29:53] somebody said that you would win um I [29:56] don't think that people realize that [29:57] like I'm a sprinter you are not ainter [30:00] classically trained oh my God you run [30:02] with your feet out to the side and you [30:04] have the heav he he runs like an [30:06] elephant like a lineer he's built for [30:09] carrying he heavy things not for going [30:11] fast I do think it would be a good race [30:13] but I play much dirtier than him so I [30:16] would probably like get close and trip [30:17] him and then keep going he would never [30:19] do that to me he's far too nice yeah [30:21] like H interesting yes yes good good I'm [30:24] planning for that yeah we're going to [30:26] have to post a for for fast but I am I [30:29] am I am pretty fast nowadays I don't [30:31] know if my back could take a 40 yard [30:32] dash like I might get into 23 yards and [30:34] then you know probably you know who's [30:36] faster than both of us [30:39] beine be Line's my border colleag who I [30:41] do agility with and she is she is way [30:44] faster than you let's be honest Kale's a [30:46] 21 time world champion of dog agility [30:50] and she gets uncomfortable every time I [30:51] announce so this is just an opportunity [30:53] for me to say that 21 time world [30:55] champion I'm not even that good at [30:57] anything and if I were i' I'd have a [30:59] flag and a hat and I'd have a t-shirt [31:01] like I'm best at whatever the thing is [31:03] no you wouldn't 21 time world champion [31:05] but every time I say it she [31:06] blushes y okay talk to about motion the [31:10] value of motion the next thing and I [31:12] mentioned just just a moment ago is your [31:14] voice this thing is so important it's a [31:18] tool that you have on you all the time I [31:21] don't quite well I do understand because [31:23] I was that self-conscious dog owner that [31:26] felt weird when I started training and [31:28] and I uh remember I had to teach you the [31:30] clap and slap I do yeah yeah for yeah I [31:33] do but but specifically with your voice [31:36] using your voice uh you know guys [31:38] especially I don't know why this is the [31:39] case when I was teaching a lot of [31:40] classes I noticed guys are often more [31:42] quiet they they they don't like they [31:44] don't want to sound I don't know [31:46] engaging and it's not about being high [31:48] and squeaky and bubbly although when you [31:50] see kale do that all the dogs in the [31:51] room are like what you know I'll pay [31:53] attention to you the P Piper right [31:55] that's really what it turns into but [31:56] it's about figuring out what connects [31:58] with your dog so you know if it's uh way [32:00] to go buddy all it's about your energy [32:03] absolutely using your voice Could Be the [32:05] Change maker that gets you past that [32:08] tough distraction or maintains some [32:10] attention when you're walking by your [32:13] neighbor's house and the dog's in the [32:14] backyard really keeping your dog engaged [32:17] with your voice is is it's a bridge it [32:20] just gives you a little bit U stronger [32:22] uh relationship Bond not relationship [32:24] but bond with your dog for those moments [32:27] when you can praise them you know when [32:29] you can tell them what a great job [32:30] they're doing maybe sometimes it's to [32:33] distract them a little bit to just [32:34] maintain some of some of that Focus once [32:37] they've made the great choice you've [32:38] used your voice to get you know let's [32:40] say 50 feet instead of 20 on this next [32:43] training session when you're doing your [32:44] walking once you get that next 50 fet [32:46] then maybe you reward them with the [32:47] thing that they love but that voice is [32:49] the thing that allows you to space out [32:51] the treats you know it doesn't we start [32:53] with a lot of food but we're working [32:54] towards no food and randomly rewarding [32:57] your dog once a blue moon because [32:59] they've done an extra great job your [33:00] voice is one of the tools that's going [33:02] to get you there it's going to allow you [33:04] to make those great strides in your [33:06] training but guys especially listen to [33:09] me use your voice use your voice to [33:11] connect with your dog it's a powerful [33:13] tool we so often guys Overlook it I [33:16] don't know why um but even you know uh [33:19] uh women are the same I mean we just [33:20] don't think we just maybe we don't [33:22] understand the value of it I don't know [33:24] what it is I think sometimes like I find [33:26] sometimes people are like really [33:28] thinking about what they're supposed to [33:29] do and when people are like [33:31] concentrating on like doing four things [33:33] at once they often don't um speak at the [33:38] same time or maybe they don't really [33:39] know what to say or how to say it's also [33:42] about like when you use your voice as [33:44] well the timing in which you use your [33:46] voice is all really really important but [33:48] you do want to be engaging with your dog [33:49] because it does make it a little bit [33:51] more fun I know like there's times where [33:53] I'll be training with students and I'll [33:55] be like holding their dog to do a recall [33:56] or something and they'll call their dog [33:58] to come and the dog will be running to [34:00] their person and all be like Yay praise [34:03] that's so good and the dog because I'm [34:05] loud and energetic the dog will stop and [34:08] turn around and want to run back to me [34:10] not because just simply because of the [34:12] tone of my voice it is really really [34:14] important that you learn to use your [34:15] voice well with your dog because it [34:17] makes um it makes a big difference yeah [34:20] and again you know we're going back to [34:22] uh something I mentioned earlier you're [34:23] competing with everything else in the [34:25] environment like it could be sounds it [34:27] could be smells I me if you can sound [34:29] like a squirrel you're set that's right [34:30] yeah it's going to be helpful for sure [34:32] but these are the things we're not [34:33] promoting squirrel sounds here whatever [34:35] connects with your dog the other thing I [34:37] guess to the flip side we talked a lot a [34:39] little bit about leash walking training [34:40] but if you have a dog who just doesn't [34:42] really care you know you're in you're in [34:43] an environment where you're trying to [34:45] get your dog dog to respond to their [34:47] name uh number one if you've gotten into [34:49] the situation your dog's not responding [34:51] I sure hope you have a long line on them [34:52] or a leash on them so you can get [34:54] control quickly but uh don't repeat [34:57] yourself over and over again the other [34:58] thing is when we're using our voice I [35:01] don't want you to uh I want you to set [35:03] your expectations so high that your dog [35:05] will respond to sit the same way they'll [35:07] respond to [35:09] sit but not like not yeah yeah not like [35:12] this escalating amount how often do we [35:14] see that you know when people like oh my [35:15] dog knows how to do it down or does do [35:17] something it's down down down and then [35:20] it happens hey down right and then the [35:22] dog lies down and you're like absolutely [35:25] we don't really want to have to yell at [35:26] the dog in order for it to listen to us [35:28] for sure yeah and I mean it is important [35:30] and I want you to the reason we talk [35:32] about this is I want you to say I want [35:35] to set you up understanding your [35:37] weaknesses as well as your strengths as [35:39] you go into the real world and you're [35:41] trying to get more Focus from your [35:44] dog uh ending your training sessions [35:47] with a motivated dog I can't tell you [35:49] how important this is you have to [35:51] experience while you're ahead yeah let's [35:53] talk about quitting while you're ahead [35:54] uh and you know why that's such a [35:57] valuable thing especially when it's [35:58] something like the recall yeah I think [36:01] sometimes that um we can do things a [36:04] little bit too long especially if you [36:06] have a if you have a young dog or if you [36:08] have not even a young dog in terms of [36:10] age but just in you haven't had um you [36:13] haven't done a lot of training with your [36:15] dog they don't always start out with [36:17] these really long intention spans and [36:20] sometimes there's actually such thing as [36:22] training or expecting Focus for too long [36:26] of a period of time [36:28] at and you know you have to kind of Bank [36:31] on your dog's natural Focus that could [36:33] be that perhaps you try to train at [36:35] times where your dog is going to be more [36:37] focused like not at nap time maybe when [36:39] they're hungry or whatever it might be [36:41] use the advantage so that you can get as [36:43] much bang for your buck as you can um [36:46] but it is important that you quit uh [36:48] while you're doing something successful [36:50] so um and what that sometimes means is [36:53] that you have to to change your plan a [36:55] little bit so um K of say used with the [36:58] recall as an example perhaps you've done [37:01] a couple recalls and um you know the [37:04] first part of the recall is going great [37:05] but maybe your dog's not super focused [37:07] when they get to you they sit for two [37:08] seconds and then they want to get up and [37:10] sniff or they're looking over there um [37:12] you don't just want to be like H [37:13] whatever and like take the dog into the [37:14] car um you know practice something that [37:17] is really easy for your dog to do we [37:19] always try and say like okay we need a [37:21] win how do we get a win here what what [37:23] can we change so that your dog ends on [37:26] doing something success uccessful and [37:28] the goal is to try to quit before you've [37:32] lost your dog's Focus before they're [37:34] mentally tired or before that really [37:37] tough distraction comes by I want to try [37:39] and um end my training session or quit [37:42] when things are going well not when [37:44] things are going not well and and you'll [37:46] learn as you train your dog more what [37:49] their stamina is like and and what's [37:51] cool is as your dog starts to get more [37:54] into training they get more focus on you [37:56] they learn more their stamina gets [37:58] longer and their ability to focus it [38:01] lasts longer um you know if they start [38:03] off with a short attention span it [38:04] doesn't stay like that forever these are [38:07] things that improve as your training in [38:09] your relationship and your dog's [38:10] listening skills improve um but part of [38:13] it is you needing to be able to read the [38:15] situation and know whether you're going [38:16] to you know push and go farther or [38:20] whether you're like you know what I [38:21] don't feel like he's not as focused as [38:23] he was when we first started maybe I [38:25] need to switch to end on something [38:26] really easy sometimes for me um I do [38:29] this in agility training all of the time [38:31] it's EXA and I learned this through my [38:34] obedience training if I'm working on [38:36] something really tough and I know I'm [38:38] ready getting towards the end of my [38:40] training session I would like to end on [38:42] something that's super easy and [38:44] sometimes it has nothing to do with what [38:46] I'm working on so for example if I'm [38:48] working on like walking or recalls and I [38:51] feel like my dog's focus is starting to [38:53] waver a little bit I might stop and ask [38:55] my dog to sit and do like three or four [38:57] tricks change the dog's mind frame a [38:59] little bit and they're like oh we're [39:00] doing something different and then I [39:01] quit so that I I end with the dogs [39:03] engaged happy looking at me enjoying [39:07] what they're doing um switching it from [39:09] something that's maybe a little bit more [39:10] challenging for my dog to something that [39:12] I know is dead easy yeah um I I've got [39:15] two points first one I want to say you [39:18] know you might be wondering well what [39:19] does that training plan look like like [39:20] what do these excises look like how do I [39:22] make it a little bit easier this is [39:23] exactly you know it's tough to [39:25] communicate a lot of these things on [39:26] YouTube We Fix specific problems for [39:28] specific dogs short periods of time very [39:30] vanilla

[40:59] training programs when they're young so [41:01] that we can stop bad things from [41:03] happening in the first place so that's [41:05] my advice to you do not wait start [41:07] immediately yeah oh my gosh it makes [41:09] your life so much easier it's uh this is [41:11] use it for an example this is a mistake [41:13] I made for sure and you know I I I um I [41:16] encourage students to do the same thing [41:18] but uh it's the ounce of prevention is [41:19] worth a pound of cure you know those [41:21] simple choices you make early on uh will [41:23] make a massive difference for your dog [41:26] but I do want to say you know we were [41:27] talking a little bit about ending every [41:29] training session with a win and people [41:30] are probably think I know you might be [41:32] thinking well how long should I train [41:34] for then like how can I plan ahead so [41:36] that I'm making good choices here's a [41:38] quick hack break down whatever amount of [41:40] time you have in uh for training [41:42] sessions throughout the day like you [41:44] know maybe I don't know how organized [41:46] you are I'm not this organized but our [41:47] our trainers do this a lot they'll block [41:49] out you know time and you know when can [41:51] I train how much time do I have left [41:52] over in the day break that up into small [41:54] pieces so you train for 5 minutes you [41:57] know when you're go for potty in the [41:58] morning you train for a couple of [42:00] minutes with your dog's food with their [42:02] meal you train for 15 minutes whenever [42:05] you get home from work and then you [42:06] train for 20 minutes in after dinner [42:09] when you have a little bit more time [42:10] shortening those training training [42:11] sessions make sure that you have a [42:13] refreshed motivated dog that's ready to [42:16] listen and learn and this is how you can [42:18] make sure that you know at least you [42:20] know you've got enough gas in the tank [42:23] to Kale's Point ending with a motivated [42:25] dog ending on a win you know maybe if [42:27] you're struggling with an exercise [42:29] doesn't matter what it is then all you [42:31] need to do is get a win on a get in at [42:33] your side or get a win with your dog [42:35] sitting and a distraction goes by a win [42:37] with your dog in a Sit Stay and you're [42:39] Clapping Your Hands it doesn't matter [42:41] what it is but ending on that win is a [42:43] really great tool or is a really great [42:45] um way to make sure that like your [42:49] training it's it's the last impression [42:51] is a lasting impression for your dog and [42:53] I want you to think about that you know [42:55] what how how did we end the other thing [42:57] you do need to be mindful of and we talk [42:59] a lot about this with talk a lot about [43:01] this with our students is um you are a [43:04] big part of the equation so there are [43:07] some days when you're like boy I'm tired [43:09] boy this is not going great I'm not in [43:12] the right head space to train right now [43:14] that's okay you know you need to take [43:17] care of you first also you might not be [43:19] giving those dogs the best information [43:22] if you're just not feeling it if you're [43:24] extra tired if you're extra sick [43:26] whatever might be going on so make sure [43:28] you're bringing the most you you can to [43:31] your training sessions it's it's going [43:32] to be really helpful and you'll know you [43:34] know you'll know when you feel like [43:35] training you know there are some days [43:37] when you just don't train after classes [43:39] I just try and do something brainless [43:42] like play tug or throw the Holy Roller [43:44] down the hallway a couple times lots of [43:47] links looting what puppies learn first [43:49] they learn best yeah that's probably [43:51] something we've mentioned in 50 of our [43:53] videos but it's also love it love it [43:57] absolutely it's so much easier to uh you [43:59] know give the puppy the great on a puppy [44:01] Essentials t-shirt we talk a little bit [44:04] about using toys in training um why toys [44:07] are valuable why might you choose a toy [44:09] as a reward instead of uh treats in [44:12] training uh well there's some dogs that [44:14] aren't as U motivated by treats we we [44:16] trained a bord Col that wasn't as [44:18] motivated by Treats but um there are [44:20] certain exercises that um I will train [44:23] with a puppy that I actually prefer [44:25] using a toy in [44:29] I think it gets um a more animated [44:33] response from the dog um it allows like [44:36] a little bit of longer engagement [44:38] between me and the puppy it allows me to [44:40] play and get my hands on them and you [44:42] know I like to playfully I was joking [44:44] before about the clap and the slap [44:46] that's um you know a fun little game [44:48] when we're tugging we like to tug and [44:50] then we'll like tickle the puppy side or [44:51] push them away and just playful little [44:53] engagements that make the puppy like [44:55] really want to you know get into the to [44:57] play um that's a fun thing to do but [44:59] typically if I'm going to use a toy to [45:01] reward my dog for things I will use them [45:03] for exercises that are already active so [45:07] things like response to name um recalls [45:10] um chase games things where the Dog's In [45:13] Motion I would not use a toy for things [45:16] like lying calmly on their bed or sit [45:19] stays or things like that where I want [45:20] the dog to be a bit bit more Mindful and [45:22] thoughtful and I want the dog to sort of [45:24] be in a stationary position as they're [45:26] being rewarded um I also don't always [45:29] use uh toys for like walking for example [45:32] because when you're trying to play tug [45:34] with the dog it's hard for them to hold [45:37] heel position at your left- hand side so [45:38] I pick and choose the types of um [45:40] behaviors that I use for a toy but I [45:42] think it also makes the training session [45:44] a bit more interesting so that you know [45:46] when I train things with my dog or I am [45:48] doing a specific training session I try [45:51] to do a few different things where I can [45:53] use different types of rewards because [45:54] it keeps it sort of replenishes the [45:57] dog's attention a little bit um I've [45:59] also trained lots of different breeds we [46:00] have a toy poodle uh hippie Shake she's [46:03] 10 years old now but when she was a [46:05] puppy and we were training her she has [46:07] this tiny little belly and you know if I [46:09] would train her for 15 20 minutes she [46:12] would be completely full and then I [46:13] couldn't use the treats anymore so I had [46:16] to be a bit creative about okay what [46:18] exercises do I want to use food for here [46:21] and what exercises do I not because if [46:23] I'm trying to make you know going into [46:25] an hourong obedience class class I had [46:27] to be thoughtful and intentional about [46:29] how I was using food and how I was using [46:31] the rewards because she literally would [46:34] get full um so every dog is a bit [46:36] different and um you kind of want to be [46:38] able to pull from uh all of these [46:40] different options to rewards but toys [46:42] are such a great way to do it and if [46:47] your dog has natural toy drive that's [46:48] awesome if they don't you can train that [46:51] in your dog and in my opinion it's [46:53] really really worth doing it um you know [46:56] a dog that learns to play retrieve is a [46:59] dog that is going to be healthier [47:00] overall you can play fetch you know [47:02] every day to keep your dog in shape it's [47:05] way healthier for them than um you know [47:08] taking them for a walk if you go for a [47:09] walk and then you play fetch you know [47:11] once a day it helps their heart it [47:14] builds muscle it's it's so helpful it [47:16] tires them out they can come inside and [47:18] nap um playing fetch is so important but [47:22] sometimes if like some people will shake [47:23] a toy in front of the dog's nose the [47:25] dog's like man they go oh well they [47:26] don't like toys and then they just write [47:28] itely um but you can work at it and [47:31] really teach the dog um that it's a fun [47:33] thing and in my opinion it's really [47:35] really worth the time to do that so yeah [47:38] and when you're outside when you're [47:40] trying to build focus with your dog I [47:42] mean there is no better way than playing [47:44] a game of tug oh so fun you know if [47:47] you're in your backyard you have your [47:48] dog on a line and you're ending your [47:51] response to name with getting to you and [47:53] playing tug like what a powerful [47:55] relationship building opport opportunity [47:57] that is to remind your dog that hey [47:59] buddy we're at the park but the best [48:01] thing that can happen today is that we [48:02] get to play this game and it only [48:04] happens between you and I like that's [48:06] the thing I learned about tug I I am so [48:08] um high on the tug idea of using tug to [48:10] build relationship quickly because [48:12] number one you got to work on your out [48:14] exercise great leadership number two you [48:16] can burn off a bunch of energy very [48:18] quickly teach them about manners not [48:19] grabbing it absolutely a little bit of [48:21] mindfulness and self-control number [48:23] three the uh it's all about you the only [48:28] way this thing is valuable is because [48:29] you're on the end of it and when it when [48:31] you're talking about trying to get your [48:33] dogs focus in a new environment or you [48:35] know uh practicing these things so [48:37] either dog defaults to you naturally a [48:40] tug toy and a response to name is an [48:42] amazing way to do that if you have five [48:44] minutes tomorrow uh and you go home for [48:46] lunch let's say and uh you have a couple [48:48] minutes you want to do something with [48:49] your dog maybe you're work from home [48:50] whatever go outside and play tug with [48:52] them go out in your backyard play tug [48:54] with them and watch how well it works [48:56] when you go back you know to your office [48:58] or when you you you know they go down go [49:00] inside and lie down and then the next [49:02] time you go outside they sniff the grass [49:04] a bit and they check in with you because [49:05] they're like hey remember last time we [49:07] were outside you had something great I [49:10] how um how are we doing for uh puppy [49:12] tugs right now I don't know oh oh boy [49:16] I'm going to tell you about a game that [49:17] we play and then you're all going to [49:18] race to get puppy tugs I hope we have [49:20] enough for you I you guys might buy them [49:21] out I'm not sure I don't know what so [49:23] one of our favorite games to play with [49:25] tug are restraint recalls and we do this [49:27] with all of our young dogs like up until [49:30] they're like a year old and sometimes we [49:32] still do it now if we want to Tire them [49:33] up a little bit so we have a we call [49:36] them puppy tugs and they are like four [49:38] feet long and and the length is [49:40] important here because what we have one [49:42] person do and you can do this with one [49:44] person if you don't have a a helper as [49:46] well but ideally you can get the family [49:48] members involved um have somebody hold [49:51] the puppy the person who's holding on to [49:53] the four foot tug toy it's long and [49:54] skinny and very soft uh to get their [49:57] mouth around so it's very encouraging [49:58] very rewarding to grab you dangle the [50:01] tug in front of the puppy's nose and [50:03] then you take off and run hoot and [50:05] Haller call their name and then person [50:07] who's holding their puppy lets go of the [50:09] pup and lets them chase after and once [50:11] they get to you you let them grab onto [50:12] the tug by by having a 4 foot tug it can [50:15] actually kind of drag on the ground a [50:17] little bit behind the person and that en [50:19] encourages Chase Drive it also ensures [50:21] that your puppy doesn't nip you because [50:22] they can bite an end that's much farther [50:25] away from your hand which is why so [50:26] great for puppies so favorite puppy toy [50:29] totally we we shot a video with that um [50:31] I forget what the puppy's name was but [50:32] it was that night in uh at the training [50:35] facility Percy and watching that puppy [50:37] who has no relationship with kale at [50:39] this point he was amazing engage with [50:41] that tug toy in a brand new environment [50:43] when all he wants to do is roll around [50:45] and chew chew on the leaves and sniff [50:47] the corners of the fenced area that's [50:50] the kind of stuff we're talking about [50:51] that's the kind of exercise you should [50:54] be doing with your dog those are the [50:55] kinds of relationship building [50:57] activities that you need to focus on [50:58] regardless of where you are in your [51:00] training Journey this is the stuff that [51:02] completely turned around my my [51:04] understanding of dog training and it [51:06] really made it fun you know it just [51:08] brings fun to training and the best part [51:10] is it doesn't ever feel like training [51:11] because it's fun for you fun for the dog [51:13] and then you go back inside you put your [51:15] feet up watch Netflix and your pup just [51:17] wants to sleep like I'm so tired isn't [51:19] that how you imagine dog ownership at [51:21] some point or they can go and sleep [51:22] peacefully in their crate without [51:23] barking absolutely totally so you know [51:27] these are the things you can do to get [51:29] better focus from your dog and it [51:31] doesn't have to be work and it doesn't [51:32] have to be complicated and it it doesn't [51:34] really need to involve a specific tool [51:36] all the time there's all sorts of [51:38] strategies talking about understanding [51:40] that being outside out a layer of [51:42] difficulty high value food whatever it [51:44] is whatever you think it is might not [51:46] always work and what you have to do to [51:49] sort that out with your dog using motion [51:51] valuable tool using your voice always [51:54] with you it's something that you can use [51:56] to get your dog's attention anywhere but [51:58] use it correctly and ending your [52:00] training sessions with a win maybe it's [52:02] a game uh of restrained recall with with [52:04] a puppy tug or fuzzy ball tug or [52:06] something like that that your dog just [52:07] finds super engaging fuzzy ball tug [52:09] that's five's favorite oh absolutely [52:11] yeah those are great toys these are the [52:13] things that I want you to think about [52:15] when you're figuring out your next [52:16] training session outside with your dog [52:18] to get more focused so that they're [52:20] naturally choosing you um uh Dan lots of [52:24] links I guess you should play with while [52:25] the pup is on leash if it's it's in a [52:26] public park Absolut yeah what get [52:29] yourself a long line um Natalia uh get [52:32] yourself a long line so like a 20 foot [52:34] line um so that your puppy has a bit of [52:37] space to run around but that you can [52:39] either attach it to your belt or you can [52:41] hold it in your hand that way your dog [52:43] has a little bit of freedom to run and [52:44] play but then of course until they have [52:46] a really reliable recall or perhaps [52:48] you're somewhere where your dog's not [52:49] allowed to be off leash it does give [52:51] them a chance to uh run and play but you [52:53] still have control absolutely huge thank [52:56] you to all of our moderators tonight [52:58] thank you to everyone who dropped a [52:59] super chat or super sticker thank you to [53:02] you if you have a dog [53:04] who is distracted by the noises outside [53:07] if you're we had an issue

[53:17] good experience for the dog that needed [53:19] it that we started working with music [53:22] content creators they developed music [53:24] that's specifically for the dog with the [53:25]

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,, Part 373/429,~Ken === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:02] I just got a notification that Ryan and [00:04] his dog Bentley are coming in for a [00:07] private lesson now you might recognize [00:08] Bentley because we've actually used him [00:10] before in one of our videos when he was [00:12] a little puppy but now he is large and [00:14] in charge and they are really struggling [00:16] with leash walking so today we're going [00:18] to talk about how to get them to stop [00:19] pulling on the leash which is really [00:21] going to be about getting better focus [00:23] now the cool thing about this is all the [00:24] exercises that I'm going to show them [00:26] you can do at home with your own dog I'm [00:29] K McAn welcome back to M [00:33] dogs we're here today with Ryan and his [00:37] yellow labador Bentley and uh we're [00:39] going to be talking a little bit about [00:41] walking on leash Ryan is here today [00:43] because he's been having uh I wouldn't [00:46] say some issues with walking on leash [00:48] but there's a a bunch of things going on [00:50] that I think you guys will relate to um [00:52] with different uh styles of walks [00:54] different family members possibly having [00:56] different expectations for walks we've [00:58] all been there so why don't you fill in [01:00] the blanks a little bit so that we kind [01:01] of can pick the direction we want to go [01:03] in today yeah so the big the biggest [01:05] confusion at home that we're having is [01:07] the difference the different types of [01:08] walks there's like the we going pee [01:11] before you know first in the morning and [01:14] then and then we have the you know we're [01:16] going for a walk like we're going like [01:18] you know to the park or we're going [01:20] around the block we got a small block a [01:21] big block walk you got a lot of [01:23] different walks happing what a lucky dog [01:26] that's great um okay and typically you [01:29] said that little bit of pulling [01:30] sometimes a lot of pulling depending on [01:32] the family member and a lot of sniffing [01:35] a lot of sniffing a lot of sniffing and [01:37] um sniffing you know can be fine um but [01:40] it also can be a little bit frustrating [01:42] especially when you're like trying to go [01:43] for a walk and the dog's just stopping [01:45] and sniffing everywhere and um before we [01:48] sort of gotone on camera you had talked [01:49] to me about the idea of a sniff walk and [01:53] um I thought that that would be a good [01:54] place to start because even just [01:55] standing around he's doing a lot of [01:57] sniffing and there is nothing wrong with [01:59] that how ever there's going to be times [02:01] where we want to walk him where we want [02:02] to be in control whether he's like [02:05] disengaged in kind of doing his own [02:06] thing and relaxing and walking and [02:08] whatever taking in the sights and smells [02:10] all good versus like we're walking [02:12] together and you're not going to stop [02:13] every 3 seconds and like sniff or like [02:15] pee on it everything so there's um a [02:18] more of relax Style walk and then [02:19] there's more of like a walk walk walk [02:22] walk we're starting a new trend here on [02:24] uh YouTube called walk walks um anyways [02:27] so we'll talk a little a little bit [02:28] about that um I don't want to knock [02:30] sniff walking but I do want to talk [02:32] about how if you're trying to train him [02:34] to walk on a leash with you and be [02:36] engaged with you and that he's also [02:38] getting a lot of opportunity to rehearse [02:39] like walking disengage and sniffing it [02:41] can be hard initially for the dog to [02:43] understand the difference between the [02:44] two um what I think we should do is [02:47] focus more on the actual like controlled [02:49] walking first to get a little bit more [02:51] engagement and then I'm going to talk to [02:53] you about how you can still do the [02:54] relaxed sniff walking that's not going [02:56] to like unravel all of the other hard [02:57] work you're going to do in order to get [02:59] him to walk on a leash okay does that [03:00] make sense y okay absolutely perfect [03:02] okay so I've just sorry you're going to [03:05] hold it in your thumb and gather it up [03:07] like this and then this is basically [03:09] it's going to go in your right hand like [03:11] so so the um collar or the clip of the [03:15] leash should sort of Point down this is [03:16] sort of the goal we're looking for so [03:18] when he's walking there's like a nice [03:20] gentle J in the leash so that there's no [03:21] pressure now if we need to redirect him [03:24] in any way you're always going to do it [03:25] with your left hand so this is like your [03:27] your breaking hand so let me just show [03:29] you quickly so if I was walking and I [03:31] needed to redirect him I would take my [03:32] left hand down and I would just move my [03:34] leash in whatever Direction I needed to [03:36] to get him back to my side it's sort of [03:38] like putting a um your foot on the brake [03:40] in the car once you have the dog back [03:42] where you need to you're going to [03:43] release again because what a lot of [03:44] people do when they walk the dog is they [03:46] end up walking with their left hand on [03:48] the leash constantly like this now yes [03:50] he's walking in position but he's not [03:53] showing any type of leash respect I'm [03:55] just sort of pulling him around the goal [03:57] is that my leash could be loose and that [03:59] I could walk him around now typically [04:00] because he probably doesn't really know [04:01] what he's doing yet he doesn't know how [04:02] to hold position he's going to be [04:05] pulling so this is where my leash [04:06] pressure can come in okay so those are [04:08] the [04:09] mechanics um we're going to practice [04:11] this in a second the last element is [04:14] when I'm doing this I'm not just going [04:15] to walk my dog and do all training with [04:17] like correcting him here and there [04:18] that's not going to be a very nice way [04:20] to introduce something to my dog I'm [04:22] going to use that but I'm also going to [04:23] use some rewards to either help or to [04:26] reward him um and that means that the [04:28] food is most easily held on the left [04:30] hand side so you are ready to go that [04:33] way I can feed I can use my left hand so [04:35] my right hand hangs out here my left [04:37] hand is like hard at work doing tons of [04:39] stuff okay so come over here and grab [04:42] this from [04:43] me okay so first thing we're going to do [04:46] is we're going to start very very simple [04:48] and we're going to make it easy for him [04:49] to be successful so when we're training [04:50] something new the the idea is not to put [04:52] the dog in a situation to fail where we [04:54] have to like do a bunch of Corrections [04:55] because that's a very nice way to learn [04:57] something new we're going to try and [04:59] make it easier for him so for this first [05:01] step you're going to have food in your [05:02] left hand and I literally want you to [05:04] put the food right on his nose and I [05:06] want you to lure him you're going to [05:07] walk up and down this little space here [05:09] seeing if you can get him to walk at [05:11] your left hand side if you run out of [05:13] food oh good boy I see that you like [05:16] food if you run into food you're just [05:18] going to stop and make them sit and then [05:19] get more food out so how many treats do [05:21] you have there okay you put like four in [05:22] your [05:23] hand oh he's like okay I'm into this [05:27] yeah so again this is what we would do [05:28] with the dogs um like in your backyard [05:32] on your driveway not out for a half hour [05:34] walk this is just like step one of [05:36] getting the dogs engage and we're going [05:38] to power through progressions really [05:39] quickly here um but this is what we need [05:41] to do we need to start with the dog [05:43] understanding okay this is my [05:44] expectation this is what I need to do [05:46] before we start adding more more [05:47] challenging things okay are you ready so [05:49] you're going when you hold your hand [05:50] You're Going To Hold Your Hand Knuckles [05:51] forward perfect and then just walk that [05:53] way see if you can lure them in at your [05:55] side good and then yes and reward yes [05:58] good and when you feed see how when you [06:00] feed him he's perpendicular to you you [06:03] can actually teach him to walk yeah [06:05] exactly if you bring him your hand like [06:07] this there and then turn his head away [06:09] now you straighten the spine there we go [06:11] walk forward and then keep your left [06:13] hand off if you can perfect now feed yes [06:16] perfect perfect perfect that's good [06:18] excellent good okay now take the food [06:19] and help him to turn around you so that [06:21] the leash doesn't tighten feed again [06:23] okay perfect oh yeah good keep your hand [06:26] uh flipped forward there you go good and [06:29] then you're do one more [06:31] turn yep hand forward yep good and then [06:35] when you're ready just stop and have him [06:36] sit sit Yay good boy so this is good he [06:41] doesn't really have a concept of [06:43] position uh yet because he he's just [06:45] learning this but isn't it interesting [06:47] that even just turning your hand this [06:49] way versus that way gets you a [06:50] completely different thing and why we're [06:52] so strict about the dog walking this way [06:54] is because we're trying to have a really [06:55] high expectation so that if I'm walking [06:57] on a street or I'm passing people I [06:59] don't have the dog just like walking [07:00] wherever I'm really particular about the [07:03] dog walking perfectly at my left hand [07:04] side now am I going to go for a half [07:06] hour walk with my dog marching at my [07:08] left hand side no I'm not going to go [07:09] for an hour walk I'm not going to go for [07:10] a 10-minute walk like that this is just [07:12] what we're going to use to get a little [07:14] bit more control and then we can loosen [07:16] the rains from there to let the dog have [07:17] a little bit more freedom okay we're [07:19] going to um sort of add a new step now [07:22] because we are walking back and forth [07:23] there's not a lot of distractions out [07:25] here what we also need to work on with [07:26] this dog is his ability to walk past or [07:29] toward towards a distraction and [07:30] understand to leave it so I have a few [07:32] toys here I just have an empty food bowl [07:34] for now hopefully we can add a few [07:36] distractions um to that in a second and [07:39] we're going to work a little bit on [07:40] distractions and changing direction okay [07:43] R come on this way okay okay just walk [07:45] past this and let's just see if he's [07:46] interested in [07:47] it it good okay so little bit interested [07:51] which is great now actually Ryan you did [07:53] a good job of saying leave it but what [07:55] we want to try and get to the point of [07:57] is when you walk past it his leash [07:59] doesn't go tight so he was really good [08:01] there when you said leave it and you [08:02] kept going forward he eventually left it [08:05] but what we're going to try and do is [08:07] get the leave it to work so well that he [08:09] doesn't even go to sniff in the first [08:11] place that's sort of the goal we're off [08:13] to a good start though just with what I [08:14] saw there so what we're going to try and [08:16] do is the goals can to be able to walk [08:18] towards the items say leave it and be [08:21] able to turn away from the items with [08:23] him still holding position at your side [08:25] with a leash uh a loose leash okay yeah [08:28] you're like okay this cool [08:30] bu can you do this step number one [08:32] because we're going we're try and set [08:32] him up for Success before we make it [08:34] harder is you're going to start with him [08:35] on your left hand side you're going to [08:36] have food in your left hand you're going [08:38] to move forward you're going to reward [08:39] him he's going to probably check that [08:41] out and even if he doesn't don't worry [08:42] about it you're going to say leave it [08:44] and without even hesitation put the food [08:47] on his nose and turn his attention away [08:49] from the reward oh that was an air treat [08:52] not a calorie in him uh and then reward [08:54] him from there okay so I want him to [08:56] hear the word and then be lured away and [08:58] get a reward so he says o I like the [09:00] word leave it I know what to happen Okay [09:02] I would only go within maybe four three [09:04] 4T of that so that it's not too [09:06] distracting so walk forward a few steps [09:08] good leave it leave it yes good and then [09:12] yes and reward good okay he was actually [09:14] pretty good there I want to try it again [09:16] what I would love to do is have it work [09:18] so that his leash doesn't um go tight [09:21] during the Y looser and when you say [09:23] leave it rather than keeping your hand [09:24] this High put it right smack down [09:26] literally touch the food to his nose and [09:28] lure away cuz I want it to be like more [09:31] exciting for him okay so let's go [09:34] good leave it and turn them away good [09:38] good so he's following the food [09:39] everything's good now what I want to do [09:42] is see if we can work a little bit more [09:43] on the act of him checking the thing out [09:46] and then uh Turning Away um what I also [09:48] want to do is see if we can do this with [09:50] using the food now as a reward rather [09:52] than a lure so what you're going to do [09:54] this time is you're not going to have [09:55] any food in your hands you're going to [09:57] have your left hand free you're going to [09:58] walk forward he's going to hopefully [10:00] check the the toys out and I might [10:02] assist him to do that you're going to [10:04] say leave it pause for a second and see [10:06] what he does what I want him to do is [10:08] immediately turn back to you on your [10:10] word without the leash without the treat [10:11] nothing if he doesn't you're going to [10:14] say leave it and then you're going to [10:16] take the leash and give a little pop pop [10:18] towards you on the leash from there so [10:19] it's going to feel like this if I do it [10:20] to you leave it you're going to pop on [10:22] the leash towards you when you do that [10:25] he's going to turn back and then you're [10:26] going to praise him but you're not going [10:27] to give him a treat okay [10:29] away when yeah I keep it handy though um [10:32] yeah perfect and then so when we move it [10:34] again what the goal is is that if I'm [10:36] able to say leave it and he's able to [10:37] turn on my verbal then I will use the [10:39] food for that so now if he doesn't [10:41] listen he gets a little leash correction [10:43] if he does listen then he gets a reward [10:45] simplifying it but I'm going to talk you [10:47] through it okay so Hand left hand off [10:49] the leash for a second you're only going [10:50] to use it if he pulls walk towards the [10:52] items good good and walk away yes and [10:54] reward him good boy good can make a [10:57] little harder now good boy good okay [10:59] walk towards the end again left hand off [11:01] only if only if he goes to pull now say [11:03] leave it leave it leave it yeah move [11:05] away move away move away quick right [11:07] quick right y [11:09] good well that didn't take very long [11:11] that was good good boy okay good boy [11:15] your positive feedback reaction is like [11:18] a three and I want it to be a 10 cuz [11:21] that was really super you said leave it [11:24] and he sort of turned and then you sort [11:25] of were like I don't know if you were [11:26] surprised but he was amazing so what [11:29] also happens and why this is important [11:31] if I say leave it and he looks away but [11:33] then I still stand here right against [11:35] that thing the likelihood of him being [11:37] like okay well there's nothing happening [11:38] so maybe I should look back is really [11:40] high but if I say leave it he turns I'm [11:42] like woohoo good boy and I get away from [11:44] that distraction I'll stop him imagine [11:46] that was like a dead fish or like [11:47] something disgusting not like cute toys [11:49] okay uh okay so uh back yourself up [11:51] again so you have a little bit more [11:53] distance go here all right no over here [11:56] all right start your walking bring your [11:58] left hand in just it's not distraction [12:01] good good wow buddy leave it yes good [12:04] boy good boy you can reward that good [12:07] boy boy so I just want to State the [12:10] obvious here because sometimes it can be [12:11] really difficult you see this little [12:13] exercise here Ryan's doing a great job [12:14] at it Bentley's doing a great job at it [12:16] we are controlling the distraction we're [12:18] controlling the environment but how do [12:21] you go from something like this where [12:22] you're like in the comfort of your [12:24] although it's not terribly comfortable [12:25] right now because it's really cold out [12:27] here um but you're in your own little [12:30] controlled space to being able to [12:31] actually go out for a walk because it [12:33] can be really challenging and Ryan had [12:35] mentioned that when he has food on him [12:36] typically it goes really well he's got a [12:38] lab uh very food motivated dog um but [12:41] the goal here is that I want to train my [12:43] dog well enough that I can get to the [12:45] point where he listens to me without if [12:48] I don't have my treats on on me my dog [12:50] still listens if I'm passing by another [12:51] dog my dog still listens if my grandma's [12:53] walking my dog my dog still listens we [12:55] need to sort of get to the point where [12:57] we're training the skill so good [12:59] that um it works in all of these [13:02] different situations but I think the [13:03] problem is people don't spend enough [13:05] time on the foundational training of [13:07] teaching leave it teaching value for [13:09] leave it because now even after like 5 [13:11] minutes we say leave it we do a little [13:13] bit of pressure on the leash and he's [13:14] like okay what do you want for me now I [13:16] have some something to work on so when [13:18] I'm out against a high Lev distraction [13:21] he's like oh we've played those games [13:22] before versus a lot of people what they [13:24] do is is they go for a walk and they are [13:26] bombarded with all these distractions [13:27] but they have zero training behind them [13:30] to actually deal with those things and [13:32] the dog doesn't say like I I want him to [13:34] say you are more valuable than the [13:37] treats and the toys on the floor you are [13:38] more valuable than the dog because if [13:40] the dog feels that way I hardly have to [13:42] work at all to get the dog back on [13:44] distractions but if they don't really [13:45] care about you and listening to you then [13:48] it's it's a bit of a harder battle so we [13:50] need to take these little mini drills [13:52] and apply them to real life I'm going to [13:54] have holding the leash the same way I [13:55] told you to do it we're just going to [13:57] walk and see what happens here [13:59] now if he goes to sniff I'm actually [14:02] fine with it provided that he keeps his [14:04] leash loose oh you're being a good boy [14:06] now okay [14:08] good so if he goes to pull right now [14:11] this is fine I'm going to let this go [14:14] but if I go forward Oh I thought I'd get [14:17] you if I go forward there he can stiff [14:21] he can do whatever as long as the leash [14:23] doesn't go tight so it goes tight hey [14:25] I'm going to do a couple Pops in the [14:26] leash yes that's good boy so I'm not C [14:29] walking here where like he has to stare [14:30] at me but he isn't allowed to pull so if [14:33] we're like walking actually going for [14:34] like a walk walk and chilling out walk [14:36] walk yeah I don't care about okay [14:38] there's pulling hey pop pop pop that's [14:41] better good boy so every time he goes to [14:44] pull I'm going to use those Pops hey hey [14:48] haha good boy right here good yes the [14:52] pops need to happen until he like [14:54] re-engages with me come on good boy so I [14:59] see how I don't care if he's on my right [15:00] I don't care about that all I care right [15:02] yes all I care about that is that he is [15:05] holding um some type of respect to the [15:08] leash he doesn't even have to look at me [15:10] now I just gave a big yes there and I [15:12] think the camera will probably be able [15:13] to see is he actually just went to pull [15:15] stopped himself and checked in with me [15:17] so I look for those moments to say [15:19] that's smart little dog good choice okay [15:22] I actually with my dogs don't even put [15:23] this okay pull see po po pop I don't [15:26] really put this on too much of a command [15:27] cuz it just expect them to do this good [15:30] that's better so pop if he pulls and [15:33] then prays when he's back if we go a few [15:35] steps and there's no pulling Bentley [15:37] leave it yes good boy we saw a bird I'm [15:42] on it I saw him look I said Bentley [15:44] leave it I have too many pockets I can't [15:46] find my cheese um but he he listened and [15:50] did the leash go tight no Noe he rocked [15:52] it sorry Ben you have to wait 10 years [15:54] for me to give you one piece of cheese [15:56] there we go now if it takes a bit to get [15:59] the food out that's fine I already did [16:01] my big yes and [16:06] praise yeah stop that good good boy [16:09] there we go so in the early stages you [16:12] might have to do a lot of Bentley leave [16:15] it yeah I'm not going to reward him for [16:18] that because he was like kind of [16:19] thinking about whether he should come [16:20] back or not good boy in the early stages [16:23] I might have to fix him a [16:25] lot but eventually he'll learned just [16:27] yes there [16:29] good eventually he'll just to check in [16:31] with me and I won't have to talk to him [16:34] quite so much but it's a lot of work [16:36] right yeah um but if you can do this and [16:39] then you can get your your wife and [16:40] whoever else on board playing around [16:42] with this a little bit um I actually [16:44] think that you probably can do this [16:46] training just with the uh regular caller [16:48] because he is so respectful to those [16:50] little pops but he needs um better [16:53] timing better inform timing to be better [16:56] um [16:57] information hold on [16:59] there is something ringing in my [17:03] pocket it's a alarm hold on I can't see [17:07] okay let me try that again that's never [17:09] happened before it was my watch um [17:11] anyways I actually think that um your [17:14] wife and your kids and whoever's walking [17:16] the dogs will probably be able to have [17:17] success with this if they do a little [17:19] bit of this but he just needs [17:20] information with better timing I think [17:22] he's just allowed I don't think he [17:23] realizes that just riding the leash is [17:26] also not okay see he can be around on [17:28] the leash even right now he's showing [17:29] leash respect he can be on the leash [17:31] without pulling but we have to be a [17:33] little bit more on top of him that was [17:35] so good wow good okay I think Ryan and [17:41] Bentley did a great job they have some [17:43] of the basics down and hopefully after [17:44] watching this video you will as well now [17:46] your walking training does not end here [17:48] so if you're looking to take your [17:49] walking to the next level make sure you [17:51] check out that video right there on that [17:54] note I'm kale

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,, Part 386/429,~Ken #puppybiting #mccanndogs === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] today we're going to be talking about [00:01] one of the most frustrating problems [00:03] when it comes to raising a puppy I [00:05] wonder what it could be and that is [00:08] nipping biting barking all of the things [00:10] that our puppies do that drive us [00:12] absolutely crazy now on my lap is this [00:15] adorable little blue healer puppy his [00:17] name is Zeke and uh his owner V has come [00:20] to visit with me today and we are going [00:21] to do a little private lesson to work on [00:24] some of the naughty behaviors this cute [00:26] little Zeke um is [00:28] doing there we go on Q I'm kale mccan [00:31] welcome back to mccan dogs so he's not [00:34] nipping and biting right now but I would [00:36] say he's being slightly obnoxious right [00:39] yeah so what we would do in this [00:41] situation is use like for me if my dogs [00:43] were barking I would tell the dog quiet [00:45] and after I give the word that I want [00:47] him to eventually Listen to I would [00:48] apply some type of discipline so we're [00:50] going to talk a little bit about how [00:51] we're going to do the discipline there's [00:53] a couple different ways that we're going [00:54] to do it so essentially you're going to [00:56] use a verbal marker when he's wrong and [00:59] in the early St ages you're going to [01:01] follow that with something physical now [01:03] I don't know if you just saw that but I [01:04] just went to put my hand on his nose [01:06] just to kind of settle him for a second [01:07] so I could talk and as soon as I went to [01:09] do that I got fighting okay so I'm going [01:13] to just let him do this for a second so [01:14] I can set the scene and then this is no [01:17] longer going to be allowed to happen [01:18] okay see it again so basically what I'm [01:21] to do is I'm I can do a couple things I [01:24] really like to make sure that the [01:25] puppies have a well- fit collar he does [01:28] point for you already it's nice and snug [01:30] if I get two fingers in there he's not [01:32] going to be able to flip around and do [01:34] any kind of Cra Crazy acrobats the [01:37] second thing that I'm going to do is [01:38] when I go to discipline him I'm going to [01:40] take my hand in his collar and I'm also [01:42] going to grab a little tiny bit of his [01:43] excess fur that he's going to grow into [01:46] we call this the Scruff and I'm going to [01:48] hold him on either one side of his head [01:50] or the other and what's going to happen [01:52] is the palm of my hand is going to sort [01:54] of brace against his cheek and why I'm [01:56] being so detailed about this explanation [01:59] is I need to hold hold him in a way that [02:00] he can't niit me anymore now when I do [02:04] that he is probably going to have a [02:06] meltdown okay now when I do this I'm not [02:09] going to yell or scream or do anything [02:11] I'm just going to be very quiet and as [02:14] soon as I see him start to go I'm not [02:16] getting anywhere and sort of relax I'm [02:18] going to release my grip just a little [02:20] bit not let go entirely just release my [02:22] grip and then I'm going to praise him so [02:24] what basically I'm doing is saying [02:25] you're wrong and when he starts to give [02:27] in me a little bit I'm going to say good [02:29] boy that's right now in the early stages [02:31] if they haven't had this done very much [02:33] um when you go to praise them they go [02:35] for round two and then they go for round [02:37] three so what might uh need to happen [02:39] you're getting uh lots of this on video [02:41] here uh what might need to happen is I [02:42] might need to go through the process a [02:44] couple times until I have him settled [02:47] okay okay so I'm going to go for it now [02:49] mama is putting a stop to this right now [02:51] so my hands in his collar the next time [02:53] he goes to bite I'm going to uh correct [02:55] him and then I'm going to see what [02:56] happens good boy good ah not knock it [03:00] off okay I'm going to hold now this is [03:03] common the front paws will come over now [03:05] see how he's bringing his front paws up [03:07] I don't lift the puppy dangle the puppy [03:10] I don't flip the puppy I just simply [03:12] hold until he settles and I like to use [03:15] my other hand to kind of get the dog [03:17] calm now this is a common thing they do [03:18] they flip I'm going to lift him up when [03:20] he does that knock it off that's [03:23] enough okay so we have some subtle [03:25] behavior I'm going to release a little [03:28] bit good boy and now I'm going to praise [03:32] good oh that's a good choice when I'm [03:35] holding the collar and I'm disciplining [03:37] what I'm looking for is a couple [03:38] different things sometimes they'll pin [03:40] their ears back a little bit sometimes [03:42] they'll um avert their gaze sometimes [03:45] they'll actually look at you but they [03:46] look at you with like you know the [03:48] expression sad puppy eyes they sort of [03:50] go like I'm sorry I didn't mean to do [03:51] that that type of thing um they M like [03:54] right now see he has like a really [03:55] relaxed mouth his ears are back a little [03:58] bit um he doesn't have he's not holding [04:00] any tension in his body those are the [04:03] things that you're looking for because [04:04] there was a few times there where I was [04:05] holding his collar and he was being [04:07] still but he was like this like ready to [04:10] go again and if I feel that in his body [04:13] I'm just going to continue holding until [04:15] I see him [04:16] go okay and at that point it's really [04:19] important that I praise and the reason [04:21] why I'm being so specific about the [04:22] timing is that this is not fun to do [04:25] it's also really hard to do which is why [04:26] people struggle with it but often I find [04:29] that either people um they aren't firm [04:32] enough or they don't have good enough [04:33] technique so the dog can nip and bite [04:35] and then we lose our confidence or [04:37] sometimes people discipline the dog [04:39] starts to show that like okay I get it I [04:41] get it and then they don't let go and [04:44] then the puppy goes okay like now I [04:45] don't know what to do because I've [04:47] showed you that I'm I'm good but you [04:49] just keep disciplining me so part of it [04:51] is reading the body language a little [04:53] bit now I'm going to talk to you a [04:54] little bit about the body language he's [04:56] stopping but he's not really giving me [04:58] any mind his whole brain is on what's [05:01] going on he's accepting it but he's not [05:03] really like sorry he's like okay fine [05:06] I'll stop until the next time that Yawn [05:09] is not being tired that's called a [05:11] stress yawn okay nothing to be worried [05:13] about what oh good boy that's wonderful [05:17] Choice what I see in a stress I don't [05:21] get too worried about is that I'm I'm [05:23] making progress here he's saying uh I [05:24] don't really like this but I guess I can [05:26] handle it but again when we're [05:27] disciplining it can't all be your you're [05:29] bad you're bad and shaking a puppy [05:31] around like a ragd doll that's not what [05:32] we're going for here I also need to take [05:34] the opportunity to find some find some [05:36] time to let him know he's right good [05:39] there we go so we have a little bit more [05:41] of a submissive puppy now um okay let me [05:44] talk to you about the leash [05:46] techniqu yes and when I'm going to feed [05:48] him I'm always going to make him turn [05:49] towards me so he knows the good stuff's [05:51] coming for me yeah so we talked about [05:54] the collar thing if you need to go to [05:56] the leash which you can do at any time [05:59] you're going to hold the leash as if [06:00] you're holding onto a baseball bat so [06:02] your thumbs are up your baby fingers are [06:04] down and you're going to lift and hold [06:06] like that um and then I'll be able to [06:08] tell you whether you need to continue [06:09] holding or whether you need to release [06:10] the pressure or not I think that [06:12] honestly the best thing to do is to try [06:14] and if anytime you're like get me out of [06:16] here just pass them off and I I'll take [06:18] over but I want to build your confidence [06:21] so that you know what to do yeah here we [06:23] go oh that's nice good now I'm going to [06:28] intentionally take his collar right now [06:31] yes and reward because I don't want him [06:33] to have a meltdown when I take his [06:35] collar cuz I need to take his collar all [06:36] the time so he see he a little bit [06:37] worried there so I'm going to take the [06:39] food put the food on his nose first this [06:41] time now grab the hair yes good and just [06:46] associate food on nose I'm not feeding [06:49] take the collar first good boy yes and [06:53] then I can reward so he starts to go [06:54] okay maybe you're not so bad after all [06:56] how about you come closer oh oh and [06:59] giving me little tricks too [07:02] yes okay so what's actually really [07:06] lovely about this puppy is his recovery [07:09] is top-notch excellent sometimes when [07:11] you first start applying pressure and [07:13] discipline oh he's trying all of the [07:15] things you're so sweet yes when you try [07:18] um discipline for the first time if the [07:19] puppies are you know a little bit [07:22] selfish in it for themselves you go to [07:24] discipline then they want nothing to do [07:25] with you the fact that he has no doesn't [07:27] have any relationship with me whatsoever [07:29] I've come in doesn't know me I've [07:31] disciplined him and he's sort of going [07:33] okay I think I can move on means you [07:35] have a really great puppy and sometimes [07:38] what happens when puppies are biting we [07:40] think oh my gosh like is so frustrating [07:42] he's awful he is a typical bratty young [07:46] puppy that doesn't know any better um [07:48] and being a cattle dog they can be a [07:50] little bit tenacious sometimes you're [07:51] tenacious you're strong but they also [07:54] can be super duper fun because they have [07:56] tons of energy they want to do stuff so [07:58] if you can kind of get them on the right [08:00] track they're like way more fun than [08:02] having to bump on a log for a dog like [08:04] he's going to want to do stuff right but [08:06] we just got to get him [08:07] organized and I would hold him a little [08:09] firmer there we go okay just hold on for [08:11] a second I don't have his scuff I just [08:12] have his that's okay and if you feel [08:14] like he can move around too much you are [08:15] going to grab a scrap the Scruff does [08:17] not hurt him at all CU all extraer he's [08:18] going to go into anyways just like his [08:20] mom would have exact exactly so you see [08:22] how he just nod there I would give him a [08:25] little shake for that too okay take [08:27] over you got it yep m [08:30] good and then if he feels settled [08:31] release the Scruff but don't release the [08:34] collar yeah you can hold the collar now [08:36] good now lift him up don't let him do [08:37] that right up quick quick quick quick [08:39] quick y good good V you lift him up [08:42] again just up toight so sort of sitting [08:44] or standing yep perfect good look at you [08:46] with the opposite hand good good good [08:49] good okay you can release your tension a [08:50] little bit just praise him with your [08:52] voice good boy good good okay don't let [08:55] go with this hand you can let him lie [08:56] down now and the reason why it's okay do [08:58] you feel the tension leaving his body [09:00] now just did you laid down that time [09:03] there go okay bring him out in front of [09:05] you the going to the beside is a bit of [09:07] an avoidance thing as well there okay [09:09] keep holding his collar good good okay [09:12] I'm going to give you a little treat I [09:14] might have taken the wind out of his [09:16] sails a little bit here you can feed him [09:17] so that the good stuff comes from you [09:18] good [09:19] boy good okay that was pretty good you [09:23] could be a little firmer okay okay but [09:25] it's cuz you haven't really done it yet [09:26] what whenever we go through this with [09:28] people people are always worried about [09:30] hurting the dog it will it's not in your [09:32] nature to hurt him you would never do it [09:34] firm enough to hurt him so do that is [09:36] not a concern so don't worry about that [09:39] good boy okay I want you to try now [09:41] maybe like while you're holding the [09:43] collar with this hand keep your grip [09:44] maybe try holding on to one of his paws [09:47] paw yeah good so then see when he did [09:50] that give him a little shake like that [09:52] when he does that knock it off okay try [09:56] again knock it off goe and K this time [10:00] don't ask him for the Paw just simply [10:01] pick it [10:02] up yep good good good my thing like my [10:07] um reaction is SL it's a little bit slow [10:09] but it's okay you're you're getting [10:10] better every time good at that look at [10:11] that good you're making some [10:14] change good now just take a hold of it [10:17] again the B [10:19] yep [10:21] yes good very good boy okay take a hold [10:28] again yeah yes I'm going to feed him [10:31] facing you I actually really like that [10:33] he give gave you eye contact there I'm [10:35] going to actually put this beside you [10:37] here so you can grab it okay grab his P [10:41] again yeah good no mou no mouthing so [10:45] even if he mous knock it off okay don't [10:47] wait till you get full-blown teeth [10:50] because if you wait until he's actually [10:52] gnawing you're going to have to do big [10:54] big discipline if he just threatens you [10:56] hey you can just give a little one the [10:58] goal is to only have to do if he's like [11:00] sniffing my hands sniffing is okay but [11:03] if he like open mouths towards [11:06] you that's [11:08] okay there you go yeah that's good good [11:11] good job good and then just like a [11:12] nitpicky timing thing it would be ideal [11:15] is as you're holding his paw and he's [11:17] not giving a reaction to say yes at that [11:19] moment so that you're sort of capturing [11:20] that moment let's try one more time hold [11:22] that paw [11:23] again that's it [11:27] good there Focus [11:29] it's okay hey yes good okay go ahead and [11:33] reward him and just draw his attention [11:34] to you all right [11:36] nice good okay and then let's release [11:39] him and give him a break for a second [11:40] good that was pretty good bud bud when [11:43] you're going to touch his paws or when [11:45] you're going to you know clip his [11:47] toenails or wipe his paws or whatever [11:49] you're doing where you need to touch him [11:51] ideally you don't really want him to [11:53] turn his head towards you at all you [11:54] want him just to go okay I'm going to [11:56] chill out and just let you do my thing [11:58] so even if you turns his head towards [12:00] you I wouldn't ah knock it off I just [12:02] might be like hey just leave it I would [12:03] just say it calmly I would just sort of [12:05] readjust his collar not in a [12:07] disciplinary way almost like a resetting [12:09] type of way so if you're not sure I [12:11] would just encourage him to move his [12:13] head Away by using his collar and then [12:16] if you feel any contact then I would [12:18] discipline a bit more if you actually [12:19] get biting or holding on to that then I [12:21] would discipline more so you can kind of [12:23] go up in levels hi bu depending on what [12:27] you need to know good boy now he does [12:30] chew on the towel too yes okay so the [12:33] same thing for discip uh for discipline [12:35] can be used for barking can be used for [12:37] chewing on the towels if he gets a shoe [12:39] in his mouth whatever it might be your [12:41] steps are always going to be first use [12:43] your voice so whatever sound or word so [12:46] if it was like chewing on the towel I [12:48] would probably say or something like [12:49] that or whatever you want like whatever [12:51] makes sense for you it really doesn't [12:53] matter what you use I usually do the [12:54] with I like with my cats too so yeah so [12:56] whatever whatever makes sense whatever [12:58] is going to come out of your mouth [12:59] naturally is what you should do because [13:01] you'll just to teach him like if I [13:03] wanted to teach my dog that spaghetti [13:04] was their discipline word I could do [13:06] that if I wanted the words don't matter [13:08] it's about what I train them to do [13:09] afterwards so you'll do your sound and [13:11] then from there you'll follow through so [13:13] if it's the towel in his mouth the first [13:15] thing I would do is go to the line and I [13:17] would put my hand in the collar and I [13:18] would try to get the towel out of his [13:20] mouth now likely when you do that he's [13:22] going to go tuck like this is so much [13:24] fun yeah and so when that happens I [13:26] would just lift up on the collar and [13:27] hold and then I wouldn't actually try to [13:29] pull the towel out of the mouth I would [13:31] just let the towel be like still and [13:33] boring and like kind of dangly because [13:35] if he sort of goes well this isn't [13:36] really fun anymore and he releases then [13:38] I can put the towel off to the side and [13:40] then I can maybe get a treat or I can [13:42] ask him to sit or do something that kind [13:44] of puts me in the driver's seat again [13:45] and then I can reward him for more Focus [13:48] um and if you need to that zipline [13:50] technique is going to be really helpful [13:51] so if he has something in his mouth I [13:53] can slide my hand down the leash into [13:55] his collar so that I'm not going to get [13:57] um i' start up here and then sh down [14:00] yeah okay how I hold him so see how he's [14:02] sitting with his back to me I like to [14:04] keep the dog in front and facing me like [14:06] this it just gives me a bit more of a [14:08] power position that when we first [14:10] started out he was at your side it felt [14:11] kind of awkward it was awkward more [14:13] because where he was in relationship to [14:15] you so if you just sort of Swing him out [14:16] in front like you did you'll feel a [14:18] little bit more in control of the [14:19] situation he's being an angel now he's [14:22] so good right now yeah now but why is [14:25] because there's follow through there's [14:26] follow through there's follow through [14:27] and every time he's gone to bike bark [14:29] and pull I've kind of told him hey knock [14:31] it off and he's like okay now I can't [14:34] make him do this forever because he's a [14:35] puppy uh but you know while he's sitting [14:38] I'm giving him pets I'm giving him the [14:39] occasional treat I'm giving him good [14:41] positive reinforcement most dogs I [14:45] ever most dogs they just they're not [14:48] actually worried so much about the [14:49] discipline itself they just want Clarity [14:52] they want black and white stuff and when [14:54] we start to blur the rules they start to [14:57] go okay well am I supposed to be the one [14:59] charge then so like maybe I can try to [15:01] you know do this I can try to do that [15:02] and you give them an inch they take them [15:03] out especially a dog you know like a [15:06] blue healer um because they're typically [15:08] pretty confident full of themselves [15:10] types of of dogs that's why they can go [15:12] after cattle and be just fine yeah [15:16] a um but they also can be so sweet [15:19] they're very smart and they can make [15:22] excellent choices with good um with good [15:24] direction if you're doing this [15:26] discipline and this continues past you [15:29] know the next month or so there's [15:31] something a bit off so this should be [15:33] something that you know not everything [15:36] is going to be fix but like the nipping [15:37] and biting you should be able to fix [15:39] that literally within a couple sessions [15:41] if he sort of goes like after today he [15:43] probably won't niit me anymore yeah [15:45] because he's sort of like I know I'm not [15:46] allowed to and then they're like okay [15:48] there's the rulle set got it um it's [15:50] sometimes when we're wishy-washy or [15:52] we're not consistent or our timings off [15:54] or whatever and again you're learning [15:55] you are not going to be a pro after [15:57] today but you're going to get better as [15:59] you get more confident and the more you [16:00] do it the easier it's going to become [16:02] because he's not going to feel like he [16:04] can fight you because right now he's got [16:06] no history with me um he's not snuggled [16:09] with me on a couch he doesn't like [16:11] there's no relationship there with you [16:14] guys it's a bit different because you [16:16] love him and I mean I love my dogs too I [16:19] want to kiss and hold them and all of [16:20] those things so you have to kind of get [16:21] over that past stuff um what I'm getting [16:24] to though is that the discipline is [16:26] really important but it also means that [16:28] all of the other stuff is equally as [16:31] important for building him up and [16:33] teaching him what he should do because a [16:35] lot of people think that nipping is [16:36] going to be solved by giving them a big [16:39] correction and that is just not the case [16:41] because you need to tell them also what [16:43] they should be doing and you need to be [16:44] setting him up so that he's not so like [16:47] if he's coming and jumping at your arm [16:49] or whatever that whatever that situation [16:51] is he's H that he's uh [16:53] nipping why is that happening in the [16:56] first place and is there something that [16:58] you could do different to control him [17:00] that could prevent him from doing that [17:02] and if that doesn't happen and he [17:05] decides to nip anyways game over you're [17:07] going to get disciplined for it but [17:08] think about how what could I do in this [17:10] scenario that could maybe teach him to [17:12] have a a different idea of his behavior [17:15] so that I'm not [17:17] like all the time like nobody wants to [17:19] do that either so I think about the [17:22] structure and the balance so that he's [17:24] getting both pieces of the puzzle today [17:26] we talked a lot about nipping and biting [17:28] with our young puppies but really the [17:30] bigger issue here is leadership so if [17:32] you want to learn a little bit more [17:33] about leadership check out that video [17:36] right there on that

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,, Part 395/429,"~Ken #puppybiting #mccanndogs === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] hi buddy oh my goodness I'm getting a [00:03] kisser this dog so puppy biting um oh [00:07] maybe we can talk a little bit about you [00:10] know when you might start to see puppy [00:12] biting uh First Steps what does what [00:15] does puppy biting look like when might [00:17] it be happening yeah I think we should [00:18] talk a little bit about age because um [00:21] you know puppy biting a lot of times [00:24] when we think about puppy biting we're [00:26] talking about puppies that are like [00:28] under 4 months old [00:30] um you know let's talk about what could [00:33] happen versus what maybe is happening so [00:35] if you learn how to address puppy [00:37] nipping uh early on it is actually [00:40] something that you can resolve within [00:43] just a few training sessions in some [00:45] cases and you know in other cases just a [00:47] few weeks it is not something if you [00:50] know what to do and how you do it it is [00:52] not something that has to continue for [00:55] months and months on end so you don't [00:57] need to be having you know six seven [00:59] eight Monon old 10-month old 12-month [01:01] old dog um giving a you know doing any [01:04] nipping and biting at all that being [01:06] said if you're not a professional dog [01:08] trainer and if you don't really know the [01:11] signs and things to look for or know how [01:12] to deal with it it would not be [01:14] surprising to hear that you have a dog [01:16] that's older than 6 months that is still [01:18] doing some nipping and biting now keep [01:20] in mind when a dog has rehearsed any bad [01:22] behavior whether it's nipping and biting [01:24] pulling on a leash not coming when [01:26] they're called digging you name it if [01:27] they've rehearsed it for months and [01:29] months and months and months obviously [01:32] be go on light down that's my girl uh [01:35] obviously it's going to be a challenge [01:37] to switch that dog's mindset to [01:40] something that's completely different it [01:42] can be done you can teach Old Dogs new [01:44] tricks but when you're listening today [01:46] if you have a very very young puppy you [01:48] want you want to get on this immediately [01:51] so that you can stop it before it gets [01:53] too bad if you have a a dog that's you [01:55] know becoming a little bit older and for [01:58] this topic I would say older would be [02:00] like over four months um you have some [02:04] work to do and uh and uh you're on a bit [02:07] of a time crunch as well because it is [02:09] something that you want to uh get on [02:11] quickly and it's going to be very [02:13] different approach very different [02:15] approach yeah and I will say that you [02:16] know when the questions come in and we [02:18] talk about different things um the age [02:20] of the puppy and um the training [02:22] experience and stuff will sort of [02:25] reflect um you know the type of answers [02:27] that we give um we going to talk a lot [02:30] about management tonight and what you [02:32] can do to set your puppy up for success [02:34] I mentioned this before we started but [02:36] it isn't just about correcting your [02:37] puppy for puppy biting um obviously we [02:40] need to be clear about our expectations [02:42] but often what happens is puppy nipping [02:44] happens because people put their puppies [02:47] in situations that are super easy for [02:49] them to nip and bite at versus [02:51] understanding how to mold and shape our [02:53] dogs with different choices on how we [02:55] handle them or how we um manage them [02:58] whether we have a leash on whether [02:59] whether we don't have a leash on whether [03:00] we use a crate whether we don't use a [03:02] crate um all of those things can mold [03:05] and shape our dogs to make better [03:06] choices and that for leads us to not [03:09] have a have to be quite so you know [03:11] strict about our rules about nipping and [03:13] biting so um there's lots of different [03:15] avenues that that sort of go along with [03:18] this topic which is what makes it so uh [03:20] complex um but uh age [03:24] is age is something that is important uh [03:28] here but um also I think anybody [03:31] regardless of your dog's age will be [03:33] able to get something from tonight's [03:35] talk absolutely um let's talk a little [03:38] bit about some of the leadership [03:39] mistakes that people make before we dive [03:41] into the um before we dive into the uh [03:45] actual like howto part of it what are [03:47] some of the leadership mistakes that [03:49] people often make that put the puppy in [03:50] a situation and you might be doing this [03:52] right now I know someone had mentioned [03:53] like my puppy's biting me right now um [03:57] the choices that you make that you don't [03:58] even think about yeah but all of a [04:00] sudden you've got a puppy who's nipping [04:01] and biting like yeah before I forget can [04:03] I just say that um if your puppy is [04:06] nipping and biting um they're normal [04:09] they you know it's a very very normal [04:11] thing for for puppies to do um a lot of [04:14] people will say oh they're mouthing and [04:15] they're teething and that type of thing [04:18] sometimes they're using their mouth [04:19] because they're mouthing and teething [04:20] but typically when a puppy uses their [04:23] teeth or their mouth on a person it's [04:26] generally to test the waters as to [04:29] whether whether they can communicate and [04:31] control the person that way because [04:33] that's how they're used to doing it with [04:36] you know their brothers and sisters in [04:37] the litter or they probably test the [04:38] waters with their mom at some point so [04:41] they they they will do that and [04:43] unfortunately what happens is if the [04:45] puppy goes up and they start nipping and [04:46] biting at you and you do things like [04:48] pull your hand away or you put a toy in [04:50] their mouth or you do things that puppy [04:52] starts to go huh nipping and biting [04:54] equals you taking your hand away [04:56] therefore I get what I do what I want or [04:58] nipping and biting means you're going to [04:59] give me a fun toy so maybe nipping and [05:02] biting is a good thing so um it is [05:04] something you have to be careful that [05:06] you're not accidentally making worse [05:08] because your response to it is um [05:11] natural unfortunately your response to [05:14] nipping and biting needs to be unnatural [05:16] it needs to be we'll talk about what it [05:17] needs to be um so that's one thing to [05:19] know that most puppies nip and bite um [05:22] and it's not because they're innately [05:24] naughty or anything like that it's just [05:27] they're they're curious they're trying [05:28] to test things out and um it is if they [05:32] start to learn that that form of [05:34] communication uh earns them things it [05:37] will continue and and in some cases [05:40] depending on the dog's temperament and [05:42] your relationship and your leadership [05:44] style um it could get worse um if it's [05:47] not addressed so I think that that's [05:49] important to say I know a lot of people [05:51] um uh will comment or or talk a little [05:54] bit about like an acquired bite [05:55] inhibition so saying like oh yeah well [05:58] the dog needs to know how hard it can [05:59] bite you um and that's something that we [06:03] don't teach you know we we teach it uh [06:06] we do teach it but we teach it in a [06:08] definitive way exactly in a very [06:10] definitive way like you do not put teeth [06:12] on people or clothes yeah that's a [06:15] really good point yeah You' be quite [06:16] definitive about it though like there is [06:18] no if ANS or buts about it because we [06:19] want it to be clear for your puppy [06:21] because when it's clear for your puppy [06:23] they learn it faster and there's no [06:25] question about well if this person is [06:27] this set of rules and that person is [06:28] that set of rules which which rules do I [06:30] choose your dog can learn very quickly [06:33] that it's not okay to uh nip and bite [06:35] your hands or you know tug on your [06:37] ponytail or you know whatever wild I [06:40] mean we've heard lots of crazy [06:42] situations but um pop your earrings out [06:44] of your ears or tug on your pant legs [06:46] you know that's not okay you know and [06:49] you can be very clear about how to uh [06:51] what your rules are it's actually quite [06:53] important to be really authoritative in [06:55] the situation you're going to show your [06:57] dog exactly what you don't want and then [06:59] let them know when they're making the [07:00] right choice by reinforcing those great [07:02] decisions and the good behavior yeah um [07:05] so how do we so B inhibition is [07:08] important I think it is important that [07:09] your puppy learns how to use their mouth [07:12] in order to be respectful um we do it a [07:14] number of way but number of ways but I [07:16] would say one of my favorite ways to [07:18] teach it is using the game of tug um and [07:20] I think you'll see this a little bit in [07:22] the video um so we'll sort of get to it [07:24] but it's a way to uh teach them that yes [07:26] you can use your mouth you can play my [07:28] hands are going to be near near the tug [07:30] my my shirt's going to be near the tug [07:32] and I can definitively say yes let's [07:35] keep playing if you're on the tug but if [07:36] that mouth turns and goes to me or my [07:38] skin I'm going to stop that play right [07:40] away um I'm going to correct the puppy [07:42] for that behavior and then immediately [07:44] offer the toy back so the puppy goes [07:46] okay that's wrong but as soon as that [07:48] toy comes out I get to play and have [07:50] some fun and the puppy learns to you [07:52] know bite the toy and be more careful [07:55] around my skin I know as the puppies get [07:57] more experience I can e also take a toy [08:00] and I can put my hands literally just [08:02] the width of the dog's mouth and say get [08:04] it and my puppy will grab right between [08:07] my hands being so careful not to touch [08:09] my hands and just go for the toy because [08:11] they learn through the start and stop [08:13] game um what's appropriate and what's [08:15] not so that's a really really important [08:17] thing they can learn by inhibition but [08:19] you don't need to do it by having them [08:21] test on your skin absolutely absolutely [08:24] we um we I've actually I pinned I think [08:27] the uh our puppy tug this is a tool we [08:28] use a lot [08:31] number one great way to Tire them number [08:32] two it's a great way it's a great game [08:34] that involves you like thisy reques you [08:37] and your dog learns that pretty quickly [08:39] the other great part is it's a great [08:41] training tool to teach what you can put [08:42] your teeth on what you can't you know [08:44] what you can be rewarded with and uh we [08:47] will probably uh reference that toy a [08:50] lot in this uh in this show um so you [08:53] can it's available somewhere on the [08:54] screen maybe just under your player [08:55] window I'm not sure um and actually Dan [08:58] can drop a link to it maybe in in the [08:59] chat I want to get to the video though I [09:01] want to start breaking down this video [09:02] cuz there is so much gold in this video [09:05] for our viewers that um you know you at [09:08] home you may have even watched this [09:10] video before it's even more valuable if [09:12] that's the case well you didn't watch it [09:14] with Two Hosts breaking it down even [09:16] more that's right that's right [09:17] absolutely speaking of which do you have [09:19] an idea of where you want to stop or do [09:20] you just want to go natural just yeah I [09:22] just set it up so that we can roll it [09:24] until we're ready to and through the [09:26] power of Internet computers [09:30] there um so I'll just stop it wherever [09:33] you know wherever you think is [09:34] appropriate okay but this is comes from [09:37] a video um you let's set up this um [09:41] student dog yeah because I you know [09:43] that's not in this um so you want me to [09:46] do that that was what well you know [09:48] better than I it's okay so this [09:49] Student's name is V and she has a little [09:52] cattle doog blue healer puppy who has [09:55] been nipping and biting them a lot he's [09:58] not a bad puppy he's a really cool puppy [10:00] actually but typical energetic um [10:04] thinking that using his his bark and his [10:07] bite can kind of get him what he wants [10:10] um and the hasn't really been um firm [10:17] enough or consistent and clear enough [10:21] with her puppy for him to really [10:23] understand what he's supposed to do so [10:25] we were just doing a quick private [10:26] lesson to go through technique time in [10:30] um reading the puppy's body language [10:32] yeah and you'll see that you're going to [10:33] see all that yeah yeah so let's uh I [10:35] I'll get this rolling so you guys can [10:37] check it out I would say he's being [10:38] slightly obnoxious right yeah I also [10:42] said more things to her before opening [10:45] the lesson and saying slightly obnoxious [10:48] prior to this we were trying to have a [10:49] conversation and the puppy was just like [10:51] barking and barking and barking so loud [10:53] that like we could even we couldn't even [10:55] have a conversation that's what happened [10:57] just before oh yeah yeah that does [10:59] that's probably good to give that [11:00] contest otherwise you're like wow Kale's [11:01] like really blunt there so there was [11:05] like a good 10 minutes before this is [11:07] this clip and he used like for me if our [11:10] dogs were barking yeah I just took a [11:12] section of that video so that you guys [11:14] know as well I would tell the dog quiet [11:17] and after I give the word that I want [11:18] him to eventually Listen to I would [11:20] apply some type of discipline so we're [11:22] going to talk a little bit about how [11:23] we're going to do the discipline there's [11:24] a couple different I said that kind of [11:26] quickly but it was really important yeah [11:29] true re iterate um so when it comes to [11:34] um discipline with our puppy or teaching [11:36] our puppies how to be respectful and [11:38] respond to us what we're looking for the [11:41] ultimate goal down the road to be is [11:43] that we can stop unwanted behaviors with [11:46] simply using our voice um you know a [11:50] verbal like ah or quiet or leave it or [11:54] whatever it might be but when we have [11:56] puppies they don't necessarily respect [11:59] that or even know what those words mean [12:01] so what I'm basically explaining here is [12:03] that when we're trying to teach the dog [12:04] to respond to that we need to first use [12:07] that command that we're hoping to use [12:10] and then 1 second later apply the [12:14] appropriate information whether that's [12:16] showing the puppy how to be right or [12:18] perhaps it's showing the puppy what [12:20] they're doing wrong but we can't just do [12:22] a correction we just can't give a treat [12:25] also without telling the puppy why [12:28] because if you do that they won't be [12:30] able to do it independently [12:32] later ways that we're going to do it so [12:35] essentially you're going to use a verbal [12:37] marker when he's wrong and in the early [12:39] stages you're going to follow that with [12:43] something saw that that's actually a [12:46] good thing to say because um a lot of [12:48] people will take their hand and and put [12:49] it around the dog's muzzle and to try [12:52] and get them to stop barking and most [12:55] puppies it just aggravates them you can [12:56] see as soon as I put my hand off he [12:58] tried to bite me there and not that you [13:00] you were like trying to like hold no I [13:01] was just trying to like tide him over I [13:04] wasn't really technically trying to [13:05] correct him or anything like that I was [13:06] just trying to talk to V his nose just [13:09] to kind of settle him for a second so I [13:11] could talk and as soon as I went to do [13:13] that I got okay so I'm GNA just let him [13:16] do this for a second so I can set the [13:18] scene and then this is no longer going [13:21] so I don't I'd like to know how many of [13:23] you in the chat you know who has a dog [13:26] like this you know is your dog is your [13:28] puppy you know full of energy full of [13:31] beans you sit down on the floor with [13:32] them and they just want to Chomp uh down [13:33] on every body part that they can get [13:35] access to or on your clothes or whatever [13:38] let us know if this is the kind of [13:39] struggle that you have at [13:41] home be allowed to happen okay see it [13:44] again again basically news biting to [13:47] hurt me here he's biting me because he's [13:50] just being a little brat like a typical [13:52] bratty little puppy that says I don't [13:54] really want to sit here and he's for [13:56] those of you I don't know how many [13:57] people know how to read body language [13:59] but you'll see all kinds of things here [14:00] besides nipping and biting a moment [14:02] before he was scratching a moment before [14:05] that he was yawning those are two signs [14:08] that says I'm a little stressed and not [14:10] in a stress like [14:12] um um the typical meaning of stress it's [14:16] like you're making me do something I [14:18] don't want to do and sometimes they're [14:20] like avoidance behaviors he does all [14:22] kinds of them in addition to trying to [14:25] niit me all because he doesn't want to [14:26] be held in that moment which is so said [14:29] too bad for him yeah that's the reality [14:31] you know we're going to talk a little [14:32] bit tonight about there are times when [14:34] you must listen you know it's it's [14:36] intolerable if you're you know biting [14:38] everyone in the house or biting me or [14:40] you know doing some of these behaviors [14:42] that could get you into trouble could [14:44] hurt someone could hurt you um you know [14:46] it's really important that your dog [14:48] understands like there are things that [14:49] are just totally off limits we're going [14:50] to talk about that I really like to make [14:52] sure that the puppies have a well-fit [14:54] collar he does point for you already [14:57] it's nice and snug if I get two fingers [14:59] in there he's not going to be able to [15:00] flip around and do any kind of C crazy [15:04] acrobats the second thing that I'm going [15:06] to do is when I go to discipline him I'm [15:08] going to take my hand in his collar and [15:09] I'm also going to grab a little tiny bit [15:11] of his excess fur that he's going to [15:13] grow into we call this the Scruff and [15:15] I'm going to hold him on either one side [15:18] of his head or the other and what's [15:19] going to happen is the palm of my hand [15:22] is going to sort of brace against his [15:23] cheek and why I'm being so detailed [15:25] about this explanation is I need to hold [15:28] him in a way that he can't niit me [15:30] anymore now when I do that he is [15:33] probably going to have a meltdown okay [15:36] now when I do this I'm not going to yell [15:38] or scream or do anything I'm just going [15:40] to be very quiet and as soon as I see [15:42] him start to go I'm not getting anywhere [15:45] and sort of relax I'm going to release [15:47] my grip just a little bit not let go [15:49] entirely just release my grip and then [15:51] I'm going to praise him so what [15:53] basically I'm doing is saying you're [15:54] wrong and when he starts to give in me a [15:56] little bit I'm going to say good boy [15:57] that's right now in the stages if they [15:59] haven't had this done very much can I [16:01] something um when you go to one thing [16:03] that's really interesting is eventually [16:05] and you'll see this happen if we get all [16:07] the way to the end of the video how this [16:09] puppy changes but just imagine right now [16:13] if you were to you know sit down and [16:16] hold on to your puppy for more than 5 [16:20] Seconds without constantly shoving [16:22] treats in their face how would they [16:24] react what's happening with this puppy [16:26] is that he so [16:30] so badly or so firmly thinks that he [16:33] should be able to just take off and run [16:34] and do whatever he wants that me I'm not [16:36] even doing anything to him other than [16:37] just holding him with me that he hasn't [16:40] stopped for a second trying to get away [16:43] from me and that show tells you a puppy [16:46] that's like I don't really feel like I [16:48] have to listen to you um if I was to do [16:51] that with beine right now she would [16:53] literally sit calm as a cucumber while [16:56] my hand was in her collar until I let go [16:59] she wouldn't try and fight she wouldn't [17:01] try and leave she wouldn't be worried [17:03] she wouldn't be afraid she would just be [17:05] like okay cool I'll just sit here and [17:08] puppies can do that too once you've gone [17:10] through this process and you'll see this [17:12] puppy later is able to do it after he's [17:14] been corrected but just notice how busy [17:17] this puppy is simply because I'm holding [17:19] him and that is a good understanding for [17:22] you to kind of see even if they're not [17:25] biting you do they just accept you [17:27] holding them for a little bit that's a [17:30] good test for leadership and authority [17:32] and a lot of puppies can't do that and [17:34] this is where it starts [17:36] yeah praise them they go for round two [17:39] and then they go for round three so what [17:41] might uh need to happen you're getting [17:43] uh lots of this on video here uh what [17:45] might need to happen is I might need to [17:46] go through the process a couple times [17:48] the other thing now uh look he's got my [17:52] arm right in his mouth yeah uh the [17:54] puppy's on a leash we use a house line [17:57] you know we use a house line in uh in [17:58] our train pring for a puppy this age um [18:01] and something that you should be using [18:02] at home as well as a house line so that [18:03] you have control over your puppy when [18:05] you need it at a moment's notice um but [18:07] it's really important that kale does [18:09] have that leash in her hand as the puppy [18:11] goes to leave her you know she needs to [18:13] be able to control the situation and um [18:16] the leash is the only way to do that [18:17] yeah the leash is important because I [18:19] need to be able to get a proper grip um [18:23] on the puppy and I need to be able to do [18:25] that within an effective time if your [18:27] puppy's off leash they can run away and [18:29] then you then you start to follow the [18:33] dog and then you try and Chase the dog [18:35] and then you try and grab the dog and [18:36] then right away dog's in control the [18:39] human is not so that leash is [18:43] instrumental in the success of stopping [18:45] nipping and [18:48] biting y it's coming I just I said a [18:51] moment ago that it's coming okay okay so [18:53] I'm going to go for it now mama is [18:55] putting a stop to this right now so my [18:57] hands in his collar the next time he [18:58] goes to bite I'm going to uh correct him [19:01] and then I'm going to see what happens [19:02] good boy good ah knock it off I'm going [19:06] to hold now this is common the front [19:09] paws will come over now see how he's [19:11] bringing his front paws up I don't lift [19:13] the puppy dangle the puppy I don't flip [19:16] the puppy I just simply hold until he [19:19] settles and I like to use my other hand [19:21] to kind of get the dog calm now this is [19:23] a common thing they do they flip I'm [19:24] going to lift him up when he does that [19:26] knock it off that's enough [19:29] okay so we have some subtle behavior I'm [19:31] going to release a little bit oh that's [19:33] better good boy and now I'm going to [19:36] praise okay now you I didn't want to [19:38] interrupt it yeah um so when you first [19:42] look at that sometimes it's like oh my [19:44] gosh what is she doing to that puppy um [19:46] but we try to mimic the same type of [19:48] disciplinary techniques that um his mom [19:52] would have done with him when he was a [19:53] puppy so using a verbal first so mama [19:56] would have growled and showed her teeth [19:58] te and then she would discipline the [20:00] puppy and moms always go for that Scruff [20:04] area behind the head and they do that [20:06] because it's a sensitive area the dogs [20:09] beine stop it oh um it's a sensitive [20:13] area the dogs um recognize it as um you [20:18] know respect and control uh also as I [20:21] indicated in the video what happens is [20:23] when I hold that dog in a specific Way [20:26] by having my hand both in the collar [20:28] with a little bit of the um fur uh in my [20:31] hand um no matter how hard that puppy [20:34] tried he couldn't turn and actually make [20:36] contact with me again and when I hold [20:38] him in a way where he feels like he [20:40] can't really get anywhere the dogs [20:42] settle much much much more quickly [20:45] sometimes when people aren't firm enough [20:47] and you'll see when V goes to try this [20:49] in a second she's holding sort of [20:51] passively and you can see he can feel [20:53] that so he you know continues to try to [20:57] see if he can wiggle his way out or nip [20:59] her more because he doesn't feel the [21:01] power of her hold the same way that he [21:03] felt mine but I've also done it 100,000 [21:07] times more than than V at this point V [21:09] is a good student throughout this too [21:11] fabulous respond quickly very self-aware [21:14] which is helpful yeah um anyways and [21:17] again you'll see the puppy tried all [21:18] kinds of Escape tactics he tried putting [21:20] his paws over my arm he tried rolling [21:23] over he tried coming up a little higher [21:26] and all you saw me do is react quickly [21:28] to that and try to get him back into [21:30] that neutral position and all I was [21:32] doing is waiting for a millisecond of [21:36] him [21:37] going and just taking a break and at [21:40] that moment that's my sign as the leader [21:43] to say good boy good puppy and I respond [21:48] in really calm when I'm holding the [21:50] collar and I'm disciplining what I'm [21:51] looking for is a couple different things [21:53] sometimes they'll pin their ears back a [21:54] little bit sometimes they'll um avert [21:57] their gaze sometimes they'll actually [21:59] look at you but they look at you with [22:01] like you know the expression sad puppy [22:03] eyes they sort of go like I'm sorry I [22:04] didn't mean to do that that type of [22:06] thing um they like right now see he has [22:08] like a really relaxed my hand is still [22:11] in that puppy's collar I haven't let go [22:14] I I I hope I speak to that in the video [22:17] but if I don't you guys get to hear so [22:19] my hand still in his collar and the [22:23] reason for that is because if he decides [22:26] to have round two and nip and bite again [22:29] I immediately have control now the way [22:32] I'm holding his collar right now is not [22:35] in a disciplinary way it's just simply [22:37] in a calming way I'm not giving him any [22:41] corrections or anything I'm simply just [22:43] holding um but what happens is if I let [22:46] go too early and he's still all fired up [22:50] I have to go through the process of like [22:52] trying to get my hand in his collar [22:53] again and it's just a little awkward so [22:55] you'll notice I don't actually let go [22:57] right away but I'm my hold and my energy [23:01] is much softer with a puppy now because [23:03] he's being a really good [23:06] boy he doesn't have he's not holding any [23:09] tension in his body those are the things [23:12] that you're looking for because there [23:13] was a few times there where I was [23:14] holding his collar and he was being [23:16] still but he was like this like ready to [23:19] go again and if I feel that in his body [23:21] I'm just going to continue holding until [23:23] I see him [23:25] go okay and at that point it's really [23:27] important that I prise and the reason [23:29] why I'm being so specific about the [23:31] timing is that this is not fun to do [23:34] it's also really hard to do which is why [23:35] people struggle with it but often I find [23:38] that either people um they aren't firm [23:40] enough or they don't have good enough [23:42] technique so the dog can nip and bite [23:44] and then we lose our confidence or [23:46] sometimes people discipline the dog [23:48] starts to show that like okay I get it I [23:50] get it and then they don't let go and [23:52] then the puppy goes okay like now I [23:54] don't know what to do because I've [23:55] showed you that I'm I'm good but you [23:57] just keep discipl in me so part of it is [24:00] reading the body language a little bit [24:02] now I'm going to talk okay I see a great [24:04] comment we should speak to back to this [24:07] camera [24:11] second okay um Maggie asks uh have any [24:14] advice for a small dog and I did notice [24:16] when we um put this up on YouTube that [24:19] there was a few comments on how do I do [24:21] this for a small dog how do I do this [24:23] with a golden retriever how do I do this [24:25] with a husky how do I do this with a so [24:28] and so breed it's all the same guys it [24:31] doesn't matter what breed of dog you [24:33] have or size of dog you have which [24:36] what's important to know when it comes [24:38] to discipline is you need to be um [24:43] gentle or firm enough for that [24:46] particular dog and the way that you know [24:49] you're being firm enough or you're [24:51] affecting change is that you can see the [24:53] puppy gets the message um I have a toy [24:55] poodle and when she was a baby puppy [24:58] doing nipping and biting I used this [25:00] exact technique that I used on the [25:03] cattle dog but obviously I'm not going [25:05] to hold quite as hard I'm going to adapt [25:08] my um pressure or strength to the dog [25:11] that I have um we've also owned a um a [25:15] Pitbull bordic cross in the past and you [25:19] would think oh my God pitbull bordic [25:20] that must be like a big strong dog and [25:22] he was physically but mentally he was a [25:26] very soft guy and so when he nip and [25:29] bite bit nipped and W nip and bite W nip [25:32] and bite thank you I was like that [25:33] doesn't sound right um when he was a [25:36] puppy uh I would say I actually the [25:38] first correction that I did with him was [25:40] a bit strong and like his little [25:41] eyeballs went I went oh my gosh he's a [25:44] real softy so then the next time I just [25:46] went cut it I was much more soft and [25:48] that's all he needed that was it um so [25:51] it's not about the breed or even the [25:53] size of dog it's about you reading the [25:57] dog's response want to you and it's [26:00] always good to start you know softer and [26:03] then uh move up as necessary but um the [26:08] collar technique works for for any dog [26:10] really however as your dog gets bigger [26:14] so if I was working with like a um you [26:16] know average breed dog siiz dog over [26:19] five months um I wouldn't use the collar [26:21] because the puppy could probably be [26:23] stronger than you at that point then we [26:25] would switch to a similar technique with [26:27] the leash but we teach that [26:29] um specifically inside our our paid [26:31] programs um because there's a lot to it [26:34] that we need to help you with [26:35] individually um so again it doesn't [26:39] matter about the breed you just can [26:40] adapt it and again these are things that [26:43] we do in our programs and we have people [26:44] that say well I'm trying this I'm not [26:46] really sure we watch video of you we you [26:49] know have Ono ones with you and we can [26:51] say oh turn your wrist this way or hold [26:53] the color this way or you're not holding [26:54] long enough or you're you're you're [26:56] releasing too quickly and within a few [26:58] minutes we got you on track um that's [27:01] the beauty of the programs with uh V in [27:05] this yeah exactly what exactly what we [27:06] did a lot of people are talking about [27:08] their dogs nipping and biting the house [27:09] line or chewing on the house line when [27:10] they're wearing them and that's a really [27:12] common thing um I'll address it really [27:14] quickly because it's it's sort of beside [27:16] what we're focused on here and I really [27:18] want to make sure that if you're here [27:19] for puppy biting you get some uh [27:21] thorough great information but your [27:24] puppy think about this you just attached [27:26] a toy to your puppy's collar uh [27:28] especially if it's brand new to them [27:30] they're going to think this is the most [27:31] interesting thing in the world so it's [27:32] your responsibility because your house [27:35] line their house line is only on when [27:36] you're when they're out of their crate [27:37] and when you're supervising them you [27:39] interrupt the behavior you take the [27:40] house line out of their mouth get them [27:42] to do something ask for a Sit get them [27:44] to go lie down get some effort out of [27:46] them and then give them a chew toy [27:48] something that they can chew on but it [27:50] is really important that you pay [27:51] attention we've got a handful of videos [27:53] on the channel to talk about what to do [27:55] when you're puppy nips and bites on the [27:57] house line because they are going to do [27:59] that it's really really important uh [28:01] that you understand that that's take the [28:02] house line off though that's people [28:04] always doesn't like it and they take it [28:06] off and now you're really in trouble for [28:08] sure yeah so the novelty wears off [28:10] supervise and I'll tell you your puppy's [28:13] very quickly going to even forget it's [28:14] on you know if you address it a couple [28:16] of times and they learn that um you know [28:18] it's not a chew toy and that they're not [28:19] allowed to chew on it life gets so much [28:21] easier because they just drag their [28:22] little house line everywhere okay let's [28:25] get back to [28:29] ready talk a littleit about the body [28:30] language he's stopping but he's not [28:33] really giving me any mind his whole [28:35] brain is on what's going on he's [28:37] accepting it but he's not really like [28:40] sorry he's like okay fine I'll stop [28:42] until the next time stress that Yawn is [28:45] not being tired that's called a stress [28:47] yawn okay nothing to be worried about [28:50] what oh good boy that's wonderful Choice [28:54] okay do you see how I'm multitasking a [28:57] little bit here I'm engaging with v but [29:00] the whole time I'm paying attention to [29:02] this puppy's body language and how he's [29:06] responding to me just telling him that [29:09] nipping was not appropriate because one [29:11] thing that's really important about um [29:15] doing this type of uh work with our [29:17] puppies is that we can't just say you're [29:19] wrong you're wrong you're bad ah and [29:21] never acknowledge when our puppies are [29:24] starting to make a change that they're [29:25] starting to try to be right and so as I [29:28] was speaking to her there I recognized [29:30] that he laid down and he put his head on [29:32] the floor and he sort of went into a bit [29:35] more of a a relaxed State um I was [29:38] literally just saying to her a moment [29:40] ago he's not really totally giving into [29:42] this yet because he was still like brigh [29:44] eyed and bushy tailed there in that sit [29:47] so um when I saw him lay down you'll see [29:50] I I I acknowledged the puppy good boy [29:53] praise and reward because we want to be [29:55] really uh balanced in our information I [29:58] don't just want to give my dog one side [30:01] of the story I need to mold and shape my [30:04] dog to know what they shouldn't do but [30:07] equally or sometimes more importantly [30:09] what should they do how should they [30:11] behave in this type of scenario and I [30:14] need to do that with lots of positive [30:17] feedback and a stress y I don't get too [30:19] worried about is that I'm I'm making [30:21] progress here he's saying uh I don't [30:23] really like this but I guess I can [30:24] handle it but again when we're [30:26] disciplining it can't all be your you're [30:28] bad you're bad and shaking a puppy [30:29] around like a ragd doll that's not what [30:30] we're going for here I also need to take [30:32] the opportunity to find some find some [30:35] time to let him know he's right good [30:37] there we go the thing I'm doing without [30:39] even thinking about it um which I don't [30:43] comment on the video is every time he [30:45] tries to like get away from me you see I [30:46] place him into a Sit he's trying to make [30:48] his Escape right now uh and I'm doing [30:51] that again because I don't want him to [30:54] be worried about me I don't want him to [30:56] be afraid of me I want him to learn that [30:59] I still love you I think you're the [31:00] cutest sweetest little puppy I just [31:02] don't like your behavior I don't like [31:03] your nipping and biting so if I [31:05] discipline and he wants to get away from [31:07] me and I just let him do that I don't [31:09] get the opportunity to work on the [31:11] relationship piece so I want him to be [31:13] with me and stay close and that's why [31:15] it's important you'll see I'm going to [31:16] get some treats out in a second I think [31:18] you mentioned this earlier um in our [31:21] talk that it's not just your bad your [31:23] bad move on it's your bad you're bad but [31:26] hey let's do something together where [31:28] I'm in the driver's seat you can do [31:30] something for me that's fun you can get [31:32] some rewards for it shake that stress [31:34] away and just learn that life goes on [31:38] you just you don't nip it's that [31:41] simple no um okay let me talk to you [31:44] about the leash [31:45] techniques yes and when I'm going to [31:47] feed him I'm always going to make him [31:48] turn towards me so he knows the good [31:50] stuff's coming for me such a smart dog [31:53] so we talked about the collar thing if [31:55] you need to go to the leash which you [31:56] can do at any time you're going to hold [31:59] the leash as if you're holding on to a [32:00] baseball bat so your thumbs are up your [32:03] baby fingers are down and you're going [32:04] to lift and hold like that um and then [32:06] I'll be able to tell you whether you [32:08] need to continue holding or whether you [32:09] need to release the one thing that I [32:10] didn't show in that particular demo CU I [32:13] wasn't actually correcting him there I [32:14] was just kind of showing is the height [32:17] of this P I'm not a very tall person uh [32:19] the height of this puppy and me lifting [32:20] up on the leash wasn't [32:23] really good uh if I was actually going [32:26] to use the leash to to um diffuse this [32:30] puppy I would have gotten like right up [32:32] on my knees or even stood all the way up [32:34] so I had some leverage just if anybody's [32:37] taking special note of technique there [32:39] that's one thing that I would have done [32:41] differently than that quick example is [32:43] to try and if anytime you're like get me [32:46] out of here just pass them off and I [32:47] I'll take over but I want to build your [32:50] confidence so that you know what to do [32:52] yeah here we [32:53] go oh that's nice good now I'm going to [32:58] intentionally take his collar right now [33:00] yes and reward because I don't want him [33:03] to have a meltdown when I take his [33:05] collar because I need to take his collar [33:06] all the time so we see he was a little [33:07] bit worried there so I'm going to take [33:09] the food put the food on his no you guys [33:10] notice that again reading dog body [33:12] language can you back it up like like [33:15] good m is that easy enough to do or no [33:18] it's okay it's okay if it's complicated [33:21] um I went to grab his collar there and [33:22] he leaned away from me and again some [33:24] people will look at that and go oh my [33:26] gosh like you're going to make AF to [33:28] take the no I'm not I'm going to teach [33:31] him that take me taking your collar is [33:34] okay yes sometimes I'm going to take it [33:36] and tell when you're being a naughty [33:37] brat and other times I'm going to take [33:39] it and tell you you're the most perfect [33:41] little cute puppy in the entire world so [33:44] I have some work to do here some [33:45] recovery work I'm taking his collar and [33:47] I'm feeding I'm taking his collar and [33:49] praising him and you'll see within just [33:51] a couple treats Zeke has a completely [33:54] different feeling about me taking his [33:56] collar he's totally cool with it so [33:58] again bringing back that idea of of [34:01] balancing out your information and not [34:03] just being too heavy on one [34:06] side and reward because I don't want him [34:09] to have a meltdown when I take his [34:11] collar used to take his collar all the [34:13] time so we see his a little bit worried [34:14] there so I'm going to take the food put [34:16] the food on his nose first this time now [34:18] grab the hair yes the reason why I'm [34:21] putting the food on his nose first is I [34:24] use the treat to encourage the puppy in [34:27] close so that when I reach my hand under [34:30] his chin to grab the collar his brain is [34:33] on the treat and he's more comfortable [34:36] with me reaching and and grabbing a hold [34:38] of his collar if you do it the other way [34:40] if I reach for the collar and then I [34:43] show the treat which is something I [34:44] would want to work towards of course um [34:47] you might have puppies that are a little [34:48] bit more resistant so I'm pulling the [34:50] fast one here I'm using the food to um [34:54] get the dog comfortable close to me and [34:57] then I'm taking a hold of the collar so [34:59] the timing of that is very deliberate on [35:01] my part would you stop giving kisses [35:04] please lie [35:05] down wait associate food on nose I'm not [35:10] feeding take the collar first good boy [35:13] yes and then I can reward so he starts [35:15] to go okay maybe you're not so bad after [35:17] all how about you come closer oh oh and [35:20] giving me little tricks too so this oh [35:24] my God it was adorable so again look at [35:28] the change in the puppy 15 seconds ago [35:31] he was trying to run away from me he was [35:32] trying to get back to V he was stress [35:34] yawning I literally took 15 seconds to [35:37] do a little couple little easy things [35:40] and now he's offering a paw he's [35:42] offering it down he's like okay I can [35:44] get behind this this is why this [35:46] training is so important you're clear [35:48] with what you need to do you'll also see [35:50] I'm not being emotional about it I'm not [35:53] being angry I'm not being emotional I'm [35:57] just being clear and that's what our [35:59] puppies needs because dogs mother dogs [36:02] are not emotional when they discipline [36:05] their puppies they just get her done um [36:08] they take the emotion aside because [36:10] they're animals they're dogs and we need [36:12] to adopt the same things humans have a [36:14] terrible natural thing of being so [36:19] emotional when it comes to this and it [36:22] just doesn't jive with how puppies need [36:24] to learn it's not good information no [36:26] and in fact a lot of cases it makes it [36:27] work [36:28] what's actually really lovely about this [36:30] puppy is his recovery [36:32] is excellent amazing sometimes when you [36:35] first start of applying pressure and [36:37] discipline he try all the things you're [36:39] so sweet yes when you try um discipline [36:42] for the first time if the puppies are [36:44] are you know a little bit selfish in it [36:46] fors you go to discipline then they want [36:48] nothing to do with you the fact that he [36:50] has no doesn't have any relationship [36:51] with me whatsoever I've come in doesn't [36:54] know me I've disciplined him and he's [36:55] sort of going okay I think I can move on [36:58] means you have a really great puppy and [37:01] sometimes what happens when puppies are [37:03] biting we think oh my gosh like this is [37:04] so frustrating he's awful he is a [37:07] typical bratty young puppy that doesn't [37:10] know any better um and being a cattle [37:13] dog they can be a little bit tenacious [37:14] sometimes you're tenacious you're strong [37:17] but they also can be super duper fine [37:19] because they have tons of energy they [37:21] want to do stuff so if you can kind of [37:22] get them on the right track they're like [37:25] way more fun than having a bump on a log [37:26] for a dog like he's going to want to do [37:28] stuff right but we just got to get I [37:30] don't know what comes out of my mouth [37:33] bump a log for do for dog so [37:35] weird okay now it's V's turn to uh work [37:39] on this exercise a little bit um and [37:41] watch the change in the Poppy's Behavior [37:44] but hold him a little firmer there we go [37:45] okay just hold on for a second I don't [37:47] have his scrap I just have his that's [37:48] okay and if you feel like he can move [37:50] around too much you are going to grab [37:51] his scrap the scrap does not hurt him at [37:53] all he all extra for he's going to grow [37:54] into anyways just like his mom would [37:56] have exact exactly so you see how he [37:58] justd there I couldn't help myself but [38:01] steing do you at home have a puppy who [38:04] will uh be goofy and silly and nipping [38:06] and biting and chewing and jumping and [38:08] doing all the bad stuff with one family [38:09] member and then a total angel [38:12] with get okay I think we're back um if [38:16] you have okay I think we're back good um [38:21] so I'm not sure where we ended [38:24] off I'm not sure anyway we'll figure it [38:26] out um so you're gonna [38:28] see did did you guys have a chance did [38:31] you hear when I asked uh if anybody at [38:34] home has a dog who is a little angel [38:37] with one family member and an absolute [38:39] Terror with [38:40] another now that we're [38:42] back oh [38:45] Sam wrong cord [38:47] buddy you asking a question okay thanks [38:51] Sparkle do you have a a situation at [38:54] home where puppy's an angel with one [38:55] family member and an absolute Terror [38:57] with another that's exactly what we're [38:59] seeing here for a moment because this [39:01] puppy understands what Kale's [39:03] expectations are what the rules are with [39:05] kale and now he goes back to his owner V [39:07] and he's like hm maybe I can test the [39:09] waters here a little bit and uh watch V [39:11] work through this a very smart little [39:13] puppy give him a little shake for that [39:15] too okay take over now um the reason why [39:19] I stepped in and grabbed the puppy from [39:22] V is um the puppy was kind of nipping [39:25] and biting her not actually making [39:27] contact but kind of threatening V and V [39:30] didn't really react and so I it's in my [39:34] bones to just re just react so I went in [39:37] there a little quickly because timing is [39:39] so important you can't let the dog nip [39:42] and bite and then start to fullon tug on [39:45] your arm and then do something about it [39:47] you're trying to react really quickly so [39:49] that's why I stepped in so fast there [39:52] feel settled release the Scruff but [39:54] don't release the [39:55] collar I wonder if the caller now good [39:58] lift him up don't let him do that [40:01] right too much you are going to grab a [40:03] scrap the scrap does not hurt him at all [40:05] his all extraer he's going to goow into [40:07] anyways he went to bite her there so you [40:10] see how he just nod there I would give [40:12] him a little shake for that too okay [40:13] take [40:14] over you got it [40:16] yep good and then if he feels settled [40:19] release the Scruff but don't release the [40:21] collar yeah you can hold the collar now [40:23] good now lift him up don't let him do [40:25] that right up quick quick quick quick [40:27] Qui Zeke was about to try a [40:30] um avoidance technique of flipping [40:34] over good good but okay you can release [40:37] your tension a little bit just praise [40:39] him with your voice good [40:40] boy good okay don't let go with this [40:43] hand you can let him lie down now and [40:44] the reason why it's okay do you feel the [40:46] tension leaving his body now just you [40:49] lay down that time there go ahead okay [40:51] bring him out in front of you the going [40:54] to the beside is a bit of an avoidance [40:56] thing as well there okay keep holding [40:57] his collar good good okay I'm going to [41:00] give Tre lean over to make sure there's [41:02] no I might have taken the wind out of [41:03] his sails a little bit here you can feed [41:04] him so that the good stuff comes from [41:06] you good [41:07] boy good okay that was pretty good you [41:10] could be a little firmer okay okay but [41:12] it's because you haven't really done it [41:13] yet what whenever we go through this [41:15] with people people are always worried [41:17] about hurting the dog it will it's not [41:19] in your nature to hurt him you would [41:21] never do it firm enough to hurt him so [41:23] do that is not a concern so don't worry [41:25] about that just just doing an incredible [41:28] job um so it's just important that you [41:31] keep the puppy out in front when you're [41:33] doing this because a lot of dogs will [41:35] kind of go behind you or they'll do [41:37] different things so um what she's doing [41:39] with a puppy right now is [41:41] excellent um I had a question from uh LG [41:47] out again oh no we're [41:49] good um what do you do if the puppy [41:51] starts snipping the kids great question [41:54] um yeah so this discipline technique is [41:59] absolutely not something that we would [42:01] have the kids perform on the puppies um [42:04] this is only for adults to do uh and the [42:07] reason for that is because we want to [42:09] make sure that the adults are able to do [42:12] it with good technique and good timing [42:15] they can follow through read the puppy's [42:17] body language be strong enough to do it [42:21] um otherwise if kids try to discipline [42:23] the puppy and they're not old enough or [42:26] they're not strong enough or any of the [42:28] reasons the puppy what happens is when [42:30] you discipline a puppy and you don't do [42:32] it well it just confirms to the puppy [42:35] that you are absolutely not a strong [42:37] leader so when it comes to kids [42:39] specifically what we would have you do [42:41] is number one always supervise when [42:44] puppies and kids are together number two [42:47] have your kids use a command that means [42:51] the puppy needs to stop B uh biting um [42:54] it could be knock it off it could be [42:56] stop whatever is is appropriate for your [42:57] kid and then they need to freeze and be [43:01] quiet and still even turn around from [43:04] the puppy if needed and then mom or dad [43:07] need to fly in within milliseconds get [43:11] the house line and then they follow [43:14] through with the discipline so remember [43:16] earlier in the chat I talked about how [43:18] important it is to have a verbal [43:20] reprimand and then that backed up with [43:23] with discipline your kid is going to be [43:25] the one that does the verbal reprimand [43:27] but you're going to back up their verbal [43:30] with the discipline and that's going to [43:31] help give your kids a little bit more [43:33] credibility and I would follow the same [43:35] process for Neighbors friends anybody [43:37] that comes into the home I would not [43:39] expect anybody other than the adults in [43:41] the household to be doing this with your [43:44] puppy the collar with his hand keep your [43:46] grip maybe try try holding on to one of [43:48] his [43:49] paws yeah good so then see you when he [43:53] did that give him a little shake like [43:54] that when he does so knock it off Qui [43:56] try [44:00] knock it off and that's a really common [44:02] time for a puppy time to ask him for the [44:03] Paw just simply pick it [44:05] up y good good [44:08] good so I know he's not [44:10] actually fighting her but he's [44:13] threatening her he's basically telling [44:14] her bug off I don't want you to do this [44:16] to me right now you're getting better [44:17] every time look at that look at that [44:19] good you're making some [44:20] change good go now just take a hold of [44:23] it again the B yep [44:28] yes so good very good boy okay take a [44:33] hold [44:35] again I love that you can see him you [44:38] can see him choose like you can see him [44:40] make the decision he's like uh no I know [44:43] there's a better yeah and you see we've [44:45] had to correct him we've had to redirect [44:48] him several times here in order for him [44:50] to get the message but we're just [44:52] continuing to be clear and consistent [44:55] again not emotional we're just trying to [44:57] show him what's what we don't like and [44:59] then as soon as we see a glimmer of him [45:01] going hm that's not working for me but [45:04] maybe this will work we're on it so fast [45:07] to reward him and then because this guy [45:09] likes love and he likes treats and he [45:11] likes praise you can see him starting to [45:13] go okay I can see how I work this this [45:17] situation it's from being subtle being [45:20] calm giving Mom eye contact that earns [45:23] me reinforcement rewards um such a smart [45:27] little guy but they're all smart because [45:29] we have to give them good information [45:30] they all can figure it out we're going [45:32] into overtime here right now uh we might [45:35] miss I think we probably wrapped up we [45:36] might miss the 840 you guys can thank [45:39] Sam for that uh more time for cinnabun [45:41] he unplugged the uh the the live [45:43] streaming setup to plug in the vacuum [45:45] clearer and then he he flipped the [45:46] breaker box he's cleaning out the [45:47] breaker box whaty anyway we'll be here a [45:49] little bit longer you guys can thank Sam [45:51] for making aate I actually really like [45:53] that he give gave you eye contact there [45:55] I'm GNA actually put this beside you [45:57] here so you can grab it okay grab his PW [46:01] again yeah you guys can watch this video [46:03] and it's entire no mouthing so even if [46:05] he mouths knock it off don't wait till [46:08] you get full-blown teeth because if you [46:11] wait until he's actually gnawing you're [46:13] going to have to do big big discipline [46:15] if he just threatens you hey you can [46:17] just give a little one the goal is to [46:18] only have to do little ones if he's like [46:20] sniffing my hands sniffing is okay but [46:23] if he like open mouths towards you [46:27] that's okay I couldn't see his mouth [46:29] from where I was this is really [46:32] important though like where do you draw [46:34] your Line in the Sand and Clarity is key [46:37] no teeth on skin or clothes period [46:41] sniffing licking maybe that's okay you [46:43] know sniffing is obviously okay but I [46:45] also I don't even I would go one step [46:47] further I don't even wait for teeth [46:49] totally I'm looking opening your mouth [46:51] yeah he's like like just like he's what [46:54] we call threatening and to me [46:57] his intent is still to try to say I [46:59] don't really like this and so I'm not [47:02] just disciplining nipping I'm [47:04] disciplining him saying I don't respect [47:07] you I feel like I can control you with [47:09] my mouth or whatever it might be so yeah [47:12] you want to CL you want to draw draw a [47:14] clear line as Ken said it's so important [47:17] good and then just like a nitpicky [47:18] timing thing it would be ideal is as [47:21] you're holding his paw and he's not [47:22] giving a reaction to say yes at that [47:24] moment so that you're sort of capturing [47:25] that moment try one more time hold that [47:28] paw [47:29] again that's it [47:32] good there Focus yes I G because I gave [47:36] him a a pretty firm there and so now [47:39] he's like oh there's that girl that I [47:41] know isn't leader [47:43] good give him a break for a second good [47:46] that was pretty good bud pretty great [47:49] when you're going to touch his paws or [47:52] so uh talk a little bit about clear [47:53] expectations uh and you covered that [47:55] something that um I don't think we [47:57] covered in this part of the video but [47:59] you can watch your original video on the [48:00] channel is UM get rid he he is a cattle [48:05] dog a breed that's a dog that's rough [48:08] and tough you know made to you know be [48:12] functioning hurting moving under the [48:14] feet of uh livestock so uh you know [48:18] don't be surprised if this takes a [48:19] little bit of effort you know it's proba [48:21] might not be fixed the first time you [48:22] work on this because you have a dog who [48:24] just is so intense about everything that [48:26] they do now even if it's not a cattle [48:28] dog your Labrador Retrievers were uh [48:30] bred to crash through the ice and and [48:33] The Cattails and the thrush to get out [48:35] to the water I mean all of these dogs [48:36] come from uh uh you know with an [48:38] interesting background the breed was [48:40] intended to you know support uh uh do [48:44] hard work support human uh whatever uh [48:47] uh efforts in a lot of cases so you know [48:50] when it doesn't happen for you you're [48:51] like well I don't know it's it's [48:53] obviously not working you know your dog [48:55] was bred to be a little bit resistant [48:56] into some of this stuff so when you do [48:58] these Corrections and you're working [48:59] through these exercises focus on the [49:01] combination of leadership and the [49:04] correction stuff because the correction [49:06] alone it's going to be a long road but [49:08] incorporating some of the leadership [49:10] stuff like stuff shoot from five you [49:12] know three or four things that you would [49:13] just not do with your dog if you're [49:15] having a nipping and biting problem and [49:16] you're working on this um if I was [49:18] having a nipping and biting problem I [49:20] would be not getting down on the floor [49:22] and rough housing and playing rough with [49:25] my puppy or getting my my ey line and my [49:28] head level down to the puppy um level I [49:31] would never do that um because you look [49:33] so much like a playmate and it's too [49:34] easy to be a my face can be too much of [49:37] a Target and if I'm down low and I'm I'm [49:39] trying to rough house and I'm showing [49:41] the puppy littermate littermate [49:42] littermate you know later on you can do [49:44] that you know I I play with my dogs all [49:46] the time now um but they know that they [49:49] can play with me without ever putting [49:50] their mouth on me um so again a lot of [49:53] these rules you don't have to have [49:54] forever you just need to have during the [49:55] puppy nipping stage until you're through [49:57] it um another thing that I would do with [49:59] a puppy is I would never have my puppy [50:01] out of their crate without a Leisure [50:02] line on so that if they do anything that [50:05] I don't like I have a way to calmly gain [50:07] control without chasing the puppy [50:10] without having to you know raise my [50:12] energy or have the puppy take off and [50:15] avoid me I would always have a leasher [50:17] line on um another thing that I wouldn't [50:19] do is I would um I guess this is [50:23] something that I would do is I utilize a [50:26] crate when I can't um supervise my puppy [50:30] and why this is relative to nipping and [50:32] biting is because I can't supervise and [50:36] be on top of my puppy every single [50:38] second of the day it would be so [50:40] frustrating for me and for the puppy so [50:43] my goal is that when my puppy's out I'm [50:45] giving good information I'm training I'm [50:47] I'm tiring the puppy out playing lots of [50:49] things building a relationship and then [50:50] puppy goes away in the crate so they [50:52] can't rehearse bad behavior and then [50:55] when I get my puppy out again we kind of [50:57] rinse wash and repeat do the whole thing [50:58] again so utilizing that crate really [51:01] helps with leadership it's not just [51:03] about house training it's also about [51:05] teaching the puppy not to be you know [51:07] not to nip and bite um another thing [51:10] that I would do is work on calming [51:13] techniques so that as my puppy is [51:16] excited or making poor choices I could [51:19] you know have the ability to tell my [51:20] puppy to sit to settle maybe to go and [51:23] lie on a bed um maybe to go get a bone [51:25] whatever it might be so I have a little [51:27] bit more verbal control over my puppy um [51:29] from there um another thing my hair's [51:33] got even more my hair went flying [51:34] another thing that I wouldn't do is [51:36] repeat myself um I wouldn't give [51:38] commands over and over and over and over [51:40] again and hope one day that they respond [51:42] I follow through so if I say something [51:45] to my puppy and my puppy doesn't do it I [51:47] say to myself hm probably doesn't know [51:49] this very well I'll help my puppy to be [51:51] right or my puppy's flat out ignoring me [51:54] right now I need to do something about [51:55] it I don't just keep giving my puppy a [51:58] 100 chances before they come around to [52:00] listen um I I do want to say this as I'm [52:03] watching the chat go through I'm seeing [52:06] a lot of really excellent questions like [52:08] really you guys are really um thinking [52:11] about this in an excellent way which is [52:13] exciting to us um and I I I don't want [52:16] to make this seem like a sales pitch but [52:18] I do want to honestly say I love the [52:21] questions that you're asking and we can [52:23] give you such specific answers to your [52:26] puppies when we get to know you and your [52:28] that's what's Difficult about YouTube [52:29] for yes and that's what I love so much [52:31] about the programs because we love [52:33] engaging with you guys on YouTube and [52:34] this stream has been absolutely [52:36] excellent I I'm imagining it's going to [52:38] be a really popular one for us to [52:40] reference but we can get so specific [52:42] with you about what to do when your [52:44] puppy does this and what to do that um [52:46] in our puppy Essentials program so um if [52:49] you're on the fence about it I I I [52:51] encourage you to check it out the [52:53] support that we have in the program is [52:55] amazing our instructors are absolutely [52:57] incredible and you're going to be joined [53:00] by all kinds of students that are [53:01] literally dealing with the same thing we [53:03] have a support group where everybody ask [53:04] questions so not only do you get to ask [53:07] questions and and interact with the [53:08] instructor you also get to see all of [53:10] the other people and the questions they [53:11] ask and a lot of time it's things that [53:13] you've never even thought of and then [53:14] you see that interaction you go oh I [53:16] didn't even know that was the thing now [53:17] I've learned more um so I definitely [53:20] suggest that you check it out um it's a [53:22] very comprehensive program and we can [53:25] really help you individually moment of [53:26] Truth with Julie what if you've tried [53:28] these and do and dog's still doing it [53:30] what are your other suggestions you [53:31] might might be technique might be I [53:34] guarantee you there's something that [53:36] you're doing a little bit wrong yeah [53:38] yeah because these techniques work for [53:40] for every I've never seen ever in my all [53:44] of the years that I've been doing this [53:46] I've never seen our techniques not work [53:48] for a dog and when we are able to watch [53:50] it in action there's always something [53:53] super subtle that's off with the person [53:55] and the dog and if you change those one [53:57] or two things it's like it's like [54:00] totally different so um that's my answer [54:04] yeah absolutely you know it's it's um [54:07] it's the kind of thing that will speed [54:10] up all of your training build a better [54:11] relationship with your puppy allow you [54:13] to like be able to play have the um [54:16] experience with your puppy and young dog [54:18] that you wanted to have by getting a [54:20] little bit of

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,, Part 399/429,~Ken === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:15] hey welcome to the store how can I need [00:17] to return this it doesn't work I bought [00:18] it because my dog pulls I put it on the [00:21] dog and all it does now is scratch what [00:22] it's fa to the ground if worse and I [00:25] can't do I wanted this to be fixed it [00:28] fix so that you don't end up like a [00:30] frustrated Freddy like this guy [00:31] instructor Meg is going to break down [00:32] not only how to wear a Gentle Leader but [00:34] how to get your dog to love wearing a [00:36] Gentle Leader so that you can get back [00:37] to the things that you love like [00:39] hasslefree walks I'm Dan welcome back to [00:41] McAn [00:43] [Music] [00:45] dogs so today I'm going to be [00:47] introducing a gent leader to my puppy [00:49] pre he is 6 months old and he's just [00:51] started to discover how exciting uh the [00:53] world is around him lots of birds and [00:55] squirrels out in our neighborhood and he [00:57] thinks it'd be fun to pull towards them [00:59] so I'm going to be introducing the GLE [01:01] leaders today so that I can ideally [01:03] start to use that on our daily walks in [01:06] my neighborhood I don't want to just put [01:08] the Gentle Leader on him though and take [01:10] him outside and have him struggling with [01:12] it pawing at it not be accepting of it [01:15] or even loving the Gentle Leader my goal [01:18] is for this to be a tool that my dog [01:20] loves to have on I do not want to be [01:23] something that we are in Conflict about [01:25] so I often put a gendle leader on my [01:27] puppies and give them their favorite [01:29] things it might might be a Kong with [01:30] some peanut butter maybe a really [01:32] valuable chew toy that they can enjoy [01:34] for a little while just on the dog bed [01:35] beside me any of their meals their [01:37] training treats these are all things [01:39] that I start with the Gentle Leader on [01:42] before I even consider taking the puppy [01:44] on a walk so as I said pre has never had [01:47] this on before I've put it to [01:48] approximately the size I think it would [01:50] be for his neck so this part is the [01:52] portion that goes around his neck this [01:54] part is uh the portion that's going to [01:56] go over his nose and often with a baby [02:00] puppy I will start by putting some food [02:01] through the loop of the G leader hey [02:03] kiddo I know this carpet smells good and [02:07] as he's eating that treat I just slip [02:09] that nose piece on good boy and I'll do [02:11] that several times you can also uh try [02:13] to train your puppy to offer this [02:15] Behavior sometimes just using that food [02:17] lure yes good boy is a little bit easier [02:21] feeding him as he gets used to that [02:23] sensation of the G leader on his nose [02:25] yes good boy off and on a couple times [02:29] making that a positive of experience for [02:30] him yes good man prey when I feel like [02:34] that's going well good boy then I can [02:37] also start attaching the neck piece [02:39] around as well so I can slip that on yes [02:42] good boy and we want the nose liop to be [02:44] big enough that he can open his mouth [02:46] fully he could tug on a toy grab a ball [02:49] chew on that bone yes good man all with [02:52] the Gentle Leader on this actually is [02:54] still a little bit big for him this is a [02:56] small I think you need an extra small [02:58] because you are so tiny yes good boy [03:01] excellent job as you can see he doesn't [03:04] really mind the Gentle Leader if he was [03:06] to start pawing at it and bothering it I [03:09] would just gently lift up on the leash [03:11] providing a little bit of pressure and [03:14] that might even happen as I get him [03:15] moving next yes good boy but my main [03:19] goal right now is to distract him and I [03:22] would probably do maybe a minute or so [03:25] with the G leader on with all of these [03:27] high value treats and then I would take [03:29] that g leer right off again yes good boy [03:32] and he's going to learn that all good [03:34] things happen when he has the G leader [03:36] on good boy so if I had a dog that was [03:39] struggling with the G leader to the [03:40] point that they didn't even want it to [03:41] go on I would actually work this in [03:44] smaller Little Steps I would take more [03:46] time just putting the nose loop on yes [03:47] and feeding break it off and play uh I [03:50] would get them accustomed to it with it [03:51] loosened so I'm not going to have it uh [03:53] fit as snug to where they might feel a [03:55] little bit more of the pressure and I [03:58] would put it on for shorter periods of [04:00] time put it on high value things so [04:02] something even like giving them some [04:05] Kong a Kong with some peanut butter in [04:07] it um as high a value reinforcement as [04:10] you can and then literally the moment [04:12] they are done that you're going to uh [04:14] take it off again I also don't want them [04:17] to learn that avoiding and running away [04:19] from me is an option so I'm going to set [04:21] myself up from for Success from the [04:22] get-go I'm going to have a line on the [04:24] puppy I'm going to make sure that them [04:26] retreating isn't uh an option for them [04:29] and I'm going going to be putting it on [04:30] again just for those short little bits [04:32] of time taking it right back off again [04:34] and I'm only going to do this with

dogs to talk about ticks and [00:08] tickborne [00:09] [Music] [00:11] diseases so back in 2012 my first case [00:15] of lime disease that I diagnosed was in [00:17] my own dog not this little Coco but my [00:20] Labrador Retriever Jack who hadn't left [00:22] my farm and he had swollen joints he was [00:25] lethargic he didn't want to walk he had [00:27] an enlarged spleen and we ended up [00:30] diagnosing a positive burela test which [00:33] is the organism that causes Lyme disease [00:35] at that time I had never seen that in [00:37] Southern Ontario I called the University [00:39] of galf they were quite excited about it [00:42] and asked me to send further samples to [00:44] them this was new novel and very [00:47] exciting thinking it was a one-off case [00:50] that was 12 years ago and now we are [00:53] diagnosing cases of Lyme disease in our [00:55] patients every week in Ontario there [00:59] were thousands of positive cases in dogs [01:01] last year and the incidents increased [01:03] from 2023 to the equivalent quarter in [01:06] 2024 by [01:08] 50% uh one thing that's interesting is [01:11] uh they've shown now that in Ontario uh [01:15] more than the blacklegged tick which is [01:17] the real name for the deer tick um the [01:19] other types of ticks also can carry uh [01:23] tickborne diseases and boria um it it's [01:26] just such a widespread problem I think [01:28] we can't we don't need to think in the [01:31] way of oh is my dog going to be exposed [01:34] I don't think I'm at risk it's only it's [01:36] only deer ticks I think we have to think [01:38] at all of our pets are at risk we're all [01:40] at risk and how are we preventing this [01:43] ticks live in our environment they live [01:45] everywhere now uh they like to hide [01:47] underneath leaf mold and litter on the [01:49] ground and then as soon as temperatures [01:52] are above 4 degrees celsus they start to [01:54] become active and they climb up little [01:57] blades of grass and then they wait for [02:00] an animal of any kind a mouse a rabbit a [02:03] deer your dog yourself to walk by and [02:06] brush against that blade of grass and [02:08] then they hijack onto your body holy [02:10] hijack they will climb up our clothes [02:13] along a dog's hair coat and then they [02:15] find a little place to tuck in they [02:17] attach they hang out there for up to six [02:20] days depending on when you find them [02:22] they don't transmit disease however [02:24] until about 36 hours or beyond that I I [02:28] think it depends by species there's one [02:31] tick species I'm pretty sure it's the [02:33] blacklegged tick that carries lime or [02:35] the boria organism that causes lime [02:37] disease that tick lights a bit cooler so [02:40] not when it's really hot so spring and [02:42] fall are really uh high peak times for [02:45] that tick also Dawn and dusk when the [02:48] temperature isn't quite so hot uh a [02:51] different species of tick is more active [02:53] with longer daylight so that tick is it [02:55] more active in the summer um but there's [02:59] there's not a Time unless it is a deep [03:00] freeze when ticks aren't active they are [03:02] just a huge risk these days if you're [03:04] hiking with your dog I think we just [03:06] have to keep ticks in mind you if you [03:09] keep your dog on a leash and you're on a [03:11] well- groomed Trail your exposure to [03:14] ticks for the chance of your dog being [03:16] exposed to ticks is very limited but if [03:19] you are really having a fun hike with [03:20] your dog and you want to let them off [03:22] leash and they're running around then [03:23] they are at risk of being exposed to [03:25] ticks and so that's where some of the [03:27] tick prevention and things like that [03:29] come in handy there are only two ways [03:32] really to uh effectively and safely [03:35] prevent ticks topically the only group [03:40] of chemicals that works to stop ticks [03:43] from attaching are called the [03:45] pyrethroids these originally were [03:47] discovered they come from chrysanthemums [03:49] they're used in a lot of flea sprays [03:51] horse fly sprays we now synthetically [03:55] make types of [03:57] pyrethroids but they when you spray them [03:59] on an animal The Tick will get on and [04:02] will not attach Unfortunately they don't [04:06] have a high safety index they are toxic [04:09] to cats and they can be toxic to small [04:11] dogs if not used in the correct dose but [04:14] they do work and for you know so for [04:16] young healthy dogs throughout hiking and [04:18] they have other forms of tick prevention [04:20] and thing we can also say if they're at [04:22] higher risk you could spray them with [04:24] this before the hike to be like you [04:26] putting in sectr pelan on before you go [04:28] outside by far um the product that we [04:31] recommend the most or the type of [04:32] product uh and that is the most widely [04:34] used are the systemic preventions and [04:38] these are products that have been [04:40] produced by pharmaceutical companies [04:43] they have had a ton of research dollars [04:46] and development time in their making [04:49] they are safe and they are effective [04:51] there are four or five different brands [04:54] on the market now these these class of [04:58] drugs are all effective against tick so [05:01] the tick the dog eats the prevention [05:03] they're all mostly made in a little beef [05:05] chew there are a couple also that are [05:07] topical and are absorbed that prevention [05:10] lasts for one to three months depending [05:12] on the product when the tick bites the [05:15] dog it absorbs this chemical which is [05:19] specific to Insects so it doesn't affect [05:21] the mammal cells and then the tick dies [05:24] within 24 hours of attachment so it does [05:27] not have the opportunity to prevent to [05:30] transmit disease there I mean there are [05:33] a lot of people who like to do things [05:34] that are more natural and they don't [05:35] want to use chemicals they don't want to [05:37] use drugs but ticks are badass and uh I [05:40] have seen some people have success with [05:42] certain things against fleas that are [05:44] more natural but the ticks seem to I [05:46] don't care whether it's garlic not a fan [05:49] of garlic lavender or whatever you're [05:52] using on your dog the ticks don't care [05:54] they're going to get on there anyway the [05:55] tick medication that is once a month [05:59] that the dogs either eat as a chew or is [06:02] absorbed across their skin those are by [06:05] prescription only the topical pyrethroid [06:08] based medications including advantics [06:11] are available over the counter there are [06:14] some general sort of copycats nobody [06:17] likes a copycat medications of those [06:19] available in feed stores and things that [06:21] I'm not comfortable with the dosing in [06:23] them some of the Amazon and online [06:27] products have been tested and shown to [06:29] not have in like they they copy the [06:30] labels and they don't actually have in [06:33] them what's supposed to be in them it's [06:34] not the product you think it is the [06:35] nerve so I think you should still [06:38] purchase any kind of tick prevention on [06:40] the advice of your veterinarian I think [06:42] I think one thing about the medications [06:44] um the Internet is just it's it can be [06:48] full of [06:49] misinformation and there is some [06:51] misinformation out there about the tick [06:53] preventive products um I'm going to talk [06:56] about one piece of misinformation [06:58] specifically there is a thought that [07:00] some of the tick preventions cause [07:02] seizures complaining of adverse side [07:04] effects of these drugs near the top of [07:06] the list seizures and I thought I'd [07:09] explain where that came from so I have [07:12] clients come to me and they say well I [07:13] don't want tip prevention because it's [07:14] going to cause my dog to seizure so when [07:17] the com the pharmaceutical company put [07:21] the tick prevention on the market they [07:22] had to do a series of studies uh where [07:24] they give many of those doses to dogs [07:26] and they have to report all side effects [07:28] and all those side effects put on the [07:30] label seizures was not one of the side [07:32] effects that was experienced in the [07:34] initial studies once hundreds and [07:37] hundreds of thousands of doses were [07:39] given and administered to our pets there [07:42] were some reports of seizures in most of [07:45] these cases some of the dogs already had [07:47] a seizure disorder it wasn't you know [07:49] specifically known it wasn't in the in [07:51] the environment of a controlled study to [07:53] know if they specifically were caused by [07:55] the medication or not but the FDA went [07:58] ahead and had the company [08:00] redo their label and add seizures as one [08:02] of the possible side effects in that [08:05] process which was a good process the [08:08] internet got hold of the information and [08:09] it went crazy and got misinterpreted so [08:12] um that really isn't a concern um that's [08:15] a that's a good question first of all [08:16] the ticks are usually around the face we [08:18] have a little Coco here around the face [08:20] and the legs because this part of the [08:22] dog is where they are putting their nose [08:24] into the grass to sniff and the front [08:26] legs are going through the grass first [08:28] so most of the ticks are found around [08:30] the front end of the dog when a little [08:33] tick nip which is the baby version of a [08:36] tick attaches to your dog it is the size [08:39] of a poppy seed I have so many people [08:42] tell me my dog doesn't have ticks I I [08:45] check hert every day and I've never [08:46] found a tick I think it's really hard to [08:49] see those ticks when they first attached [08:52] I mean this dog has a lot you know a [08:53] long black hair coat how am I going to [08:56] find a little tiny poppy seed of a tick [08:59] NP until it's been there for 3 Days gets [09:02] to the size where I can actually say oh [09:05] she's got a tick on [09:06] her and then by then it's already [09:08] transmitted burela or one of the other [09:10] tickborne diseases so the I guess the [09:14] answer to your questions I don't think [09:15] there is any good way manually to be [09:18] able to be sure 100% sure you're getting [09:20] all the ticks off of your dog you can [09:22] use a pair of tweezers and you just take [09:25] those tweezers as close to the dog skin [09:27] as you can and you just gently pull [09:29] there are also uh little tick remover [09:32] tools that you can get we have a lot of [09:34] those available and um we can show you [09:36] one here we came across a tick couple of [09:40] days after an outing so it's still alive [09:43] I can see legs it's slightly engorged [09:46] it's probably been on there 12 to 24 [09:48] hours or so what I'm going to do here is [09:50] get as close to the skin as possible [09:53] with this Critter and without twisting [09:57] just put steady pressure and and I'm not [10:00] pulling really [10:03] hard and there we go the um there's [10:06] really a funny myth that if you leave [10:10] the head of the tick in the dog [10:12] something happens I'm not sure what that [10:14] is that happens or it's still going to [10:16] be transmitting disease but that's not [10:17] true the the little organisms um that [10:20] cause disease burela and anaplasmosis [10:22] they're in The Tick's body and [10:24] circulating um it's not like there's an [10:26] alien going to grow in your dog if it [10:29] when you pull it out usually the head is [10:31] there and you don't need to go digging [10:33] around looking for any missing mouth [10:34] Parts that'll just die and the dog's [10:37] body will wall that off sometimes you'll [10:39] see quite a bump in a crust where a tit [10:41] comes off a dog because they create an [10:43] immune response and an inflammatory [10:46] response so the dog's tissues will get a [10:48] little bump and across there so what [10:50] does lyme disease look like in our pet [10:53] dogs I guess classically we thought it [10:55] was leness lethargy maybe a bit of a [10:58] fever but what I have learned that [11:00] almost any presentation of illness that [11:03] walks into my clinic could be Lyme [11:07] disease I've seen swollen eyes lame legs [11:10] paralyzed faces lethargy kidney disease [11:14] poor ability to perform and many many [11:17] other variations I no longer think oh [11:20] this looks like lime I think oh I better [11:22] test for line so I I think what's [11:25] happening is that you could have for [11:28] instance you could test the dog for Lyme [11:30] disease for berila and it's still sick [11:32] and seems to either have some like I had [11:35] one case that came from the states that [11:37] had all kinds of negative tests for Lyme [11:40] disease but the blood looked like Lyme [11:42] disease as far as how the blood counts [11:44] were or a tickborne disease let's say [11:46] and that dog ended up uh responding to [11:50] the medication for tickborne disease [11:53] even though we had negative tests in [11:55] people too it's in the human literature [11:57] it's quite well document that tis are [12:00] spreading a number of diseases and we're [12:02] not able to even test for them all in [12:04] January of [12:05] 2023 uh in Ontario the disease [12:09] anaplasmosis was also uh made to be [12:12] reportable like burela and we've had [12:14] three or four cases of that at our [12:16] clinic now too another tickborne disease [12:18] there is one medication and it's called [12:20] oxy cycling it uh seems to be effective [12:23] for all of the tickborne diseases but [12:25] again it's killing the organism stopping [12:28] the organism from reproducing it's not [12:31] mediating this immune response that the [12:34] body has which also seems to do ongoing [12:36] damage in addition there are some herbal [12:38] supplements for instance in our practice [12:40] we have a veterinarian who's [12:41] knowledgeable on Chinese herbs and we [12:43] have an herbal formula that also helps [12:46] uh maintain these patients with [12:47] long-term Lyme disease symptoms I had a [12:50] huge learning curve the last few years [12:53] um you can get the classic dog come in [12:56] uh be lame be a little bit off positive [12:59] you put them on the medication which is [13:01] doxy cycline and some people have told [13:03] me within one dose and like my dog did [13:06] as well one dose they're a different [13:08] they're a different dog they feel better [13:10] they're back to normal even though we do [13:11] treat for 28 days in some cases and I [13:15] feel that these are the cases that [13:17] either had a high exposure or it took a [13:21] while for the pet owner to realize that [13:25] something was off with the dog and the [13:27] dog has had the organism for for a while [13:30] the body the dog's own immune system [13:33] responds to the organism and this immune [13:37] response itself just like in people can [13:40] cause ongoing waxing and waning symptoms [13:44] and signs for months or years now that [13:47] I'm about three years into this process [13:49] I can think of three patients in [13:50] particular that still have flares and we [13:52] still put them back on doxy cycling I I [13:55] think that used to be done where we [13:57] would um save ticks and test them if [13:59] people still bring us tests ticks to [14:00] test say that five times fast and we can [14:03] do that to see whether or not they had [14:05] burela in them or not that's what you're [14:07] testing for um but these days ticks are [14:12] transmitting many diseases a tick [14:14] doesn't just have brelia and then [14:15] another tick just has anaplasmosis it's [14:18] known that they are what they call [14:20] co-infections using preventions [14:22] monitoring for clinical signs of [14:25] tickborne disease and testing the actual [14:28] dog for the tick born diseases is more [14:31] useful than just testing the tick I I I [14:34] don't think I'm in it far enough I have [14:35] to see these dogs that we've diagnosed [14:37] in the last three years age out to know [14:40] if that's a question but what I what I [14:42] have noticed is that the ones that have [14:46] repeatedly come back for for certain [14:49] signs that we treat it's like they're [14:51] static it's like they're not getting [14:53] worse but if the dog was started at 100% [14:56] I can only get it back to 80% and uh [14:59] each time we treat it there I can think [15:01] of one case this is a greated example [15:03] the dog had multiple ticks on its [15:07] face um I saw this dog later in in the [15:11] course it had been to a different [15:12] veterinarian before but the dog ended up [15:16] having a droopy face so it had what we [15:18] call a neuropathy and perhaps a myopathy [15:20] where the muscle was affected too um the [15:22] dog couldn't swallow the dog couldn't [15:25] move its tongue well uh its lips sagged [15:28] the side of its f face and its ey sagged [15:31] when the dog came to me um we figured [15:34] out that this was burela caused or Lyme [15:36] disease and I did some reading in the [15:38] human literature and it was interesting [15:40] they've noticed in people that get [15:41] neuropathies which is a nerve damage [15:44] from the pilia organism that it can [15:47] happen at the site of attachment which [15:49] made sense for this dog because it had [15:51] so many ticks the owner said they pull [15:52] so many ticks off its face that's where [15:55] the dog had most of the problem we got [15:57] that dog with treatment a point where it [16:00] eats uh it can move its tongue it can [16:03] swallow but it will continue to have a [16:05] droop on its face and sort of some [16:07] shallow muscle on that side of its head [16:10] for the rest of its life and some [16:12] lethargy it never got back to its [16:14] regular energy level uh I have a client [16:17] uh kale mccan who has beline who is a [16:21] high level agility [16:23] dog and one year two years ago now uh [16:28] kale noticed when this dog was doing [16:30] agility runs including World [16:32] Championship agility runs that she would [16:35] just randomly fall off the aett or have [16:38] a fall over a jump and this is not a dog [16:40] that does that so kale put together [16:43] video of four or five of these Falls [16:46] that all happened within within a few [16:48] months uh period of time and I slow down [16:51] the videos and I watch them I thought oh [16:52] maybe you know there's one leg or [16:53] shoulder or something that's bothering [16:55] her and if I slow them down I can see [16:57] exactly what's happening [16:59] and if it's the same limb and it was a [17:01] different limb or a different sort of [17:03] move that caused beine to wipe out uh [17:07] every single time and it seemed to be a [17:09] timing thing and I wondered about her [17:11] having uh like a coordination or because [17:14] her little border colly brain was [17:16] telling her feet what to do so quickly [17:18] and then they just weren't quite getting [17:20] to where they were and it just the [17:22] thought of lime disease came to me and I [17:24] said to kale let's test the dog for Lyme [17:26] disease and she was positive and I [17:28] didn't I didn't know at that time was [17:30] this dog positive for lying but then [17:32] still having a training problem in [17:33] addition were these things correlated so [17:36] we put her on doxy cycling and the [17:38] problem went away that Illustrated to me [17:41] this dog was missing apparatus at high [17:44] level agility if this dog had belonged [17:47] to uh you know the average pet owner who [17:49] goes hiking twice a week they never ever [17:52] would have noticed clinical signs in [17:55] this dog because in every other way she [17:57] seems perfectly normal therefore that [18:00] told me that you don't have to have [18:03] kidney disease or changes on blood work [18:06] Lyme disease can cause subtle changes [18:09] and let's face it the pets don't talk so [18:11] they're not going to say you know I've [18:13] just had this funny feeling in my leg if [18:16] it doesn't affect them in a way the [18:18] client can see then we're not going to [18:20] know so I am much more open-minded now [18:24] in how I choose to treat these animals [18:26] there's no textbook that tells you about [18:28] that's that's why the screening tests [18:30] are so important um even on prevention [18:33] you know I I'm I'm not perfect about [18:35] giving my Prevention to Coco on the [18:37] first of the month every month it's uh [18:39] the screening test that we run which is [18:41] called the SNAP test so it has heartworm [18:44] it has Baria which is the organism that [18:46] causes lme it has anaplasmosis which is [18:49] the most recently recognized tickborne [18:51] disease in Ontario it also has two types [18:53] of er liia which are tickborne diseases [18:56] and so with about four or five drop of [18:59] blood we can test for antibodies which [19:02] is exposure to these diseases and and [19:05] the Heart it also tests for actual [19:07] proteins from heartworm but the [19:08] tickborne part of the test are [19:10] antibodies and if it's positive it says [19:12] that the dog has been exposed to these [19:14] tick born diseases then it's a [19:16] conversation with the owner whether [19:18] there are any clinical signs or whether [19:19] or not we should be treating so today we [19:22] had a tick talk and we learned all about [19:24] ticks about Lyme disease about this huge [19:27] problem that we are facing with our dogs [19:29] in Southern Ontario we even broke down [19:31] some myths so if you want to break down [19:33] some more myths and learn some more [19:35] truths about our dogs check out this [19:37] video I'm Dr Paula and

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,, Part 424/429,~Ken #mccanndogs #stopdogjumping === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] so this we probably haven't we haven't [00:02] mentioned five at all if if people are [00:04] brand new here they might not even know [00:06] him he's Perfection aren't you buddy [00:09] he's pretty darn cute this is our [00:10] youngest dog his name is five alive he [00:13] is a whippet [00:15] bordoli Jack Russell many terrier mixes [00:21] and he's just two years old and uh we [00:24] thought he'd just chill out behind us [00:25] while we talk he's gone through the [00:27] whole jumping up phase um yeah and we're [00:30] through it on the other side and he's [00:32] very springy like he natur he loves to [00:34] be airborne actually uh but he just [00:37] learns to be airborne without it being [00:40] on a human right yeah yeah because [00:42] you've you've created some rules around [00:44] that um you know I don't want to get too [00:47] much into the weeds of like sometimes [00:49] with some dogs you might allow them to [00:50] jump up a little bit more and then rain [00:52] them in a little bit but before we get [00:54] to to that well actually I can say is [00:56] one thing that I have done with him [00:58] because jumping up in jumping is such a [01:01] fun thing for him to do I [01:03] actually I actually taught him um how to [01:07] do it as a trick so one of the tricks [01:09] that he knows is I'll put my arms up and [01:11] I'll say hop up and he will go from the [01:14] ground and he'll jump right up into my [01:16] arm so I can catch him um and it was a [01:19] really easy to trick a trick to train [01:20] because he naturally just wanted to jump [01:22] up all the time which has been great [01:24] it's a fun little trick that I do but [01:25] what's nice about it is now unless I say [01:28] hop hop he knows not to jump so it's a [01:31] good like now you do it now you don't [01:33] type of thing so if it's a trick that [01:34] you want to train you still can do that [01:36] because then you can train them to also [01:37] not do it uh did you see the attention [01:39] he's giving you when you're giving him a [01:40] familiar command I know he's like how do [01:42] I hop up from a table behind you um [01:45] let's talk about Crossing his paws it's [01:47] very cute GLE proper um we're going to [01:50] talk about I think three areas of [01:52] challenge that a lot of you might have [01:54] at home uh tonight and uh let's talk [01:57] about counters um jumping up on people [02:00] and then jumping up on other objects I [02:01] want to start with counters y I think [02:03] it's it can be a little bit more [02:04] controlled and I think it'll lead nicely [02:06] into the jumping up on people I actually [02:08] have a video that you may have seen here [02:10] on the channel uh set up that I pulled [02:13] um in into the uh the live stream [02:14] tonight that kale and I might um we [02:17] might rev it's probably good to review [02:18] it I know you guys really enjoy when we [02:20] review some of those videos and you know [02:22] dive a little deeper into the steps uh [02:23] so we'll probably do that yeah that's [02:25] right let's let's uh talk about counters [02:29] and the challenge that most people have [02:31] I'll tell you right now because a lot of [02:33] people are going to say well this I mean [02:34] they only jump on the counter when I'm [02:36] not there if I'm not in the kitchen [02:38] that's when it happens and that's no [02:39] excuse we're going to talk to you a [02:41] little bit about how you can set your [02:42] dog up to maybe make those mistakes and [02:43] work through it but um if your dog is [02:46] continuing to make the same mistake over [02:48] and over and over again you can't put [02:50] them in a situation where they can make [02:51] the wrong choice uh the other thing we [02:54] should talk about for all of this for [02:57] all of these uh training examples you [02:59] are definitely going to want to have a [03:02] line on your dog and I don't care how [03:04] old they are or how much you think they [03:07] know it you need a house line or a leash [03:10] on the dog depending on the size uh you [03:13] need to have control you need to have [03:15] the right management Tools in place uh [03:17] because of that because I know that [03:19] jumping up was going to be a challenge [03:20] for a lot of you in tonight's chat uh we [03:22] actually make a house line I think it's [03:25] probably tagged on the video or [03:26] something it probably exists somewhere [03:27] on your screen somewhere and uh this is [03:30] exactly the kind of tool that we will [03:31] use to uh manage the dog in some of [03:34] these situations or you can use a leash [03:36] like your leash at home and they'll wear [03:38] it you're thinking like well I'm not [03:39] going for a walk why would my dog wear a [03:41] leash I'll tell you anytime you're [03:42] working on one of these nuisance [03:44] behaviors you must have control it when [03:47] you need it and a house line is a great [03:49] way to do that y um it is really [03:51] important to have a leash or line on and [03:54] it's also important to use it because um [03:57] you know when we get into the weeds and [03:59] how to train [04:00] this one of the things that we need to [04:02] make sure that we have really down path [04:05] that we're excellent at is delivering [04:07] our dogs information in really good [04:10] timing um because that's really the only [04:12] way that we're going to affect change is [04:14] if we are teaching our dog in a way that [04:16] they actually understand it um so the [04:19] timing of the information whether it's [04:21] telling them that they're good or [04:22] whether it's telling them that they're [04:23] wrong it has to be spoton and by having [04:26] a leash on it allows us to be able to [04:28] address the situation and in the moment [04:30] stop the dog from running into the other [04:32] room or grabbing things and taking off [04:34] that's going to be really important the [04:35] other reason why the line is so [04:36] important is it because it allows you to [04:38] gain control quickly and establish [04:40] yourself like a little bit more like a [04:42] leader again if you don't have a leash [04:44] or line on the dog and you're trying to [04:46] stop the dog and they again run away or [04:48] they turn it into a big game that's fun [04:50] and they're more likely to repeat it [04:52] again so the leash in order to train [04:54] this is an absolute must especially if [04:57] you're hoping for this Behavior to [04:58] become indep dependent they it for the [05:01] behavior to happen whether you're right [05:03] smack daad beside them or eventually [05:05] when they have um a little bit more [05:07] freedom in the house when they're older [05:08] a little bit more trustworthy can they [05:10] still follow these same rules um when [05:13] you're not side by side with them so the [05:14] leash is going to get is going to be the [05:16] thing that gets you there okay and this [05:17] is really good Shannon you brought up a [05:19] good important Point um Shannon said he [05:22] eats them uh and I I think you're [05:24] probably talking about the leash of the [05:25] house line super common um and this is a [05:27] complaint that a lot of people have when [05:29] they start using some of these [05:30] management tools it's normal yeah cuz [05:32] imagine not worried about it you've just [05:34] you've just attached a toy to your dog's [05:36] neck they they might see it that way [05:38] it's really important regardless of what [05:40] skill you're working on whatever you're [05:42] trying to fix that you're supervising [05:44] your dog anytime they have one of these [05:45] management tools on that you're [05:46] supervising your dog anytime they have a [05:48] chance to make a mistake whether it's [05:50] potty training it's jumping up it's [05:52] chewing on stuff whatever the thing is [05:54] you need to be a great leader for your [05:56] dog and that means you need to be a [05:57] great manager you need to be there with [05:59] them so so when your dog goes to chew on [06:01] their house line when your dog goes to [06:03] uh chew on the leash same thing as if [06:04] they were to chew on a pair of shoes um [06:06] you're going to uh mark it with your [06:08] voice step in you're going to take that [06:09] out of their mouth or whatever get them [06:11] to do something you know Kale's um we [06:14] have a great video I don't even remember [06:16] we've made so many videos but uh you're [06:17] were talking about um him five chewing [06:19] on the house line because he did when [06:21] when we started they all do it's sure [06:24] but because kale was supervising him she [06:26] caught it caught him in the ACT uh took [06:29] it out of mouth got him to do something [06:31] and then in in the video I think you [06:33] asked him to go lie down on a bed she [06:34] gives him a job redirect his attention [06:36] to something El absolutely now so now [06:38] she he's working for her a little bit [06:39] you know he's like okay I'm ke in this [06:41] is great if I give you something this [06:43] lie down on the bed then he gets [06:45] something and kale gave him like a [06:46] chewbone that he absolutely loved we're [06:48] not looking to um stuff something in the [06:51] dog's face so that they choose that [06:54] right choose that thing over chewing on [06:55] the leasher line we're getting them to [06:57] put their put you know uh uh change [06:59] refocus their attention it uh makes them [07:02] work makes them think a little bit use a [07:04] little brain now they've learned that if [07:05] they give you something they get [07:07] something yeah keep that in mind I think [07:08] the other thing to remember too is that [07:10] most of the time when I hear from people [07:11] that their dog choose the line their [07:14] dogs are wearing the line like 5% in [07:16] comparison to my 100% absolutely point [07:19] the novelty wears off you know when he [07:21] first had it on he he when he was a [07:23] puppy he would wear the house line in [07:25] the house and not even just for jumping [07:27] up it was for any any puppy behavior [07:30] that they do because they're puppies and [07:31] they don't know any better but he [07:33] literally wore that house line every [07:35] single second and I'm not exaggerating [07:38] that he was out of his kennel in the [07:39] house so if we were playing if we were [07:41] going outside for a pee if we were lying [07:43] and chewing on a bone if we were [07:44] snuggling whatever he was doing he was [07:46] wearing the line and for the first [07:48] couple days yep he was super excited [07:49] about it but then it just sort of became [07:51] like an additional appendage and there [07:53] his novel he wore off and he just wasn't [07:55] that worried about it but the first [07:57] couple times he tried to eat it I had [07:58] great supervision and I stopped him [08:00] right away he didn't get five or six [08:02] minutes to Chomp on the line when I was [08:03] paying wasn't paying attention because I [08:05] was always paying attention and because [08:07] he didn't get the rehearsal of chewing [08:09] and chewing and chewing and thinking [08:10] like oh this is fun he didn't get a [08:12] chance to learn it was fun because I was [08:14] right there to stop him from doing it [08:15] and redirect him so you know a lot of [08:17] people don't understand that you [08:20] actually have to do some work when we do [08:22] do these things and if you just can [08:23] supervise and you can be there quickly [08:25] you can change behaviors so fast it's [08:30] people let let it go on for too long and [08:31] then it's harder to fix yeah and I mean [08:33] we're not talking specifically about [08:34] house line we're talking specifically [08:36] about management tools so uh I had I I [08:39] you know I mentioned at the top of the [08:40] show at some point um excuse me that I [08:42] brought uh my dog was two years old when [08:44] I came into Mand dogs and you know had [08:46] to address all these changes uh we had [08:48] an 8-year-old dog come in the house at [08:50] at one point and uh he went on a house [08:52] line until we were sure that he was [08:54] going to make all the right choices it [08:56] doesn't matter the age of dog you know [08:58] it it it so don't think well he he knows [09:00] this or you know he's getting he's older [09:03] I don't know if i' put put put a leash [09:04] or a line on him and the reason you want [09:06] to do that is because you want to give [09:08] your dog the best information with the [09:10] best timing it's going to make a huge [09:11] difference in your training so when you [09:14] can do that you don't have to chase them [09:15] down you don't have to chase after them [09:17] grab hold of their scruff of their [09:19] collar or grab their collar which is [09:21] more difficult also you know can be [09:23] pretty invasive the dog it it could be [09:25] startling if you can get control from a [09:26] few feet away whether this is jumping up [09:28] on the leash or jumping up on uh people [09:31] jumping up on uh PE uh uh counters or [09:34] couches or whatever doesn't matter what [09:36] the thing is you need to have some extra [09:38] control eventually you can you're [09:40] obviously going to wean away from some [09:41] of these things but right now while you [09:43] have a problem put extra effort in to [09:46] make sure that you've always got a [09:47] little bit more control of that dog [09:49] because they are going to need it and [09:50] you're going to thank yourself down [09:52] you're going to thank us down the road [09:54] so let's talk about counters we took a [09:56] bit of a redirect but I think it was [09:57] important that you understand how [09:58] important management is in a situation [10:00] like this yeah I think we need to talk [10:02] about clarity as well and um you know we [10:05] talked about like physically what we [10:06] want to do a little bit but we also need [10:08] to talk about words commands you know [10:10] what do we say when we want our dogs not [10:12] to jump up oh this is good maybe we give [10:15] it to them oh okay what do you what what [10:17] word do you use when you don't want your [10:19] dog to jump up on something or when they [10:21] have jumped up maybe you catch them on [10:23] the counter what word immediately comes [10:25] to your your mind what what's that thing [10:27] um maybe we can talk while we're getting [10:30] some answers about [10:32] uh confusion you know without answering [10:36] the question we can talk a little bit [10:37] about too many words I'm picking up what [10:38] you're putting down yeah um so one of [10:41] the things that we want to do uh when [10:43] we're training our dogs with all of our [10:45] commands that we use is we want to try [10:47] and have consistent commands that mean [10:50] the same thing every single time and [10:51] then with our training we actually take [10:53] it one step further we want to be able [10:55] to say the command only one time so that [10:58] the dog is really clear that this word [11:00] means this that word means that and that [11:02] they listen be sometimes difficult for [11:04] the dogs to differentiate so what they [11:06] end up doing is they end up feeding off [11:08] a little bit more of your body language [11:09] rather than your word because your words [11:12] don't mean the same thing all the time [11:13] and while that can be fine for some [11:15] situations the ultimate goal is that [11:17] your dog can really have good verbal [11:19] control because that means that you're [11:21] not dependent on you know what hands you [11:24] use if you're using any hands at all if [11:26] you're bending over if you're sitting in [11:27] a in a couch rather than standing up if [11:30] you're halfway across a field or not we [11:32] want the dogs to learn to listen to our [11:34] voices and not be dependent on um our [11:37] actual words so uh sorry our actual body [11:40] language so it's important that what we [11:42] have as a command we really thoroughly [11:44] know the meaning of that and that we're [11:46] consistent with it okay so I see some uh [11:50] very responses yeah I see I see down I [11:53] see off I see no I see a so let's talk a [11:57] little bit about what we use okay um I'm [11:59] going to start off with saying no I'm [12:01] going to start off with with the no word [12:03] first um actually I will say we use the [12:05] word off okay and I'll I'll you'll get [12:08] to know why as we sort of talk about [12:10] this um why would we not use the word no [12:13] so in this situation the word no doesn't [12:17] really tell the dog what they should do [12:20] it simply tells the dog what they [12:22] shouldn't do um so it which should be [12:25] important that if you say hi buddy come [12:27] here up come on [12:29] no that's not a lot of room it's okay [12:31] you can do it there you go um you should [12:35] tell them what they should not do so by [12:37] saying no it's like okay no I'm wrong [12:39] but what what should I be doing instead [12:41] so we would rather use a command that [12:43] actually has um some meaning you could [12:45] maybe use a verbal reprimand if you [12:46] needed to but a lot of dogs are pretty [12:48] quick and um you know it it's probably [12:51] best just to get the word out that [12:52] you're looking for um the other word [12:54] that I see in there is the word down now [12:57] I know a lot of people say the down and [13:00] I guess suppose it depends on what you [13:02] use um for the dog as a command to [13:05] actually lie down like what five was [13:07] doing on the table before that would [13:09] what we we would call that down and so I [13:12] don't want to say down and expect him to [13:14] lie all the way down on the floor um you [13:16] know and a sphinx or lie all the way [13:18] down and then other times St down and [13:20] then you know is he supposed to lie down [13:22] on the couch or is she supposed to get [13:23] off the couch um so again if you have a [13:26] different word for the actual lie down [13:28] perhaps it doesn't matter you know you [13:29] can use whatever words you want they [13:31] need to be consistent but for us we try [13:33] to avoid using the word down because it [13:35] has such a specific meaning um and we [13:38] instead use the word off now one thing [13:40] that I think people don't actually [13:41] realize is for us off means don't jump [13:46] in the first place not get off the [13:48] person so you know if the dog is jumping [13:52] and we've missed our moment yes you [13:53] could use off but we want to try and [13:55] make sure so if my dog somebody was [13:57] approaching my dog and my dog started to [13:59] wiggle and get really excited before my [14:02] dog had a chance to jump I would start [14:04] to preemptively say off and remind the [14:08] dog remember we're not jumping in the [14:10] first place um rather than get off once [14:13] the dog's already up there so we suggest [14:15] that you use the word off and then save [14:17] some of those other commands for other [14:19] situations just for clarity and [14:21] consistency sake for the pup yeah and [14:23] this this might be a light bulb moment [14:25] for you uh because the amount of people [14:27] that I and I saw just the other day I [14:28] don't remember where it was was when [14:29] remember thinking like oh that poor dog [14:31] uh someone was saying sit down sit down [14:33] sit down sit down sit down and the dog [14:36] you know the dogs just they would have [14:38] my dogs would literally sit then down [14:39] then sit then down then sit then down [14:40] like a Jack In The Box yeah um talking [14:43] about counters so if you have a puppy [14:46] that might be in a might be interested [14:49] with what's on the counter there's a few [14:52] indications some signs that they're [14:54] going to give you that they're starting [14:55] to think about jumping up that they [14:57] might be interested and this applies to [14:59] counter couch whatever anytime they're [15:02] trying to get like to an elevated [15:04] surface and some things you're going to [15:07] notice especially when it comes to like [15:08] your kitchen countertop is they might [15:11] start doing some air senting like oh is [15:13] that is that bread a fresh bread on the [15:15] counter th chicken yeah like what is [15:18] that thing are those cookies up there I [15:20] mean because their sense of smell is so [15:21] good but that'll be a pretty early [15:23] indication that they're thinking about [15:25] checking it out they're thinking about [15:26] it and uh kale just talked aled about [15:29] great timing using the off being [15:31] preemptive with the off so that you [15:32] don't have to fix the problem you you [15:34] can prevent it that could be a great [15:36] time to issue your off Y and a lot of [15:39] people don't really understand why that [15:42] works but your dog's brain is on getting [15:45] that thing up there you issue that off [15:47] command or you just tell them hey off [15:49] whatever you know however you want to [15:51] deliver the information sorry buddy [15:53] however you want to deliver that [15:54] information and your dog is going to [15:56] think you're some sort of psychic [15:57] they're going to be so how did you know [15:59] I think you know that yeah absolutely um [16:03] so you know the other thing they might [16:05] do is stand absolutely still or you [16:07] might see them start to dip their front [16:09] end because they're about to jump up you [16:10] can see them get a good one they start [16:13] to coil yes that's a great like they're [16:15] about to jump they start to coil their [16:17] body so that they can get a good pounce [16:19] yeah for sure yep I know I I've heard [16:22] some dogs will actually literally jump [16:24] all the way up on the counter not even [16:26] just the front paws all four paws for [16:29] sure and and here's the challenge is uh [16:32] if you have a sit a dog that loves to [16:34] hop on the counters or jump up onto [16:36] things like that um it's so gratifying [16:39] if they reward themselves once if [16:41] there's one time that they get a chance [16:44] to eat that loaf of bread or grab that [16:46] sandwich or you know grab the chicken uh [16:49] that's on the counter you it it's so [16:51] much harder to fix it so at this point [16:53] in your training really be consistent [16:55] about you know being aware of what's in [16:57] your counters more importantly [16:58] supervising dog when they're in that [17:00] situation so let's imagine that um let's [17:05] imagine the dog is jumping up on the [17:07] counter and somehow you've missed it or [17:10] or or you know you've uh they're not [17:13] they haven't quite self- rewarded but [17:14] they've jumped on the counter what's [17:15] your next step well the next thing is to [17:18] try and get control of the dog as [17:20] quickly as possible and this is where we [17:21] get to Circle back to our house line or [17:24] our leash because the very first thing [17:26] that I want to do is make sure that I [17:27] can bend work through it with the dog I [17:29] have to get the dog off of the counter [17:31] and a lot of the time if we go to step [17:33] in towards the dog to get them off the [17:35] counter they're either going to do one [17:37] of two things they're going to try and [17:38] madly scarf down whatever on the counter [17:40] that they're trying to get or they're [17:42] going to take the item or not and [17:44] they're going to take off and run away [17:45] from you because they think I'm not [17:46] sticking around to get in trouble here [17:49] and a lot of times people stop there [17:52] they say ah get off there and the dog [17:54] takes off and runs and you you know move [17:56] towards the dog or you just sort of clap [17:57] your hands or something and the dog gets [17:59] off the counter and we think okay well [18:01] we stopped it now I'm good to go but [18:03] what people don't realize is when [18:05] there's actually no consequence or no [18:07] training involved all you're teaching [18:10] the dog to do is jump up on the counter [18:13] until somebody yells at you to get off [18:15] of the counter I can't tell you how many [18:18] dogs I know that understand what off [18:20] means because I you know people say to [18:22] me you know I say off and he gets off [18:25] but then 5 minutes later he's up on the [18:26] counter again he's up on the counter [18:28] again say often he does it and you know [18:31] the big thing that people are missing is [18:33] the consequence and the training part so [18:37] this is where this next step comes in if [18:39] I step in to get my dog to get off the [18:42] counter I'm actually going to follow [18:44] through with some type of redirection so [18:46] I'm going to step on the line I'm [18:48] probably going to pick the line off and [18:50] I might tell my dog off and give them a [18:52] quick little pop on the collar towards [18:54] the floor and then once they're on the [18:55] floor then I'm going to praise them so [18:57] that I say jumping is wrong four on the [19:00] flooor is correct and then I might even [19:02] stand there for a second and wait to see [19:05] what my dog does and my dog has two [19:06] choices they could very boldly jump up [19:08] on the counter and just completely [19:10] disrespect me and then I'm ready to you [19:12] know correct that behavior again or what [19:14] I'm hoping happens is I stand there for [19:17] a second with the leash in my hand and I [19:20] wait for the dog to make a decision and [19:22] that dog goes hm I'm not sure I want to [19:24] jump up right now and then I can say yay [19:27] good off good choice and then I can [19:30] praise and reward and reinforce my dog [19:32] and then I wouldn't just stop there I [19:34] would then go and give my dog something [19:36] else to do I might send them to their [19:37] bed I might give them a chewbone I might [19:40] have them go and lie down something that [19:41] says you know what you need to do [19:43] something for me now I need need to [19:44] listen to me but I'm going to go and [19:46] give you something a little bit more [19:47] productive to do what I'm not going to [19:48] do is turn my back to the dog and start [19:50] you know frying something on the stove [19:52] again and you know stop paying attention [19:54] to my dog because it's likely that they [19:56] could try it again especially if this is [19:58] a chronic problem so um supervision [20:01] needs to happen before during and after [20:04] so that you can um help influence all of [20:07] those different decisions but just [20:09] waving your hands at the dog and [20:10] clapping and yelling at them every time [20:12] they jump up until they get off and then [20:14] repeating that process is not going to [20:17] permanently fix your problem it's just [20:19] going just going to stop it in the [20:21] moment it's the training that happens [20:23] after you get them off that actually [20:25] stops them from jumping up ever again so [20:28] that this is not a chronic problem that [20:30] you have to deal with yeah I know a lot [20:32] of people have expressed a um have some [20:34] challenges challenges with uh dog [20:37] jumping up on people so I don't want to [20:38] spend too much time on counters but um [20:40] there uh you mentioned using the leash [20:43] of the house line um one thing that's [20:45] important is that you're guiding that [20:46] leash towards the ground uh you know [20:48] some people will have the leash in their [20:49] hand and want to pull the dog up and [20:51] away from the counter your techniques [20:52] really important here you don't want to [20:54] you flip them over backwards so your [20:55] leash goes in and towards the ground the [20:57] other thing is if your dog Do's making a [20:59] good wow look at how cute he is he could [21:01] if your dog if your dog's making a good [21:03] choice so we have a video somewhere uh [21:06] that talks about using processed cheese [21:08] so this is a great way to work to work [21:10] on this exercise processed cheese is [21:13] like thin and very malleable and it can [21:15] like wrap over a countertop over the [21:16] corner of a counter really easily now [21:19] whether you consume processed cheese or [21:20] not I leave that entirely up to you but [21:22] it's nice when you're training a dog to [21:23] have some in house you do it with [21:24] delicious Cracker Barrel uh block like [21:29] no you couldn't it's too it's not M [21:31] enough it's also just too delicious and [21:33] you should just eat it yeah um so what I [21:35] want you to do if if you're struggling [21:37] with something like um counter jumping [21:39] is you get that leasher line in your [21:41] hand you're going to work on a sit at [21:43] your side right beside that counter and [21:45] then you can roll that cheese just over [21:47] the edge of the countertop you'll [21:49] literally sit with your dog and allow [21:51] them to you know make their choices [21:53] you're going to reward them away from [21:56] that cheese away from the countertop if [21:58] they choose not to jump up but if they [22:00] do try to jump up you're there you have [22:02] the leash in your hands you can tell [22:03] them off and guide them down and away [22:07] it's a great way if you've discovered [22:08] that you have this problem of like [22:10] incorporating it into a you know a real [22:12] world situation and uh practice practice [22:16] practice be sure that you're giving your [22:18] dog the appropriate amount of Freedom um [22:21] you know when they're in the kitchen [22:23] maybe need a longer line if they they're [22:25] persistent about jumping up on the [22:27] counter but you have to be able to catch [22:29] them in the act and what we just talked [22:31] about with uh being proactive is a great [22:34] way for your dog to very quickly learn [22:36] that jumping up on the counter is just [22:38] not allowed I know uh Maggie had asked [22:41] like well what what age should I start [22:42] teaching this well the right away right [22:45] away as soon as soon as they start to [22:47] let you know that they're interested in [22:49] jumping up on the counter you don't have [22:51] to wait um to train an exercise like [22:53] this it's really a lot of it when [22:54] they're really little too it's just [22:56] about supervision oh yeah because if can [22:58] get on top of it early you almost like I [23:02] I I can't think of the dog that we've [23:05] had in years that has even tried to jump [23:08] on the counter because we start when [23:10] they're puppies about teaching them what [23:12] they should be doing when they're in the [23:13] kitchen with us and because they never [23:15] really get to test the theory out of [23:17] jumping up on the counter because you [23:19] know we're always doing something [23:22] specific with them it's just not really [23:24] something that we have to deal with it's [23:25] called proactive training that's [23:27] literally what we teach in puppy [23:29] Essentials and life skills it's [23:31] proactive training teaching them what to [23:33] do first uh because what they learn [23:35] first they they learn best the goal is [23:37] to set them up so that they learn the [23:38] right things first so that you don't [23:41] have all of these unwanted behaviors [23:43] that you're trying to fix that happens [23:45] too because not everybody's perfect [23:46] right from the beginning but that is the [23:48] goal is to to start early and um you [23:51] have less problems you have to work [23:52] through because you get ahead of the [23:54] storm briefly um let's talk about uh [23:57] their opportunity to train with us [23:59] because I know you know we're giving [24:00] sort of generalized advice but in our [24:02] programs we give specific advice for you [24:04] and your dog whether it's in person or [24:05] online so just very briefly puppy [24:07] Essentials maybe or life skills yeah [24:09] well just I can sort of speak generally [24:11] about it you know you guys um probably [24:13] found us because you've watched on [24:14] YouTube we have amazing YouTube videos [24:16] of course um lots of instructions lots [24:19] of things that you can train your dogs [24:20] to do but something that we can do [24:22] really differently in class when we work [24:24] with you is you only way people say well [24:25] what do you do when you have a husky [24:26] what if you do when you have a havy what [24:28] if you do what do you do if my dog [24:30] doesn't like treats what if you do if my [24:32] dog just constantly bites on the leash [24:34] well um or it's not working yeah I tried [24:36] that and it's not working when we are [24:38] working one-on-one with you we get to be [24:40] so nitpicky about all the itty bitty [24:43] details where we can tailor exactly what [24:45] we're talking about to make sure that [24:47] you and your dog specifically get it and [24:49] we can tweak things because you know dog [24:51] training is not a you know you do this [24:53] then you do this then you do this and it [24:55] works with every single dog that's [24:57] that's not how it works you're not [24:58] fixing Plumbing no there's you know you [25:01] have to kind of learn how to bring out [25:03] what is best in each dog and also in [25:06] each person you know we're really people [25:08] trainers um you know we work with you [25:10] specifically so that you learn to work [25:12] with your dog and I think that's sort of [25:14] the ideal thing about coming to inperson [25:16] classes or even our online classes you [25:18] know we work really hard to get to know [25:20] you and your dog really well so that our [25:22] uh feedback to you can be really [25:24] specific so that you feel supported [25:26] because training dogs and puppies is [25:29] frustrating sometimes and you know [25:31] sometimes you just want to give up or [25:32] you think like oh my gosh this dog's [25:34] never going to do it and then you just [25:36] get some direction and then um you can [25:40] have an entirely different relationship [25:42] with your dog um so yeah so it's our [25:44] puppy Essentials is for puppies that are [25:46] under four months and life skills is for [25:48] dogs um any age over that and um the [25:52] programs are specifically detailed to [25:54] what should be worked on with dogs of [25:56] those um respectful ages for in person [25:59] and online you get personalized support [26:00] y yeah just so that we know moving [26:02] forward if you're like I this you know [26:04] this isn't working for me or I don't [26:06] quite get it that's a great way to find [26:08] more support is in those programs um I [26:10] made a game time also they're just fun [26:12] yeah that's true I mean you can see a [26:13] lot of our um uh students that are in [26:15] the chat having a having a blast um I [26:19] made a game time decision I changed up [26:21] the video that I that I'd like to break [26:22] down a little bit from what I can see in [26:24] the chat I think a lot of people are [26:26] struggling with proximity and we can [26:28] talk a little bit about the training dog [26:30] training Target I know exactly the video [26:32] that you're going to go to yeah I this [26:34] is going to be something that you are [26:35] going to be quite intentional about but [26:37] this is going to solve your jumping up [26:39] problem faster uh because you're going [26:41] out of your way to make sure that your [26:43] dog is in a good learning uh space [26:46] literal space as well as like a learning [26:48] head space so um maybe let's just dive [26:51] into that video break and start talking [26:53] a little bit about this and then we can [26:55] come back out and go back to the [26:56] teaching plan for a minute [26:58] do [26:59] this and I'll take this okay ready to go [27:03] I'm [27:05] ready look about to sneeze at you I want [27:07] to introduce to you the concept of a [27:09] training Target so you know what a [27:11] Target looks like I want you to think [27:13] about those different areas as different [27:15] thresholds that you can use with your [27:17] dog to make things either easier or more [27:19] challenging as your dog's training [27:21] progresses so if you look at the biggest [27:23] um circle on a Target the usually the [27:25] easiest one to achieve it's going to be [27:27] the same with your dog training if [27:29] you're working with your dog around [27:31] other people think about having those [27:33] people stay in the biggest area of the [27:35] target the furthest away from your dog [27:38] um in order for your puppy to be [27:39] successful now if they're at a distance [27:41] and your dog is able to sit on a loose [27:43] leash they're able to check in with you [27:45] they're able to be attentive you can [27:47] then have that person close into the [27:49] middle part of that Target they can come [27:51] in a little bit close okay before we get [27:54] there you need to think about the fact [27:56] remember that my ear is attached to your [27:57] ear sorry yeah um so most people will [28:01] Rush that first part the amount of [28:02] people that struggle with leash walking [28:04] they say like I can't go anywhere then [28:05] you then you can't go anywhere you need [28:08] to learn to get some attention your dog [28:09] needs to have some mindfulness and to [28:11] allow you to reward to get some Focus to [28:14] be able to move forward at all but if [28:16] you see you know your neighbor uh 50 [28:19] feet away or some random stranger with a [28:21] dog 50 ft away and you know your dog is [28:24] going to definitely run and jump on them [28:26] you're going to have to work on some [28:27] station skills first so don't rush that [28:30] first part make sure you're getting a [28:32] solid foundational sit at your side [28:35] solid so that your dog looks like [28:38] they're sitting there on purpose not [28:39] like you know there's a difference you [28:41] know the dog's like sitting on a loose [28:43] leash absolutely not trying to bark not [28:45] trying to pull you're going to hear [28:47] something that we say a lot in all of [28:49] our training is that you want to build [28:51] on success we see that so much and [28:53] that's really a big premise of of the [28:56] Manan method of dog training is building [28:57] on success and so you want to try and [28:59] find a threshold that your dog can do [29:03] and if you have a real friendly dog [29:05] that's you know eager to jump you're you [29:08] know building on success might look like [29:10] standing 50 feet away from somebody with [29:13] your dog on you know sitting beside you [29:16] um it might not be somebody coming and [29:18] petting your dog and saying hello in the [29:20] early stages if your dog cannot hold a [29:23] sit on a loose leash and pay attention [29:25] to you while you're 50 30 20 10 ft way [29:28] there is no way that they are not going [29:30] to jump up on somebody you've got to Ace [29:33] the um foundational steps first before [29:37] bringing in those added distractions so [29:40] that your dog has some skills and some [29:41] understanding of what you're expecting [29:43] of them so that they can actually [29:44] achieve success because if they're not [29:46] clear about your expectation and what [29:48] they should be doing it will be [29:50] impossible for them to do it right yeah [29:51] and I feel bad for the dogs when people [29:53] are like oh oh this he doesn't know like [29:55] he's just oh he's just so happy and [29:56] crazy and can see the owner really [29:58] embarrassed absolutely yeah so make sure [30:00] this is a you know work on this first [30:02] step work on that sit in control first [30:04] before bringing anyone in closer or you [30:06] go closer to [30:08] anyone and this is where really where [30:11] you're going to need to work your butt [30:12] off now it doesn't all need to be [30:14] perfect it's okay if somebody starts to [30:16] get close and your dog makes an error [30:18] but what you do about that error is [30:20] going to make all of the difference [30:22] let's talk first step so you're out for [30:23] a walk with your dog your dog happens to [30:25] see somebody at at a distance you can [30:27] kind of tell they're going to come in to [30:28] want to say hello to your dog what's the [30:30] first thing that you should do well the [30:31] first thing you need to do is get your [30:33] dog's attention before they get locked [30:35] on to that distraction so I might [30:37] interrupt her I might use a bit of food [30:39] hey pup what's this hey hi what's this [30:41] and I might lure her into my side and go [30:44] to a control exercise so I don't think [30:47] I'm going to say this in the video but [30:49] what I did there is rather than just [30:51] take the leash and pull her into [30:53] position because I'm training her I'm [30:55] trying to make you know sitting at my [30:57] side and not jumping on people a really [30:59] positive experience so I chose to keep [31:01] the leash loose I never pulled on her [31:03] neck there the leash was nice and loose [31:05] and I just used some cookies to lure her [31:07] back to my side and we have a lot of [31:09] people who you know don't know about our [31:10] entire training process that say oh my [31:12] gosh I don't want to have to use treats [31:13] all of the time yep we got it we don't [31:16] want you to use it either but if we're [31:18] teaching something from the very [31:20] beginning and we want our dogs to really [31:22] enjoy and be motivated and eager to work [31:24] for us we want to do it in a positive [31:27] way once I train this puppy look at her [31:29] now sitting and looking at me on a loose [31:32] leash she knows that earns her rewards [31:34] now I have the basis of my of my [31:36] exercise now she's learning okay this is [31:38] a really positive thing once I've set [31:40] the tone then I can start to wean off of [31:42] the food and I can slowly and gradually [31:45] take some of these extra AIDS away but [31:47] it's not about um you know I was I was [31:50] very meticulous there about getting her [31:52] attention away from whatever she was [31:53] eating in the ground encouraging her to [31:55] my side being very calm but clear and [31:58] patient showing her what I need her to [32:00] do and again there's no people around [32:01] right now it's just can you sit beside [32:03] me on a loose leash because if we can't [32:05] do this no one else is no one's going to [32:07] be able to come in so we've got to start [32:09] here well and people are going to say [32:10] well I mean look she's she's doing that [32:12] because of the treats yes exactly she's [32:15] never done this before a puppy and we're [32:17] going to work through that you know [32:18] we're going to work on weaning off of [32:19] those trats but right now this is the [32:21] fastest most rewarding way to make this [32:24] happen so that's exactly what we're [32:25] going to do this dog doesn't live with [32:27] us she's not our dog but she's 3 years [32:28] old now and now she she can do this all [32:30] by herself no treats no leash nothing [32:32] she's been working on so she understands [32:34] that when she's sitting at my side yes [32:36] that she needs to remain in that [32:38] position even though there's [32:39] distractions around and this is an [32:41] obedience skill that we drill into them [32:43] and when they're young to help teach [32:44] emotional control so my dog's in the [32:46] control position and as that person [32:48] approaches I'm just going to say hey [32:49] how's it going just hold on wait there [32:51] one second I'm just going to instruct [32:53] them to just sort of okay what are you [32:55] going to say when you're out on your [32:56] walks and someone says oh is that oh I [32:59] just I used to have I used to have a [33:02] cotton I used to have a Toller I used to [33:04] have a oh I I just love dogs can I pet [33:07] them or they maybe they just start [33:09] walking up to you and they're like [33:11] absolutely happens all the time and we [33:12] have lots of dogs and we I've seen it [33:14] happen so uh what are you going to say [33:16] to them it's really important that you [33:18] take control of the situation and if it [33:20] is someone who loves dogs you are going [33:22] to have a trainer helper on board likely [33:25] say like oh just hold on one second I'm [33:27] actually in the process of training them [33:28] and and you know we're working on [33:30] keeping them from jumping up on people [33:31] could you help me for a minute train [33:33] them imagine how excited they're going [33:35] to be about this I've never had somebody [33:37] say no when I've asked that when I've [33:39] been out on the street every time I've [33:42] said hey like I'm actually training him [33:43] to do stuff do you mind helping me for [33:45] two seconds I can give you some treats [33:47] and we they're like oh yeah sure like [33:48] they're always so great about it so [33:50] don't hesitate you know really be an [33:52] advocate advocate for your dog in this [33:54] situation and um so don't you know stop [33:57] people before they get too close and uh [33:59] make them feel like they're helping you [34:00] cuz they are [34:02] yeah stop at a distance good girl okay [34:06] come a little closer yes good girl good [34:09] sit yes and my focus is going to be more [34:11] on the dog and less on the person now if [34:14] I see that she's oops if she's over [34:17] distracted she can't I might end up [34:18] saying this but I'll say it now go and [34:20] lie down f um is you'll notice that I I [34:23] didn't have Ken just walk not that [34:25] that's Ken I don't know who that crazy [34:27] man is [34:28] um I didn't have him just come right in [34:30] I had him come in a little closer and [34:32] then stop because I'm trying to make [34:34] sure that uker is the puppy's name look [34:35] at her how you pused her she's like got [34:37] her eyes closed and she like so [34:39] submissive so cute um but I wanted to [34:41] make sure that even as he got closer [34:43] that I could reward her for being still [34:45] and again what I'm trying to do is have [34:47] her be right more than she's being wrong [34:50] which is why I was rewarding there um [34:52] you know so profusely because I was [34:54] trying to let her know look at when [34:56] people approach and you stay in sit [34:58] really good things happen you get [34:59] cookies you get treats you get to see [35:01] that person but you're going to stay in [35:02] that sit so I'm really helping uh her a [35:05] lot there and of course when she got up [35:06] out of the sit I was not really paying [35:08] attention much to her because I was [35:10] talking to the camera as well but you'll [35:12] see what happens when they do make [35:13] mistakes because they will and we're not [35:15] going to panic we're just going to work [35:16] through [35:19] it lots of [35:21] Ls we break that down frame by frame for [35:23] Kale's timing on not allowing that break [35:25] to happen in super slow motion hold that [35:29] sit I'm just going to ditch the food and [35:32] I'm [35:33] just you're like melting sit good girly [35:37] I'm going to place her back into that [35:38] sitting position and this dog is a very [35:41] friendly dog I me she just can't wait to [35:43] get petted um maybe you have a dog that [35:45] isn't super friendly maybe they're a [35:47] little bit worried you know that that [35:48] this is the kind of thing that we would [35:49] change your training uh specific to you [35:53] um but if you have a dog that is is [35:54] enthusiastic or is terribly [35:56] unpredictable when they're going to to [35:57] jump these are the exact steps that [35:59] you're going to follow um do you know if [36:01] she gets up again because how we paused [36:02] it we they didn't really get to see the [36:05] reaction time so if you could go back [36:06] like 15 seconds that would be great a [36:10] little bit more a little bit [36:12] more there okay so watch how quickly I [36:16] react um to uker getting up Less on the [36:20] person now if I see that she's oops if [36:23] she's overd distracted and she can't [36:25] hold that sit I'm just going to ditch [36:27] the food [36:28] very slowly because I'm talking to [36:29] camera but I would have gone right into [36:31] this placement immed you see I didn't [36:33] let get all the way to the end jum on [36:36] the second she broke the sit I was [36:38] automatically Gathering up my leash and [36:40] getting ready to redirect her into my [36:42] side now normally when I would be [36:44] training a dog I wouldn't also be [36:46] explaining what I was doing to a camera [36:48] um so I my goal is to get her back into [36:52] that sit at my side as quickly as I [36:54] possibly can talk about that leash um [36:56] collection yeah so you can see I have [36:58] the leash gathered up in my right hand [37:00] there um but I have enough leash left [37:03] over oh you can't see my hand touch [37:06] it um that there's still like a a j [37:09] shape in the leash and that is to make [37:12] sure youur feels like she's off leash [37:15] I'm not forcing her to sit there I'm not [37:18] holding the leash tight I am actually [37:20] giving her full opportunity to choose to [37:24] get up again if she wishes to and if she [37:25] does I would just simply push her uh put [37:27] her back um and I would do that as many [37:31] times as it took for her to go oh maybe [37:33] I'm supposed to be sitting here and that [37:35] she holds that sit beside me in which I [37:37] would reward her but I have the leash [37:39] gathered up like that because if I was [37:41] holding only the handle of the leash if [37:43] she was to get up and go and jump on [37:45] someone she would be out the end of that [37:47] six foot leash with in a blink of an eye [37:49] it would be much harder for her to get [37:50] me back so we suggest holding the leash [37:52] in a way that you have good control so [37:54] if they get up you can gather the leash [37:56] and recollect them um within moments of [38:00] them getting up and again that comes [38:02] back to that timing I talked about at [38:03] the top of the show she needs to learn [38:05] the information within one second so I [38:07] need to be super fast in order to teach [38:10] her what she should be doing at the [38:11] opening of this uh clip we talked a [38:13] little bit about why kale used food to [38:15] get uker in this case back in at her [38:18] side um so that uker was in a sit and [38:20] control position for through the [38:21] training phase why didn't you use treats [38:23] on this situation okay good question oh [38:26] thanks I'm full of them [38:28] so initially I used the treats because I [38:30] was beginning the exercise I was setting [38:33] her up to be successful she hadn't [38:35] jumped on anybody she hadn't made any [38:37] errors up to that point so I was using [38:39] the food to encourage her back to my [38:41] side I deliberately did not use treats [38:44] to get her into a sit here because she [38:46] made a mistake she jumped up she needs a [38:50] quote unquote consequence or she needs [38:52] to know that that was a wrong error and [38:55] if she got up and jumped up tried to [38:57] jump on someone and I tried to fix that [39:00] by getting treats out and luring her [39:01] back there are many dogs that would go [39:05] oh every time I get up and try and jump [39:07] on someone mom or dad pulls out more [39:09] treats and they bring me back I should [39:10] try and get up more because I get more [39:12] treats so I need to make sure that I'm [39:15] selective with when I bring the the [39:17] treats of the cookies out if she gets up [39:19] because she's jumping or she's breaking [39:21] position she's doing something that is [39:23] not correct I will use the leash to [39:26] physically put her back into my [39:28] sightings I'm not hurting her I'm just [39:29] following through placing her firmly but [39:31] confidently showing her what I need her [39:33] to do but if she holds position or she's [39:36] doing something correct or I'm helping [39:38] her I'm going to use the rewards for [39:40] that so positive reinforcement needs to [39:43] be given at the correct time so that [39:45] it's clear and negative reinforcement [39:48] needs to be given at the correct time so [39:50] that it's clear what I should be doing [39:51] but I should be doing she's also had [39:53] lots of reinforcement for being handled [39:54] moved around like uh the sit placement [39:57] so [39:58] she's not worried about it she knows [39:59] what it means she knows what to do the [40:01] other thing is that the equipment that [40:03] you're using you're not using a harness [40:05] in the situation and so often I see [40:08] people struggle and struggle and [40:10] struggle it's virtually impossible to [40:11] teach your dog not to jump up if you're [40:13] training on heart it's just not it's [40:14] just not effective enough it's just not [40:16] the you know your timing is better and [40:18] you have better head control especially [40:20] with a dog that's really persistent a [40:21] dog that really insists on driving [40:23] towards that person on getting up out of [40:26] the sit uh using flat Buckle collar it's [40:28] just a flat simple flat Buckle collar [40:30] yeah that's well fit um is the best way [40:33] to uh have a good controler your dog and [40:35] get them back into that sitting position [40:37] really [40:41] quickly there's my papa Ro I'm going to [40:44] yes and reward once again okay come in [40:46] and try again sit yes now if she's able [40:50] to hold the sit as that person gets [40:51] close I can then say all right you can [40:53] pet her good girl oops oopsie so want [40:57] her to maintain that sit even though [41:00] she's being patted so she gets up the [41:02] opportunity to be patted sort of uker [41:05] got up and I put her back uh Ken being a [41:08] dog trainer does this automatically [41:10] without being told uh because he knows [41:12] what to do but if you're working with a [41:13] normal human um you should tell them to [41:16] back up because if your puppy's jumping [41:18] and you're trying to fix them into a sit [41:20] and that person just continues to Pat [41:23] and talk and squeak and squawk at your [41:25] dog it's going to make it very hard for [41:26] your dog to refocus on you so Ken just [41:29] backed up which made my job easier to [41:31] get uker calm into a Sit um but if you [41:34] were working with just the average Joe [41:36] on the street that's where you could say [41:37] to them oh hold on a second just give me [41:39] one second if you could back up I'm [41:41] going to get her sitting again and then [41:42] you can come back in and say hello um [41:44] but don't let people continue to pet [41:46] your dog if they're jumping on them [41:47] because that's you're trying to tell [41:49] them no don't do it and they're saying [41:51] it's okay it's okay that's very mixed [41:53] messages for your dog so have them back [41:55] up get the sit back and and then once [41:57] they're sitting then have that person [41:59] come back in and your dog will start to [42:00] put together ah I get love and affection [42:03] and all these greetings when I'm sitting [42:06] and not when I'm jumping and that will [42:08] help speed up this process for you yeah [42:10] just to get back to the equipment for a [42:11] second some people have mentioned like I [42:13] have a small dog I heard that uh the [42:15] flatb or the collar will collapse or [42:17] trachea and I think that's we had uh Dr [42:20] Paula D one of the veterinarians on the [42:22] channel That talked a little bit about [42:23] how uh incorrect that is yeah but yeah I [42:26] mean it's just internet lore I guess um [42:30] but you know check with your vet if your [42:31] dog does happen to have uh some sort of [42:34] unusual atypical depends how small [42:36] they're if they're like under 10 lb then [42:40] yeah but still they're only under 10 PBS [42:44] so they're not putting a lot of pressure [42:45] on the collar you can we're not remember [42:48] with all of this stuff we're not letting [42:50] any dog whether they're 6 lb or whether [42:52] they're 60 lb we're not letting dogs [42:55] lunge and choke them El at the end of [42:57] the leash um so I think when people [42:59] Envision oh my dog's going to hurt their [43:01] trachea Well yeah if they're lunging and [43:03] and and dragging dragging themselves and [43:06] choking themselves um you know of course [43:09] they are any any dog will do that uh but [43:12] we're not letting that happen we're not [43:13] letting our dogs rehearse that [43:16] yeah n not on the table anymore try [43:19] again yes good girl yes good girl see [43:24] how much KLA is rewarding there while [43:27] while the uh situation is the most [43:30] difficult as I'm petting uker she's [43:32] really pouring on the rewards cuz she [43:34] wants to make that part valuable that [43:36] that the dog is in its sit and uh that [43:39] there's someone petting them CU I also [43:40] could give her permission to go and say [43:42] hello but when I do that I'm going to [43:43] keep my leash handy and I'm going to [43:45] instruct that person just to be calm now [43:47] another issue that we've had with yuker [43:49] is that if she's starting to feel um a [43:52] little bit over excited sometimes she'll [43:54] actually submissively pee and it's even [43:56] wor if people are squeaking and [43:58] squawking and bending over top of her so [44:00] I'll often just encourage people to [44:01] either stand up tall or bend down and [44:04] and sort of keep their body upright and [44:05] then I'll let her go and say hello good [44:07] okay good go say hi okay go say hi hi [44:10] Budd off good girl good did you see that [44:14] did you see that automatic sit that she [44:16] had cuz she'd been rewarded so many [44:18] times uh for being in the sitting [44:19] position that when she got petted that [44:22] she turned to kale almost looking for a [44:24] reward and so what's so interesting [44:26] about this this dog is is not that food [44:27] motivated no um so you know uh she had [44:31] to learn to be excited about Tre that's [44:33] why you see it tug toys sticking out of [44:35] my pocket there because I got [44:37] reinforcements ready if I need to yeah [44:40] yeah yes so good girl yes now you don't [44:44] necessarily have to food reward your dog [44:46] in this moment yes she took the food [44:48] there but she could really care less [44:49] what she really wants is love and [44:51] affection and as long as she's remaining [44:53] in this sit position I'm going to allow [44:56] her to get that that affection but I [44:58] also want to make sure that I have good [44:59] control so I also want to train her uker [45:02] Yay good girl I want the ability to get [45:05] her back uh to me and when I want her to [45:08] but because she's a puppy I'm going to [45:10] train her to do that shall we so that [45:12] was good I I'm going to jump away from [45:13] that for a second I just want to comment [45:15] by lot people are like oh my all my dog [45:17] does is pull you know my dog would do [45:19] this it just pulls um you notice I'm not [45:22] doing any walking in this video I'm not [45:25] letting I'm not letting the pull so I [45:28] think sometimes people don't realize is [45:30] that this exercise that you see in this [45:32] video it will all not only helps jumping [45:35] up but it also will help teach your dog [45:37] not to pull because every time she got [45:39] up out of that sit and pulled on the [45:40] leash I had her sit I had her do [45:43] something so that she sort of learned [45:45] that she kind of had to give me least [45:46] respect on this exercise because she [45:48] never was allowed to pull so sometimes I [45:51] think people are are trying to do like [45:53] University degree skills with your dog [45:55] and you haven't even mastered any [45:57] kindergarten skills yet um you know if [45:59] your dog is pulling towards every single [46:01] person you know stop moving around so [46:04] much until you're ready to do that like [46:06] try and think about things in in little [46:09] um little stages so that you can work on [46:12] I'm hardly moving at all I'm I'm pretty [46:14] stationary in this exercise because I'm [46:16] trying to build value for not pulling on [46:18] the leash not jumping for paying [46:20] attention to me um and I didn't really [46:22] say this but when I was calling uker [46:24] away from Ken a second ago again I [46:27] didn't say her name and like cross my [46:29] fingers and hope that she turned to me I [46:31] said her name and then I lured her with [46:33] food I'm setting her up to be successful [46:36] and then eventually once we get going I [46:38] will test her I'll call her and I won't [46:39] have treats and we'll get to that part [46:41] but so many people just hit the dog with [46:44] the test right away and they wonder why [46:46] is the dog not listening why are they [46:48] pulling why are they not responding to [46:49] their name cuz you haven't taught them [46:51] to do it yet they're not robots you've [46:54] got to teach them before you're putting [46:56] in so many people will just put dogs in [46:58] scenarios where they will fail I I [47:01] wouldn't even know your dog and I would [47:02] say of course they're going to fail of [47:03] course they're going to pull there they [47:04] don't know how to do that so we have to [47:06] remember we've got to train our dogs [47:09] first before we're putting them in these [47:11] scenarios and if you're not sure how do [47:13] you train it that's why you go to dog [47:15] class absolutely because we teach you [47:17] how to do that we teach you how to set [47:18] this up well and you know um two things [47:20] that I wanted to point out number one [47:21] you may have missed a little bit earlier [47:23] in the show but we talked about the [47:25] amount of people that really struggle [47:26] with leash walking that with all kinds [47:28] of things but they can't get their dog [47:29] in a sit at their side if you can't get [47:31] a sit at your side your walk can't begin [47:34] you know if your dog just is just [47:36] blowing you off couldn't care less about [47:38] you know the fact you've got treats [47:39] Rewards or the fact that you're there [47:40] they're just there to drag you down the [47:42] street that's not good walking training [47:44] there's no way to get to a point where [47:46] your dog can be reinforced by something [47:48] because they don't care so all it could [47:51] take is a few you before you leave the [47:52] house you get some rewards and when you [47:54] get on the front step or you get in the [47:55] hallway or you get in the elevator or [47:57] whatever you get some attention and then [47:59] you start to slowly work your way [48:01] towards a test and maybe it's walking [48:03] maybe it's a a stranger coming up to you [48:05] or maybe it's you know whatever the [48:07] thing is but take it step by step I see [48:09] often in comments and things on the [48:12] Channel people say yeah try this with a [48:13] completely crazy dog we never would we [48:16] want to make sure that that dog UN [48:19] number one well we would try this in [48:20] this video with a crazy dog yeah for [48:22] sure like really crazy but it's usually [48:24] with walking videos and it's usually [48:25] yeah good luck you this with something [48:27] dog extra crazy we we wouldn't start the [48:29] walking training until we could get a [48:31] Sit yeah we would do Foundation [48:34] Foundation Foundation that's what we're [48:36] going to build this house on and it it [48:38] is exactly how you need to think about [48:40] your training if you're struggling with [48:41] jumping up counters whatever people [48:44] whatever the thing is what's the [48:45] foundational step it's that green zone [48:47] that we talked about 20 minutes ago you [48:49] know it's that area where the [48:50] distractions far enough away that your [48:52] dog isn't really that interested in it [48:54] and then you can start to build some [48:56] rewards and slow make your way closer to [48:57] that distraction or have that [48:59] distraction move closer to you that's [49:01] going to be really important if you're [49:02] jumping up number [49:07] two number two the amount of value you [49:10] put on that calling back the response to [49:12] name at the end is something I I don't [49:15] see anyone doing ever they don't do it [49:18] ever I don't you know when you see that [49:20] in the real world people don't do it and [49:22] I'm not sure why as a dog trainer I know [49:24] that I want to make that the best part [49:26] for my dog dog especially if you have a [49:28] dog that's super interested in shuming [49:29] up on people so when you call them back [49:32] maybe it's a step away maybe it's [49:34] calling them back from getting petted [49:35] make sure it's worth it to them because [49:38] next time next time you're in that [49:40] situation your dog's probably going to [49:41] think huh I remember how great this was [49:43] when I got back to my owner here you [49:45] know when I got back you know in into uh [49:48] in in close to them in that sit at the [49:50] side really make that part valuable it's [49:52] going to be really important and [49:53] although it doesn't really seem that [49:55] important at the end of that maybe your [49:57] dog did a great job and that's awesome [49:59] but if you're in the training phase [50:01] you're still going to want you're still [50:02] going to want to be rewarding those [50:04] things cuz you want to make them [50:05] valuable um I will say that you know one [50:07] of the things that we that hopefully you [50:10] can take from today's live stream is [50:12] that if you have a be a behavior that is [50:16] unwanted that you don't like one of the [50:18] best ways to correct it to fix it is to [50:21] teach the dog to do something that you [50:23] do like in that scenario and jumping is [50:26] just such a easy way to think about that [50:28] in situations where your dog jumps teach [50:32] them to sit instead I don't care what [50:33] the situation is whether it's greeting [50:36] people at the door on the on the street [50:39] um you know countertops whatever it [50:41] might be teach your dog what to do [50:44] instead and stop the rehearsal of your [50:47] dog doing it wrong if you can do nothing [50:49] else but that two those two things you [50:52] will be headed in the right direction [50:54] stop the rehearsal of the bad behavior [50:56] and get your dog doing something else [50:58] more productive in place of the bad [51:02] behavior so that you can find something [51:04] to reinforce your dog for so that we're [51:06] not just you know frustrated and upset [51:09] with the dog all yeah Kale's talking [51:11] about an incompatible behavior and if [51:13] it's jumping up on people that sit at [51:14] your side is really great we actually [51:16] worked on with this little guy we [51:18] actually worked on a uh go lie down on [51:20] your bed when we were making food like [51:22] when we were cooking dinner when he was [51:23] really little and because he'd be [51:25] interested in like in and stuff so [51:27] instead we put his head in the stove [51:29] yeah yeah so instead we gave him an [51:32] incompatible Behavior we asked him to go [51:34] lie down on a bed and that's that's all [51:36] we just worked on that and if you're at [51:39] home and maybe you're you know you don't [51:40] have somebody around to help you train [51:42] then you're going to pretend to be [51:43] cooking like don't actually you don't [51:45] want to ruin your dinner for one but you [51:46] also don't want to you know put yourself [51:48] in a situation where you can't split [51:49] your attention we we going to pretend to [51:51] get your dinner ready and work on that [51:53] go down go lie down on your bed take [51:55] these moments out of of your day when [51:57] you can um commit to training rather [52:00] than going through the rehearsal so [52:02] walking on leash take the time to train [52:04] your dog to to go for a walk rather than [52:07] just taking them for a walk you're going [52:08] to be surprised at how much it exercises [52:10] their brain and then you can do we have [52:11] all sorts of ideas for things that you [52:13] can do to keep your dog exercise healthy [52:15] fit without going for a 4 kmet or 2.
document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,, Part 425/429,5 [52:19] mile walk uh down the street so you know [52:23] really focus on these these these times [52:25] and and look for these opportunities to [52:26] find an incompatible behavior for that [52:28] thing that you don't like if it's [52:30] jumping on the couch maybe your dog [52:32] maybe your dog gets their own bed in the [52:34] living room maybe there's a little dog [52:36] bed that your dog can go lie down on [52:38] otherwise you can follow a lot of the [52:40] same steps we talked about at the top of [52:42] the show when we talked about the uh [52:43] counters to work on this yeah what's [52:46] really really important if you're having [52:48] trouble with your dog jumping on your [52:49] couch is that uh you're managing it if [52:52] not listen I there are times in your day [52:55] when you're tired and you've had enough [52:57] dog training for the day that's exactly [52:59] when you've had your dog out for a pee [53:01] You' they've had their exercise they're [53:03] fed everything they can go lie down in [53:05] their crate and you can watch your show [53:06] you know separate these these uh [53:08] situations so that you're not [53:10] overwhelmed so that you're not [53:12] frustrated so that your training is good [53:14] when you're investing the time in it so [53:17] um the litmus test for a dog being [53:20] allowed up on the couch in our household [53:22] is when we say off do they get off yeah [53:25] and if they don't like the first time we [53:28] ask and we don't want to have to say it [53:29] in a mean way right or 17 we want to [53:31] just be able to say off and the dog says [53:33] okay absolutely easy peasy yeah so so we [53:36] know that if they are if you know we we [53:38] think they're ready for it you know we [53:40] don't we've worked through our [53:41] leadership things they listen to us well [53:43] we allow them up on the couch we say off [53:45] we expect them to get off if not we go [53:47] back to the training phase maybe we need [53:49] to exercise a little bit more uh you [53:51] know uh there all kinds of strategies to [53:54] to work around building leadership in [53:55] our training but but um I want you to be [53:58] mindful of that I I I see this I see [54:00] this often you know in comments and [54:02] emails and things uh that people are my [54:05] dog won't even get off the couch or like [54:07] you know I've got to drag him off the [54:08] couch well you shouldn't put your dog in [54:10] that situation if you're really [54:12] struggling with that same thing goes [54:13] with countertops same thing goes with [54:16] people now it's been a fun show we're [54:19] going to we might miss the 1240 or the [54:22] sorry the 840 if we don't uh get our [54:24] butts out of the train station here if [54:27] maybe just a reminder too that uh we [54:29] have a bit of a different schedule this [54:31] month okay because we normally we do the [54:33] show every other Thursday um but the [54:37] every other Thursday falls on a week [54:39] where I'm where are you going to be okay [54:42] in the [54:43] Netherlands because myself and my little [54:46] border coli beine are representing Team [54:49] Canada at the agility World [54:51] Championships so um I'll I'll be in [54:54] another country playing dog agility 21 [54:56] time world champion of dog agility I [54:58] don't know if i' mention that ear the [55:00] show yeah I kind of like saying 21 it [55:02] has like [55:03] nice I haven't been able to get another [55:05] another medal in the last couple years [55:07] so I'm I have a I have to work on it but [55:11] anyways it's pretty cool if any you guys [55:12] are interested in um dog agility or you [55:14] are you curious to see what it is uh if [55:16] you check out um Maan dogs agility [55:19] Instagram page um I post a ton of our [55:22] agility Journey uh there if you're [55:24] interested absolutely uh if you're [55:26] looking for more support or help you can [55:27] always join us in our online or [55:29] in-person programs go to Mand do.

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 2/13,~Ken === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:04] scooter [00:05] scooter hey scoot [00:09] scooter scooter come come sco scooter [00:14] come please wait am I supposed to use [00:17] his name or the come command there what [00:20] am I doing wrong I get it we've all been [00:23] there we've all felt like that guy and [00:25] that is exactly why I sat down with [00:26] instructor Meg to get to the bottom of [00:29] what is the big difference between a [00:30] come command and a response name and [00:32] does it actually matter well in this [00:34] video she's going to break down how to [00:36] use that command when to use that [00:38] command and which commands you should [00:39] use so that you don't make things worse [00:41] for you and your dog I'm Dan welcome [00:44] back to M [00:45] [Music] [00:47] dogs so response to name is one of the [00:49] first skills that I teach my young [00:51] puppies when they come home I want to [00:53] make sure that when I call my puppy's [00:55] name they know it's a great thing and [00:57] they are Keen to turn and look at me [00:59] each time I say their name we start out [01:01] even with our online programs and our [01:03] in-house programs by teaching these [01:05] 10-week old puppies that when I say your [01:07] name good things happen you get a treat [01:10] you get attention from me even sometimes [01:12] having some fun and playing with a toy [01:14] one of the issues that we find with a [01:15] lot of students dogs is that they hear [01:17] their name so often all day long that [01:20] they start to tune it out Marley Marley [01:23] No [01:24] Marley you can actually overuse your [01:27] dog's name so we want to be really [01:29] careful that if we call our dog's name [01:31] we are actually looking for attention [01:33] from them and they're going to get [01:35] something from us dogs do what's [01:37] reinforcing so if we call their do their [01:39] name and they receive nothing from us [01:42] after a while their response to name is [01:44] going to go down we don't need to say [01:47] spot sit spot down spot here that's [01:50] overusing the name so if I'm going to [01:52] use my dog's name it means I want you to [01:55] turn and look at me now for me the [01:58] responsive name is also an attention [02:00] getter and recall combination if I call [02:02] my dog's name I immediately want them to [02:05] turn and look at me but it might not [02:06] necessarily mean they do need to come [02:08] towards me I might say their name and [02:10] then ask them to sit or I might say [02:12] their name and ask them to move with me [02:14] in another Direction the response to [02:16] name is an attention getter it is a [02:19] recall unless they hear other direction [02:22] when I first start teaching a response [02:23] to name I take a little bit of my puppy [02:26] breakfast or dinner simply sitting [02:28] somewhere like the kitchen or my living [02:29] room [02:30] I repeat their name followed by a treat [02:32] over and over again spot treat spot [02:35] treat spot treat until eventually my [02:38] puppy thinks their name equals treat [02:40] then when they do start to get a little [02:42] bit more distracted I can call that name [02:45] help them with the food to turn and [02:47] reward them from there eventually that [02:50] puppy learns that even when they're [02:52] distracted when I call their name they [02:54] need to immediately turn and look at me [02:56] because their name equals cookie after [02:59] I've done done a number of training [03:01] sessions where I'm working the name and [03:03] immediately feeding I also work some of [03:06] those restraint recalls but with [03:07] response to name so you may have seen [03:10] this in some of our past videos but this [03:11] is probably one of our favorite puppy [03:13] exercises to do this hallway has trained [03:16] many of puppies with us and uh one of [03:18] our favorite things to do is some little [03:20] re recalls to start teaching her her [03:22] name or even a he her her command so [03:25] I've given H Ken a little handful of her [03:27] breakfast I have a little hand of her [03:30] breakfast as well and we're just going [03:32] to sit on either ends of the hallway and [03:33] we're going to call back and forth tire [03:35] her out a little bit and have a really [03:36] fun way of teaching her about coming to [03:40] us good okay [03:45] PR okay [03:48] ready [03:50] [Music] [03:55] setay good girl you're going to get so [03:58] much faster at this [04:00] good [04:01] girl so when she eats the food I have [04:04] food here I'm just going to hide it away [04:06] aa's going to turn her around Ken's [04:07] going to try and get her attention Ready [04:10] Set Yuki yay what a good girl nice job [04:16] good good job all right okay and then [04:19] we'll turn her around here K we'll turn [04:22] her around we'll do it again ready Yer [04:24] ready ready ready say Yer here here here [04:28] here here oh she's an Old Pro already [04:30] you can really see the dogs pick up the [04:32] pace really get excited about hearing [04:34] their name when you do exercises like [04:36] this this is a this is just such a great [04:38] way to reinforce the value of coming to [04:40] their name good girl it's also really [04:41] important when you do this see how close [04:43] we're feeding her I'm letting her come [04:45] right in okay we're going to go again [04:47] Ready Set [04:51] Yer [04:53] Yay good girl now we didn't make a big [04:55] deal when she didn't respond the first [04:57] time now this is I mean the first time [04:59] we ever done this exercise with her but [05:01] the one thing I would I wouldn't do is [05:03] call her name over and over again uh the [05:06] next time I need to make sure that I [05:07] have a little bit more Focus before I [05:09] call her name and uh when kale releases [05:11] her let's try this again [05:14] ready are Yer yes good girl we can also [05:20] sneak that little puppy sound recall in [05:22] there ahead of time since that's [05:23] something that she's kind of familiar [05:24] with already because her breeder did [05:26] that when they were feeding good girl [05:28] wow Missy moo [05:30] come on [05:33] Ken you [05:36] y girl this can be used for the come [05:39] command and response to name I want my [05:42] puppy to learn that when they hear their [05:44] name they want to race towards me as [05:46] fast as possible that's going to build a [05:49] lot of speed and a lot of excitement for [05:51] each time they hear their name and [05:53] that's what we're trying to do right now [05:54] we're trying to make their response name [05:56] a fun thing not a nag but something they [06:00] generally want to respond to and are [06:01] excited about each time they hear their [06:03] name being called by their owner there's [06:05] a big difference between response to [06:08] name and my C command my C command is [06:11] used very infrequently in my dog's [06:14] everyday life in fact I can't remember [06:16] the last time I said the word come to [06:18] any of my dogs if I say come to my dogs [06:21] that means you must not think about your [06:23] options if you here come you turn on a [06:26] dime and Sprint towards me as fast as [06:28] you can when might I use this if my [06:31] puppy accidentally got out of the front [06:32] door of my house and he started chasing [06:34] a squirrel across the yard towards the [06:36] road I'm going to say come that is my [06:39] emergency command if there's a skunk in [06:41] my backyard and I don't want to chance [06:43] if my dog's going to turn or not I'm not [06:46] going to say one of my more casual [06:47] responses I'm going to be using my come [06:50] command as well in that situation so [06:53] come neede jerk reaction don't think [06:55] about whether you should or you [06:57] shouldn't or if there's better options [06:58] for you when you hear come you're going [07:01] to turn on a dime and run back towards [07:03] me as fast as possible we train the come [07:05] command very differently than many of [07:07] our other commands I don't risk saying [07:10] come to my dogs unless I can guarantee I [07:14] can make it happen when we have baby [07:16] puppies we do a lot of work with having [07:18] a person restrain them while we say come [07:21] and take off running in the opposite [07:22] direction eventually as our dogs gain [07:25] more skills we often attach a longer [07:27] line so that we can ensure that every [07:29] time we call them we can make it happen [07:32] when I'm teaching one of my young dogs [07:34] both of these skills I want to set [07:36] myself up to be successful I don't want [07:38] to chance if my puppy gets to respond or [07:40] not so when I'm training in the house [07:43] they are wearing a house line at all [07:45] times that way I can ensure that if they [07:47] choose not to respond at any time I can [07:50] immediately stop them take control and [07:52] then help them to be successful when I'm [07:54] working outside I have a long line on my [07:57] puppy at all times they don't have the [07:59] option of running around my yard having [08:01] a puppy burn and having fun without me [08:04] all of the fun and training is going to [08:05] involve me and our relationship when I'm [08:08] training both the response to name and a [08:11] come command I want to make sure that I [08:12] have really really fun and valuable [08:14] resources for the dog for many dogs that [08:17] includes some high value treats my [08:19] border colleagues tend to really love [08:21] tug toys so I use the McAn dogs puppy [08:23] tug he goes absolutely wild tugging on [08:26] that when he comes back to me every [08:27] single time just to complicate things a [08:29] little bit further we also have an [08:31] informal recall so in my dog's everyday [08:34] life they hear the command here far more [08:36] than they would ever hear the command [08:38] come say for example my puppy's out in [08:40] the backyard in the morning going to the [08:41] bathroom if I want them to come back in [08:43] towards me I might do a little here here [08:46] very casual when he's a baby puppy and [08:48] he's first come home this is very [08:50] similar to a little pup PP pup that [08:52] means I want you to move towards me but [08:53] it's not a life or death situation if [08:56] I'm in the kitchen and my puppy H [08:57] happens to move in towards the living [08:59] room to see what another family member [09:01] is doing again I might use a little here [09:03] here I reward them still I still make it [09:05] lots of of fun I make it engaging to [09:07] move towards me but it's not the same [09:10] urgency that I would use the come [09:12] command for I also have an extra command [09:14] that I use with my very small dog right [09:16] now to teach him to come in nice and [09:19] close to me and that actually is the [09:20] command close not everyone uses this [09:23] command but I find it really helpful [09:25] with my little 7B papon because when I [09:27] want him to come in close I take can [09:29] take that food lure it and nice and [09:31] close to my body he gets fed while he's [09:33] actually touching my leg and then I can [09:35] reach in and take the [09:36] collar so my criteria for this close [09:39] command is that he needs to be so close [09:42] that the back of my hand is touching my [09:44] leg good boy and his nose is attached to [09:46] my hand to get that treat if he's any [09:48] further away from that then that's not [09:50] close enough for me for our recall [09:52] training in classes we often teach this [09:54] with a sit in front so often after the [09:56] dog has worked a response to name or [09:59] command we teach them to come in nice [10:01] and close into a sit so that we can [10:04] reward them they don't learn to get the [10:06] treat and then take off running again we [10:08] can even reach down and take their [10:10] collar or attach a leash if the dog's [10:12] been given a little bit more freedom and [10:14] been allowed to move without the leash [10:15] on well there you have it now that you [10:17] understand the why it's important to [10:19] understand the how and how to train [10:21] these skills properly to do that check [10:23] out one of those two videos right there [10:24] and on that note I'm Dan

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 2/199,~Ken === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] listen nobody said that puppy training [00:02] was going to be easy in fact it's kind [00:04] of stressful and daunting at times if [00:05] you don't know what you're doing and [00:07] that's exactly why I sat down with [00:08] instructor Steve today to talk about the [00:10] ins and- outs of puppy training from his [00:11] experience so you don't have to be [00:13] stressed and you can get back to having [00:14] fun with your puppy I'm Dan welcome back [00:17] to McAn [00:19] [Music] [00:21] dogs how many dogs have you trained like [00:23] your own personal dogs how many dogs [00:24] have you [00:25] owned two [00:28] three uh [00:31] [Music] [00:34] nine and very different dogs all very [00:38] different dogs my biggest thing for the [00:40] training is all about relationship it's [00:42] all about that dog and I learning to [00:43] work together and it's all about having [00:45] that dog want to work with me um I want [00:49] them to come out going okay what are we [00:51] doing it's you and me not hey there you [00:53] are I'm going to go do my own thing over [00:55] here that's the biggest thing that that [00:57] when I can start to get that like the [00:59] moment that puppy comes home I want that [01:01] puppy to think I'm the greatest thing [01:02] ever like I I literally want them to go [01:04] wow this person gives me good [01:06] information they reward me for doing all [01:07] these things we have so much fun you [01:09] know it's really more about building [01:11] that relationship in in those early [01:12] stages and you know having had different [01:15] types of dogs certainly gives me [01:17] knowledge to lean on um that said I [01:20] never go into my next dog now thinking [01:23] about what the other dogs knew I you [01:25] really have to you have to wipe that [01:26] clean you have to take all that [01:28] information and go yeah I'm going to [01:29] file it I'm going to keep keeping in my [01:30] brain but this is this dog and I need to [01:32] train this dog the dog that's in front [01:34] of me is the one that needs the [01:35] information whatever that information is [01:37] we're still figuring it out but I need [01:38] to train this dog I I mean it could be [01:41] the same breed could be the same litter [01:42] and you could have completely different [01:44] personalities completely different work [01:45] ethics completely different um ways to [01:47] interact completely different confidence [01:49] levels I mean that's how it really comes [01:51] down to the dog itself um just like [01:53] people right you know like you know [01:55] you've got kids I got a kid they're very [01:57] different personalities and they maybe [01:59] learn different L they take things in [02:01] differently and I need to be aware of [02:02] that to help each of them achieve what [02:04] they can well I think the hard thing is [02:06] people want hard and fast answers how [02:08] much do I need to do something and [02:10] there's really no answer that we can [02:12] give you for that because your life is [02:14] your life my life is my life somebody [02:16] else's life is their life so you know [02:18] the answer that I would give to somebody [02:19] like that is really as much as you can [02:22] as much as you can as much time as you [02:24] can spend interacting with that dog um [02:27] and the interaction is the key it's not [02:28] just letting the dog be around around [02:30] you teach it what to do you know I sort [02:33] of think of training in a couple of [02:36] pieces one is kind of like the formal [02:38] training where I'm training an exercise [02:40] I'm going to teach a thing I'm going to [02:41] teach the dog to respond to its name I'm [02:43] going to teach the dog to sit or [02:44] whatever else it happens to be but any [02:47] other time that puppies out it's sort of [02:49] more informal training but there's still [02:50] training going on there's still you know [02:53] uh I'm paying attention to what they're [02:54] doing and then thinking okay should I [02:55] let that dog go over and sniff the shoes [02:59] or chew in the shoes shoes or what could [03:01] I do in that moment to teach the dog to [03:02] do something else instead so really the [03:06] answer is as much time as you can and if [03:08] you sort of think of it that way it [03:09] becomes a lot less daunting cuz we think [03:12] about I have to spend all this time [03:14] doing all these things and trust me [03:15] puppies are puppies are not easy puppies [03:18] are you know require a lot of work but [03:20] the thing that I want to have people [03:22] remember is puppies are learning all the [03:23] time whether it's from us or whether [03:25] it's from other things cuz when it comes [03:28] down to it they're pretty darn simple [03:29] creatures they do what's rewarding to [03:31] them and um I want to make sure that all [03:35] that reward and all those good things [03:36] all the good information comes from the [03:37] people comes from the owners comes from [03:38] them and in my opinion it sort of [03:41] becomes less of this big giant thing and [03:44] it more becomes okay yeah this is what [03:46] we're doing this we're we're just going [03:47] to do stuff with the puppy it's going to [03:49] depend on what you see from the puppy [03:51] and that's you know that's again where [03:53] where animal training in general is [03:55] different than math or some sort of [03:57] science because it's going to be what [03:58] the puppy's showing you so [04:00] for example most puppies are happy gol [04:02] lucky they love people which is so [04:04] fantastic and people love puppies um but [04:06] if I see a puppy that's jumping up quite [04:09] a bit um the first thing I would think [04:11] is okay do I want that behavior to [04:13] continue okay and if I think H it's kind [04:17] of okay but the top puppy's kind of over [04:19] the top then maybe I might focus on [04:21] teaching that dog to sit while people [04:23] are nearby by so I'm going to look at [04:25] the puppy the puppy's actually going to [04:26] tell me what they need right um you know [04:29] if if you see those things and you can [04:31] start to sort of make a mental note and [04:32] go ah you know what that's happened a [04:34] couple of times you know they've barked [04:35] at that thing a couple of times or you [04:37] know they were worried about that [04:38] particular person who came in or they [04:40] were over excited when that other person [04:41] came in the more you can kind of make [04:43] notes on that in your brain and go okay [04:45] that's something I maybe don't want to [04:46] have happen some more or maybe it's [04:48] something I do want to have happen some [04:49] more maybe I have a puppy who's [04:50] generally worried but all of a sudden [04:51] gets really confident with some person [04:53] you know you're going to then take that [04:55] and go okay I need to build up that [04:57] puppy's confidence so maybe I let that [04:59] puppy be a little B more excited but if [05:00] I have a puppy that generally is way [05:02] over the top then I have to think okay [05:03] maybe I need to teach some more manners [05:05] and a little bit more calm mindedness so [05:07] the dog really tells us what to do where [05:10] I have a big problem and where I get [05:12] really [05:13] uncomfortable is when people tell me [05:15] these things they tell me that my dog's [05:17] ere excited they jump they bark they do [05:18] all these things and they don't do [05:20] anything about it to prevent it they [05:21] don't teach the dog what to do and then [05:23] they get mad at the puppy for doing it [05:24] over and over and over again like that's [05:25] not fair it's not fair to put a dog into [05:28] that situation because because [05:30] invariably they're reinforcing some of [05:31] those things at some points but then [05:33] those times when it's inconvenient for [05:35] them then they get mad at the puppy and [05:36] that's when I really have a big problem [05:38] with the information that we give I want [05:39] the information to be fair and clear so [05:41] the pup's going to tell me what they [05:42] need and then I need to be consistent [05:43] about it yeah you know that's a that's a [05:46] question we get all the time and and you [05:47] know one of the things that's important [05:49] to to note is that the steps that we [05:51] take those next next steps need to be [05:53] small they need to be very small because [05:55] we want to add things in little teeny [05:56] bits to continue to help that dog to be [05:58] successful so I'll give you an example [06:00] of when I might think my puppy's ready [06:02] for something so let's say I'm teaching [06:04] my dog how to respond to their name and [06:05] we spend all this time simply building [06:07] value for their name and then we show [06:09] them how to respond to their name and [06:11] then you know I let the puppy get a [06:12] little distracted and I call that [06:14] puppy's name and it turns around like a [06:16] shot and we have a great party um then I [06:18] can start to go okay this puppy's [06:20] understanding it in this moment in this [06:22] particular situation with these [06:23] particular distractions so I might [06:25] change one little thing so the next step [06:28] isn't necessarily taking that from from [06:30] my living room or my kitchen and going [06:32] to the schoolyard where it's chaos and [06:34] you know when everything's going on [06:35] that's way too big of a step I might [06:37] change one little thing so I might [06:39] change that distraction in front I might [06:41] put like a stuffed toy out or I might [06:43] put a little tupperware container with [06:45] some food and I'm going to add these [06:46] little distractions really slowly not so [06:49] that the dog learns to be wrong but so [06:50] that they learn to be right in the face [06:51] of all those new distractions so when [06:54] are they ready for the next step well [06:55] when I'm getting excellent responses [06:57] when I'm getting like 90% I take that [07:00] next step and then I may have to realize [07:02] too well that didn't go well I put the [07:04] new thing in there and the dog didn't [07:06] get it right and that's you know one of [07:08] the other key things is when I see my [07:09] dog make a couple of mistakes my [07:11] personal rule is my dog makes two [07:13] mistakes I have to make it easier I have [07:15] to help the dog to be right and then I [07:17] have to then push through that by taking [07:19] smaller steps again you know somebody [07:20] said this to me years ago um you know if [07:23] you put that working right now and you [07:24] spend all this time teaching the dog how [07:26] to live in our world in your world in [07:28] your house um you're going to have an [07:29] amazing dog for 12 15 years um don't put [07:35] in the work and you're going to have a [07:37] dog for 12 15 years that might be very [07:40] different in terms of that relationships [07:42] the work is all know so the dog is [07:44] learning to um find Value away from you [07:48] now that's like this weird dog train [07:50] like what the heck does that mean well [07:52] it's learning that you don't really [07:54] matter and there's more fun things to do [07:56] um again can some dogs eat easily [07:59] transition into that type of Lifestyle [08:01] yes but again where I find it's a [08:04] biggest struggle is then people come to [08:05] me and they say my dog is still peeing [08:08] in the house or my dog is chewing on the [08:10] thing my dog is stealing things um those [08:16] are not a result of a puppy being bad or [08:18] being malicious puppies don't think that [08:20] way but they have the opportunity to do [08:23] behaviors that are satisfying to them [08:25] the act of doing them um uh rewards them [08:29] and I think well you can't be mad at [08:31] that puppy for that cuz you're letting [08:33] it happen you're letting them have that [08:35] opportunity so the the idea of too much [08:38] Freedom tends to create situations where [08:40] puppies make choices that puppies will [08:43] make but where it's a problem is when [08:45] people get mad at them for doing that [08:46] right and then I need to say the first [08:48] thing when anytime I I have a student or [08:51] person I'm working one-on-one with and [08:52] says my dog does this and I don't like [08:54] it the first thing the first answer I'm [08:55] going to give them is you have to stop [08:56] that thing from happening literally you [08:58] just have to stop it okay and people [09:00] sort of go well what do you mean well [09:02] you either need to have eyes on them you [09:03] need to prevent them from being in that [09:05] particular situation but if we prevent [09:08] it sometimes and then sometimes not then [09:11] that puppy is literally thinking for [09:13] that that time where they can get that [09:15] reward they're thinking that it's like [09:16] the old slot machine right you sit at [09:17] slot machines waiting for that jackpot [09:19] to hit you keep pulling the lever [09:20] pulling the lever well if that puppy's [09:22] won that jackpot once twice three times [09:24] that's setting you back so far so the [09:26] first thing we got to do is stop that [09:27] behavior and generally that comes from [09:29] taking away some [09:30] freedoms that's a tough thing for people [09:33] to get their head around that's the [09:34] hardest thing for people to get their [09:36] head around and you know what I want [09:38] people to realize is that like this [09:40] isn't forever this isn't like your [09:43] puppy's going to be locked in their [09:44] crate for life my puppies my dogs get to [09:47] do like they have life amazing in my [09:49] house right um but that comes once they [09:51] know the rules and that once they know [09:53] how to act and how to live in our [09:54] environment so I don't necessarily mean [09:56] working with them directly but I will [09:59] absolutely have eyes on them I [10:01] absolutely will know what they're doing [10:03] and what they're into I mean you know [10:06] kids in the house you put a puppy and [10:07] kids in the house and things are quiet [10:09] something really bad is happening like [10:11] there's no way around that so I always [10:13] know where the puppy is uh that puppy [10:15] always has a leash or a line on so that [10:18] I'm not in a situation where I'm saying [10:20] oh gosh the puppy chewed the thing I [10:22] just don't want that to happen so I [10:24] never want them to rehearse that kind of [10:25] thing and that's where our management is [10:27] really a lot more fluid in my than [10:30] people might think know things like my [10:31] crate um if I need to run downstairs to [10:34] change the laundry and just puppy goes [10:36] in the crate for 2 minutes 90 seconds [10:38] whatever it is and then I'm never mad at [10:41] the dog for doing dog things it just [10:43] never happens the opportunity is never [10:45] there for those dogs so um I literally [10:48] mean I have eyes on them okay now that [10:51] changes as they get a little older as [10:52] they get a little older a little bit [10:53] more reliable um and my dogs know how to [10:56] exist in the house then yeah they get [10:57] more freedom and I might go um you know [11:00] around the corner and come back and that [11:01] puppy's fine I might go downstairs and [11:03] come back up you know they get more [11:05] freedom provided they get they uh make [11:07] better choices but it's up to me to show [11:09] them what those choices should be yeah [11:10] oh yeah I mean you know gating off an [11:12] area in the house you know my puppies [11:14] aren't locked in their crate I want to [11:15] qualify that they're in there when [11:17] they're needing to settle and go to [11:18] sleep when I got to do other things but [11:20] yeah I've gated I gate off a section of [11:22] my house there's usually a pen uh in my [11:24] kitchen or someplace close by so I have [11:27] various levels of sort of management [11:29] um you know but taking away things like [11:32] you know the opportunity to go [11:33] downstairs and disappear into the [11:36] basement you know getting into all the [11:37] things that's the first thing I need to [11:39] do is sort of section off the house give [11:40] them a bit of an area um not only for my [11:43] house but for that puppy's safety [11:44] there's so many things in your house [11:46] that are dangerous for puppies I don't [11:48] want them to get into um so I need to [11:50] make sure that's a um that's that's [11:53] taken care of and it be does doesn't [11:54] become an issue it's also less stressful [11:56] for me like I'm just not worried about [11:58] it like because it never happens host [11:59] lines and long lines um best tools for [12:02] dog training ever because I always want [12:04] to make sure my dog can't ever hear [12:06] something and go n not interested so I [12:10] in the house uh all puppies drag a house [12:12] line to prevent them from doing things [12:13] now that's not a leash it's not [12:14] something I hold on to and holding tight [12:16] all the time it's just more of an [12:18] emergency break but couple that with me [12:20] seeing what they're doing all the time [12:22] let's say my puppy does try and take off [12:23] to steal a sock I can just do a little [12:26] hay step on that line I just stop those [12:28] things from happening stopping those bad [12:29] behaviors um but I also want to make [12:32] sure that my puppies do have some [12:33] Freedom out in the yard like they're not [12:35] bound to the 3ot circle around me so [12:38] having a 15 or 20ft long line um gives [12:41] the puppies more freedom again it's [12:42] tends to be just dragged behind them I'm [12:44] right out there with them but again if [12:46] that puppy decides oh I might dig in the [12:48] yard here I can pick up that line I can [12:50] interrupt that digging and give them [12:52] something else to do what I don't want [12:54] to do again is let that puppy have free [12:57] rain and then be mad when it's dug for [12:59] the last 6 months cuz it was Winter and [13:01] who cares but now it's springtime and [13:03] you want your flowers to come up you [13:05] know those tools allow me to use my [13:07] voice to back up my voice very calmly [13:09] very fairly and teach the puppy what to [13:11] do instead without that you end up [13:14] running after a puppy which is game on [13:16] every single time now again that's for [13:18] now like my old dogs they get to hang [13:21] out in the yard they get to you know [13:22] watch the world go by absolutely but [13:24] when you have young puppies you know the [13:26] same roles that I take in the inside the [13:28] house are applied outside of the house [13:30] consistency happens everywhere that [13:32] puppy is and that is where one of the [13:35] mistakes happen is people think okay I [13:37] train the dog in the house but outside [13:38] it can do whatever and then they're mad [13:40] at it for doing things and then they're [13:41] also mad at it when it doesn't respond [13:43] to its name outside like it did inside [13:44] well you only trained it to respond to [13:47] its Dame inside and now you're mad at it [13:49] from blowing you off outside that's your [13:50] fault that's on you that's not on the [13:52] puppy when they're in the crate house L [13:54] comes off I I my habit is I clip it on [13:56] the door of the crate so it's right [13:57] there ready to go um no they don't have [13:59] it on when they're in the in their crate [14:01] um in the in a pen No I again I'm [14:05] supervising them I'm keeping an eye on [14:06] them so they don't have a leasher rign [14:07] on at that point because again I can [14:08] quickly interrupt things but the moment [14:10] they have a little bit more freedom that [14:11] is always on them I want to make sure I [14:13] can interrupt anything before it becomes [14:14] an issue because again puppies learn [14:16] quickly they're learning all the time [14:18] and one opportunity for them to hear [14:20] your voice and you having to chase them [14:22] to do something that's a huge reward for [14:25] puppies when you watch dogs interact the [14:27] dog that's generally being chased is the [14:29] one who's in charge it's running the [14:31] show it's you know it's decking and [14:33] diving and doing all those things it's [14:34] having the best time the ones that are [14:35] running after it they're the ones that [14:36] are little bit further down the line [14:38] right now so I want to make sure that my [14:39] puppy never gets in that position I just [14:41] want to stop things from happening real [14:43] quick it's not emotional and never have [14:45] to worry about it well I want to make [14:46] sure that that first things first all [14:48] their needs are met they've got food [14:50] they've got water they've gone to the [14:51] bathroom um beyond that though it is [14:54] about um getting some of that energy out [14:56] puppies don't just chill out generally [14:59] and the puppies that I have now because [15:00] of the agility I do I want busy puppies [15:02] I want them high I want them working all [15:04] the time um so I will make sure I do [15:07] things that engage their brain it's not [15:09] just Mindless throw a toy and hope they [15:11] can do it it's throw a toy have them [15:13] back tug and play ask for the toy back [15:15] ask them to sit have them hold that sit [15:17] while I have that toy in front of them [15:19] reward them with the toy so I do all of [15:21] the things again that's sort of more the [15:23] informal type of training that I talked [15:24] about so we're doing things but it's not [15:27] this this this this this and this it is [15:29] all about me though and it is all about [15:31] paying attention to me so before I put [15:32] them in I make sure that again they've [15:34] got all their needs met whether it be [15:36] food water bathroom but we've had a play [15:38] they've had a chance to uh expend some [15:40] energy uh I've brought their brain into [15:43] it so again it's not mindless stuff [15:45] teaching them to sit and hold a position [15:47] having puppies sit still is such a [15:50] challenge puppies don't come that way [15:52] they don't so teaching them to hold a [15:54] still position a stable position whether [15:56] it be sit or down or whatever while [15:57] things are going on around them that [15:59] really engages their brain and that [16:01] tires puppies out more than anything [16:04] else and I'll build on that as they get [16:05] older when they you know when we're [16:07] working on sort of more formal training [16:08] I do lots of stays lots of stationary [16:10] stuff lots of things that require them [16:12] to use emotional control and that way [16:15] when I put them back in the crate they [16:16] they just go to sleep they're they're [16:18] happy everything's looked after well [16:20] when it comes to toys there's a couple [16:21] of hard fast rules in my house and soft [16:24] toys are not things that are out for my [16:26] dog stuffy stuffies things with [16:28] squeakers in them all that kind of stuff [16:30] you know again I learned this years ago [16:32] I would buy these great stuffed toys and [16:34] my dogs would just shred them and I'm [16:35] like wow that was fun and then I have to [16:37] go buy another one so that was the first [16:39] mistake that I made but then I also [16:41] learned more about how interactions work [16:44] um with me and the toy so you know now [16:47] in my house I have gosh I have a [16:49] ridiculous amount of toys and you know [16:50] lots of Arman dog's toys which are my [16:52] go-to for most things cuz I've learned [16:55] that the toy and I are supposed to be [16:58] the thing not just the toy itself so um [17:01] my young puppies don't have free access [17:02] to those toys they're kept in a closet [17:04] um but when I go to that closet and open [17:07] the door I have puppies there ready to [17:09] go because they know that it's going to [17:12] be fun it's going to be about me and the [17:14] dog interacting together so whether it [17:17] be a food that I a toy that I can put [17:19] some food in for some of those more food [17:20] motivated dogs or you know a long puppy [17:22] tug just to let that puppy Chase it and [17:24] have a tug and play um you know all [17:27] those toys are the things that that I [17:29] spend time working with my dog with I [17:31] never just sort of say see you later [17:33] here's a toy cuz again I don't want my [17:34] dog to learn that when there's a toy [17:36] there they can just leave me and go and [17:38] do whatever I want it to be about me and [17:40] that puppy and it's about like it's [17:42] about fun it's about let's this is when [17:44] we get to kick up our heels when your [17:45] puppy can learn to really get excited [17:47] with you and the toy and then we can [17:49] start to throw in some of the brain [17:51] stuff where I say okay give me that toy [17:52] now and you sit for a second and that [17:54] puppy then learns its brain to shut [17:55] itself down now we're into some really [17:58] cool stuff where we can really start to [17:59] have that puppy um um understand how to [18:03] get excited when you ask them to but [18:05] more importantly how to be calm when you [18:06] ask them too and it's all in Play It's [18:08] All About play yeah so you know things [18:10] that um um I would give my dogs that I [18:12] feel comfortable giving them uh Now new [18:15] puppies I still supervise them until I [18:18] get a feel for what type of chewer are [18:21] they are they a very heavy chewer are [18:23] they a lighter chewer um but you're [18:24] right when you walk into a pet store [18:25] there's like aisle upon aisle upon aisle [18:27] of things first things first I want [18:29] something that they can't rip apart bite [18:31] in half and possibly ingest and create [18:33] any issues that's that's the first thing [18:34] now trial and error has told us that [18:36] things like um you know Nyla bones uh [18:39] you know various sizes depending on your [18:41] puppy bigger than you would ever think [18:44] to buy bigger is always better when it [18:46] comes to chew toys uh those are great my [18:48] dogs do well on things like antlers now [18:50] um antlers and nyab Bones themselves are [18:53] a bit of a caveat because each dog is an [18:56] individual and dogs have chipped teeth [18:58] and broken teeth with all of these [19:00] things so you have to pick something [19:01] that's good for your dog that's why that [19:03] supervision is so important but things [19:05] like Kongs I use Kongs constantly um now [19:08] that doesn't mean my house is a [19:10] free-for-all with all these bones out [19:11] there uh I still want these young dogs [19:14] to know that these are my toys and I [19:16] will give them to you you get to play [19:17] with them and I get to take them away so [19:19] you know we establish a little bit of [19:21] leadership we establish the fact that [19:23] that I can take them and give them and [19:25] the puppy learns that all these good [19:26] things come from me um things like Kongs [19:29] I would put in their crates stuffed with [19:30] some frozen deliciousness for them to [19:32] chew from time to time uh that's sort of [19:34] a daily thing for me with young baby [19:36] puppies and then from there I use bones [19:38] to teach my puppies to settle you know [19:41] um you talk about crate time and freedom [19:43] I want my puppies to learn that when [19:44] we're watching TV we watching Netflix [19:46] dog's job is to hang out and be that [19:48] super super calm dog so I will get a [19:51] bone I'll put a bed out I'll have that [19:53] that house line on and I'll have teach [19:55] that puppy that their job is just to [19:56] hang out on the bed so they get a bone [19:58] but they learn they only get the bone of [19:59] the bed you don't get free run of the [20:00] house and this is what we do when we're [20:02] watching TV or whatever dog training [20:05] makes you self-aware if you're not [20:08] self-aware you're not going to be a good [20:10] dog trainer and that's like a big thing [20:14] that's like a I know that's a statement [20:15] where people like no I don't [20:17] need dog's behavior is a reflection of [20:20] the information that we give them good [20:21] or bad and the more you can realize the [20:25] things that um you're telling the dog [20:28] and the things you you're either [20:29] rewarding or not the quicker the dog [20:31] will learn so um things like I now [20:35] videotape all of my training every s [20:38] especially for some of the stuff I'm [20:39] doing right now because I need to be [20:40] very specific about it and I literally [20:41] will go go back and go okay frame by [20:43] frame what's the dog doing but frame by [20:45] frame what am I doing that's telling the [20:47] dog do something and how can I change [20:49] that so it's really about being [20:50] self-aware and understanding that dogs [20:52] don't do things out of spite dogs aren't [20:54] stubborn they don't get up and decide [20:56] I'm not going to respond to that when my [20:58] person calls me today cuz I don't like [21:00] they don't work that way okay we need to [21:02] talk about we need to think about the [21:03] information that we're giving them and [21:04] change that information be ready for the [21:06] work it's not M there's no Magic Bullets [21:09] there's not you know eight weeks from [21:10] now you're going to have a perfectly [21:11] trained dog it's work and you can make [21:13] it fun or you can make it arduous but [21:17] the more you realize that there is fun [21:19] in dog training and when the wheels come [21:21] off cuz they're going [21:23] to you just keep trying you know there's [21:26] there's a there's a trust the process I [21:28] think I said that to you earlier when I [21:29] walked in here because the things I'm [21:30] training right now there's a there's a [21:32] trust the process that needs to happen [21:34] and it takes time and consistency and if [21:37] you can do that your dogs can learn [21:38] anything but most of all have fun with [21:41] the dog that's the big thing have fun [21:43] with the dog and enjoy the dog cuz they [21:44] need to they need to be fun or else [21:46] why'd you get it it's important to have [21:48] fun in your training to be able to do [21:50] that you have to have a plan to build [21:52] the perfect plan for your puppy check [21:53] out that video right there and on that [21:55] note I'm Dan happy training

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 13/199,~Ken #leashwalkingtraining #mccanndogs === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] if you're trying to go for walks with [00:01] your dog and the second you walk out the [00:02] front door they lose complete focus and [00:04] it's like you don't even exist anymore [00:06] well this video is for you because what [00:08] you do next in those moments are the [00:10] most important and in this video [00:11] instructor Meg is going to work with her [00:13] poppy pre to show you how to find [00:14] success in your failures so that you can [00:16] move forward in your training I'm Dan [00:19] welcome back to Maan [00:21] [Music] [00:23] dogs many of our students are very keen [00:26] to take their dogs on a nice long [00:28] enjoyable walk but let's face it that [00:31] beautiful picturesque walk isn't [00:33] actually that easy when you have a young [00:35] puppy that is easily distracted by [00:37] everything in their environment it's [00:39] okay to fail sometimes it's okay to take [00:41] your dog to a new place and have things [00:43] not go perfectly that's how we evaluate [00:46] where we are in our dog training what [00:48] matters though is what you do with that [00:49] information so right from the get-go I'm [00:52] going to bring him [00:53] out and I've got his leash attached and [00:56] I'm going to build some Focus right here [00:58] at my vehicle I'm not going to start [01:00] walking and allow him to rehearse [01:02] pulling me wherever he feels like going [01:04] yes good boy rewarding him for giving me [01:08] some Focus I'm then going to work on a [01:10] skill that's familiar for him getting in [01:12] at my side yes good babes good job and I [01:16] might even do that several times search [01:19] good [01:20] job waiting for him to [01:23] refocus Lots going on out here a person [01:25] walking by he's a very very social [01:29] little man [01:30] yes good boy excellent ready pop so I'm [01:34] pausing for a second he's checking out [01:37] his surroundings which is totally fine [01:39] but then yes I want him to acknowledge [01:42] me again so anytime again I get eye [01:44] contact or movement towards me or any [01:47] engagement I'm going to [01:49] reward helping him into my side again so [01:52] that I can have him in a control [01:54] position something that he is really [01:55] really good at and really familiar at [01:58] yes well done [02:00] car starting up beside [02:02] him well done he doesn't care about [02:05] vehicles too much he's not too [02:07] distracted but I am still going to [02:08] reward him and reinforce him as the car [02:10] starts and even as it walks by yes for [02:13] him the harder distraction is [02:15] environmental Birds smells [02:19] squirrels yes good man but I don't want [02:22] him to be worried about Vehicles he's [02:24] very young dog so as it goes by yes I'm [02:26] just GNA keep rewarding him for sitting [02:29] at my side if he gets up no big deal I'm [02:31] just going to gently place him back [02:34] sit there he got up from the sit so it's [02:36] not a big deal but I'm not going to let [02:38] him choose what he gets to do and just [02:40] wander around so I simply placed him [02:42] back into a Sit waited for him to hold [02:44] that sit for a minute and then broke it [02:45] off when I wanted to so when I got him [02:48] up from that sit that was on my terms I [02:50] said okay I let him know that he was [02:52] allowed to move on and here again I'm [02:56] just waiting for that engagement and [02:59] this might be too much for him I might [03:01] have brought him into an environment [03:03] that was just too distracting it would [03:05] be like going outside of your house and [03:07] having you know multiple people walking [03:09] by the front of your house or multiple [03:11] cars or maybe squirrels going by and if [03:13] that's the case get closer to the house [03:14] or go into the backyard go somewhere [03:16] where it's easier for them close close [03:19] yes very good close yes good job [03:24] press good job and I think he actually [03:27] does care more about the smells than me [03:29] right now so I'm just going to make it a [03:30] little easier for him I'm going to lure [03:32] him into my side yes good boy and work [03:35] some more sits here seeing again if [03:37] he'll offer yes some attention good boy [03:42] excellent there are multiple ways to get [03:44] your dog's attention you can ask for [03:46] their attention calling their name [03:48] saying look at me something that cues [03:51] the dog to look up at you the other type [03:53] of attention that we work very hard at [03:55] is something that we call voluntary [03:57] attention the dog chooses to randomly [04:00] look at you this can start when your [04:02] puppy comes home at 8 weeks old every [04:05] time your little ball of fur is sitting [04:08] in front of you or standing in front of [04:09] you and chooses to look at you and [04:11] engage reinforce that tell them yes [04:14] reward them for that it doesn't even [04:16] need to be on a command at first it's [04:19] all about them making the choice to [04:21] check in with you and each time they do [04:23] that we let them know that was the right [04:26] choice we do this over and over and over [04:29] again so that your dog learns they want [04:32] to check in it's not rewarding for them [04:34] to tune you out start sniffing the [04:36] ground watching the birds fly by every [04:39] single time they make the decision to [04:41] look back at you good things happen now [04:44] in order for this to work though you [04:46] need to make sure that you have [04:47] reinforcements that your dog finds [04:49] valuable for some dogs it might be a [04:52] treat some dogs will work for their [04:53] meals for their kibble other dogs need [04:55] something a little bit more valuable no [04:58] matter what you need to make sure that [05:00] you are letting them know first with [05:02] your voice then with body language and [05:05] reinforcement that eye contact and them [05:08] choosing to engage with you is a good [05:10] thing I also know that for him I have to [05:13] keep things short and sweet if I push [05:15] him and make the training session too [05:16] long he's going to get full with his [05:18] tiny little stomach and he might [05:21] actually just start to tune out because [05:22] it's been too much for him too much [05:24] stimulation so I try to keep my training [05:26] sessions under five minutes if I go over [05:29] that I find I lose him sometimes and I [05:31] don't want that I don't want him to [05:33] rehearse not listening to me so I always [05:36] want to make sure I have his Focus [05:39] ideally for the entire duration of the [05:41] training [05:42] session Yay good boy right here he's got [05:47] a lot going on yes I'm getting down to [05:50] his level for a second make things a [05:51] little bit easier another car just [05:52] pulled in very good boy moving away [05:56] again this way yes well done press here [06:01] get good [06:04] job yes very good excellent job good boy [06:11] so I can tell right now he's not ready [06:13] to do his let's go walking in this [06:15] environment that's why all I am working [06:17] on is him choosing to focus and choosing [06:19] him to follow me right now this way yes [06:23] good boy excellent pres is a really [06:25] sensitive dog so I'm actually going to [06:27] put him away for a second he's probably [06:29] been out working for I don't know 5 [06:31] minutes that's his max right now if I [06:33] push him too far too long uh I find that [06:36] he gets a little bit unsure uh he's not [06:38] as motivated I have two border colleages [06:40] I could probably walk them for an hour [06:42] and they would stay focused on me the [06:43] entire time pres just doesn't have that [06:46] right now so we're going to put them [06:47] away and bring them out in a little bit [06:48] later when things are fresh again good [06:50] boy good job my goal today was to try to [06:53] make it further than the parking lot but [06:55] pre showed me very quickly he wasn't [06:57] ready for that so sometimes you need to [07:00] take a break reflect on the training [07:01] session and then try it again which I [07:03] might do with him today I might even [07:05] leave him for today and try again [07:07] another day what I'm looking for for my [07:10] dog in order to progress in difficulty [07:12] is fabulous attention really good [07:14] working attitude looking like he wants [07:16] to work with me um really good food [07:19] drive so if your dog is choosing not to [07:21] take the treats or choosing not to take [07:23] your reward there's a good chance that [07:25] they're over-faced it is too stimulating [07:27] or too difficult for them when we allow [07:29] our dog to rehearse things like that [07:31] what they rehearse becomes what they [07:33] know so if I was to allow pre to tune [07:36] out start sniffing the grass barking at [07:38] squirrels pulling on his leash and allow [07:41] him to do that repeatedly that becomes [07:43] his Norm that becomes something that he [07:45] thinks is allowed to happen because I [07:47] haven't told him otherwise so while you [07:50] might be excited to take your young [07:51] puppy to lots of different places maybe [07:53] reconsider where you take them and what [07:55] you ask them to do when you go there [07:58] have a plan in place and if the puppy is [08:00] not doing any of the skills that you are [08:02] looking for it might be time to turn [08:04] around put them back in the car and take [08:06] them home now instructor Meg might have [08:08] been working on Focus here but really [08:09] what she was working on was her [08:11] leadership skills and to make sure [08:12] you're being a good leader for your dog [08:14] you're going to want to check out that [08:15] video right there and on that note I'm [08:17] Dan happy Trading

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 20/199,~Ken #leashwalkingtraining === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] it's not uncommon to struggle with loose [00:01] leash walking training and actually it's [00:03] pretty common to make a bunch of excuses [00:05] for why your dog's walking so poorly so [00:07] in this video we break down the 10 most [00:09] common excuses you're making that's [00:11] holding you back from your dog walking [00:12] nicely on a loose leash I'm Dan welcome [00:15] back to Maan [00:18] dogs breed Tendencies absolutely play [00:21] into how dogs interact with the world [00:24] than what we can expect them to do but [00:26] they're not a limiting factor and that's [00:28] something that I really try and get [00:29] across to my students people say yeah my [00:31] dog will never do that cuz they're ex [00:33] breed or they'll never do this cuz [00:34] they're not supposed to do that that's [00:36] saying it's not worth training any [00:38] behavior is worth training but like [00:40] anything else I need to spend time [00:41] teaching them how to do it first yeah I [00:44] wouldn't expect that a dog who's never [00:46] been taught how to walk let's say it's a [00:47] beagle whose nose is to the ground all [00:49] the time uh can all of a sudden ignore [00:51] those smells and give you continued [00:53] perfect Focus I wouldn't expect that [00:54] right off the about at all but I also [00:56] wouldn't let that be a limiting factor I [00:58] could use those breed Tendencies as a [00:59] bit of a reward if my dog gives me some [01:01] great walking I could say okay now [01:03] you're allowed to go sniff for a little [01:04] bit okay buddy now you need to come back [01:05] and work with me using the breed [01:07] Tendencies to help uh help you gain [01:09] success is a really good thing but [01:11] please don't let them be a limiting [01:12] factor and say that you can't do [01:13] anything because your dog can probably [01:15] no surprise to you that our young dogs [01:17] have very short attention spans and it's [01:19] going to be a much easier situation for [01:21] you if you're able to rehearse what you [01:23] want the dog to do what happens when we [01:26] get out of that attention span Zone and [01:28] we spend too much time on one skill or [01:30] out for a long walk is our dogs start to [01:33] lose focus and we lose that opportunity [01:35] for optimal learning so your best in the [01:37] early stages of training to keep your [01:39] training sessions nice and short and [01:41] that includes attempts to go out for [01:42] walks practice your Loos lead walking [01:45] skills around your front yard and your [01:47] backyard and inside the house if you [01:48] need to and then take very short [01:50] durations when your pup or your young [01:52] dog is fresh I actually spend a lot of [01:55] time when I've got a young dog in the [01:56] house just walking back and forth on the [01:59] sidewalk in front of my house and then [02:01] as I see that my dog is getting better [02:02] at better and better at being able to [02:04] stick with me I might extend that a [02:07] couple of doors down to the neighbors [02:08] Etc but my goal is always to keep those [02:11] training sessions nice and short so that [02:13] I have my dog's full attention during [02:15] the session and then I can end while [02:16] we're still getting wins there is a [02:19] million different items that come up on [02:21] my social media feeds every single day [02:23] oh this new magic thing does this or oh [02:26] look at this one does this but it also [02:27] has Sparkles there are lots of great [02:29] things that that can help your dogs but [02:31] the things that are going to help you [02:32] the most are going to be the basics your [02:34] leash your collar and you those are the [02:38] things that you need beyond that we need [02:40] our motivators we absolutely do but stay [02:42] away from the quick fixes what it's [02:44] going to take is some consistency from [02:45] you and some relationship building with [02:47] you and your dog when we follow our dogs [02:50] it gives our dog the wrong message it [02:52] tells the dog that Yep they're in charge [02:54] pull on the leash the person follows go [02:57] and lay down on the grass the person [02:59] will stop and wait for you uh pull the [03:01] person over towards a car the person [03:03] will follow we want to make sure that [03:05] we're choosing the direction of the [03:06] walks the pace and the stops it can't [03:09] mean that we stop and have some fun with [03:11] our dog as well you we can stop at the [03:13] park and say okay go Sniff and the dog [03:15] can sniff around but when I call my [03:17] dog's name and say let's go I expect [03:19] them to get back on course with me dogs [03:21] are pretty Dynamic creatures and their [03:23] value and motivation changes with the [03:25] world around them you know in your house [03:27] it might be that their dog food is the [03:29] best treat in the world to them but when [03:30] you go outside you might find that [03:33] that's not very valuable it's not [03:34] powerful enough for them and then you [03:36] might find something that's a little bit [03:37] more powerful maybe you picked a [03:38] commercial treat that's quite uh quite [03:40] interesting to your dog but over time [03:42] like anything else their interest in [03:44] their motivation in those particular [03:45] treats changes one of the things that [03:47] you need to do is be able to change and [03:49] adapt quickly good dog trainers know [03:51] when to change things to help their dogs [03:52] to be right over and over and over so [03:55] getting yourself stuck with one treat [03:57] and your dog says me I'm not interested [03:59] is not to be the beyond the end on and [04:00] if you find that Magic Treat don't think [04:02] that's the only one be ready to change [04:04] gears maybe Len the value for easier [04:06] things maybe bring up the value for a [04:08] different treat for busier places be [04:10] flexible because it's not just one treat [04:12] think about all the distractions on a [04:14] walk and if I have a young dog I want to [04:18] pattern the behaviors I want in a very [04:20] positive fashion so I don't end up with [04:23] problems so I want to set them up for [04:24] success and if I take my young dog out [04:27] for a walk they're going to be pulling [04:29] on the lead leash they're going to be [04:31] totally ignoring me they're going to be [04:33] grabbing things in their mouth uh all [04:36] things I don't want my head is going to [04:37] explode I'm going to get frustrated with [04:39] my dog and that's not going to build a [04:41] great relationship with my young puppy [04:45] so I'm going to teach my puppy in a very [04:48] quiet little spot with a ton of treats [04:50] or toy or just my voice if you're not [04:52] into Treats but I'm going to set my [04:54] puppy up that walking at my side is [04:57] really fun for short little durations [04:59] with no distraction so they say I love [05:02] walking with you and then I'm slowly [05:04] going to build to little more [05:06] distraction little more distraction in a [05:08] little longer and in the meantime I'm [05:10] going to wear my puppy out not through [05:12] walks cuz a walk's really not going to [05:14] cut it and a lot of people get caught in [05:16] the Trap I need to exercise them longer [05:19] um to Tire them out but they get in [05:20] better shape and pretty soon I need to [05:22] quit my job so that I can walk my [05:24] puppies so they're tired I'm going to [05:26] play some little training games I'm [05:28] going to interact with them to Tire them [05:29] out I'm going to teach them how to walk [05:31] so that once they're a little bit older [05:33] we can go for a stress-free enjoyable [05:35] walk it's a given that our brand new [05:37] baby puppies are not going to be ready [05:39] for life out there in the real world but [05:41] I have a puppy who just turned nine [05:42] weeks old yesterday and I've already [05:44] been working hard teaching basic skills [05:47] inside the house with limited [05:49] distractions working on things like [05:51] luring the puppy into different [05:52] positions working on building value for [05:55] my side making sure that at some point [05:57] down the road when my puppy does start [05:59] going for walks they have really [06:01] wellestablished value for being at my [06:03] side all of these little skills and [06:05] games and tricks that you can use to [06:07] teach your puppy early on are going to [06:09] serve you so well as your puppy [06:11] continues to age and become an adult so [06:14] don't wait to get started with your [06:15] training I started the very day my puppy [06:18] came home just teaching him how to [06:20] follow food so that I could then [06:21] progress that to the next step of [06:23] teaching them how to follow food at my [06:25] side how to follow food into different [06:27] positions Etc get started right away you [06:29] won't regret people often put harnesses [06:31] on the dog as a Band-Aid solution to [06:33] prevent the pulling and gagging and [06:35] hacking that goes with a young dog who [06:37] doesn't know how to walk just because [06:39] they put a harness on doesn't mean the [06:41] dog knows how to walk all it does is [06:42] actually Band-Aid the solution and [06:44] prevent that choking one of the hard [06:46] Parts about harnesses too is if I need [06:48] to redirect my dog turn them away from [06:50] something that they might be interested [06:51] in I'm trying to turn them from their [06:53] sent to their body what I want to do is [06:55] think about turning them from their head [06:56] so I can very easily with as little [06:58] Force as possible say hey here's what I [06:59] want you to do instead harnesses were [07:02] designed to help dogs pull and a good [07:05] harness for pulling should fit snug over [07:07] their chest but it's not something [07:08] that's going to be used to teach your [07:09] dog to walk it's a term I hear a lot and [07:12] it's one I used to say but more jokingly [07:14] I love Jack Russell I've had a couple of [07:16] them they're strong willed but strong [07:19] willed is actually a good characteristic [07:21] where stubborn isn't dogs are no [07:24] different than people uh we all do [07:26] what's rewarding uh you know how many [07:28] times have you you said I'm going to [07:30] start to eat healthier and then somebody [07:31] brings donuts and it's like H I'm going [07:34] to have that dut I'll go to the gym [07:36] every day well I'm going to start that [07:38] tomorrow we all do what's rewarding and [07:41] our dogs are no different so those [07:43] stubborn dogs are just doing what's [07:45] rewarding to them so getting mad at my [07:47] dog cuz he's stubborn or he's bad no I [07:51] just need to show him that there's value [07:53] in doing what I want and how I'm [07:56] pleasing me so that we can have [07:58] enjoyable maybe I'm going to get some [08:00] treats maybe I need to go to a lower [08:02] distraction environment maybe I need to [08:05] use my voice more maybe I need to reset [08:07] my expectations that my walk is just [08:09] making it out the front door of my house [08:12] on a loose leash and then we get into a [08:14] little game of play or he can chase me [08:17] so that walking with me is wonderful [08:19] instead of classifying him as stubborn [08:22] and getting mad it's a no win situation [08:24] changing dog behavior takes time and [08:26] consistency there's no magic bullet [08:28] there's no magic thing that's going to [08:29] immediately fix your dog's behavior in [08:32] any situations what is going to change [08:34] it over time is consistency of [08:36] expectation so I know what I want my dog [08:38] to do consistency of follow through and [08:40] teaching so I'm going to show them how [08:41] to do it and then I'm going to expect [08:43] that they do it and then consistency of [08:45] rewarding as we sort of work through [08:47] proofing this so I understand that [08:50] people think they've tried everything [08:51] and I would agree that they have but I [08:52] want you to try harder for longer and [08:54] give your dog a chance to learn a [08:56] behavior that is our biggest goal [08:58] there's no magic fix in dog training now [09:00] that you know the 10 excuses you're [09:01] making it's important to understand how [09:03] to teach your dog to walk on a loose [09:05] leash and to do that you're going to [09:06] want to check out

reverse one I'm going we're going [00:14] that quickly tonight CU I want I want to [00:16] get right down to it so I've got a bunch [00:19] of clips from a video I want to we we [00:21] need to break them down for you I know [00:23] there are uh lots of questions and [00:25] comments that come up uh surrounding [00:27] different aspects of leash walking and I [00:29] think what's really important is that [00:30] you understand um you know not only like [00:35] the methodology for for the mchan method [00:38] but like understand the mistakes that [00:39] are so common that people make that are [00:42] just setting you back you know we don't [00:43] want you to struggle with something that [00:45] you don't have to struggle with if you [00:47] just think about it a little differently [00:49] so let's give you this I'm going to give [00:51] you one of these and I'm going to get [00:53] the other one now remember we're [00:55] attached at the ear I'll remember don't [00:56] worry far I'll

talk [01:07] a little bit about a common mistake that [01:09] people make and let's break it down [01:11] readed Tendencies absolutely play into [01:13] how dogs interact with the world and [01:15] what we can expect them to do but [01:17] they're not a limiting factor and that's [01:19] something that I really try and get [01:20] across to my students people say yeah my [01:23] dog will never do that because they're X [01:24] breed or they never do this because [01:26] they're not supposed to do that that's [01:28] saying it's not worth training any [01:30] behavior is worth training but like [01:31] anything else I need to spend time [01:33] teaching them how to do it first yeah I [01:36] wouldn't expect that a dog who's never [01:37] been taught how to walk let's say it's a [01:39] beagle whose nose is to the ground all [01:40] the time uh can all of a sudden ignore [01:43] those smells and give you continued [01:44] perfect Focus I wouldn't expect that [01:46] right off the B at all but I also [01:48] wouldn't let that be a limiting factor I [01:49] could use those breed Tendencies as a [01:51] bit of a reward if my dog gives me some [01:52] great walking I could say okay now [01:54] you're allowed to go sniff for a little [01:55] bit okay buddy now you need to come back [01:57] and work with me using the breed [01:58] Tendencies to help uh help you gain [02:01] success is a really good thing but [02:02] please don't let them be a limiting [02:03] factor and say that you can't do [02:04] anything because your dog can okay this [02:07] is an important one and I I think one of [02:10] the things that really Rings true for me [02:12] is when I was uh teaching a lot of life [02:13] skills one I would see in a night I [02:16] would teach you know two classes back [02:17] toback life skills one classes and we I [02:20] would see let's say pick any breed let's [02:22] say a Jack Russell Terrier come in and [02:25] the first Jack Russell Terrier uh you [02:27] know was the same age as the second one [02:30] uh the first Jack Russell Terrier had a [02:32] Handler or an owner who was thinking [02:34] like there's no way I'll ever get his [02:36] nose off the ground this is a Jack [02:37] Russell Terrier I'm you know I'm in [02:39] trouble I I'll never really have a nice [02:41] walk with him the second Jack Russell [02:44] Terrier owner thought you know what I [02:46] can probably use this use this to my [02:47] advantage or I'm going to commit myself [02:49] to teaching this puppy this young dog [02:51] how to walk I'm not going to um consider [02:54] the excuse that because of the breed he [02:57] can't do this he or she can't do this [02:59] and I will tell you each and every time [03:01] the person who made the commitment to [03:04] helping the dog to be successful and and [03:06] not allowing themselves to make excuses [03:08] was successful this is really important [03:11] yeah yeah I'm always so happy when [03:14] people come in and they have a problem [03:15] and like say the dog is um you know a [03:18] sight hound or a hunting dog and they [03:20] maybe are a little bit more prone to [03:21] sniffing than some of the other breeds [03:23] or whatever it might be and that person [03:25] is like oh he really loves to do this [03:27] but like how do I stop it like how do I [03:29] get him to focus and I think perfect [03:32] your expectations are in the right [03:33] direction now we can get away with the [03:35] training but when we have people are [03:36] like oh well he's just a husky obviously [03:39] he's just going to pull right um you [03:41] know it just people I think sometimes I [03:43] don't know if they want to use it as an [03:44] excuse or maybe they just truly don't [03:46] understand that every dog every breed is [03:49] a little bit different and like Ken said [03:51] sometimes within the same breed you can [03:54] have two dogs literally from the same [03:56] litter brother and sister that can have [03:58] such different temperaments different [04:00] mindsets and you have to do one thing [04:01] with one dog and a different thing with [04:03] another dog and that's part of dog [04:05] training that's one of my favorite parts [04:07] of dog training is figuring out how to [04:09] unlock what I need to from that dog and [04:12] I said at the top of the show it's all [04:13] about finding the right motivator so if [04:15] you have a dog that likes to sniffer um [04:18] we have quite a few breeds but one of [04:19] the breeds that we have is a border [04:21] collie and they love to Chase and they [04:23] love to do things they were bred to do [04:25] and so I utilize that natural tendency [04:28] of chasing to teach him how to do a [04:31] recall to teach him to play and settle [04:33] to look at me when I ask I use Chase as [04:36] a reward from him but guess who he's [04:37] chasing me rather than the car rather [04:40] than the other thing so I take what's [04:42] natural for my dog and I spin it towards [04:45] how to train and that's you know [04:47] something that we do in our training we [04:48] help you learn how to unlock those [04:50] things with your dogs you might your dog [04:52] might have Tendencies or motivations and [04:54] drives that you you didn't even realize [04:56] were there until we are able to unlock [04:59] them yeah and I know some people will [05:01] mention things like oh my dog just wants [05:02] to sniff the ground like he just that [05:04] that is his ultim sniff walk right and [05:07] that is his ultimate reward and um you [05:10] know there might be some truth to that [05:12] that your dog does really want to sniff [05:15] the ground more than pay attention to [05:16] you but maybe you can use that to your [05:18] advantage you know we published a video [05:20] a while ago that talked about how it's [05:21] so important to separate those two [05:24] things now it's unreasonable to think [05:25] that your dog's going to walk in at your [05:27] left hand side for a 3 km or a 2 mile [05:30] walk um so it's important that when you [05:33] are teaching this leash walking when [05:35] you're in asking for that perfect [05:37] position and at your side which is [05:38] really important and must be [05:41] communicated clearly that uh you can [05:44] break it off you know you can walk with [05:46] beautiful attention and when you get [05:47] this nice stretch of leash walking where [05:49] you're like oh boy this is exactly what [05:51] I want you can release your dog with an [05:54] okay go sniff or okay go play or [05:56] whatever the thing is as long as you're [05:59] getting I Precision is a you know I mean [06:01] it sounds so uh specific which is I mean [06:04] the word but you know if you're getting [06:06] the perfect result then maybe that's [06:08] your opportunity to break it off and let [06:10] your dog go for a sniff I really like [06:12] that tactic of training because we know [06:14] especially when we're starting a new [06:16] skill with a inexperienced dog less is [06:18] always more trying to keep things really [06:20] short and sweet and sometimes you [06:22] actually can get uh better better [06:24] Behavior better performance from the dog [06:26] if you don't say okay we're going to go [06:28] out and you're going to pay attention to [06:29] me for this whole 45 minute walk um [06:32] sometimes this is not not achievable but [06:33] if you can work for like 10 15 seconds [06:36] at a time before you know it and the dog [06:38] starts to get the game that 10 15 [06:40] seconds turns into several minutes um as [06:43] long as it you know you're consistent [06:44] and you're being patient but that [06:46] actually is a a more enjoyable way for [06:48] dogs to learn because they have a bunch [06:50] of easy wins easy fast wins that makes [06:53] them go huh looking at you and paying [06:55] attention for 10 seconds was really not [06:57] that hard and then I got paid off and [06:59] you know and all kinds of fun things and [07:00] then that so they sort of go maybe I'll [07:02] try doing that again versus you know [07:04] bashing your head against one another [07:06] the whole time you know begging for [07:07] their attention so that's a really [07:09] really good training tactic not just for [07:11] walking but actually so many so many [07:13] exercises with dog training yeah so if [07:16] you're struggling right now with your [07:17] dog and you're saying like oh it's cuz [07:18] he's a gold and he just wants to meet [07:20] people or so because she's a whatever [07:22] breed um it's you make the decision now [07:26] you either make excuses or you make [07:28] changes you can only choose choose one [07:30] and and one of those choices will allow [07:32] you to be successful with your dog okay [07:35] let's go on to clip [07:37] two ready [07:41] yep probably no surprise to you that our [07:44] young dogs have very short attention [07:46] spans and it's going to be a much easier [07:48] situation for you if you're able to [07:50] rehearse what you want the dog to do [07:53] what happens when we get out of that [07:55] attention span Zone and we spend too [07:57] much time on one skill or out for a long [07:59] walk is our dogs start to lose focus and [08:01] we lose that opportunity for optimal [08:03] learning so your best in the early [08:06] stages of training to keep your training [08:07] sessions nice and short and that [08:09] includes attempts to go out for walks [08:11] practice your Loos lead walking skills [08:13] around your front yard and your backyard [08:15] inside the house if you need to and then [08:17] take very short durations when your pup [08:19] or your young dog is fresh I actually [08:22] spend a lot of time when I've got a [08:23] young dog in the house just walking back [08:26] and forth on the sidewalk in front of my [08:28] house and then as I see that my dog is [08:30] getting better at better and better at [08:32] being able to stick with me I might [08:34] extend that a couple of doors down to [08:35] the neighbors Etc but my goal is always [08:38] to keep those training sessions nice and [08:40] short so that I have my dog's full [08:42] attention during the session and then I [08:44] can end while we're still getting wins [08:46] like Shannon read my mind yeah let's [08:49] let's talk about that it's so important [08:50] yeah that was really good um I also want [08:52] to point out I I can I'm trying to put [08:54] my myself into what um our viewers would [08:57] be seeing watching that video especially [08:59] Shannon and walking up and down the [09:00] driveway you know some people will say [09:02] oh my gosh look at all the treats like [09:04] obviously the dog's walking there's [09:05] treats on the nose um or you [09:09] know the dog's not going to do it unless [09:11] the food's there but remember when we're [09:13] teaching our dog to do something new and [09:15] we're trying to build oh my gosh look [09:17] how dirty he is I know from a big I know [09:20] we went for a big walk around the [09:21] property and he went into um the stream [09:24] and he just takes forever to dry you [09:26] look like a dirty dog Mister oh Farm dog [09:29] yeah um anyways a lot of people are [09:32] alarmed by the food they either don't [09:34] want to use the food or they think like [09:35] oh my gosh like I can't go for a walk [09:37] with treats on the dog's nose but we [09:39] want to remember that you have to start [09:40] somewhere and what we don't want to do [09:42] is start with a lot of uh correction and [09:45] negative feedback to the dog what we [09:46] want to try and do is I keep saying this [09:48] over and over again I know but build [09:50] motivation we need to get the dog to say [09:51] I like to walk with you and by keeping [09:53] it short and sweet and keeping the [09:55] reward rate high you're going to start [09:57] to build a really nice Foundation that [09:59] will allow you to move into a phase [10:02] where maybe you reward less frequently [10:03] maybe rather than food being in your [10:05] hand it's in your bait bag rather than [10:07] being your bait bag maybe it's hidden [10:08] behind you so we have little [10:10] progressions that we can take but if you [10:12] can't do that if you can't walk up and [10:14] down your driveway with some food or [10:16] back and forth in front of your house [10:18] with some food and get full engagement [10:20] how can you possibly think that you're [10:21] going to go for a walk around the block [10:23] and have it work well so you've got to [10:24] start where your dog is a total rock [10:27] star at what you're doing and then build [10:30] from there and the way to do that is to [10:33] go in with um high value rewards and [10:36] good control Shannon had a leash on she [10:39] had the leash gathered up she had good [10:40] training equipment she had a controlled [10:42] environment she was engaging her dog [10:44] with her voice you could see how fast [10:46] she was walking there's lots of things [10:47] that she was doing that allowed that [10:49] puppy to do a good job also the puppy [10:52] all of the dogs that those trainers were [10:53] working in the videos did not belong to [10:55] them they were dogs that we borrowed [10:56] that day for the YouTube video no [10:58] relationship ship whatsoever but because [11:00] the methodologies and the motivation is [11:02] there the dogs are like huh this looks [11:04] pretty cool let me follow along and then [11:06] you're able to establish some you know [11:08] some the startings of a skill yeah I [11:10] think to to expand on that a little bit [11:13] you talked about if you can't walk up [11:15] and down your driveway without a little [11:17] bit of attention uh you can't go any [11:18] farther if you can't if your dog can't [11:21] sit beside you in any location with Le a [11:25] loose leash under control yeah and I [11:28] know a lot of people struggle with this [11:29] you know we get a lot of comments like [11:30] well my my dog's way too crazy for that [11:32] you know try this with a try this with [11:34] some you know outrageous uh uh behaved [11:37] um regardless of the breed doesn't even [11:39] matter um I'll tell you that we wouldn't [11:42] you wouldn't start there you must get [11:45] some attention before you even start [11:47] that walk whether that's using food [11:49] whether you've started to teach a sit in [11:51] at your side if it's in your living room [11:53] that's great if you start in there [11:55] that's a wonderful place to start maybe [11:57] it's in your hallway doesn't matter [12:00] someplace you can uh start to be [12:02] successful before you take it outside so [12:04] you're not correcting correcting [12:05] correcting all the time we talk a lot [12:07] about getting your dog wanting to listen [12:10] so that they're motivated to work with [12:12] you and so often uh I think people want [12:14] to skip steps because they're they're [12:16] just thinking about the end product you [12:18] need to build a foundation it's not [12:20] natural for a dog to walk in at a human [12:22] side just not natural for them to do [12:23] that there needs to be some reason why [12:26] they want to be there and in this case [12:28] with your Alle walking you need to [12:30] create a history of history of reward in [12:32] that position so that they all of a [12:33] sudden see it's a little bit more [12:34] valuable can I comment on something that [12:36] somebody said in the chat there's this [12:37] one here conetta she said um you can [12:40] pull it up busy um New York uh City [12:43] street makes it so hard for my easily [12:45] distracted puppy um I totally feel you [12:48] there and it can be difficult to find [12:50] you know a driveway like the country [12:53] where there's nothing going on that's [12:55] not the case in your scenario and I I [12:56] have actually had a similar scenario [12:58] even I don't live in New York City we [13:00] live a little bit more in the country [13:02] but uh I had a border call um in for [13:04] training a little uh a year or so ago [13:07] and um even though we don't live in a [13:09] super busy area she was highly [13:12] distracted by cars and there's enough [13:14] cars that go past our house that trying [13:17] to get her to work just in the driveway [13:18] at first was nearly impossible because [13:21] every time a car would go by she'd [13:22] basically lose her mind so I do [13:24] commiserate with you something that I [13:26] did that I found immensely helpful is I [13:28] would stay in the house a little bit [13:30] longer but rather than just work in the [13:32] house with nothing going on I actually [13:34] kept building the distraction level in [13:37] my house so I just would start in the [13:39] drive not the driveway what's the long [13:41] thing in your house uh the hallway yeah [13:44] start in the hallway connects all the [13:46] rooms yeah long skinny not a lot of [13:49] things to do we would just have nothing [13:51] going on there and then I would work to [13:52] have some of her favorite toys out like [13:54] little landmines and then we would work [13:56] to having treats off to the side and [13:58] then I might let some the other dogs out [14:00] just you know Milling around the house [14:02] and she'd have to work her walking then [14:03] Ken would bounce a tennis ball so we do [14:06] different things that would kind of get [14:07] her distracted and then I could work on [14:09] leave it and redirect her attention so [14:11] we were actually gaining all of those [14:13] skills that we needed in a more [14:15] controlled environment before I went [14:17] outside so um something like that might [14:19] help you take an environment and make it [14:22] more distracting for yourself so that [14:23] it's under control and then work your [14:25] way to being um being outside on the [14:27] busy Street I know that sounds like a [14:29] lot of work but it is a nice way to kind [14:31] of give the dog a bit of a clearer [14:33] expectation of what you're hoping that [14:35] they do Mr Man can you lie down was he [14:37] going for a walk oh [14:39] boy [14:41] that [14:43] um this is interesting because we've [14:45] used something like this in the past [14:47] with some dogs yeah you go ahead and [14:49] yeah so my puppy's doing better now that [14:50] she's found a stick to carry along with [14:52] her and then uh hard shape emji from uh [14:55] tar here tar oh know who was that from [14:58] um [14:59] can't [15:00] see what now oh I see okay yeah this is [15:04] like I mean this is a very specific case [15:07] but we've done something similar I mean [15:08] what you were doing is trying to find [15:11] the little ways you can get a little bit [15:13] more success I mean it's a great it's a [15:16] it's a small thing that you've added to [15:18] your training routine and maybe for your [15:20] dog that's that could also work I mean [15:22] it might change how you reward them a [15:23] little bit but sometimes the littlest [15:25] tweaks can make a big difference and uh [15:28] I know we've done something similar in [15:30] the past to just get a dog uh you know [15:32] following a pace a little bit better um [15:35] it's about what they want it's about [15:36] identifying what motivates them and how [15:39] you're going to get the results that [15:40] you're looking for um so I I love that [15:43] thinking outside the box cuz sometimes [15:45] that's what you've got to do Cana said [15:47] that her dog is a Chinese crested that's [15:49] so cool oh cool very cool okay let's go [15:52] to this clip cute little dogs oh for [15:54] sure we had an instructor with one [15:56] didn't we she still has one should she [15:59] yeah million different items that come [16:02] up on my social media feeds every single [16:04] day oh this new magic thing does this or [16:06] oh look at this one does this but it [16:08] also has Sparkles there are lots of [16:10] great things that that can help your [16:11] dogs but the things that are going to [16:13] help you the most are going to be the [16:15] basics your leash your caller and you [16:19] those are the things that you need [16:20] beyond that we need our motivators we [16:22] absolutely do but stay away from the [16:23] quick fixes what it's going to take is [16:25] some consistency from you and some [16:27] relationship building with you and your [16:29] dog yeah I love this cuz uh I mean we've [16:32] all probably been victim to the uh [16:35] seeing something cool on uh Instagram or [16:37] Tik Tok and be like oh maybe that'll [16:39] solve my problems I'll tell you why this [16:41] really resonates with me because before [16:43] I went to McAn dogs uh almost 20 years [16:46] ago now um I I know I bought I bought [16:51] all the stuff I bought like the collars [16:53] and the leashes and the you know fences [16:55] and the things and the toys and the [16:57] stuff at thinking that somehow one of [17:00] these things would solve my problems and [17:03] what I discovered after just a couple [17:05] weeks of uh of of lessons uh was that [17:08] the most [17:10] powerful thing I needed was uh good [17:14] information [17:15] consistency and like a tool that was [17:18] reasonable and a tool that I could like [17:20] train with train off of uh I know a lot [17:22] of people will consider uh you know [17:24] harnesses and things like that it's not [17:26] a great train or like um prong callers [17:28] PR callers AB usually a go-to dog P [17:31] throw prong collar on it totally totally [17:33] um but yeah and you know I think this [17:36] speaks to we often speak to some tools [17:38] so uh uh Steve mentioned a collar a [17:42] leash and you those three things we also [17:45] I'd include in that something like a [17:46] Gentle Leader because sometimes you're [17:48] just a little outd doed sometimes you [17:50] have a dog that's just a little too [17:51] powerful and what you're looking for is [17:53] the least amount of equipment the least [17:55] amount of thing that you're hopefully [17:57] going to train off of in real [17:59] I think the the main thing that people [18:02] are hoping is that they can have a quick [18:04] fix and that they can just you know use [18:06] one piece of equipment and then they [18:07] could just take their dog for a walk the [18:09] next day and um [18:11] unfortunately um dog dogs just dog [18:14] training doesn't work like that and um [18:17] you know if there is that magic tool it [18:18] might work for you know a couple times [18:20] and then the dog will just go H let me [18:22] just try let me just try my old tricks [18:24] with this thing and see what happens and [18:25] then you're not from there if you're not [18:27] giving the dog good information [18:29] about what they're doing wrong and what [18:30] they're doing right it really doesn't [18:32] matter what tool you use even the tools [18:34] that we recommend if we say use a collar [18:36] in a leash and you put a collar and a [18:38] leash on your dog and you go outside and [18:39] it's an utter disaster it's not the [18:41] callar and the leash's fault it's that [18:43] maybe you don't know how to deliver the [18:45] information or you don't know when to [18:47] reward or you don't know what you're [18:49] looking for you don't know how to hold [18:50] the leash you don't know how to change [18:51] direction there's so many nuances to [18:54] teaching the dog um that you need to [18:56] learn about so that that that piece of [18:58] equipment AIDS you in doing that so that [19:01] eventually when those pieces of [19:02] equipment go away you have a dog that [19:05] listens without a callar without a leash [19:06] with other treats um those are just [19:08] tools to help you get to the the main [19:11] event which is um listening absolutely [19:14] yeah yeah and considering Tools in your [19:16] training they're just tools you know [19:19] it's it's a thing that's going to allow [19:20] you to communicate better with your dog [19:22] and the idea of relationship you know [19:24] building out some relationship with your [19:26] dog and I know that's sort of like a big [19:27] word doesn't it's hard to nail down [19:29] exactly what that means but when we talk [19:31] about leash walking it's things like [19:33] picking the right reward picking the [19:34] right location don't go those over um o [19:37] overwhelming environments picking the [19:39] right uh motivator like it all of this [19:42] stuff that's exactly what I'm talking [19:43] about when we talk about relationship [19:44] good I just want to go back to that [19:46] comment I made about like the training [19:47] the Border col in the hallway yeah what [19:49] we're trying to do here the whole [19:51] building relationship thing is that I'm [19:52] trying to teach my dog that I am as [19:57] valuable or more valuable [19:59] than the thing they naturally want so in [20:01] this bord col's case who naturally is [20:04] bred for years and years and years and [20:05] years to chase things um I needed to [20:08] teach her that I was more valuable than [20:12] a car right and what's Difficult about [20:14] that or maybe it's your dog that wants [20:16] to chase other dogs or squirrels or [20:18] whatever it might be your dog instincts [20:21] tells them to be distracted by those [20:23] things you have you have a lot of work [20:26] to do to build up your value you so that [20:29] you can meet a squirrel or you can you [20:31] know be the same as a car or whatever it [20:33] might be that's why if we take the dog [20:36] away from competing against that [20:38] distraction and we build on repetitions [20:41] of success so the dog has value for [20:43] looking at you then when I got to the [20:44] point where I could go outside and the [20:46] car would go by and I would say uker [20:48] leave it or let's go she would go huh [20:51] 500 times I've looked at her and she's [20:54] rewarded me when I've heard that before [20:56] so that's pretty cool and then now I can [20:58] compete against those distractions [21:00] because I have a dog that actually wants [21:02] to that's what we mean by building a [21:04] relationship we have a dog that says I [21:06] like you I want to listen to you I see [21:09] you as more valuable than those other [21:12] things and once your dog feels that way [21:15] training and conquering challenges [21:17] become much easier and it's not that [21:19] you're not going to have challenges your [21:20] dog's still going to make mistakes [21:21] because they're a dog and not a robot [21:23] but now you get to go towards those [21:26] mistakes and you have better information [21:27] better relationship back on well and you [21:30] know I mean we we create some of these [21:31] problems ourselves also guys that was a [21:33] great sound bite for the future that was [21:36] really lot of links living it's so true [21:38] it's so true but um this we we often put [21:42] ourselves in a situation where we've [21:43] accidentally allowed our dogs our dog [21:46] who loves other dogs to play with other [21:48] dogs too much we've accidentally allowed [21:50] our dog to pull us to a stranger cuz [21:52] they love dogs and they can't wait to [21:54] pet him so you can control some of the [21:56] risk as you're building up your value to [21:58] your dog by not uh by by by by you know [22:02] really limiting the things they find [22:04] rewarding in the world uh maybe it's [22:06] other dogs maybe it's uh uh other people [22:08] on your Walks Like there there will be [22:10] opportunities to uh play with other dogs [22:13] down the road like your dog doesn't need [22:15] a friend today you know they they need [22:18] to understand yeah that's right that's [22:19] absolutely it and and you know they need [22:21] to understand that you're worth [22:23] listening to and um I just feel bad cuz [22:26] I know so many students who come to us [22:28] and like I don't know what to do he [22:30] won't listen to me when there's another [22:31] dog around I can't walk down the street [22:33] cuz as soon as there's a dog four blocks [22:35] down he just wants to go visit them if [22:37] that's if that's the case limit your [22:39] dog's exposure to those other dogs [22:41] reduce the value of those other things [22:43] and really focus on your relationship [22:45] really focus on your value with your dog [22:48] yeah um I noticed a few people in the [22:50] chat are asking about how beine is doing [22:52] which is very very kind thank you for [22:54] asking um I'll uh I'll let you know at [22:57] the end of the once we get through all [22:58] this I'd be happy to give you an update [23:00] on on how she's doing I know you guys [23:01] some of you guys must uh follow us on [23:03] our our agility channel so I see it and [23:06] and I will um I will let you know how [23:08] she's doing um at the end of the stream [23:10] okay into the next one ready yep dogs [23:15] are pretty Dynamic creatures and their [23:17] value and motivation changes with the [23:19] world around them you know in your house [23:21] it might be that their dog food is the [23:23] best treat in the world to them but when [23:24] you go outside you might find that [23:27] that's not very valuable it's not [23:28] powerful enough for them and then you [23:29] might find something that's a little bit [23:30] more powerful maybe you picked a [23:32] commercial treat that's quite uh quite [23:33] interesting to your dog but over time [23:36] like anything else their interest and [23:37] their motivation in those particular [23:39] treats changes one of the things that [23:40] you need to do is be able to change and [23:42] adapt quickly good dog trainers know [23:44] when to change things to help their dogs [23:46] to be right over and over and over so [23:48] getting yourself stuck with one treat [23:50] and your dog says me I'm not interested [23:52] is not going to be the be all on the end [23:54] all and if you find that Magic Treat [23:55] don't think that's the only one be ready [23:57] to change gear maybe lessen the value [23:59] for easier things maybe bring up the [24:01] value for a different treat for busier [24:03] places be flexible because it's not just [24:05] one [24:07] treat okay let's talk about that uh you [24:09] know sometimes uh the best treats in the [24:11] world won't work that is so true yeah I [24:14] think um it is important to um get to [24:17] know your treats get to know your treats [24:19] and what your dog likes and and again [24:21] like I said um we do use a lot of treats [24:24] in our training to initially um show our [24:27] dogs what we want them to do so it they [24:29] sort of start as a bit of a lure and [24:31] then eventually as we go on we start to [24:33] use it more of as a reward so the dog [24:35] actually s do the behavior without the [24:37] aid of food and then it becomes very [24:39] random but in the early stages um you do [24:43] need to know uh you know if you have [24:46] five treats could you rate them for one [24:47] to five I to one would be the highest [24:49] value treat all the way down to the [24:51] lowest value and then one of the tactics [24:53] that we'll use is um match the level of [24:56] treat and how powerful it is to the [24:58] distraction so if I'm at home and I'm [25:00] just working in the house or I'm you [25:02] know around something where there's a [25:04] lot a lot of distraction I can probably [25:06] get away with some of my lower value uh [25:08] rewards um and then if I'm around a lot [25:11] of distractions or maybe I'm working on [25:13] something that I want to really build a [25:14] lot of drive like if I'm teaching [25:16] regardless of where I'm I'm teaching a [25:18]  command or recall or even walking I [25:21] typically will just use my heavy hitter [25:23] treats the treats that my dog really [25:25] likes because I want my dog to be really [25:27] crazy [25:28] about you know engagement and focus [25:30] during those two exercises because I [25:32] know how important they are um you know [25:34] so that when we start to work on the [25:36] comeand my dog automatically goes like [25:37] Oh my gosh this is like this is like the [25:40] cooked chicken exercise like I'm ready [25:42] to go um the other thing too is like [25:44] some dogs not all dogs are really crazy [25:47] motivated by food so um we actually have [25:50] a few videos on how you can make a dog [25:52] more motivated by food but also think [25:54] outside the box that bord I was telling [25:56] you about she liked food but she could [25:59] kind of hit or miss it was very [26:00] difficult to train her around [26:01] distractions with treats when she was [26:03] little um but she loved to play tug with [26:06] me so often some of the things that I [26:08] would do I would use a tug toy as her [26:10] reward and that worked wonderfully to [26:12] get her attention and keep her engage [26:14] with me so you kind of have to think [26:15] outside the box a little bit to figure [26:18] out what the big uh bribe is I know I I [26:20] used um chasing a water hose with our [26:23] little uh Toy Poodle she loves when I [26:26] turn that hose on outside she turn into [26:29] a water demon she's crazy she loves it [26:32] so I would call her and when she would [26:34] get to me I'd shoot the hose into the [26:36] grass and she'd go absolutely that was [26:39] my impression clip that clip that part [26:41] two Studio she would go absolutely crazy [26:43] but woo would she come to me quickly [26:45] because she started to know that that [26:46] was a part of reward obviously I didn't [26:48] carry a hose around with me all the time [26:50] um but you know if we were in the [26:51] backyard or something it was just a fun [26:54] way to switch up my reward so that it [26:55] wasn't just treat treat treat treat [26:57] treat all the time [26:59] yeah and I know um people will say [27:02] things like uh oh you know I just [27:04] struggle won't take food then he just [27:05] isn't interested in me and you know [27:07] we'll talk about uh sometimes we'll [27:09] mention you know if if there's too much [27:11] Temptation you might need to change the [27:12] location in some of your training and [27:14] you might see more success when you go [27:16] in the backyard you said that one before [27:18] yeah oh far too many times okay um [27:21] pretty good you may have heard it before [27:22] um uh so so you know reducing that [27:25] distraction may increase that food value [27:28] you know but it food isn't everything [27:30] and that's i s that's the important [27:31] takeaway here if you're recognizing that [27:33] food isn't working and food normally [27:35] works for your dog either time to raise [27:37] the value raise the uh uh motivator or [27:41] uh reduce the distraction around you [27:43] make things easier for your dog maybe [27:44] it's a shorter walk you maybe it is a [27:46] sit at your side I will tell you that is [27:48] the least valued exercise that can [27:51] totally change your training if you [27:54] teach your dog to sit under control on a [27:56] loose leash in at your side as [27:58] distractions go by leash walking gets [28:01] way easier yeah people don't realize [28:03] that like that sit on a loose leash is [28:06] such a crucial step for leash walking [28:08] because it teaches your dog leash [28:10] respect it teaches them to stay under [28:12] control without pulling on the leash and [28:14] that's the first step that your dog [28:16] needs to understand before you can you [28:18] know go on these long walks and and your [28:20] dog not drag you everywhere absolutely [28:22] yeah it's so important okay let's dive [28:24] into leash walking clip number six [28:31] think about all the distractions on a [28:33] walk and if I have a young dog I want to [28:36] pattern the behaviors I want in a very [28:38] positive fashion so I don't end up with [28:41] problems so I want to set them up for [28:42] success and if I take my young dog out [28:45] for a walk they're going to be pulling [28:47] on the leash they're going to be totally [28:50] ignoring me they're going to be grabbing [28:52] things in their mouth uh all things I [28:54] don't want my head is going to explode [28:56] I'm going to get frustrated with my dog [28:58] and that's not going to build a great [29:00] relationship with my young puppy so I'm [29:03] going to teach my puppy in a very quiet [29:06] little spot with a ton of treats or toy [29:09] or just my voice if you're not into [29:10] Treats but I'm going to set my puppy up [29:13] that walking at my side is really fun [29:15] for short little durations with no [29:17] distraction so they say I love walking [29:20] with you and then I'm slowly going to [29:23] build to little more distraction little [29:25] more distraction and a little longer and [29:27] in the meantime time I'm going to wear [29:29] my puppy out not through walks cuz a [29:31] walk's really not going to cut it and a [29:33] lot of people get caught in the Trap I [29:35] need to exercise them longer um to Tire [29:37] them out but they get in better shape [29:39] and pretty soon I need to quit my job so [29:41] that I can walk my puppies that they're [29:42] tired I'm going to play some little [29:44] training games I'm going to interact [29:47] with them to Tire them out I'm going to [29:48] teach them how to walk so that once [29:50] they're a little bit older we can go for [29:51] a stressfree enjoyable [29:54] walk such a good point yeah so this not [29:57] only only is it I mean this talks a [29:59] little bit about age so let's talk about [30:00] age and you know level of challenge that [30:02] you're introducing to the dog yeah so if [30:04] I have a a young dog that's like under [30:08] you know six six months or so I'm [30:11] honestly not going to be doing a lot of [30:12] taking my dog for a walk at this point [30:15] um like a traditional walk so I wouldn't [30:17] be putting the leash on and like walking [30:19] around the block with with my young [30:21] puppy um because they just really [30:22] haven't had enough training to know how [30:24] to do that well instead I might throw my [30:26] puppy in the car with long line um you [30:29] know head to the park and then play some [30:32] chase games or play some uh restraint [30:35] recalls or different things like that [30:37] I'll have my dog out and about learning [30:39] how to listen but I'm not actively going [30:41] to be working you know testing my my [30:43] leash walking um I would be training it [30:46] teaching my dog how to do it but I [30:47] wouldn't be actually actively walking my [30:50] dog at that age because they need to be [30:52] trained how to do it first I think a lot [30:54] of people don't realize that you [30:55] actually have to train your dog to go [30:57] for a walk before you can go for a walk [31:00] they don't just come knowing how to do [31:02] that and unfortunately then what happens [31:04] is people start taking their puppies for [31:06] these walks and for six months the dog [31:09] is rehearsing dragging them around the [31:10] block and then you come to class and say [31:13] okay I want to start my leash walking [31:14] training and rather than a dog that has [31:16] not had six months rehearsing dragging [31:18] you versus a dog that's already do done [31:20] that it's very different process to fix [31:22] it um can you fix it of course you can [31:24] but it's just a lot harder um now once [31:26] the dog gets a little bit older then of [31:28] course you can start to do more walks uh [31:30] for sure but remember walking your dog [31:32] to me isn't necessarily you know the [31:35] only form of exercise um a lot of dogs [31:40] won't get tired out that way you know [31:41] for me I take my dogs for walks but then [31:43] I also exercise them in addition to that [31:46] whether that be um through fetch or as [31:49] my dog gets older rather than like going [31:51] for a walk around the block we go for [31:53] hikes or we go for what we call prop [31:55] walks and they're doing a lot more [31:57] running and you know up and down Hills [31:59] and like just moving around a little bit [32:01] more and they're way more tired than [32:02] going for a 15 walk around my [32:04] neighborhood um so things you have to [32:06] consider obviously whatever you do has [32:08] to work with your with your lifestyle [32:10] but it also has to be the right thing [32:11] for your dog you know if you get a [32:13] higher energy dog if you have a border [32:15] call dog like this this dude can't go [32:17] for one 15 minute walk around the block [32:19] and be happy and you know be calm in the [32:22] house it's not it's just not their [32:24] nature he needs mind work he needs [32:27] physical work so you also need to make [32:28] sure that you are doing what your dog [32:30] needs in order to be happy and healthy I [32:34] let's let's uh touch on dogs under 16 [32:36] weeks when we're talking about like [32:38] relationship building exercises that's [32:40] that is so much more valuable than any [32:42] walk could ever be for a dog uh of [32:45] around that age as well as the timing [32:47] and and I know some people will say well [32:50] you know my dog's whatever six months [32:51] and I just got them uh think about it [32:54] the same way let's talk about a few [32:56] exercises that we will do to build build [32:58] relationship build value on the human [33:00] yeah there's lots of different things [33:01] that we would do um I like to do like [33:03] lots of follow exercises Chase exercises [33:06] so with the puppy on a leash um or a [33:09] long line I would have you know some [33:10] treats or a toy and I would practice [33:12] calling my puppy by name or even just [33:14] using a a filler thing like here here [33:17] here and then I would run away and when [33:19] my puppy notices that chases after me [33:20] when they catch me I might work some [33:22] control and reward my dogs my dog's [33:24] starting to pay attention and we can [33:26] play a bit of like a shadow game where I [33:28] go one way dog follows me I reward I run [33:30] off in a different direction puppy [33:32] follows me and I reward it teaches the [33:34] puppy how to have a little bit of [33:35] Engagement um we also do like tons and [33:39] tons of trick training when our dogs are [33:40] are young and I personally love trick [33:43] training because I find it really um [33:45] tires my dog up mentally it also teaches [33:48] Dogs how to learn and how to problem [33:51] solve it also allows me to get um a [33:55] deeper understanding of how my dog [33:57] learns and sort of how creative they are [34:00] and um you know whether they get [34:02] frustrated easily like how often do I [34:05] need a reward I learn all of that [34:07] through trick training um it's a great [34:09] relationship Builder but then when I go [34:10] to set out to work on more serious [34:13] things um I have a better idea of what [34:15] that puppy needs that could be different [34:17] than you know another dog that I've [34:19] trained or whatever so trick training is [34:21] a great thing to do of course it's [34:23] adorable and cute but there's uh so much [34:26] value in that type of you know spending [34:29] 15 20 minutes a day just playing around [34:31] with a few things can make such a [34:33] difference in your dog's ability to want [34:35] to listen to you well and and and for [34:36] exercise we will do so many restrained [34:39] recalls in a hallway in the backyard [34:42] dogs dragging a a long line even not [34:44] even with puppies like with adult dogs [34:46] we'll take our puppy tug or if it's a [34:48] older dog we'll take a fuzzy ball tug [34:50] and uh you know I'll hold the dog at one [34:51] end of the hallway or somewhere outside [34:53] and kale will get the dog excited sneak [34:55] away go 20 ft away and then we'll call [34:57] their name here's what's so beautiful [34:59] about the restrained recall uh you're [35:02] building value for you you're working on [35:05] a response to whatever the word is maybe [35:08] it's your recall maybe it's a response [35:09] to name whatever whatever you're using [35:11] so you're building excitement and value [35:12] for that thing you're also having an [35:14] opportunity to to play with a uh an [35:17] interactive toy like a a fuzzy ball tug [35:19] or a puppy tug with your dog but they're [35:22] getting so much exercise like just [35:26] tugging at the end of these restrained [35:28] recalls your puppies young dog's going [35:30] to be exhausted and you're doing so much [35:33] more oh it's just so much better for [35:36] them than going and struggling and you [35:38] getting dragged down the street on a [35:39] walk practicing the wrong things you [35:41] know not having a good time and your [35:43] dogs learning that the world around me [35:44] is way more interesting than that human [35:46] at the end of the leash ever is so uh uh [35:49] important important to know that uh I [35:51] mean I understand you hopefully after [35:53] this if you're struggling you won't be [35:54] going for walks you're you're going to [35:56] be training your walking but um you know [35:58] your puppy still needs exercise your dog [36:00] still needs to burn off some calories so [36:02] a great way to do that is the things [36:03] we've just talked [36:05] about okay next clip [36:11] ready it's a given that our brand new [36:13] baby puppies are not going to be ready [36:15] for life out there in the real world but [36:17] I have a puppy who just turned nine [36:18] weeks old yesterday and I've already [36:20] been working hard teaching basic skills [36:23] inside the house with limited [36:25] distractions working on things like [36:27] luring the puppy into different [36:29] positions working on building value for [36:31] my side making sure that at some point [36:34] down the road when my puppy does start [36:36] going for walks they have really [36:37] wellestablished value for being at my [36:39] side all of these little skills and [36:42] games and tricks that you can use to [36:44] teach your puppy early on are going to [36:46] serve you so well as your puppy [36:48] continues to age and become an adult so [36:50] don't wait to get started with your [36:51] training I started the very day my puppy [36:54] came home just teaching him how to [36:56] follow food so that I could then [36:58] progress that to the next step of [37:00] teaching him how to follow food at my [37:01] side how to follow food into different [37:03] positions Etc get started right away [37:06] yeah that was good so uh Shannon [37:07] mentioned some of the things that we had [37:08] just talked about which is important [37:10] ready for eight yep people often put [37:12] harnesses on the dog as a Band-Aid [37:14] solution to prevent the pulling and [37:16] gagging and hacking that goes with a [37:18] young dog who doesn't know how to walk [37:21] just because they put a harness on [37:22] doesn't mean the dog knows how to walk [37:23] all it does is actually Band-Aid the [37:25] solution and prevent that choking one of [37:27] the hard Parts about harnesses too is if [37:29] I need to redirect my dog turn them away [37:31] from something that they might be [37:33] interested in I'm trying to turn them [37:34] from their Center to their body what I [37:36] want to do is think about turning them [37:37] from their head so I can very easily [37:39] with as little Force as possible say hey [37:41] here's what I want you to do instead [37:43] harnesses were designed to help dogs [37:45] pull and a good harness for pulling [37:47] should fit snug over their chest but [37:49] it's not something that's going to be [37:50] used to teach your dog to [37:53] walk good yeah this is a common people [37:55] say like oh I have to use a harness my [37:57] talk chokes or they cough when uh we go [38:00] for a walk yeah I think a lot of people [38:02] like the harness because it it it does [38:04] make walking easier for the person and [38:06] it takes the pressure off of the dog's [38:08] uh neck that's for sure um but it's so [38:12] easy to pull with a harness on that [38:14] sometimes you know if your ultimate if [38:16] your goal is to take your dog for a walk [38:19] and let them pull you on the harness for [38:21] the whole walk if that is your goal then [38:23] the harness is a great idea if your goal [38:26] though and this is what we would prefer [38:27] your goal to be is to be able to take [38:30] your dog off leash one day and have them [38:32] listen to you uh if your goal is to be [38:34] able to walk them around people and have [38:36] them not drag you um or just take them [38:38] for a walk anywhere and have them not [38:39] drag you if that's your ultimate goal [38:42] then I would say ditch ditch the harness [38:45] immediately for your training purposes [38:47] because um you do need to be able to [38:49] redirect them a little bit more easily [38:51] and um you know if the rehearsal you [38:54] know I see I I'm afraid I would damage [38:55] his neck um yeah yeah I hate him choking [38:58] and gagging so okay this is perfect how [39:01] do you start to redirect this training [39:05] so that that is not happening but then [39:07] you are also teaching the dog to to to [39:09] listen and that goes back to our [39:11] previous um comments about where are you [39:14] practicing and how are you practicing if [39:17] you're putting a callar un leash on and [39:18] you're just letting them choke and gag [39:20] everywhere that is not going to solve [39:22] your problem we need to get the harness [39:24] off we need to get the proper equipment [39:26] on and we need to be putting oursel in a [39:28] in a scenario where we can actually [39:31] teach the dog what they should be doing [39:32] differently I'm not just changing the [39:34] equipment and going for a walk and then [39:36] hoping and letting my dog chag gag and [39:38] choke everywhere that's not fun I get [39:40] why you wouldn't want to do that um but [39:43] you have to roll up your sleeves and do [39:44] a little bit of dog training [39:45] unfortunately it means that you have to [39:47] put a little bit of work in and you need [39:48] to shelf the whole walk thing for a [39:50] little bit um until you're you're able [39:53] to go forward or perhaps consider a [39:55] different training tool like I don't [39:57] know are we going to talk about gentle [39:58] leaders at some point we can and in fact [40:00] uh a couple people in nette mentioned [40:01] Gentle Leader has been a game changer [40:03] for Hazel and me and [40:05] UHA yeah yeah something like a Gentle [40:08] Leader is a is a great option and it's a [40:10] head collar it's a head collar there's [40:12] um it's a very different head collar [40:14] than a lot of the other head collars out [40:15] there it's the one that we feel works [40:17] the best one Loop goes around the dog's [40:19] nose one Loop goes behind the head it [40:22] does not hurt the dog in any way yet it [40:24] is very powerful it uh deals with the [40:27] premise of pressure rather than thee [40:30] premise of pain which is why it can be [40:32] used for young dogs even puppies if you [40:34] want um and it allows you to have sort [40:37] of full control over the dog's head so [40:39] you can turn and um it's just a [40:42] wonderful tool I've used it with many of [40:45] my own dogs um and it's sort of a nice [40:47] stepping Zone to get to the point where [40:49] you know eventually you could wean off [40:51] of The Gentle Leader and just go back to [40:53] the um flat Buckle collar but um a lot [40:56] of people are apprehensive about G [40:57] leader because most dogs hate it when [40:59] you put it on and they have a complete [41:01] meltdown and um Mariah Carey moment [41:03] those are the dogs that need it the most [41:05] yeah and usually they have a meltdown [41:06] not because um it hurts them or anything [41:09] it's because they don't feel like [41:11] they're in control anymore they don't [41:12] feel like they can just do and run over [41:14] here and do whatever they want and they [41:15] say h this sucks all of a sudden you [41:18] have all this control um so we have lots [41:20] of videos on the channel about the use [41:22] of a Gentle Leader actually how to teach [41:23] your dog to like the Gentle Leader um [41:26] and how it can be good for different [41:27] dogs you know we actually used it for [41:29] one of our dogs um her issue wasn't so [41:31] much pulling but it was actually that [41:33] she was a little bit nervous around loud [41:35] noises and things and I didn't want to [41:37] be out on the street you know correcting [41:39] her for pulling or anything like that [41:41] and being really negative with her [41:43] because she was already a very [41:44] soft-minded dog so the Gentle Leader [41:47] allowed me to be able to use less [41:48] correction and reward her a bit more [41:51] build her confidence and um um she's 7 [41:56] years old now and I still use it from [41:57] time to time um when I need to so it's a [42:00] really great thing um darn there was [42:02] something I was just abouted to mention [42:03] oh there are so many there's some really [42:05] good specific questions in here and as I [42:08] look through the chat there are all [42:09] sorts of situations where if we could [42:12] see what your dog is doing where you [42:14] know if you if we could if we could [42:15] build a relationship with you and your [42:16] dog and understand here's here's where [42:18] you're making a mistake and here's what [42:19] your dog really needs and that's exactly [42:21] what we offer in our online training or [42:23] in-person training programs I know that [42:26] uh you know there are all kinds of [42:27] videos out there on the internet about [42:29] dog training but if you're not picking [42:31] the right things for you if you don't [42:32] get a little bit of feedback if you [42:33] don't if you don't uh have the [42:35] opportunity to like work through some of [42:37] the mistakes that you're making you'll [42:39] never be successful um so it's really [42:41] important uh that you know that you do [42:43] have an opportunity to train with us go [42:44] to Mand do.
document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 34/199,com and check out our online [42:47] training programs if you're [42:48] International or you know don't live [42:50] close to Ontario Canada um or our [42:52] inperson training because it's it's hard [42:55] to give advice on some of this stuff [42:56] because I just know exactly you know [42:58] well how how how are you holding your [42:59] hand how fast are you walking you know [43:01] is your leash tight um where in our [43:03] online training or or inperson training [43:05] programs I can know right away that [43:07] there's you know what your problem might [43:08] be totally um I like that Annette said I [43:11] followed your videos and taught instead [43:13] of just slapping it on her which I've [43:14] done in the past that's so great yeah [43:16] you know sometimes that can be a really [43:17] good thing and then somebody else ask [43:19] can I use a g leader with dogs that have [43:20] very short legs um yep totally can the [43:23] only time that the G leader can be a [43:25] little bit hard is if you have dogs with [43:27] really short noses like our Boston [43:29] Terriers or our pugs although sometimes [43:30] they do fit um but other than that um [43:33] they can be fit on any dogs are super [43:35] adjustable yeah we uh uh was a Moira [43:39] said can you recommend a resource for [43:41] trick training I think we have we have a [43:43] bunch of them we have tons of trick [43:45] tutorials on the YouTube channel for [43:46] sure tons uh we also might have they [43:49] might also be in our free training [43:51] library on on the site so uh if you go [43:55] into uh Mand do.
document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 35/199,com and then go into the [43:58] online training side uh I think we've [44:00] got some free resources there for trick [44:02] training which is exactly what you're [44:03] talking about it's like step by step so [44:05] that you can follow along and then uh [44:07] you know train with your pup yeah okay [44:09] going go over here let's see what [44:11] instructor Carol has to say it's a term [44:13] I hear a lot and it's one I used to say [44:15] but more jokingly I love Jack Russell I [44:17] had a couple of them they're strong [44:19] willed but strong will is actually a [44:22] good characteristic where stubborn isn't [44:24] dogs are no different than people uh we [44:27] all do what's rewarding uh you know how [44:30] many times have you said I'm going to [44:32] start to eat healthier and then somebody [44:33] brings Donuts as like H I'm going to [44:36] have that dut I'll go to the gym every [44:38] day well I'm going to start that [44:40] tomorrow we all do what's rewarding and [44:43] our dogs are no different so those [44:44] stubborn dogs are just doing what's [44:47] rewarding to them so getting mad at my [44:49] dog because he's stubborn or he's bad no [44:52] I just need to show him that there's [44:54] value in doing what I want and how [44:58] pleasing me so that we can have [45:00] enjoyable walks maybe I'm going to get [45:02] some treats maybe I need to go to a [45:03] lower distraction environment maybe I [45:06] need to use my voice more maybe I need [45:08] to reset my expectations that my walk is [45:11] just making it out the front door of my [45:13] house on a loose leash and then we get [45:16] into a little game of play or he can [45:18] chase me so that walking with me is [45:20] wonderful instead of classifying him as [45:23] stubborn and getting mad it's a no- win [45:25] situation [45:27] there's something I find really [45:29] frustrating when someone says oh you [45:31] know I I've tried it but he's too [45:33] stubborn I think you're the stubborn one [45:35] you know I'm so I I'm so um over the uh [45:39] dog being the stubborn one here and I [45:41] and I'll tell you why because I remember [45:43] thinking boy Degan is so stubborn when I [45:46] was you know before I came to Mand dogs [45:48] as a student I thought like boy she is [45:49] stubborn she just won't listen to me and [45:51] in hindsight and thinking look at all [45:53] the it's never us that's the problem we [45:55] just blame the dog that's right it it it [45:57] and it's just not fair um but when you [45:59] recognize when you recognize you're [46:01] thinking like oh boy I have just I've [46:03] created the situation or I've allowed [46:05] them to rehearse the wrong things it's [46:07] not the dog that's the stubborn one uh [46:09] and I want you to really think be [46:11] self-conscious or very aware of the [46:14] interaction you're having with your dog [46:15] the situations that you're putting them [46:17] in and the training that you're doing [46:19] have you ever taught them how to walk [46:20] nicely on a loose leash through these [46:22] distractions no well maybe that's why [46:25] they're being stubborn right now uh it's [46:27] so [46:28] important and I've been there I totally [46:31] get [46:33] it changing dog behavior takes time and [46:36] consistency there's no magic bullet [46:38] there's no magic thing that's going to [46:39] immediately fix your dog's behavior in [46:41] any situations what is going to change [46:43] it over time is consistency of [46:45] expectation so I know what I want my dog [46:47] to do consistency of follow through and [46:50] teaching so I'm going to show them how [46:51] to do it and then I'm going to expect [46:53] that they do it and then consistency of [46:55] rewarding as we of work through proofing [46:57] this so I understand that people think [47:00] they've tried everything and I would [47:01] agree that they have but I want you to [47:02] try harder for longer and give your dog [47:04] a chance to learn a behavior that is our [47:07] biggest goal there's no magic fixes in [47:09] dog [47:10] training you know that saying in Dory [47:14] just keep swimming just keep swimming oh [47:16] the fish movie y the fish movie that's [47:19] right I like this I like camping with [47:21] ruffles it's a great line uh you just [47:24] need to keep training keep training keep [47:25] training you know sometimes we just have [47:28] to it does it's not like a quick fix [47:30] like you don't sometimes go out there [47:32] are some things you can go out and do [47:33] two or three times and the dog's like [47:35] got it and you can just you know you're [47:36] good to go but there's other things that [47:38] you kind of got to chip away at and then [47:40] you know before you know it you're like [47:41] oh my gosh like we're doing this like [47:44] this is going really well now um but [47:46] you've got to just keep training it's [47:48] really important that you stay patient [47:50] when you're dog training because you're [47:51] going to have good days and bad days [47:53] like I do too literally this week I was [47:55] training my puppy on something yesterday [47:57] and I had a horrible training session [47:59] and I left feeling so frustrated with [48:02] what I was doing and then I went back to [48:04] the hall today and I did the same thing [48:06] he was a rock star it's like sometimes [48:08] you just have bad days and you have good [48:09] days also yesterday I was tired I was a [48:12] little bit grumpy today I was feeling a [48:14] lot better so I was a better dog trainer [48:15] so I think sometimes you just have to [48:17] remember you got to keep training you [48:18] got to keep working at it that's that's [48:19] an important point you know I think a [48:21] lot of maybe you at home uh get to a [48:24] point where you've trained a bunch of [48:25] things and all of a sudden is not going [48:27] well and you just leave this with this [48:29] sour taste in your mouth um pay [48:31] attention to those moments how long did [48:33] you train what exercise did you work on [48:34] do you need to isolate that exercise do [48:37] just it for every you know when you take [48:39] your puppy out first thing in the [48:40] morning or when you take your dog out [48:41] after dinner or whatever work on just [48:43] that thing and be really uh specific [48:45] about the time that you spend on it but [48:47] it is important to end every training [48:49] session with a win something positive [48:52] yeah even if it's a little win you know [48:54] and I did do that yesterday but I'm a [48:55] perfectionist so even though I ended on [48:58] a win all the way home I was like why [48:59] did that go so badly what could I do [49:01] differently tomorrow I feel like I [49:03] should have been more patient so even [49:05] somebody who's a very very experienced [49:07] dog trainer you go through these types [49:09] of things mateline I love that she's [49:11] starting a training journal to remember [49:12] how far She's Come starting tonight one [49:14] of the things that I suggest that you [49:16] put in your training Journal meline is [49:18] put a little note on like your dog's [49:21] attitude or energy and your attitude and [49:24] energy because that's something that [49:26] I've learned over the years that [49:27] sometimes if I've you know for me I I [49:30] teach other people and other dogs all [49:32] day long and then sometimes it's not [49:34] till 9:30 or 1000 p.

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 37/199,at night where [49:37] like I get a chance to train my own dogs [49:39] and there's sometimes where it's like I [49:42] don't have any more energy left and I [49:44] have learned over the years that that is [49:46] not a good time for me to like work on [49:49] something complicated with my dogs or do [49:51] something that requires a lot of mental [49:52] energy sometimes that's just like I [49:54] throw a ball for like 20 minutes so that [49:56] my dog gets to do something so I'm I've [49:59] learned that I need to be in a good head [50:01] space in order to conquer some of these [50:03] things if you've had a crappy day and [50:05] you're tired maybe that's not the time [50:07] where you go outside in the driveway and [50:09] you try and work on walking because [50:10] you're already like you know not really [50:12] feeling it so pay attention to your [50:14] attitude and your dog's attitude because [50:17] sometimes that can really help mold and [50:18] shape how you should change what you're [50:20] doing MH yeah I know a few people have [50:22] mentioned ask the flirt pole would that [50:23] be a decent reward for dog uh maybe [50:27] uh or could be the worst thing that you [50:28] could possibly use as a reward it's so [50:31] entirely dependent on your dog yeah a [50:33] flirt pole is basically a tug toy on a [50:36] on a long line with like a crop like a [50:38] horse crop basically you could certainly [50:40] do it or just get our long puppy tugs [50:43] are great for that because they're 4 [50:45] feet long so when you like run away they [50:48] actually drag on the ground and that's [50:49] why our pupp that's why we call a puppy [50:51] tug because uh puppies really like it [50:53] because it's easy to they don't have to [50:55] jump up to grab it out of your your hand [50:56] you don't have to bend over you can they [50:58] can just grab it really easily but [51:00] basically you want something that you [51:02] can move around and flick around and [51:05] make really exciting and you basically [51:07] can turn any toy into a flirt pool it's [51:09] about the movement and how you're using [51:12] it but they're they're good but they're [51:14] not a necessity well and maybe um so [51:17] thinking about the flirt pole we don't [51:18] own one we do just fine um but uh it's [51:21] also harder to hide where a puppy tug or [51:23] a fuzzy ball tug you can stuff in your [51:24] back pocket good luck put in a flirt [51:26] Pole in your sweatshirt or down the back [51:27] of your pants yeah in your pant leg and [51:29] then all of a sudden you can't go [51:30] anywhere um some some really great great [51:33] questions uh did you want to cover uh [51:35] beline status beine oh sure yeah um so [51:38] uh I think I mentioned on the last have [51:40] I is this the first live stream since [51:42] I've I think so I think it is so the [51:44] last live stream I said that uh be and I [51:46] were headed to uh the Netherlands to go [51:48] to the agility World Championships we're [51:50] part of Team Canada which is really [51:52] exciting and uh while I was away last [51:55] week or maybe a week or a little bit [51:57] more ago um she had a wonderful showing [52:00] for majority of the week we actually [52:02] placed first in three of the courses she [52:05] was a a rock star but unfortunately in [52:08] um the Saturday night finals the big [52:11] finals uh she had um an accident on one [52:14] of the pieces of equipment and ended up [52:16] getting an injury on her toe uh while we [52:19] were overseas so it was a little bit [52:21] scary and stressful but we were able to [52:22] get her home safely and quickly um she's [52:25] had surgery on her toe uh and she is [52:29] healing and she is happy and she's doing [52:32] really well I don't think she loves the [52:34] fact that she can't like go for walks or [52:36] do anything like that right now we have [52:38] to keep her calm and quiet but she's [52:39] being such a trooper and um we have all [52:43] the best people helping us with um [52:45] decisions and care for her and she is [52:48] expected fingers crossed to make a full [52:51] recovery in 6 to 8 weeks because our [52:53] next goal is going to Belgium in October [52:56] um so we'll see right now we're just [52:59] taking it day by day but she is doing [53:01] well she's happy and she is living the [53:04] life she's getting massages and snuggles [53:06] and peanut butter treats and all kinds [53:09] of things to keep her entertained so um [53:11] thank you for asking it's very sweet [53:13] appreciate it um but yeah she's doing [53:15] good she's got the best care around so [53:17] one thing that we're doing a lot more [53:19] lately is playing Mand dog music when [53:21] we're at home on on YouTube or on [53:23] Spotify because it's uh relaxing music [53:26] that we created with uh uh music [53:28] producers um we actually started it [53:31] because of beine yeah yeah that's [53:33] exactly the case and it works in fact [53:35] one day I came uh home into the living [53:38] room and both kale and beine were asleep [53:41] uh Beyond her bed and kale on the couch [53:43] and Mand dog's music was playing in the [53:45] background so uh at the end of tonight's [53:47] show you're G I find it very relaxing it [53:48] is very relaxing um at the end of [53:50] tonight's show you're going to have an [53:51] opportunity to be redirected there if [53:53] not you can check out Mand dog's music [53:55] on YouTube YouTube or apple music or [53:58] Spotify uh it's better than TV for dogs [54:01] it's relaxation uh uh you know it's [54:03] exactly what your dog needs if you're [54:05] trying to chill them out a little bit uh [54:07] or uh your beautiful wife also chills [54:10] them out um I hope to see you in our [54:13] online training classes or in person [54:15] we're

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 39/199,~Ken === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] let's talk about [00:01] p and how they go poo and PE what if I [00:05] told you that you could get through your [00:06] whole house training process with your [00:08] puppy with only having one mistake or [00:10] maybe even no mistakes today I'm going [00:12] to break down everything for you so that [00:14] your potty training does not have to be [00:17] so stressful I'm kale mccan welcome back [00:19] to McAn [00:21] [Music] [00:22] dogs now what I'm going to do with my [00:25] puppy in the first couple days home in [00:27] terms of preventing accidents um in comp [00:29] comparison to maybe the second week that [00:31] they're home is actually going to be a [00:33] little bit different when I first get my [00:35] puppy home I'm going to try and make [00:36] sure that I am letting my pup out on a [00:39] really regular basis even maybe more [00:41] often than I think they have to go to [00:43] the bathroom and that's just to make [00:44] sure that I'm not in a situation where [00:46] my puppy is going to rehearse having any [00:48] accidents that could mean every couple [00:50] of hours that could mean after you know [00:52] all of the common times where they have [00:54] to go I'm going to try and get ahead of [00:55] the storm when I get to the point though [00:58] where my puppy is being let out on a [01:00] regular basis I do need to think about [01:03] how that's going to fit into my everyday [01:04] life schedule you know if I go to work [01:06] or if I need to do anything I can't be [01:08] letting my puppy out every couple of [01:10] hours for the rest of my puppy's life so [01:12] at some point once we've sort of gotten [01:14] a few days under our belt together I now [01:17] need to transition to teaching my puppy [01:19] that it's his responsibility to let me [01:21] know when he has to go to the washroom [01:23] um and that's going to be done in a few [01:25] various ways so how do you know when [01:27] your puppy has to go outside um now [01:30] there's a couple things we're going to [01:31] think about I do want the responsibility [01:32] to eventually be on my puppy but seeing [01:34] as he is a puppy I need to make sure [01:36] that I am taking careful consideration [01:38] to set him up to be successful so a few [01:41] common uh times of the day that I'm [01:42] going to think about is very obvious [01:44] ones will be you know after he's woken [01:46] up from a really long nap typically he's [01:48] probably going to have to go outside [01:50] after he's had lots of snacks after he's [01:52] had breakfast lunch dinner um another [01:54] common time that a lot of people don't [01:56] really think about is if he's had a lot [01:57] of physical exercise so if we've been [01:59] playing a lot or if he's been playing a [02:01] lot running around it's pretty common [02:03] that um that he might have to go outside [02:06] and a lot of people will miss that [02:07] they'll have let the puppy have a play [02:09] and then they'll let the puppy lie down [02:11] and go and have a nap and that's a [02:12] pretty common um time for them to have [02:15] to to use you know to go potty outside [02:17] and that could also be a a common time [02:19] where they'll have an accident the [02:21] second thing though is that I actually [02:22] want to teach my puppy how to ask me to [02:25] go outside when he does have to go and [02:27] there's a number of different ways that [02:28] you can uh do this with your puy um many [02:31] of them work as well but I'll let you [02:33] know one of my favorites uh you know [02:35] teaching your puppy to ring a bell or to [02:37] do a certain sign can all be really [02:39] helpful I personally have found over the [02:41] years that I much prefer teaching the [02:43] puppy to actually come and find me to [02:46] come and and to me and give me a sign [02:48] that way as they get older they have a [02:49] little bit more Independence in my home [02:51] um I don't have a poor puppy sitting at [02:53] the door while I'm you know watching [02:55] Netflix or typing something on the [02:57] computer and their poor puppies waiting [02:58] to to be let out so I prefer the puppy [03:00] to come to me now um there's a couple [03:03] ways that you can do this number one you [03:05] could just wait for some certain signs [03:07] that your puppy will do that sort of [03:08] gives you the the indication that they [03:10] might have to go out there are some [03:12] puppies that will naturally do things [03:13] they might naturally go to the door they [03:15] might naturally come and seek you out to [03:17] get your attention but lots of puppies [03:19] don't and that's actually very normal so [03:21] don't be worried if that's the case I [03:23] have had excellent luck um sort of [03:26] forcing the issue on the puppy in the [03:28] morning so you know in the morning when [03:30] I I take my puppy out of their crate for [03:32] the first time and we need to go uh do [03:34] our business outside one of the tactics [03:36] that I really like to do is rather than [03:38] take the puppy out immediately I'll just [03:40] put my house line on place my puppy down [03:42] on the floor near the door to go outside [03:44] and I will just stand calmly and not [03:46] engage with a puppy and sometimes what [03:48] will happen you can get it Bud sometimes [03:51] what will happen is uh you know the [03:53] puppy might immediately be like oh gosh [03:56] I have to pee and they'll just squat [03:57] right there you know in front of you and [03:59] I know that sounds a bit horrifying but [04:01] you know timing is everything if you're [04:02] able to catch your puppy in the act of [04:04] having an accident right in front of you [04:06] it's sort of a blessing in disguise you [04:08] can uh address that and take them [04:10] outside and we'll get more into that in [04:11] a moment or the other thing that might [04:13] happen and this would be the better of [04:14] the two options is that your puppy might [04:16] start to feel a little uncomfortable and [04:19] they might start to do a few things that [04:20] will be a good indication to you they [04:22] could um start sniffing the floor moving [04:25] around they might even go to the door [04:27] they could start to Circle a really [04:29] common way one that people often um Miss [04:31] is the puppy will actually wander off [04:33] and try to get away from you rather than [04:35] go right in front of you because they're [04:36] a little uncomfortable and when your [04:38] puppy starts to do those signs you're [04:40] going to say to them do you have to go [04:41] outside you can pick up your house line [04:43] or you can pick the puppy right up if [04:45] you'd like and then outside you go and [04:47] you can repeat that process I like to do [04:49] the morning routine thing because I know [04:52] my puppy has to go outside it's a little [04:54] easier I find than you know in the [04:56] middle of the day and maybe you're not [04:57] completely certain where that they have [04:59] to go and then you're just sort of [05:00] waiting around this is a good way to um [05:02] have great timing you can anticipate [05:04] what's going to happen and you can be [05:05] really consistent and I really do find [05:07] that within a few days of doing this you [05:09] can start to get on a pretty good um [05:11] routine with them I'm just going to keep [05:13] him on a little bit of a shorter leash [05:15] and I'm going to wait for him to start [05:16] squatting there we go hurry up hurry up [05:19] hurry up hurry up hurry up he's looking [05:22] at me like what the heck is that mean [05:24] hurry up hurry up hurry up hurry up oh [05:28] my goodness Yay good [05:32] boy so remember when we're trying to [05:35] teach our dogs initially how to go uh [05:37] pee or poo on command all you're going [05:39] to do is a bit of word association so as [05:41] he squats I'm just going to calmly [05:42] repeat the word that I'd like him to [05:44] learn to go on over and over and over [05:46] again it's important that when you first [05:48] start this though you do wait for the [05:49] puppy to actually start going once [05:51] you've done this every day for about a [05:53] week or so you can actually put it to [05:55] the test you can take them outside and [05:57] start to initiate the the exercise by [05:59] saying the word and most often than not [06:01] within moments your puppy will actually [06:03] start to squat for you um it is [06:06] important when you bring your puppy out [06:07] to do their potty though that you keep [06:10] your leash gathered up and you keep it [06:11] rather short puppies have a hard time [06:14] sometimes knowing whether they're going [06:15] outside for business or for pleasure and [06:17] if you're letting them walk you all over [06:19] your lawn and pick up this and pick up [06:21] that it will kind of steer their [06:22] attention away from actually getting [06:23] what they need to done so the rule is [06:26] business first and then pleasure second [06:28] and once you've had a little pee or a [06:30] little poop then you can have a little [06:31] play outside maybe do a little bit of [06:33] training and then you're good to go a [06:35] common question we get about uh teaching [06:37] puppies to do their business outside is [06:39] whether or not you should give your dog [06:40] a treat when they go and uh my advice on [06:44] this is I would actually suggest that [06:45] you do not do that and this is actually [06:47] a mistake I personally made with dogs in [06:49] the past and I've had a few dogs that [06:51] are very very food driven and I actually [06:53] had one very clever dog that would go [06:55] outside and do what we call Phantom pee [06:57] so she would go out and look at me and [06:58] she would squash absolutely nothing [07:00] would come out because she was [07:03] understanding that if she did that she [07:04] would get a reward so you don't actually [07:05] give need to give your dog physical [07:07] treats for this praise play affection [07:10] all of those things is positive [07:11] reinforcement enough what do you do if [07:13] your puppy has an accident and you are [07:16] there to catch them ideally that is the [07:19] best case scenario possible so our [07:21] puppies learn within one second and the [07:23] way we're going to let them know that [07:24] having an accident in the house is wrong [07:26] by is by being right there when they do [07:29] it really you want to scold them or [07:31] interrupt them when they're in the act [07:33] of going to the washroom and um one of [07:35] the things that I would suggest that you [07:37] do is just go for a startle effect you [07:39] don't need to do anything too crazy but [07:41] I will usually um you know raise my [07:42] voice or give a verbal reprimand I might [07:45] clap my hands hey hey hey what are you [07:46] doing something that sort of surprises [07:48] them doesn't scare them but surprises [07:50] them to the point where they sort of go [07:51] oh gosh what's happening and as soon as [07:53] I get a reaction from them I'll quickly [07:55] go over I'll either grab the house line [07:57] or I'll scoop them up and then I'll take [07:59] them outside immediately but if you can [08:02] um react to them while they are actually [08:06] going that is going to make the most [08:08] sense to them there's lots of ways that [08:10] people will um try to fix house training [08:13] that is just not effective and they [08:15] wonder why their problem still continues [08:17] um but ideally being there in the moment [08:20] is the only way you're going to fix your [08:22] problem um let's talk about what happens [08:24] if your puppy has an accident and you [08:26] are not there it's not doesn't happen in [08:28] your presence well [08:30] to put it bluntly that's one point puppy [08:33] and no points you so um you're not going [08:35] to fix a house training problem if you [08:37] are not there to catch them the axe so [08:39] if you are giving your puppy a lot of [08:41] opportunity to be on their own and [08:43] accidents are happening you need to [08:45] really think about how you can structure [08:47] your day uh a little differently you can [08:50] um supervise your puppy better um [08:52] perhaps you need to be using a house [08:54] line so if they try to sneak off you can [08:55] step on it prevent them from you know [08:57] getting to another room we utilize a lot [09:00] of baby gates in our house when we're [09:01] raising young puppies so that they don't [09:03] have access to the Full House they have [09:05] to stay in the room that we are in so [09:07] that it's easier to monitor them and [09:09] honestly sometimes life is busy and we [09:11] can't watch them every single moment and [09:14] that's why we have a crate or a kennel [09:17] and we like to have the crate or the the [09:18] kennel right in the room with us so our [09:20] puppy's still spending time with us but [09:22] if I need to sit down on the computer I [09:24] need to do something that's going to [09:25] take my attention away from my puppy for [09:27] a little period of time if I'm going to [09:28] have a shower or if I'm going to help [09:30] the kids with homework whatever it's [09:31] going to be I'm going to pop the puppy [09:33] in and out of the crate as much as [09:34] possible so that my puppy cannot sneak [09:36] off when I'm not paying attention and [09:38] have an accident in the house somewhere [09:40] um once the deed is done and you didn't [09:42] see it happen it's a done deal from [09:45] there you cannot be um scolding your dog [09:47] or being upset with your dog if uh it [09:50] happens and it's not in your presence [09:52] you unfortunately need to be more upset [09:53] with yourself for not being a better [09:55] supervisor because they truly do not [09:58] understand things that they've done [09:59] wrong two three seconds after they've [10:02] done it you know they're going to be [10:03] like why are you so upset you know if [10:05] they don't put it together it's not [10:06] going to fix your problem it might make [10:08] you feel better in the moment but really [10:09] it's it's bad dog training you've got to [10:12] supervise them catch them in the ACT [10:13] it's the only way to make the process go [10:15] quickly and efficiently today I talked [10:17] about everything you need to know about [10:18] house training your puppy but I didn't [10:20] talk about all of the common mistakes [10:22] that you could be making so we made an [10:24] entire video just about that you can [10:26] check that out right there on that note [10:28] I'm k mccan happy training

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 54/199,~Ken === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] puppy nipping is a thing and it is not [00:02] fun it's frustrating it hurts when they [00:05] have these razor sharp teeth um but what [00:08] people don't realize is that a lot of [00:10] the time when people are rough housing [00:13] with their puppies it can cause puppies [00:15] to be um a little bit more nippy and [00:16] bitey and it can be a little bit [00:18] confusing when people are rough housing [00:20] with their pups and causing the dogs to [00:22] to rehearse this Behavior but also [00:24] people don't realize that you actually [00:26] can use play maybe not rough housing [00:28] play but actual PL to teach your puppy [00:31] how to be a little bit more respectful [00:34] with um with your [00:35] [Music] [00:37] hands so this is a typical young golden [00:41] retriever puppy who as you can see has [00:43] no qualms about biting my jacket biting [00:46] my hands and he's not a bad puppy he's [00:48] just a puppy that's young and doesn't [00:49] really understand about bite inhibition [00:51] at this point and he thinks playing [00:53] should include using his teeth on my [00:56] skin or on my clothing so I want to show [00:58] you a little play exercise [01:00] that we can do with our puppies to teach [01:02] them that you actually can play we can [01:04] have fun together but there are a few [01:06] rules involved now before I get right to [01:09] the play part I actually need to teach [01:11] the control part first because I need [01:13] Stephen to understand Steph's like the [01:15] perfect name to get you in trouble with [01:17] um Stephen I need to teach him how to be [01:20] calm I need to have him understand what [01:22] the expectation is and I'm actually [01:24] going to teach him a command called [01:25] settle and the cue that I'm going to get [01:27] that I'm going to use to get him to [01:28] settle is by taking a hold of his collar [01:31] and when I take a hold of his collar I [01:32] want him to understand that he needs to [01:34] immediately be calm now we're going to [01:37] have to start right with in beginning [01:38] here because we do not have a calm puppy [01:39] at this point so I'm going to take a [01:41] little bit of food out and I'm just [01:42] going to put it right on Steven's nose [01:44] there we go you can see his behavior [01:45] changeed and I'm going to take a hold of [01:47] his collar with my free hand here you [01:49] can see my hands right in there yes good [01:51] boy and I'm going to reward him a few [01:54] times for sitting and being calm while [01:56] my hand is in his collar and I am not [01:58] being um discreet about this my hands [02:02] right in there good boy that's excellent [02:04] now I'm going to stop the treats and I'm [02:05] going to let go and I'm going to try [02:07] this a few times I'm going to reach in [02:09] take a hold of his collar yes and then [02:11] reward so the hand goes in the collar [02:13] First Once I have a good hold I'm going [02:15] to yes and reward all I'm doing with [02:17] this puppy right now is conditioning [02:19] when I he feels me take his collar I [02:22] want him to be calm and just be still [02:24] and await the rewards now eventually [02:26] once we do this enough time I won't need [02:28] to use the food but this is very first [02:30] time working with me and doing this [02:32] exercise so I need to make it well worth [02:34] his while now you'll notice I'm not [02:36] giving him any treats during this [02:38] exercise when I'm not holding him I want [02:40] him to think yes that this is the [02:43] absolute best part taking the collar is [02:44] a good thing it is crucial that you do [02:48] this step before you do the next part [02:50] that I'm talking about if your puppy [02:51] does not understand that when you take [02:54] their collar they need to be calm and [02:56] settled and relaxed this game is not [02:58] going to work I need yes I need a [03:00] position where he says I know my job [03:03] here I need to sit and be calm um in [03:05] fact I shouldn't say sit if he just [03:06] stands and be is calm that's okay too [03:09] now you might not see here CU he's [03:10] facing me but his eyes are a little [03:12] softer he's opening his mouth he's in a [03:14] totally different mindset than he was [03:16] just a moment ago all right now when I [03:20] use play to teach my puppy about not [03:22] nipping and biting I need to make sure [03:24] that I have a few things ready ahead of [03:26] time so there's a couple things that [03:27] I've done here number one his called is [03:30] well fit on his neck it's just snug [03:32] enough that I can fit two fingers in [03:34] there it's not so loose that he could [03:35] spin around and and have a little Heyday [03:37] if I was holding on to it so the collar [03:39] needs to be uh secure the other thing is [03:41] I need to have a leash on my puppy [03:43] because what I don't want him to do is [03:44] jump in try try to you know bite me in [03:47] my clothing and then take off and be [03:48] able to successfully run away so while I [03:50] might not use the leash a whole lot it [03:52] is going to be here as a bit of a backup [03:54] I'm in a controlled environment I've [03:56] actually rolled my sleeves up a little [03:58] bit to make them a little bit less [04:00] appealing and um you could do this with [04:02] a toy but I actually want to just go [04:04] right for the Gusto and teach him about [04:06] how to play with me just with my bare [04:08] hands um and not use the toy that that's [04:11] a great thing to do but it's almost like [04:12] a separate exercise so I have treats [04:15] ready and waiting in my pocket here [04:17] ready to go and I'm going to see if I [04:18] can initiate some play part of the [04:20] control aspect of this is that I start [04:23] the game and I stop the game so if he [04:26] comes up and he just starts initiating [04:27] play right away I would respond to that [04:30] by taking his collar and tell him settle [04:32] no no I need to start it that's what [04:34] allows me to to establish a bit of [04:35] leadership Play Time play time good boy [04:39] now if I feel any teeth on my skin or on [04:42] my jacket I am going to take his collar [04:45] and then uh tell him to settle he's [04:46] being pretty good right now we're [04:48] playing the floppy dog [04:50] routine good boy oops okay he's jumping [04:53] up and nipping so I'm going to take his [04:54] collar [04:58] Settle yeah yes good boy notice that I [05:03] waited a moment before I said yes and [05:05] gave him a treat because when I first [05:06] grabbed his collar um he actually still [05:09] had his mouth on my skin he wasn't [05:11] biting down and you know hurting me per [05:12] se but he still had his teeth on my skin [05:15] once I continue to hold I saw the little [05:17] wheels turn yes good boy Stephen and I [05:20] saw him go wait a second she took my [05:22] collar and I was Calm before so I waited [05:25] for him to assume that position and then [05:27] I yes and rewarded from there so let's [05:28] go ahead and try that again good boy I'm [05:30] going to start the game ready Play Time [05:34] Play Time play time good boy play time [05:38] now I'm going to stop before he bites me [05:40] settle oops okay so see how it's hard [05:43] for me to grab his his collar right now [05:45] he's going to bite this is where I can [05:47] use the leash to slide down and take his [05:49] collar [05:51] settle yes brilliant boy so again I take [05:57] a hold of the collar and then I'm going [05:59] to reward once he's calm beautiful bub [06:02] good boy now if your puppy is really uh [06:05] small or slippery or has a lot of fur [06:08] it's hard to get a hold of that collar [06:09] you can take a hold of the leash and [06:11] just zipline your hand all the way down [06:13] to the collar from there when you play [06:15] this exercise you do not have to only [06:18] stop once your puppy's nipped and and [06:20] and bit at your arms you can stop really [06:22] at any time because it's up to you to [06:24] start and stop but I want him to learn [06:26] that if his yeah actually he just did a [06:28] good thing there he went to bite hand [06:30] and instead he went to go to the leash [06:32] which I'm absolutely okay with but I [06:33] want him to understand that play can [06:36] continue as long as you're not biting me [06:39] okay should we do it one more time ready [06:41] Play Time play time Play Time play time [06:46] woohoo play time oh careful careful [06:49] careful [06:52] settle [06:54] yes that was your best [06:57] one good boy [07:00] wow so um Steven's laying down this time [07:03] rather than sitting and I'm okay with [07:04] that because what I'm looking for is [07:06] what's happening up here I'm seeing a [07:08] calm puppy he's giving me really good [07:10] eye contact wow that's [07:13] amazing good [07:15] boy what a lot of people don't realize [07:17] when it comes to stopping our puppies [07:19] from nipping and biting is that actually [07:21] correcting nipping and biting isn't the [07:23] sole way that you're going to fix your [07:24] problem in fact you can prevent a lot of [07:27] the nipping and biting issues from [07:28] happening in the first first place [07:30] simply by training your puppy this is [07:32] one of the things that we really focus [07:34] on in our puppy Essentials program we [07:37] want to teach you about the type of [07:38] puppy that you have not the breed but [07:40] the temperament and the mindset so that [07:42] you can give them and deliver the [07:43] information that's um that's important [07:46] and that you're not just doing the [07:47] cookie cutter thing you know there's [07:48] times where you're going to set out and [07:49] work on one thing and then we might need [07:51] to shift things slightly so that you and [07:53] your puppy can find success and uh [07:55] myself and my team of instructors are [07:57] really good at being able to read those [07:59] situ ations so that we can tweak things [08:01] so that they work perfectly for you and [08:03] for your puppy now you want to keep [08:05] these little sessions go boy you want to [08:07] keep these sessions really short and [08:09] sweet don't keep going until your puppy [08:11] gets a little bit exhausted do a couple [08:13] little reps here and there and then you [08:14] can stop from there now the last thing [08:16] I'm going to show you is just what we [08:18] call a passive restraint so the other [08:19] thing I want Stephen to be able to be [08:20] comfortable with is simply being held [08:22] and being calm so you can see for a [08:24] couple seconds he's fine there and then [08:26] he says I don't want to be here and this [08:27] is typically where a puppy goes to nip [08:29] and bite now I have a nice calm puppy [08:32] yes good boy so I can say yes set him [08:35] down I could reward if you had a family [08:37] member with you ideally it would be [08:39] great is while you were holding the [08:41] puppy if they were nice and calm you [08:43] could have a family member give your [08:44] puppy a few yes and then treats now [08:47] something that I'm doing here is I have [08:48] my hand just in his collar in between [08:50] him and me so that I can stop him from [08:52] turning to nip at me and I just want him [08:54] to be like a dangly puppy and actually [08:56] we call this the noodle test so you can [08:58] see if I hold hold him he's just like [09:00] all noodly and relaxed and and uh [09:03] comfortable hi lover Good Boy Yes again [09:07] I don't want to do it for too long [09:08] because I want him to be successful now [09:11] this one exercise is not going to solve [09:13] all of your nipping and biting problems [09:15] there is a whole whack load of things [09:16] that you need to know about in order to [09:18] get the full picture but this is [09:20] something that you can do that can allow [09:22] you to have some fun with your puppy [09:24] play and engage with them but them [09:26] understand you're being so good now them [09:29] understand that they can play and have [09:30] fun but they can do it without using [09:32] their teeth on your skin and on your [09:34] clothing and that's really our number [09:36] one rule if you find that you do this [09:37] with your puppy and it doesn't go quite [09:39] as smoothly I want you to take more time [09:42] working on the very first part of this [09:43] exercise and that is teaching them to [09:45] take the allowing you to take their [09:47] collar and reward them if your puppy is [09:50] not a master at that going into the [09:53] playing part where you're actually [09:54] provoking play with the puppy is only [09:56] going to end with your puppy nipping and [09:57] biting and you not being able to get [09:59] controll you'll notice that when I took [10:01] his collar it immediately calmed him [10:04] down so if you take the collar you're [10:05] not immediately getting that that means [10:07] you need to go back and work a little [10:09] bit more on having the puppy understand [10:11] the expectation that when we hold the [10:13] puppy's collar they need to be calm and [10:15] settled something that's important to [10:16] note about this game is that it is not [10:19] designed for all ages of dogs this [10:21] little play and settle exercise is [10:23] something that I would only do with a [10:24] puppy that was very young let's say [10:26] under 13 14 weeks old um and with [10:30] certain sizes of and weights of dogs as [10:32] well as your puppy gets a little bit [10:34] older and they have a little bit more [10:35] weight and a little bit more life behind [10:38] them it will become more challenging to [10:40] get them to settle but just by taking [10:42] their collar you know he is a very 10- [10:44] we old golden retriever puppy who's a [10:46] little bit more softer minded to begin [10:48] with if you're at the point in the [10:50] journey with your puppy where your [10:51] puppy's a little older a little bigger [10:53] um there's other tactics that we would [10:55] use uh to work through our nipping and [10:57] biting problems but I wanted to make [10:58] sure it was understood [10:59] that this particular game is best suited [11:02] for the smaller younger breeds of dogs [11:05] and the idea is to start this before we [11:08] have a lot of nipping and and and biting [11:10] problems Stephen is a young golden [11:12] retriever puppy that's very soft and a [11:14] little bit more mild um but remember if [11:16] you have a puppy that maybe is a bit [11:18] more boisterous and could use slightly [11:20] different tactics in order to conquer [11:21] nipping and biting you're going to want [11:22] to check out that video right [11:26] here on that note I'm kale happy [11:29] training ================================================== CONTENU DE:

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 66/199,~Ken #puppytraining #mccanndogs === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:01] okay so our online team just mentioned [00:05] I'm going to put this in the thing so [00:08] there is are you going to give it up now [00:10] I don't know okay well we can wait we [00:12] can wait let's wait we haven't even [00:14] talked about any dog training yet yeah [00:16] okay let's wait we'll wait fine fine [00:18] fine okay big questions you as a puppy [00:21] owner you feel like you have limited [00:22] time maybe you feel super overwhelmed [00:24] and we don't want you feeling that way [00:25] because you don't have to uh you know [00:28] you you can get farther Faster by giving [00:32] your puppy good information but you need [00:34] to know what some of those steps are and [00:36] you really need to avoid some of the [00:37] pitfalls that most new puppy owners make [00:40] so we need to talk about some of these [00:42] things I think I like this one this is a [00:44] good place to start I can just find my [00:46] little mouse um good place to start and [00:49] I'm Canna ask kale these questions she [00:51] is without a question the Expert 21 time [00:54] world champion dog trainer uh singer [00:57] dancer uh depends on uh the situation [01:02] either way you're you're ready how early [01:05] should I start training my puppy it's a [01:07] super common question and I think a lot [01:09] of people who bring a new puppy home are [01:11] kind of confused about this yeah um the [01:14] short answer is immediately the the [01:17] moment you bring your puppy home um you [01:20] should start training your puppy the [01:22] longer answer is what does training your [01:24] puppy mean because I think sometimes [01:26] when people say when I training I start [01:28] training my puppy people automatically [01:30] think like when should I start training [01:32] my puppy to sit and come to their name [01:34] and all those of things but one thing [01:36] that we really teach you in our programs [01:38] is that training happens all of the time [01:40] sometimes yes you are deliberately and [01:42] intentionally training your dog to do [01:44] skills but also everyday interactions [01:47] with your dog management feedback um [01:50] engagement all of those things are also [01:53] training your puppy to understand kind [01:55] of how the rules of your house are going [01:57] to go so um you're going to be actively [02:01] training and guiding and and mentoring [02:04] your dog all of the time um along with [02:07] actually training skills which you also [02:10] can start on right away you don't have [02:11] to wait um obviously there's going to be [02:14] a list of um skills that you would start [02:17] we would recommend that you start with [02:18] first and then some things that we would [02:21] not recommend you start until later um [02:24] but again short answer is yes start [02:26] training right away absolutely we [02:28] actually have uh quite a few videos on [02:30] the channel that talk about like [02:32] pre-recorded videos that talk actually [02:34] we have excises to do yeah when they get [02:36] home yeah in fact there was uh two [02:39] videos now at least one for sure with [02:41] uker where we show you the whole trip [02:43] home like we show you picking this puppy [02:45] up bringing her home and what there was [02:48] a couple challenges along the way like [02:49] there were a couple hiccups along the [02:51] way um and then what happens the moment [02:55] we get her home and remember how many [02:57] puppies would you say you've had like [02:59] personally only had 12 13 so far so lots [03:03] of experience like lots of you know [03:06] opportunities to go through this and [03:09] over 10 yeah under 20 personally you [03:12] know affected and uh invested in the [03:16] growth development of these puppies you [03:18] know some of the pitfalls that people [03:19] make and one of the big ones is they [03:21] don't start training early enough like [03:23] it's just not they want to let their dog [03:25] be a puppy before they start training [03:28] but you can do both at the same time [03:29] yeah uh sort of the short version of of [03:32] that is uh you start training right away [03:36] uh but you know don't work on the sits [03:37] and stays and like don't work you don't [03:39] go leash walking with that puppy you [03:41] know you're going to take it easy we'll [03:42] talk in a minute about some of the [03:43] things you should be doing um but and [03:47] how to think about it yeah so that's [03:49] really [03:50] valuable okay I like this one how long [03:53] should I train my puppy each day um well [03:57] we would recommend that [04:00] the best way to train your puppy and [04:02] again I assume this question is related [04:04] to um training your puppy to do skills [04:07] or tricks or obedience or things like [04:10] that uh we would recommend that you [04:12] train your puppy multiple times a day [04:14] have multiple sessions throughout the [04:16] day but those training sessions should [04:17] be very short and by very short I'm [04:20] talking like 5 to 15 minutes depending [04:24] on what you're working on puppies and [04:26] dogs in general especially if they [04:28] haven't had much training yet but [04:29] puppies in in particular have a very [04:31] short attention span um and when we're [04:34] training our dogs we are looking to get [04:37] really good engagement from our puppies [04:39] and sometimes if we just push the limits [04:41] a little too long our puppy brains sort [04:43] of fizzle out a little bit and then you [04:45] end your training session and they're [04:47] you know a bit sniffy and they're [04:48] distracted and you don't have really [04:50] good engagement so we like to train um [04:53] for short periods of time but we do it [04:55] multiple times um throughout the day uh [04:58] and work it indoor every day engagement [05:00] with the puppy already and that seems to [05:02] be the best way to train your dog [05:04] efficiently uh and quickly and [05:07] effectively yeah um absolutely that I [05:11] mean those that's great I forget what [05:12] that's called it's called it triol or [05:14] something Trifecta I mean it should be a [05:16] trifecta if you're if you're nailing all [05:18] those three things it is a trifecta [05:20] you're right if you're talking about uh [05:22] the amount of time can you judge the [05:25] amount of time you should be training a [05:26] puppy for like so how long should I be [05:28] training people want to to say oh you [05:30] know 60 Minutes every day it doesn't [05:32] work like that kale talked about [05:33] breaking it down into short training [05:35] sessions how do you know when okay [05:37] that's enough of a training session for [05:39] you know breakfast time or something I [05:41] usually find that out um pretty early by [05:43] watching my dog's behavior and [05:45] engagement if I'm you know been playing [05:47] and doing some stuff for a few minutes [05:49] and all a sudden my the puppy starts to [05:51] get you know disengaged I'm either going [05:53] to go they either have to go to the [05:54] bathroom or I've like trained too long [05:56] and so the next time I train I'll [05:58] shorten it by several minutes and see [06:00] what I get and if my puppy's still ready [06:02] to rock by the end of it maybe I'll push [06:04] the boundaries a bit more the next time [06:06] or I learn where my sweet spot is you [06:08] always want to make sure when you're [06:09] training your puppy and this actually um [06:11] is going to be something you follow all [06:13] the way through your dog training [06:14] Journey even as they get older and [06:16] you're you're engaging with them you [06:18] always want to quit while you're ahead [06:19] you want to quit when your dog wants [06:20] more because that's what builds more [06:22] motivation um to do things with you yeah [06:25] it's [06:26] great um and the amount of natural [06:29] training opportunities that will come up [06:30] like the amount of things that are and [06:32] we'll talk about that in this next [06:34] question um but the amount of things [06:36] that are going to happen naturally you [06:37] don't have to go out of your way you [06:39] know get your leash ready and put your [06:40] bait pouch on or whatever you it's going [06:43] to happen so you'll be ready for it you [06:44] you can train through it so let's talk [06:47] about how do I know what to teach my [06:50] puppy how do you know that's a great [06:53] question that's I mean you ask us we can [06:55] help you yeah I remember sometime I was [06:58] teaching a a puppy class we were getting [07:00] to the end of it and somebody put their [07:02] hand up and they were like so how do you [07:05] train the dogs and I was like oh that's [07:08] great yeah good question I feel like [07:10] we're going to take the next four weeks [07:11] and eight weeks of the program to learn [07:13] that such a big question so how do I [07:15] know what to teach my puppy um well [07:18] there's so many things that you can do [07:20] but really want to start at the basics [07:22] and this is going to sound a little [07:23] weird but one of the things that we like [07:25] to do uh right from the beginning with [07:27] our puppies is teach our puppies [07:29] anything that helps them to learn how to [07:32] learn yeah um teach them problem solving [07:35] skills teach them recovery skills teach [07:36] them anything that is related to [07:39] engagement with us um we don't do a lot [07:43] of things where the puppy gets to go and [07:44] be independent like off by themselves [07:46] and like kind of forgetting that we [07:47] exist a lot of the things that we start [07:49] off with are things that we can do [07:51] together with our puppy because the most [07:53] important thing to me in the first [07:54] couple weeks of having my puppy home is [07:56] to just start to develop a bond with [07:57] them um because once we have a nice bond [08:00] with one another the um training starts [08:02] to get bit better so um if you want [08:04] specifics I would work on um L uh [08:07] getting my puppy used to luring so what [08:10] that means is you know if I have treats [08:11] in my hand can my puppy really easily [08:14] follow my hand with the treats in it so [08:16] that I can start to use that technique [08:18] to teach my puppy to look at me to sit [08:20] to lie down to follow me um all of those [08:24] things so that would be one uh we teach [08:26] the puppy about what the word Yes means [08:28] because we use yes as a verbal marker [08:31] for when our dog is correct so we teach [08:33] them about that um I would start [08:35] introducing their name early on um we do [08:38] that very differently than what most [08:39] people do most people just start using [08:41] the name repetitively over and over and [08:43] over again um and we actually [08:45] deliberately do not do that we do not [08:48] say their name when they are a puppy [08:50] unless we're in a training situation [08:53] because I want my puppy to eventually [08:55] when I say their name to look at me when [08:57] I say their name the first time every [08:58] single time I say it I I want attention [09:01] so when I'm um trying to rehearse this [09:03] with a baby puppy who doesn't have any [09:05] experience I deliberately wait until I [09:08] have something on my person that can [09:11] help me get that attention whether it's [09:13] saying their name and then showing them [09:15] some food or saying their name and [09:17] showing them a tug or saying their name [09:19] and giving them a little tickle and [09:20] backing away and having some fun so that [09:22] my puppy learns when I hear this word oh [09:25] my gosh great things happen and I need [09:27] to pay attention to you we deliberately [09:29] avoid saying their name um in almost all [09:33] situations until we've actually trained [09:34] our dog to respond to it yeah um here's [09:38] there's also a lot more that we do but I [09:39] feel like that's a lot to start off with [09:41] absolutely um relationship building that [09:44] that's anything relationship and bond [09:46] that will form a bond between you and [09:48] the puppy and that includes you like [09:50] we've talked about that before you may [09:51] have mentioned that just now thing like [09:53] if it includes you it's a it's a benefit [09:55] that's right uh we have two super chats [09:56] now I haven't twed in a long time so I [09:58] got one loaded [10:01] up uh two interesting questions that we [10:04] uh don't often get I mean we're kind of [10:05] opening a big um let's address this [10:09] let's talk about this Courtney Raybon uh [10:12] congratulations on your first Super Chat [10:13] um I have second pick what character [10:15] traits are best this is a big question [10:18] I'm assuming you have second pick uh in [10:20] the litter for the puppy just assume [10:22] that's what you're referring to yeah uh [10:24] what character traits are best um that's [10:27] a hard one to answer Courtney because uh [10:29] kind of need to know what your lifestyle [10:32] is like and and what you're looking to [10:34] do with the pup um you know if you're [10:37] somebody who is going to be active if [10:39] you're looking for the dog to do active [10:41] things with um if you have a busy life [10:44] or if you have um more of a chill life [10:47] you're going to be uh looking for [10:49] different personality traits that's [10:50] going to um match what you want the dog [10:53] for um personally speaking I would try [10:57] to look for a puppy that is um confident [11:01] but not overly confident um I would look [11:03] for things like that like um you know if [11:06] you're around all the puppies like how [11:07] much natural engagement do you get uh [11:10] are they off like doing their own thing [11:12] um but I would say the best tip I have [11:13] for you is to um and if you're allowed [11:17] to pick yourself uh separate the puppies [11:20] in order to spend time with them don't [11:23] only pick off of puppies that are only [11:25] together in a litter because some dogs [11:27] will be very comfortable when they're [11:30] surrounded by their brothers and sisters [11:32] and in the place that they've grown up [11:33] and they've spent most of their time but [11:35] you take that puppy that's all confident [11:37] in that situation and you put them in a [11:39] different room in the house and you uh [11:41] put take them outside and their brother [11:42] and sisters aren't around uh you get a [11:44] very very different um experience and [11:47] sometimes people are shocked when they [11:48] get their puppy home and they're like oh [11:50] my God why is it so scared it was so [11:52] confident in the litter um so you can [11:54] tell those those types of things so that [11:56] would be a couple tips for you there I [11:58] think Courtney might have border col a [12:00] poodle oh um mentions uh I'm pretty [12:04] active train recreational I would look [12:06] for confidence first uh GSD [12:10] random why does my eight-month old GSD [12:12] listen really well off leash but on [12:15] leash she acts like I don't [12:18] exist I don't know yeah I don't know [12:22] there could be a lot of factors yeah [12:23] there's so many factors um in some cases [12:28] uh when dogs are are on leash and when [12:30] the leash is tight um whether you're [12:33] making it tight or whether the dog is [12:35] making it tight because the dogs know [12:37] they're on leash it's actually very easy [12:40] for the dogs to just know that you're [12:42] there they don't really have to worry [12:43] about you so they disengage you're [12:45] pulling them around you're sort of [12:46] you're making them sit you're making [12:48] them follow you by pulling the leash the [12:49] dog say well this is perfect I don't [12:51] have to do anything you're going to do [12:52] all the work for me um and uh I'm not [12:55] saying this because I think dog should [12:57] be a leash just because it listens [12:58] better I would really work on making [13:00] sure that when your dog is on leash that [13:02] you're focusing a bit more on engagement [13:04] perhaps move to more stationary [13:06] exercises rather than ones that involve [13:07] a lot of movement distraction [13:09] stimulation um and try to get your dog [13:12] to work with you with the leash loose [13:14] perhaps incorporate some treats into [13:16] your training or their favorite toy um [13:18] to get a bit more engagement but it is [13:21] you know there's lots of dogs that will [13:23] behave very different when the leash is [13:25] on versus off um I would argue that um [13:30] the dog listens perfect as an 8-month [13:32] old dog off leash all of the time into [13:34] to the degree that we would expect I [13:36] think sometimes if it you know at that [13:39] age with that freedom for the most part [13:41] if it works in your dog's favor most [13:43] dogs listen really really well until [13:45] there's a squirrel or until there's a [13:47] bunch of other dogs over there or you [13:49] know until somebody's eating that hot [13:50] dog and the dog just decides that they [13:52] would rather do that instead so uh I [13:54] would continue Rel lease training maybe [13:56] a long line would be a great option a [13:57] nice like stepping stone between having [13:59] the dog completely off leash and then [14:01] having the dog on a short leash um but I [14:04] would flip to wor more more stationary [14:06] work on leash so that you can improve [14:08] that the other thing I wonder uh is if [14:12] you're in a situation where your dog can [14:13] be off leash and you're in situations [14:15] where your dog needs to be on leash uh [14:18] they're likely very different [14:19] environments if you're choosing to allow [14:20] your dog off leash there's likely less [14:22] distraction there but if they're on [14:24] leash you're probably using it for a [14:26] reason so maybe the uh the environment [14:28] is too distra in or you haven't [14:30] reinforced some of those good attention [14:32] skills on that 6ot leash around these [14:34] some of these challenging things so [14:36] consider that you know think about okay [14:38] we if if we're getting great results out [14:40] wherever you are off leash maybe it's [14:42] time to pop pop the six foot leash on [14:43] and work on some walking work on some [14:45] whatever recalls work on some you know [14:47] stationary skills uh it could be really [14:49] valuable at that point yeah we have so [14:51] many drills in our programs that [14:53] specifically work on leash respect so [14:55] that means that when the leash is [14:56] attached to your dog's collar and you're [14:58] holding on to the end of it whether [14:59] you're sitting standing running you know [15:02] walking whatever you're doing we [15:04] actually train the dogs that it's their [15:06] responsibility to keep the leash loose [15:07] regardless of where they are around us [15:09] so if we move one way they just learn to [15:11] move with us in a way that the leash [15:12] never goes tight and once they [15:14] understand that concept then teaching [15:16] them to come when they're called [15:17] teaching them um to listen to us around [15:20] distractions teaching them to walk on a [15:21] loose leash all becomes more easy uh [15:25] when the dog has a a better truer sense [15:27] of how to have um least respect that [15:30] actually reminds me is maybe now is a [15:32] good time yeah now's a great time so now [15:34] that we just talk to you about all these [15:35] things yeah so instructor Aaron has uh [15:38] set up a uh discount for anybody who's [15:41] interested in uh our puppy Essentials [15:43] program or she kicked it up a notch to

program [16:08] we could be training with you as soon as [16:10] tomorrow um so that's pretty exciting uh [16:13] thank you instructor Aon for setting [16:14] that up but this is the kind of thing [16:16] because when we talk about situations [16:18] where you know you think like my dog's [16:20] not listening on on my you know leather [16:22] six foot leash or whatever but they're [16:24] they are listening off leash it could be [16:27] that moment of uh an instructor watching [16:29] you train your dog watching watching [16:30] your video saying like o here's here's a [16:33] little change you need to make or [16:34] consider you know how you're walking the [16:36] the tone of voice you're using there's a [16:38] million different things and this is [16:40] what I learned when I was a student at [16:41] Mand dogs many years ago is that the the [16:44] the most tiny changes can make a world [16:47] of difference dog training is such a [16:49] nuanced thing uh Louise just to thank [16:52] you lots of great advice thank you you [16:54] made our lights blue very cool thank you [16:58] okay let's move on to uh I like this [17:02] question thank you megie our instructors [17:05] are superb they are absolutely super [17:07] they're amazing when do I make training [17:09] more difficult like how do I how do I [17:12] crank it up a little bit uh sort of have [17:15] a simple answer for that and that's when [17:17] I sort of say when you are working on a [17:19] skill and you can't remember the last [17:21] time your dog had a failure you're ready [17:23] to up the ante you're ready to to make [17:25] it a little bit harder and I think [17:27] sometimes when people um um what people [17:29] don't realize with uh training is that [17:32] once you teach your puppy to do [17:34] something if you're looking for them to [17:35] be able to do that thing forever so have [17:38] longevity in that skill or reliability [17:40] or however you want to look at it you [17:42] need to train your dog to do the thing [17:45] but then you need to go through a [17:47] proofing stage to make sure that the dog [17:49] knows it in all situations they know it [17:53] when you don't have a handful of food or [17:55] your hand in the bait bag or the leash [17:57] on the on the collar or um their [18:00] favorite tour nearby or shaking the [18:02] cookie Bean like lots of people think my [18:04] their dogs so trained but really when [18:06] you look at it they're only trained in [18:08] some circumstances and we're looking for [18:11] your dog to have reliability so that you [18:13] can take your dog all over the place [18:15] anywhere and they can listen to the same [18:19] uh skills the same expectations no [18:21] matter where they are so that you know [18:23] you can enjoy your dog in lots of places [18:25] um so I would start to make things more [18:28] difficult when your dog is showing you [18:30] that they're really confident and [18:33] reliable in what you're doing and that [18:34] looks like a dog that listens um on the [18:37] First Command that looks like a dog [18:39] who's able to listen with a loose leash [18:41] and that is a dog that is able to listen [18:44] um you know in a bunch of different [18:46] locations not just in you know the [18:48] kitchen or the backyard or wherever [18:50] you're training and then you're ready to [18:52] make things a bit more challenging and [18:54] you could do so by um asking your dog to [18:56] do the behavior longer maybe you try it [18:59] with more distance maybe you bring in a [19:01] bunch of distractions and see if your [19:03] dog can still listen um but you want to [19:06] just know that you can move on to the [19:08] next step when you see reliability and [19:10] focus from your dog usually it's pretty [19:13] obvious yeah Jennifer what about puppy [19:15] biting your pants as you walk get a [19:16] house line use a house line it's the [19:18] best management tool you could possibly [19:19] have for your puppy yeah um the other [19:22] thing I want you to keep in mind though [19:23] in the mistakes that I made long before [19:25] I was a trainer at my cans was uh when [19:28] when Kale's talking about you make it a [19:30] little bit more difficult we're talking [19:31] about like incrementally more difficult [19:34] we sometimes we'll talk about the 3DS [19:36] distance distraction and duration and [19:38] we're only going to ever increase one of [19:39] those at a time so we can't expect our [19:42] puppy um to uh I don't know whatever [19:45] you're working on to make things more [19:46] difficult to uh you know recall down [19:49] your hallway and then go in the driveway [19:52] or go in the parking lot and try to do [19:54] the same exercise there we're going to [19:55] increase these things ever so slightly [19:58] and to Kale's Point ensure success make [20:00] it really rewarding and motivating for [20:02] your dog but we really want them to [20:04] understand like these words are they [20:06] work everywhere and the way to do that [20:08] is to make sure that you're setting them [20:10] up so they make the right choices a [20:12] great way to make things more difficult [20:14] as you do your [20:16] training uh common question why [20:18] shouldn't I give my puppy freedom to [20:21] roam this is so I see this I see this [20:24] kind of question pretty often when it [20:26] comes to like oh I can't can't use a [20:29] crate or I can't how am I supposed to am [20:31] I supposed to quit my job to train my [20:33] puppy and I'm like oh man so you [20:37] shouldn't give your puppy freedom to [20:39] roam because they have so many [20:40] opportunities to get hurt to make bad [20:42] choices to do the things that you don't [20:43] want them to dose bad things rehearse [20:45] bad things especially when it comes to [20:48] potty training or chewing so stealing [20:51] your things eating your shoes yeah [20:53] barking at the window and people walk by [20:54] there's like literally endless things [20:56] that they learn to do poorly yeah so if [20:58] you've gotten a puppy and you're like [20:59] well how on Earth I'm I going to potty [21:01] train this puppy when I go to work for 8 [21:02] hours well you're going to figure out [21:04] some way for someone whether it's you or [21:07] a dog walker or somebody to pop by maybe [21:10] twice a day and let the puppy out so [21:12] that they they're not in there holding [21:13] their bladder ble so that they're not [21:15] having accidents all over the place but [21:18] you know the reason you don't want your [21:19] puppy to have freedom to roam is you at [21:22] this point especially when they're so [21:23] little and and if if you have a puppy [21:25] that's like home for the first two two [21:26] weeks even they're probably [21:29] everywhere you go they're like your [21:30] little Shadow it is the most adorable [21:32] thing and people say ah he's so smart [21:34] he's already trained and then they get [21:36] to like the four- we Mark you know uh [21:39] 12we Mark and they're like there's a lot [21:41] of world out here I'm going to go [21:42] Adventure on my own so curious this is [21:45] why you don't want you give to give your [21:46] puppy freedom to roam they will only [21:48] make bad choices if they're allowed to [21:51] do it and they find it satisfying [21:53] remember puppies will only do what's [21:55] rewarding to them so if they find it [21:57] rewarding re rewarding to chew on your [21:59] shoes if they find it rewarding to pee [22:01] in the corner because they don't have to [22:03] go outside that's what they'll do so by [22:06] not giving them all kinds of freedom to [22:08] roam it ensures that your eyes on them [22:11] you know what they're doing you can [22:13] catch them in the ACT which sometimes is [22:15] the most valuable learning moment [22:17] especially when it comes to house [22:18] training you catch your puppy in the ACT [22:20] hey knock that off or whatever [22:22] interruptive thing you do um that really [22:25] U solidifies for your puppy like ah oh [22:27] this is not the right thing and then you [22:28] can take them outside and finish out [22:30] there giving your puppy freedom to roam [22:33] also devalues you at this point we [22:37] really want to focus on relationship [22:39] focus on um building showing your puppy [22:42] why why should they even listen to you [22:44] it's not natural for them to so we're [22:46] going to have to give them a bunch of [22:47] reasons so if they can hang out in the [22:50] living room and chew on a Kong chew toy [22:52] or you know they're stuffy or something [22:54] they're going to find that pretty [22:55] gratifying and then hey my food machine [22:58] comes by and you drop off their dinner [23:00] really what value do you have so if you [23:02] can be there with them while they're [23:04] making great choices you can reward that [23:06] while they're making the wrong choices [23:07] you tell them hey knock it off or [23:08] whatever um you really need to make it [23:11] about you uh it's so important and it's [23:13] so important during this really [23:14] impressionable phase uh while you have a [23:17] puppy [23:19] yeah [23:21] um let me just see [23:24] here okay this is [23:26] good what does 100% supervision actually [23:30] mean I see Katie can I'm I'm going to [23:32] grab your uh Super Chat in just a [23:34] second what does 100% supervision [23:37] actually mean that means that both of [23:39] your eyeballs are watching the puppy [23:41] when they are not in their crate um and [23:45] because we control all of the choices [23:49] the puppies make when they're first [23:51] learning the rules of the house we can't [23:54] do that all of the time because we still [23:56] have a life to live and we have to do [23:58] normal people things and um you know our [24:01] our attention does have to Veer away [24:03] from the dog sometimes they need to be [24:04] able to um do their own thing too they [24:07] need to be able to disconnect and and [24:09] have time away from you as well that's [24:11] also important um so uh supervision is [24:17] very intense engagement and and in and [24:20] interaction with your puppy um and doing [24:24] so by controlling the amount of space [24:27] they can roam in the house [24:28] kind of BS off of the freedom question [24:31] before you know if my puppy is in the [24:34] kitchen with us when they're [24:36] learning they're only in the kitchen [24:38] they don't also have access to the [24:40] living room they can't go upstairs to [24:41] the bedrooms we restrict where they can [24:43] go in the early stages until we know we [24:45] can trust them until we know they they [24:47] listen very very well when we you know [24:49] give them commands and call them when we [24:51] know they can just go and chill and lie [24:52] down and be calm and not be running [24:54] around the house and and you know [24:56] causing Havoc um that's when we can [24:59] start to maybe lessen our supervision [25:01] and give the dogs a bit more you know [25:03] Independence because we we trust what [25:04] choices they're going to make uh but 100 [25:07] supervis 100% supervision literally [25:10] means you're paying attention to them [25:12] you're not multitasking and doing other [25:14] things and not not realizing you haven't [25:16] paid attention for the last 10 minutes [25:17] because you've been sending an email and [25:19] Now on your phone or whatever you know [25:21] making dinner like oh it'll be fine the [25:23] puppy will be fine you now the dogs [25:24] chewed all the fuzz out of your Uggs or [25:26] whatever it's been so especially if you [25:28] got fuzzy Uggs well Uggs are only fuzzy [25:30] so um so yeah so that's what that's what [25:33] it [25:34] means great Katy K thank you for the [25:37] Super Chat bonding has gone a little too [25:39] well he cries for ages when he can't get [25:41] to me also not food motivated during [25:43] training okay let's let's tackle these [25:46] let's split these up and then uh talk [25:48] about them individually so let's talk [25:49] about crying for ages when he can't get [25:51] yeah honestly I find this one really [25:53] hard to answer because there are like 10 [25:56] different directions that this could go [25:58] um um and it really depends on what the [26:01] situation is so this is a very difficult [26:03] question to ask without having uh back [26:05] and forth with you which is the nice [26:07] thing about our online classes because [26:08] we can do that with you a little bit [26:10] more easily um so I'm just going to [26:11] speak a little bit more generally here [26:14] um just because I don't know all all of [26:16] the of the points you know often people [26:18] who are having um separation issues like [26:21] this um you know we would ask about [26:24] their crate situation we would ask about [26:27] when they're using it are you even using [26:29] one are you only using it when you go to [26:31] bed or when you leave are you creating [26:34] um the puppy to have stress because [26:36] they're not used to being separate from [26:38] you um you know if the puppy is whining [26:41] or crying are you going back and you [26:43] know going it's okay it's okay and and [26:45] feeding into that and teaching the puppy [26:48] that you like that that response um you [26:50] know there's a way to interact with dogs [26:52] when they are um you know a little bit [26:55] unsettled when we're not with them that [26:58] can help promote more confidence um [27:01] there are you know creating methods that [27:03] you can use to help with this um there's [27:06] all kinds of things so I find this one a [27:09] little bit difficult to answer when [27:11] there isn't a bit more of a back and [27:13] forth opportunity um I don't know if you [27:15] want to add something into that that's [27:17] good I mean uh I think I think you hit [27:19] on all the points we have a couple of [27:20] videos on the channel that talk a little [27:21] bit about preparing your dog to get in [27:23] the crate get in their crate um but also [27:26] picking those moments you know um [27:28] just because you're I mean I don't know [27:30] what your home situation is but let's [27:31] say even if you're work from home let's [27:33] say you work from home but that you need [27:35] to go you know do Zoom calls or [27:37] something while your puppy's uh in the [27:38] house you should be picking times other [27:41] than when you need to leave them so that [27:43] you're separated from them so having [27:45] them go in their kennel while you make [27:46] dinner because you can focus on the [27:48] training of that um I actually need to [27:50] go up here uh I just want to See's [27:52] writing something who Katie's writing [27:54] something just to clarify he's 10 weeks [27:55] old and we're coming to you starting [27:57] next Thursday okay cool that's great 10 [28:00] weeks old yeah yeah this good you have a [28:03] very young puppy uh so we got you Katie [28:07] oh yeah it's all good yeah yeah I would [28:09] mention that to your instructors though [28:10] when you go uh because they can have [28:12] that great little back and forth with [28:13] you Katie to make sure you're on the [28:15] right track but a 10-week old puppy [28:17] that's having that issue is very [28:18] different than like if your puppy was [28:21] like 5 months 6 Months 8 months 10 [28:23] months so uh you're good uh and the food [28:26] motivated thing um just make make sure [28:28] that you're uh number one not [28:30] overfeeding your puppy number two not [28:32] free feeding your puppy so that you are [28:34] um feeding small meals um at 10 weeks [28:37] you could still be feeding three three [28:39] times a day if you want to uh smaller [28:42] things um smaller portions um give it to [28:46] your puppy to eat and then pick it up uh [28:48] you might even uh feed your dog in the [28:50] crate especially if you have a dog [28:52] that's a bit stressy about you leaving [28:54] you know put the the food bowl down and [28:56] and let your puppy eat from there [28:58] um oh you know what uh Dan can you send [29:02] uh Katie or or drop the link for the [29:04] five aive video where we you were [29:07] working on um some food like exercises [29:09] then you did the crate and he offered to [29:11] go in the crate like he just offered to [29:13] go in there um that' be that'd be great [29:15] Dan if you can find that one I don't [29:16] remember which one it is I don't know if [29:17] it's first day home or not but that'd be [29:19] great and then my recommendation to you [29:20] is if you are coming to class there's [29:22] lots of distractions at class so make [29:23] sure that you bring your puppy to class [29:25] very hungry also have lot and lots of [29:28] different types of training treats um [29:31] it's really common for puppies to be [29:32] interested in something for a short [29:34] period of time and so if you only bring [29:36] one type of treat for like the entire [29:38] time you're trying to train some puppies [29:40] will get bored of it so multiple types [29:42] of treats um and high value treats and I [29:46] not necessarily surprisingly we wouldn't [29:48] necessarily recommend that you go and [29:49] get some from a pet store sometimes [29:51] people have way more luck um using like [29:54] block cheese chicken wieners cut up [29:56] chicken breast that type of thing our [29:57] homemade tuna yeah I was just about to [29:59] say we have an amazing super super [30:01] simple recipe for tuna treats that are [30:03] just a couple different ingredients and [30:06] um most puppies are really motivated to [30:08] work for it um so that's where I would [30:10] start awesome Kira Ashley thank you for [30:12] the Super Chat let us know our mods will [30:14] be keeping an eye on the chat to see if [30:16] you have a question now uh I like this [30:20] one cuz um what tools do you use for [30:24] puppy training by tools do you mean like [30:26] so like things do you use I guess yeah I [30:28] think that's what I took training out [30:30] um I mean we it's not we practice what [30:34] we preach yeah like we we literally we [30:37] have Vlogs talking about this but we [30:39] literally use all the things and what [30:42] are all the all every time I get a puppy [30:43] I have like my puppy training bag and I [30:46] have my arsenal of tools and things that [30:48] I have in it and it literally goes [30:51] everywhere with me everywhere my puppy [30:52] goes um their little backpack goes too [30:56] um in that backpack you would see you [30:58] know well they would have a collar on [30:59] their neck obviously um but I would have [31:01] a house line I would have um a long line [31:04] so when I'm training outside I would [31:06] have lots of different types of tug toys [31:08] I might sound like a bit of a crazy [31:09] person here or I'm going to sound like a [31:12] smart dog trainer is um there's [31:14] different toys for different situations [31:16] so when I'm doing like recall training [31:18] for example Ken and I love to play [31:20] restrike recalls with our puppies and we [31:22] have these long puppy tugs that we sell [31:24] that are like 4T long and um we love [31:26] recall training with these to because um [31:29] I'll hold the puppy and Ken will take [31:31] the tug toy and he'll call the puppy and [31:33] run away from me and I'll release my [31:35] puppy to chase Ken and then because the [31:37] the toy is so long it kind of drags on [31:39] the ground a little bit and the puppy [31:41] can grab hold of it it's really skinny [31:43] so even puppies with little mouths and [31:44] it's very soft so the puppies can sink [31:47] their teeth into it really easily and so [31:49] you can play this really great a great [31:51] game of tug as a reward so I have that [31:54] let me know while kale answers more [31:56] questions from what you just heard kale [31:58] mention what do you think what are a [32:01] couple of things the puppy's going to [32:02] learn from that one exercise what do you [32:05] think you can accomplish from doing [32:07] those restrained recalls uh drop it in [32:09] the chat I want to see how closely you [32:10] guys are paying attention because [32:11] there's so much in that one exercise [32:14] that um it just it just uh until you [32:17] sort of like look at it a little [32:18] analytically you don't realize how [32:19] valuable something like that is sort to [32:21] interrupt that's okay um the other toy [32:24] that we would use is like a short a [32:25] smaller toy uh fuzzy ball tug or [32:28] anything like that where I might start [32:29] to work on teaching my puppy to retrieve [32:32] that's something I teaching my puppy to [32:33] fetch uh go grab a toy and bring it back [32:36] to me so we can play tug together this [32:37] is something I always do as well I have [32:39] like a whack load of training treats I [32:41] have a a training uh treat bag um I will [32:45] have usually like a couple different [32:47] bones uh chew bones as well that I could [32:49] you know put in their crate to chew or [32:52] you know if I want the puppy to be out [32:53] with me and I just want the puppy to be [32:55] calm I can give them something to do um [32:58] um I don't know I usually have like a [33:00] mat or a bed that I can roll up and in [33:03] the early stages not necessarily go in [33:05] the crate but I would just have it with [33:07] me so I could work on teaching my puppy [33:09] some on your bed training um which [33:11] builds into you know Common mindfulness [33:14] in the house later um on self-control [33:18] Bruno was mentioning a uh he's early in [33:21] the live stream mentioned something [33:23] about like how do I build in an off [33:24] switch or like I'd love if this dog had [33:26] an off switch on your bed [33:28] is the way to do that it's it is the [33:30] perfect exercise uh to start to turn you [33:33] know flip that off switch for your puppy [33:36] regardless of the amount of energy it's [33:37] going to take a little bit of pre-work [33:38] you know you're going to have to know [33:39] that your puppy's in the right State of [33:41] Mind to work on an exercise like that [33:43] but it's also like a trick it's also [33:45] like a skill I mean it is everything and [33:48] I would say one of my favorite extra [33:50] skills that we teach our dogs is the [33:52] command go and lie down yeah totally for [33:55] sure we use it it's so functional use it [33:58] all day every day you know if I'm like [33:59] typing on the computer even for simple [34:01] things like my we have one border that [34:03] like really loves to be petted and loved [34:05] Grand Slam like and so if your hands if [34:07] you're typing on the computer he's the [34:09] dog that like will come and lift your [34:10] arm because he wants you to pet him and [34:12] obviously I love to pet him but [34:14] sometimes I'm like trying to get stuff [34:15] done and all I have to say is Go and lie [34:17] down like that that nicely and he's like [34:20] okay and then he just goes and finds a [34:21] spot and lays down you know just learns [34:23] to chill out and it's nice because [34:25] obviously when he was a puppy he [34:26] couldn't do that but as they get more [34:28] trained it's just a nice way to get the [34:30] dog just to go and chill totally uh just [34:33] a reminder I see uh we've got a couple [34:35] new students in the online in online [34:37] training we'll see you tomorrow awesome [34:39] um June train station uh for 10% off of [34:43] all of our programs uh life skills and [34:45] for puppy Essentials if you have a puppy [34:47] under five months then you're going to [34:49] register for puppy Essentials and if you [34:51] have a dog over 5 months any age over [34:53] five months then you would take our life [34:55] skills program they're two totally [34:56] different programs working on two [34:58] totally different things but [35:00] they go together like peanut butter and [35:02] jelly yeah well how do I teach my puppy [35:04] to like their crate now this it's asked [35:08] in a very straightforward like there's [35:09] one answer kind of way but it's actually [35:11] a little bit more challenging than you'd [35:13] think kale talked a little bit about [35:14] some simple crate exercises that you can [35:16] do where you're feeding your puppy in [35:18] their crate you're tossing food in the [35:19] crate making a bit of a game of it but [35:21] there's a few things that you can do [35:23] before it's time to go in there crate [35:25] that can actually make things much much [35:27] easier [35:28] number one uh making sure that they've [35:30] gone out to peer poop before they go [35:32] into their crate now you know that's not [35:34] why they're barking exactly yeah because [35:36] especially if if you are in the stage of [35:38] that you're creating your puppy often [35:40] you know you need to make sure that [35:41] you've taken care of all of the things [35:42] that could be wrong um or or you know [35:45] needs they might have before you ignore [35:48] some of the noise that they make um do [35:51] do some exercise with them the the tug [35:54] puppy tug like do some tug exercise them [35:57] physically yeah it's so valuable [35:59] exercise them physically because when [36:00] they get in the crate they're just going [36:02] to want to lie down and sleep yeah I [36:04] hardly ever put my puppy into a crate [36:07] when they have high energy it's always [36:09] after I've trained them or I've played [36:11] with them or done something so by the [36:13] time they need to go in their crate for [36:14] a few hours because I have you know to [36:16] go out or I have to work or whatever it [36:18] might be my puppy's like cool I'm ready [36:21] for a nap man um also too like we don't [36:24] really let our puppies nap out of the [36:26] crate when they're young either you know [36:27] even if I if I see my puppies starting [36:29] to get sleepy I go put them in their [36:31] crate I want to teach them to go and [36:34] chill out and have you know time to [36:36] relax yeah absolutely um so you've taken [36:39] care of those two things you can even do [36:42] something like uh some mental exercises [36:44] so whether that's food luring I mean [36:45] depending on the age of your puppy that [36:47] it'll change what exercises you're doing [36:49] but maybe it's some food luring maybe [36:50] you're luring your puppy into a Sit [36:52] maybe you're luring them onto a bed and [36:54] teaching them how to lie down you or [36:56] maybe it's you know it could be it could [36:58] be a million different things but [37:00] exercising them physically then [37:01] exercising them mentally is a nice way [37:02] to sort of lay on the plane so and it [37:05] doesn't take long we're not talking [37:06] about a 35 minute training session we're [37:08] talking about a 3.
document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 68/199,5 minute training [37:10] session and then they're ready to go in [37:12] their kennel um do we start life skills [37:15] as soon as we finish puppy Essentials [37:17] sure do yeah it's the best way to do it [37:19] for sure yeah you know people sometimes [37:21] do want to take time off to like perfect [37:24] the um perfect the drills and skills you [37:27] learned in one program but that's not [37:29] really how our whole life skills program [37:32] is structured it's structured to help [37:35] you through the bumpy Parts because [37:36] often what happens is you take puppy [37:38] Essentials and you lay down a really [37:40] good uh Foundation you get through a lot [37:42] of the puppy stuff bonding nipping and [37:44] biting um house training uh basic skills [37:48] all of that kind of stuff and then you [37:49] go into life skills where we really [37:51] start to work on skills that are going [37:53] to make your dog easier to live with um [37:56] but often what happens as you get to the [37:58] end of you know your life skills program [38:00] you're getting some great skills [38:02] underneath your belt and then your dog [38:04] starts to hit like a new section of [38:06] adolescence and some people um you know [38:08] think that their training is done but [38:10] it's actually the most important part is [38:13] to train your dog through those moments [38:15] so if you can just go right from you [38:17] know program to program to program to [38:20] program you get the best results because [38:22] the dogs don't have any time to get [38:23] rusty you don't fall off the wagon of [38:25] practicing you're accountable because [38:27] structure it's so important yeah totally [38:30] and honestly people are often surprised [38:32] to hear this you know my last name is [38:35] McAn this is my family's business I've [38:36] been doing this forever I know how to [38:38] train dogs I personally take my puppies [38:42] to every single level when they are [38:45] puppy at our school um they do puppy [38:47] Essentials grade one or uh life skills [38:49] two life skills three life skills four [38:51] uh and then usually I do life skillon [38:53] three and life skills four for over and [38:55] over and over and over and over again [38:56] because I love the structure that it [38:58] provides um it also keeps me training [39:01] because I know I have to go to class and [39:03] even though I could probably do it on [39:04] myself you get busy you get lazy just [39:06] get disconnected um so I literally do it [39:09] with my own dogs even though I don't [39:11] really need the instruction but I love [39:13] to do it because of the structure yeah [39:15] yeah AQ how long do you get access to [39:17] puppy Essentials and uh instructor Rob [39:19] said you get three months access to [39:20] puppy Essentials and that's important [39:22] because we are actually suppor four four [39:25] we program so you can it allows you have [39:27] some wiggle room so but but the [39:29] important part I know people have said [39:30] like well I want lifetime access like I [39:31] want access to these videos or whatever [39:34] and uh what's so valuable about our [39:37] program is we're actually helping you [39:39] this isn't like a bunch of YouTube [39:41] videos that you'll watch you want you [39:42] want to have us available too that's [39:45] that's the beauty of it totally what you [39:46] want is to not feel like you can fail [39:48] what you want is for somebody to like [39:50] know your dog know you so that they can [39:53] give you the right advice and and that's [39:54] why uh you know we shorten that window [39:56] that we you have access to like all of [39:58] the support and then life skills is [40:00] another period and then we actually have [40:01] an ongoing um uh monthly members that [40:05] you can continue to get support with but [40:07] um that's that's why we actually time [40:09] stamp the uh the program [40:12] yeah what kind of toys should I get for [40:15] my puppy this is a common question [40:17] because I think people always want to [40:18] buy like the coolest toys their dog [40:21] cutest toys get another one um so [40:24] basically you have two categories of [40:27] toys boys when it comes to dog training [40:29] and having a dog owning a dog um one is [40:33] going to be um for chewing that you can [40:38] give them they can go off and chew [40:40] without you they can have it in their [40:42] crate they can have it on their dog bed [40:44] it's for them to actually lie down and [40:47] actively chew on it um great for their [40:50] gums great for their teeth great for um [40:53] stimulation great for all of those [40:55] things and those items need to be safe [40:59] they need to be indestructible they need [41:01] to be something that you would not worry [41:04] walking away and and leaving with [41:06] leaving your puppy with it because you [41:07] know it's going to be okay um those are [41:10] the types of chew toys chew bones chew [41:13] whatever that your puppy should have [41:15] access to 24/7 um we have a little [41:19] basket in our living room and it is [41:22] filled with two toys so toys that Ken [41:25] and I know that if our dogs go Gra them [41:28] there's nothing to rip apart there's [41:29] nothing to chew on it that they could [41:31] break or ingest or hurt themselves on um [41:34] and our dogs can go and get them and [41:36] chew on them and play with them anytime [41:38] that they want to the second category is [41:42] what we call Interactive toys so these [41:44] are special toys these are toys that are [41:46] only used when you are involved and this [41:50] is where your tug toys are going to come [41:52] in your fuzzy ball tugs your frisbees [41:55] your tennis balls or whatever your are [41:57] tennis no well you could play ball with [41:59] your dog but you're not going to I [42:01] wouldn't give my dog a tennis ball to go [42:03] and chew right um I would throw a tennis [42:05] ball maybe with my dogs I personally [42:07] don't do that with my dogs because I'm [42:08] too worried about them getting hurt but [42:10] um uh I'm also a little crazy about that [42:14] yeah uh but so those types of toys would [42:16] be ones that maybe live in my training [42:18] bag or maybe live in a you know a [42:20] container on the top of my dog's crate [42:21] or my dog can't just get it whenever [42:23] they want to I would bring those toys [42:25] out we would play fetch we would play [42:27] tug we would do some training and once [42:29] we've done playing that toy would go [42:32] away um the other thing that that does [42:34] besides allowing me to keep my dog safe [42:37] is it builds value for that toy um you [42:41] know I have certain toys with my dogs [42:43] where if I pull five our youngest dog's [42:47] name is five alive if I pull certain [42:49] toys out he Associates that with like [42:52] the job that we're doing so this toy [42:54] means like oh this is the toy she uses [42:56] when we go swimming all the time this is [42:58] the toy she uses mostly when I do a dog [43:00] agility my dogs have certain toys they [43:02] only get when they play dog agility and [43:05] they are like oh my God I know what that [43:07] means they don't get it all of the time [43:09] I keep it very special and that builds a [43:12] lot of drive and a lot of love for the [43:14] activity that we're doing together and [43:16] also for that particular toy um why [43:19] would they get hurt from tennis balls [43:20] because dogs can uh defuzz tennis balls [43:23] it's terrible for their teeth and for [43:26] their gums [43:27] um it will grind their teeth down and it [43:30] gives me the Willy Woos they'll also [43:32] skin it and swallow the swallow the [43:35] outside of the the tennis ball but [43:36] you're also pretty cautious about like [43:38] an unpredictable bounce too like if the [43:40] tennis ball goes out and bounces oh [43:42] you're not referring to like chewing it [43:44] yeah uh I don't throw anything for my [43:46] dogs that they will uh could like jar [43:49] themselves um you know when people throw [43:51] balls like over the top the dog's heads [43:53] and stuff um it's a great way to like [43:57] cruciate I maybe looking from a from a [43:59] different perspective because I play [44:01] very very high level Dog Sports and I [44:03] literally don't even let anyone throw [44:05] anything for my dog and some people [44:06] might be like oh my God you're so mean [44:09] uh but um I'm very careful with my dog's [44:12] bodies and you know they are you know [44:15] they're very precious I want them to [44:16] live for a long time with no injuries [44:19] and be old and comfortable and not sore [44:22] and all of that stuff so we careful I [44:23] want to go back for a second to the uh [44:25] talk about the chew toys and um you know [44:28] we'll we have give our dogs access when [44:30] they want to some chew toys or we'll [44:32] give a puppy a chew toy but the very [44:34] first time you give your puppy a chew [44:36] toy regardless of what it is I want you [44:38] to be watching them get a sense of like [44:41] what kind of chewer are they you know [44:42] how quickly do they chew through things [44:44] are they the kind of puppy that will get [44:45] their entire mouth over something a [44:47] decent rule of thumb is to get like a [44:48] size and a half bigger than whatever the [44:50] size recommended is that way they can't [44:52] like Chomp hurt their teeth you know get [44:54] it uh all the way in their mouth but [44:57] even the safest chew toys out there uh [44:59] until you have a sense of what kind of [45:01] chewer you have it's a great idea to [45:03] supervise that as well and then once you [45:05] get a sense of how your puppy like I had [45:07] I'll tell you what makes me this um [45:10] reminds me of this Degan I the Black [45:12] Labrador Retriever that brought me to [45:13] Mand dogs many many years ago um I got [45:16] her a Kong toy cuz i' heard these things [45:18] are amazing they're nearly [45:20] indestructible I got her a red Kong H [45:22] and the top was off of it in about 4 and [45:24] a half minutes but luckily I was [45:27] observing her so I knew from that point [45:29] on I had to get yeah I had to get the [45:30] extra for extra tough tourers Kong and [45:33] and uh and she loved that but uh it was [45:36] important to keep an eye it is important [45:37] to keep an eye on your puppy while [45:40] they're figuring out their while you're [45:42] figuring out what kind of tour they are [45:44] um so don't overlook that that is [45:45] important but interactive toys are so [45:49] valuable uh I didn't get a chance to see [45:53] when we talked about the restraint [45:54] recall you are achieving so much k will [45:57] go to you know uh end of the hallway or [45:59] when we're outside you know kale will go [46:01] take the fuzzy the puppy tug and run [46:05] away with it exciting the puppy I'll [46:06] hold the puppy and then she'll call [46:07] their name the puppy goes racing towards [46:09] her hits the end of that tug and has a [46:11] great time yeah that dog is starting to [46:13] learn response to name or whatever [46:16] whatever uh command we're using whatever [46:18] word we're using they're starting to [46:19] learn that like oh every time I hear [46:20] that word I run towards you um they're [46:24] starting to learn that you are a value [46:26] you're something exciting in and you [46:27] know there's you know you you bring [46:29] you're the bringer of good things so by [46:30] the time they get to you you are have [46:33] all the value in the world all the while [46:35] the you know the environment's going on [46:37] around them maybe even in your house in [46:39] a hallway you know yeah we do it in like [46:40] a bunch of different places totally [46:42] totally I also like to do it with [46:43] different people holding my puppy as [46:45] well because the puppy gets used to [46:46] somebody getting in their space and [46:48] holding them and then after a few [46:50] seconds of being held they get to run [46:51] and have fun so they start to get less [46:53] worried about other people like getting [46:55] in their space for them yeah um you're [46:58] also getting exercise like this one this [47:01] one thing you do this is the thing we do [47:03] with a puppy before bed you know we'll [47:05] do some restrained recalls we'll do some [47:06] mental stimulation but the beauty of [47:09] this kind of exercise is then they've [47:10] got a poop your puppy your puppy has to [47:13] poop after these kinds of things so if [47:14] you're wondering like oh boy I don't [47:15] want to put the puppy in their kennel [47:17] before bedtime because I don't know if [47:19] they're going to poop in there uh it's a [47:20] great way to stimulate that kind of [47:22] thing so I mean it just accomplish [47:23] accomplishes so much uh another great [47:27] question what is one piece of advice you [47:29] can give to every puppy owner one piece [47:33] of advice if you had to condens down the [47:35] most valuable thing I have to say right [47:38] now is don't wait to train your puppy [47:41] don't wait to train your puppy yeah [47:43] start right away um or dog like if you [47:47] have an older dog and you're like I [47:49] haven't started yet start start tomorrow [47:51] um the more training that you can do the [47:54] faster you're going to get to the point [47:55] where you can actually really enjoy your [47:57] dog um you don't need to give your dog [47:59] time to be a puppy and to do their own [48:01] thing um 100 you're going to do stuff [48:04] together they're going to have all kinds [48:06] of wonderful experiences with you so I [48:08] would say start training right away and [48:11] the other thing that I would say is um [48:14] understand really understand that a [48:17] well-trained dog takes work and it takes [48:19] time and effort there are very little [48:21] things when training a dog if you want [48:23] it to be done well that is a quick fix [48:26] you have have to do the work you have to [48:28] do the repetition and you need to be [48:30] ready to do that a lot of people just [48:31] like want to put the magic collar on or [48:33] get you know they always say what treat [48:34] do you use that your dog must listen so [48:36] great because you have great treats [48:38] that's not the secret guys it's not the [48:40] secret um you know I can air treat my [48:43] dog sometimes I literally can fake [48:45] giving her a treat and she goes oh cool [48:47] because it's not about the treat it's [48:49] about teaching the dog um to work for [48:52] you it's a it's a much bigger thing but [48:54] it's not a fast process um you have to [48:56] be willing to do the work and if you do [48:58] that you're going to get a fabulous dog [49:01] yeah my one piece of advice would be it [49:03] is going to be work but it is going to [49:06] be worth it yeah I I can't tell you it's [49:09] also fun I can't tell you the difference [49:10] that it made uh for me having [49:13] experienced you know I I I I had a [49:15] 2-year-old labador retriever that I [49:17] brought to Mand dogs after from my vet [49:18] said listen I can't even assess her you [49:20] need to go over to Mand dogs and get [49:21] some training um and having that [49:23] experience versus having an experience [49:25] where we started where I where I learned [49:27] more about dog training I became a [49:29] trainer I had my own puppy and I started [49:31] them the right way MH um it was so much [49:34] easier it's that ounce of prevention was [49:36] worth a pound of cure I think is the [49:38] saying uh it was so much easier to just [49:41] give them good information to start off [49:42] with but I had to like go out of my way [49:44] to make sure that like my I had a good [49:46] schedule and you know I was giving [49:48] giving the puppy the exercise and me [49:49] physical and mental exercise that they [49:51] needed it was work but I will tell you [49:54] it has paid off for the last however [49:57] many years however your long your dog [49:59] lives if you put in that 6 8 12 months [50:02] of work it will pay off for the rest of [50:05] their life you'll be able to go more [50:06] places do more things with them you [50:09] won't be dealing with like some of the [50:10] really challenging things that if you uh [50:13] you know you ignore them now

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 71/199,~Ken #puppytraining #mccanndogs === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:06] there is one skill that I like to teach [00:08] every single one of my puppies when I [00:10] get them home and I think you're going [00:11] to be surprised how many different ways [00:13] you're going to be able to use this [00:14] yourself I'm K mccan this is Steven [00:18] welcome back to McAn [00:20] [Music] [00:22] dogs let's talk about what type of bed [00:24] you should use for this exercise and [00:26] where it should be when you're training [00:28] now if you're just starting out the [00:30] location of the bed really doesn't [00:31] matter eventually you're going to put [00:33] the bed in the area of the home that you [00:34] want your dog to train on but in the [00:36] early stages that part doesn't really [00:37] matter the type of bed that you'd use [00:39] can um can be helpful though so I like [00:42] to use something that's very well [00:43] defined um I like the bed to be raised [00:46] versus just using like a flat towel or a [00:48] mat on the floor um I think just [00:50] provides a bit more of um definition for [00:52] the puppy and um if you're working like [00:55] I'm on carpet with a bed so obviously [00:56] the bed's not going to slide but if [00:58] you're working on a slippery floor some [01:00] puppies can be a bit sensitive to the [01:01] bed moving so just be aware that if they [01:03] you know start to get overzealous and [01:04] jump on the bed it's not going to go [01:05] flying so just secure the area so that [01:08] there's not going to be any un um [01:10] unexpected interruptions that might [01:12] cause the puppy to lose confidence in [01:14] the bed uh and just start off nice and [01:16] easy once they have a a basic idea of [01:18] what they're supposed to do we can take [01:20] that bed and we can start to put it in [01:21] the areas where we're actually going to [01:22] be using it in real life when we're [01:24] first starting to introduce the bed to [01:26] the puppy basically all we're going to [01:27] do is just little Association I wanted [01:30] to learn that any part of his body that [01:31] goes on the bed is going to earn him a [01:33] reward and also anytime I teach my puppy [01:35] anything new I'm not really that [01:37] concerned about the command that I'm [01:39] going to say I really want to get the [01:40] behavior rehearsed a little bit and then [01:42] I can name it from there so I have [01:44] several treats in my hand I'm just going [01:45] to lure him over to the bed yes good boy [01:48] and I'm going to reward as soon as he [01:50] touches the bed and in the early stages [01:52] I'm not going to worry about a specific [01:54] position just get on the bed get a [01:56] reward it's that easy he's actually [01:58] defaulting oh that was an accidental [02:00] down we're going to take that yes good [02:02] boy um he's just automatically sitting [02:05] when we get on the bed all of that is [02:06] great now when I actually train on your [02:09] bed as a skill I personally really like [02:12] the um on your bed to mean get on your [02:14] bed lie [02:15] down look at that that was not that was [02:19] actually movie Magic it was the um treat [02:22] that's in my hand in in perfect down [02:24] position so that looked really great but [02:26] it was really because my hands down low [02:28] I want it to mean get on the bed lie [02:30] down and remain in position until I [02:32] release you so I'm guessing the first [02:34] couple parts is going to be pretty easy [02:36] okay so as we can see when I drop my [02:38] hand he lies down very very quickly so [02:40] we're going to go ahead and add that [02:41] step so I'm going to lure him over drop [02:44] my hand down to the floor and then I'm [02:46] going to yes and reward multiple times [02:48] now when I have a puppy that is moving [02:50] so freely with the treats he's getting [02:52] on the bed he's not afraid he's lying [02:54] down in a position everything is going [02:56] really smoothly I can already start to [02:58] think about adding a command now um [03:01] Stephen does not know how to stay on the [03:03] bed at this point so we're going to talk [03:04] about that as a separate step right now [03:06] I'm going to start doing a little word [03:07] association ready I'm going to say the [03:09] verbal first on your bed good boy and [03:12] lie down yes good boy now I'm going to [03:16] reward a couple times before he has a [03:17] chance to get up and then I want it to [03:19] be my idea that he comes off the bed [03:22] okay good boy so that's another really [03:25] important point that I think a lot of [03:27] people um forget about if if I want him [03:30] to understand to stay on the bed instead [03:32] of getting off a million times I need to [03:35] make sure that I teach him to wait for [03:36] me to release him so if I feed him and I [03:38] pull my hands away and I stop paying [03:40] attention I start doing other things and [03:41] he just gets up and wanders away off the [03:44] bed whenever he feels like it he sort of [03:46] learns that it's his idea to stay on the [03:48] bed or not on the bed so I need to take [03:51] u a little bit more control of the [03:53] situation Yay good boy by beating him to [03:56] the punch bit so on your [03:58] bed yes yes good boy so I'm going to [04:01] pull my hand away momentarily yes and [04:03] then reward good boy pull my hand away [04:06] yes good and I could start to say good [04:09] on your bed I could reiterate that [04:10] command woo that was a really crunchy [04:12] one good on your bed good boy good on [04:15] your bed okay yay and after he finished [04:18] that last treat I could release him from [04:20] there good boy now you can see we got a [04:22] smart little puppy on our hands here [04:24] when you start to see that your puppy [04:25] goes hm something about this bed earns [04:28] me rewards you can start start to [04:30] increase your repetitions you can start [04:31] to increase the amount of time that you [04:33] have your dog remain on the bed what I [04:35] would not increase at this point though [04:37] is the distance from the bed it would be [04:39] much better to work on duration with you [04:40] standing nice and close so that you can [04:42] deliver the rewards quickly and [04:44] efficiently rather than having the dog [04:45] on the bed and move away you'd get to [04:47] that point but right now duration and um [04:50] distraction we could work on but I'm not [04:52] going to worry about going uh at a [04:53] distance now you may notice that Steven [04:55] is very good at following the food he's [04:59] very quick to sit he's very quick to lie [05:01] down and one of the reasons for that is [05:03] Steph is actually already part of our [05:04] puppy Essentials program we stole him [05:06] from a student today to do this video so [05:09] he's already started some training and [05:10] some basic understanding of some of our [05:13] foundational Concepts on how we teach [05:15] things so if your dog isn't following [05:16] the food as as um efficiently as this [05:19] puppy is take some time remove the bed [05:21] as a option for now and just work on [05:24] getting the puppy to follow your hand [05:26] around with the food and every couple of [05:27] steps you can yes some reward to work on [05:30] sit you can lift your hand up to work on [05:32] down you can move your hand nice and [05:34] slow to the floor make sure youve [05:36] rehearsed those types of behavior first [05:38] before adding the bed into the mix but [05:40] again he's pretty quick at this stuff [05:41] because he's learned to follow the food [05:43] to sit and lie down completely separate [05:46] from adding our bed exercise um the [05:49] second tip that I have for you is when [05:51] you're training this you'll notice I [05:52] have this blue line attached to step's [05:55] collar and the reason why I have that [05:57] here is because I don't want Steven to [05:59] um you know suddenly get a burst of [06:01] energy and decide to nip and bite at me [06:03] or bite at the couch or even run away [06:05] having this house line on I can keep [06:07] control of him my goal though is that I [06:10] can work on keeping him so engaged it it [06:12] just sort of hangs out flops in the wind [06:13] I don't really have to do much about it [06:15] I only need to use it if I absolutely [06:17] have to all right it's clear that Steven [06:19] is a little yes is a little brainchild [06:21] here so I'm going to show you another [06:22] little exercise that you can do that can [06:24] actually start creating Independence on [06:26] the skill right from the get-go so up [06:28] until now get uh Steven on the bed I've [06:30] been taking the food and actually luring [06:32] him onto the bed I'm showing him exactly [06:34] what to do one of the cool things about [06:36] dog training though and puppy training [06:38] is something that we call offering the [06:40] behavior and this is where we can really [06:41] start to see whether the dog is putting [06:43] together what behavior that they're [06:45] doing that is actually earning the [06:46] reward so this time what I'm going to do [06:48] is I'm going to show him the treat but [06:49] I'm not going to lure him onto the bed [06:51] I'm going to actually see yes good boy [06:55] without guiding him with a treat does he [06:57] understand that coming over here onto [06:58] the bed is what actually is earning the [07:00] reward okay good [07:03] boy yes I'll take that now he's not [07:07] lying down that's okay I don't expect [07:08] him to do the down yet I actually don't [07:10] think he knows how to lie down [07:11] completely independently although he may [07:13] surprise us all I want to know now is [07:16] that if he goes yes onto the bed oh you [07:19] missed buddy will he get a reward okay [07:23] yes good boy so I need to get my yes out [07:25] quickly and efficiently good boy I bet [07:27] we have a lot of really great dog [07:29] training Fanatics watching in uh [07:31] watching our videos and something that [07:33] you may have noticed me do that was very [07:35] subtle is even though I wasn't taking a [07:37] treat and deliberately luring him onto [07:38] the bed and I wasn't telling him where [07:40] to go I was actually very slightly using [07:43] my body language to kind of open up the [07:45] possibility to go to the bed here good [07:48] boy so for example if I was to stand [07:50] like this with my back to the bed it [07:52] would be very cool if he decided to walk [07:56] past me and go onto the bed but me [07:59] presenting my body this way isn't very [08:01] inviting but if I turn and face the bed [08:04] it sort of puts a little nugget in his [08:06] mind that he should actually go there [08:08] good boy so early on I could just move [08:10] my body in that direction to help him [08:12] without actually yes without actually [08:14] pointing and as time goes on I might [08:17] start to slowly fade away some of that [08:19] extra body language yes um so that he's [08:22] doing it a bit more independently but [08:23] when you're puppy training there's a big [08:25] difference between on your bed and [08:27] actually showing the puppy versus just [08:28] subtly turning your body towards that [08:30] can be a really helpful step to add in [08:32] especially for young dogs often when [08:34] people see our videos when we're first [08:35] teaching something new they're often [08:37] very surprised by the amount of food [08:38] that we're giving the puppies in the [08:40] early stages and they'll say if I gave [08:42] my puppy that many treats they'd be [08:43] ginormous or they wouldn't want to eat [08:45] that much um so we always take that in [08:47] consideration in my bait bag I actually [08:49] have Steven's dinner so he's actually [08:51] not getting his dinner and then all you [08:53] know this extra abundance of treats I'm [08:55] using the dinner to actually teach him [08:57] how to do behaviors and there might be a [08:59] little bit leftover I could put in his [09:00] bowl and maybe do a bit of crate [09:02] training or something but you do want to [09:04] be mindful that in the early stages when [09:05] we're doing all of this extra training [09:07] and all of this treat training we do [09:09] want to make sure that we're not [09:10] overfeeding our puppies so steal a bit [09:12] of their supper or their breakfast use [09:14] that to work into your training [09:16] exercises throughout the day now what I [09:18] can start to do is teach him how to go [09:20] to the bed on a command now one of the [09:22] sneaky ways that you can do this is just [09:25] add the command that you want to use on [09:26] your bed to the behavior when it's all [09:29] ready in action so rather than me [09:30] standing here and saying on your bed on [09:32] your bed on your bed and have him look [09:33] at me like I have three heads if he [09:34] doesn't know I'm going to wait for him [09:36] to go on his [09:37] own on your [09:40] bed oh that was a bit premature there [09:44] hey you would fur come here what's this [09:46] do you want [09:47] that you want this try something on your [09:51] bed yes so you have to be a bit patient [09:53] there I'm waiting for him to offer and [09:55] then I can reward from there that's so [09:58] good look at you now this is actually [10:00] really cool I'm not getting it down on [10:01] the bed but you'll notice that he's gone [10:04] hm if I just stay on the bed the treats [10:06] start coming and that brings us into our [10:08] next phase and that is duration the on [10:11] your bed exercise is really not that [10:13] helpful unless he learns to stay on the [10:15] bed good boy now I don't want to wreck a [10:18] good thing here so I'm going to give him [10:19] this last treat and I'm going to release [10:21] him before we uh have a failure okay [10:24] good boy you are brilliant so teaching [10:28] them that this this is the valuable [10:30] place to be oh look at you that's so [10:33] good because once he understands that [10:35] this is a great place to be I can start [10:36] to build um distraction and I can start [10:39] to use it in a little bit more realistic [10:41] situations the other thing to remember [10:43] is that if you're going to work on [10:45] having your dog remain on a bed and [10:47] you're going to give them something to [10:48] do like chew on a bone or have a Kong [10:50] make sure that your rules about staying [10:52] on the bed still apply so um the house [10:54] line should still be on it can be in [10:55] your hand or under your foot so if they [10:57] decide to wander away and do their own [10:58] thing you can interrupt them and bring [11:00] them back to the bed um same thing when [11:02] they're chewing the item if it happens [11:04] to you know fly off the bed and they [11:05] just go and lie down and chew it there [11:07] don't waste the opportunity to put value [11:09] on the bed stop get the bone get the [11:11] Kong bring it back to the bed make this [11:13] area The Sweet Spot that your dog wants [11:16] to head to all of the time but criteria [11:18] stays the same whether you're giving [11:19] food from your hand or whether you're [11:20] giving them a separate item this little [11:22] exercise can be practiced anytime [11:24] throughout the day but one of the best [11:25] times to practice is late at night [11:27] because it really condones your puppy [11:29] being calm and settled uh in fact it's a [11:31] great exercise to add to a nighttime [11:34] routine with your puppy now if you want [11:35] to learn how to develop a proper [11:37] nighttime routine for your puppy you [11:39] should check out this video right here [11:40] on that note I'm caman happy training ================================================== CONTENU DE:

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 84/199,~Ken #mccanndogs #offleashdogtraining === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] listen I can guarantee we have the same [00:01] goals when it comes to loose leash [00:03] walking training to get outside with our [00:05] dogs enjoy a walk with them on our side [00:07] not pulling us down the street but I [00:08] think a lot of us also want to get out [00:10] with our dogs off leash eventually well [00:12] in this video instructor kill is going [00:13] to break down the one tool that's going [00:14] to get you there quickly but also [00:16] without undoing all your hard work and [00:17] training I'm Dan welcome back to Mand [00:23] dogs today I want to talk to you about [00:25] one of my absolute favorite dog training [00:27] tools and one that's going to make a [00:29] huge difference in the training with [00:30] your dog and that is a long line now the [00:34] beautiful thing about a long line is the [00:36] perfect way to bridge the gap between [00:37] having a dog that listens on leash and [00:40] having a dog that listens off leash [00:41] which is the ultimate goal colani let's [00:44] talk about when and how you would use [00:47] this long line now one of my favorite [00:49] Parts is to work on it when I'm training [00:51] my dogs to come now if she gets to the [00:52] end of the line and starts to pull I can [00:54] just y I can give her a couple pops on [00:57] the leash and encourage her to come back [00:59] to my side good girl this is a great way [01:01] to teach her that I need her to stay [01:03] within 21 ft of me now one of my [01:06] favorite places to use this or times to [01:07] use this is in that awkward stage [01:09] between when your dog doesn't quite know [01:11] how to walk perfectly in a loose leash [01:13] yet and also when you're trying to give [01:16] your dog a little bit more freedom to [01:17] exercise them and spend time with them [01:19] outside what I can do by having this [01:21] long line on is I can just hold a handle [01:23] and come here babe and we can just go [01:25] for a walk and that way I can start to [01:27] teach her to move around now if she gets [01:28] to the end of the line I oh look at that [01:31] good choice that was actually really [01:33] awesome what she did there she was about [01:35] to hit the end of the line she noticed I [01:37] was moving away and she chose to move [01:38] back wow I'm going to reward her for [01:40] that if she had chose to pull through [01:43] the end of line and get distracted or [01:44] tried to chase a squirrel or whatever it [01:46] might be I have my thumb through the [01:48] loop I have good control and I could [01:50] just execute a couple little pops on the [01:51] leash to get her to look back and then I [01:53] could run away we could have a lot of [01:55] bit of fun good girl so what I can just [01:57] do is practice moving around with her [01:59] and see if she'll yes see if she'll just [02:03] choose to move back with me and this is [02:05] the starting of being able to have what [02:07] we call verbal control my goal when I [02:09] train my dog is that I don't want to [02:11] have to have a leash or a line on the [02:13] dog I want to trust her enough that I [02:15] can take this leasher line off and she [02:17] would just stay around me now you'll [02:19] notice when I'm working with her colani [02:22] yeah my line is loose and that's the [02:25] beauty about having a long line if my [02:27] leash was just 6 feet long and she [02:29] didn't have the leash training yet she'd [02:31] probably just do a lot of pulling me [02:33] around which is not really what I want [02:35] to be rehearsing so this is a wonderful [02:37] stepping stone between having great [02:39] leash control colani yeah good girl and [02:43] giving your dog a little bit of Freedom [02:45] Perfecto yes a couple great factors [02:48] about this particular long line is the [02:50] length so it's 21 ft that gives your dog [02:53] plenty of room to move around uh without [02:55] the leash going tight so you can work a [02:57] little bit on your off leash control con [03:00] yeah good girl the other thing that's [03:02] great about it is the fact that it's [03:04] bioe so it's really comfortable to use [03:06] on your hands it's very soft but it's [03:08] also really strong you know if colani is [03:10] a big strong dog if she decided to take [03:13] off I would have really good control [03:14] because of the material of this leash [03:16] colani yeah good girl um the other thing [03:20] that's really important is the fact that [03:21] I want to be able to have this out of my [03:23] hands and eventually dragging so if I [03:25] want to take her swimming if I want to [03:27] go hiking if it's raining if it's muddy [03:29] this line is going to be able to be [03:30] dragged through the dirt and then simply [03:32] be washed off and be completely clean [03:34] again good girl so it's a really great [03:36] um material for any type of training [03:38] that you have you can grab one of these [03:39] for yourself while supplies last by [03:41] heading to Mand dogs.
document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 85/199,store so I have a [03:44] couple Pro tips for you when using these [03:45] long lines number one because our [03:47] ultimate goal is that we're trying to [03:49] achieve achieve off leash control I need [03:51] to make sure that when I'm using this my [03:53] line isn't constantly tight especially [03:55] when I'm trying to call and give [03:57] commands if I'm calling and trying to [03:59] train her a completely tight leash she's [04:01] going to be very leash wise so it's [04:03] important to put enough slack in the [04:04] leash that she feels off leash the [04:07] second tip to think about is that while [04:08] you're using it because it's really long [04:10] in uh length there are going to be times [04:13] where it's going to get caught around [04:14] your dog's paws and legs it's really [04:17] important that if you see it wrapped [04:19] around their paw that you don't pull or [04:21] uh do any training with it take a second [04:23] to unravel them if it's simply just [04:25] between their legs though so sometimes [04:27] hold on babe let show them what it looks [04:29] like sometimes the line will just be [04:31] like this I could still give a little uh [04:33] pulse when when it's like that to get [04:35] her attention um I also could just let [04:38] the line be loose and let her step over [04:40] it but it's sort of a nice side colani [04:42] come here babe it's often a nice sign [04:44] that when the line is sort of like this [04:47] and it's moving around that means that [04:49] it's loose that means I have a dog [04:51] that's being respectful and attentive [04:53] and aware of where I am so see how it's [04:54] a bit between your legs [04:56] colani yeah good girl so I can just give [05:00] it hey babe come here yeah good I can [05:03] just give it a little nudge in order to [05:05] get her to turn I don't have to be too [05:06] worried about it good girl okay so one [05:09] of my favorite ways to work with my dogs [05:11] is in an open field where I can work a [05:13] little bit on some recalls and also on [05:16] some uh just off leash control now you [05:18] can see the line's a little bit further [05:20] away but because it's 21 ft I'm actually [05:23] don't need to panic this gives her an [05:25] opportunity to have a little bit of [05:26] Freedom it also gives me the opportunity [05:29] to have a a little bit of a peace of [05:30] mind and if I'm nervous about her [05:32] getting too far I can simply just use [05:34] this line as a break I can go and step [05:36] on it with my foot she might hit the end [05:38] of it and she's going to feel that [05:39] tension there we go and then when she [05:42] turns around I can reward her from there [05:45] now what's great about this okay is I [05:47] can give her a little bit of freedom and [05:48] if I call her [05:50] Kanani I can step good try I can step on [05:54] the line so she didn't listen to me [05:55] there I said her name and she kept [05:57] moving I can step on the line and now I [05:59] can train through it so I'm actually [06:00] just going to grab the line good girl [06:03] and I'm going to let her get distracted [06:05] okay colani yay there's my girl colani y [06:11] good girl right here yes good sit [06:15] excellent so I can use a little bit of a [06:17] Chase I can use some rewards when she's [06:19] close I can use backing away to get her [06:22] encouraged to choose me what a good girl [06:24] if I spend literally 10 minutes out here [06:27] playing around especially in this heat [06:29] playing around with my recall and my [06:31] training colani yeah I'm going to have a [06:34] tire dog but also a dog that's learning [06:36] to listen to Me So eventually I won't [06:39] need this long line anymore but it is [06:41] such a great training tool to work [06:43] through all of these distractions um [06:45] while you're giving your dog a chance to [06:47] have some fun the tools we use are only [06:49] as valuable as the skills that our dogs [06:51] actually know to make sure your dog has [06:53] all the skills it needs for offleash [06:54] walking training you're going to want to [06:55] check out that video right there and on [06:57] that note I'm Dan happy training in ================================================== CONTENU DE: 2024-06-23_Do_You_Rely_On_A_Dog_Harness__Leash_Walking_Mistake__2.

talk about what type of bed you [01:02] should use for this exercise and where [01:04] it should be when you're training now if [01:05] you're just starting out the location of [01:08] the bed really doesn't matter eventually [01:09] you're going to put the bed in the area [01:11] of the home that you want your dog to [01:12] train on but in the early stages that [01:14] part doesn't really matter the type of [01:16] bed that you'd use can um can be helpful [01:18] though so I like to use something that's [01:20] very well defined um I like the bed to [01:23] be raised versus just using like a flat [01:25] towel or a mat on the floor um I think [01:27] just provides a bit more of um [01:29] definition for the puppy and um if [01:31] you're working like I'm on carpet with a [01:33] bed so obviously the bed's not going to [01:34] slide but if you're working on a [01:36] slippery floor some puppies can be a bit [01:38] sensitive to the bed moving so just be [01:39] aware that if they you know start to get [01:41] overzealous and jump on the bed it's not [01:43] going to go flying so just secure the [01:44] area so that there's not going to be any [01:46] un um unexpected interruptions that [01:49] might cause the puppy to lose confidence [01:51] in the bed okay before we get there I [01:53] think you sort of breezed over it but [01:55] why choose a bed like that like was [01:57] there a reason that you chose that bed [01:59] that's a little puffy you know it's not [02:01] a great big huge fluffy bed yeah I think [02:03] it needs to be a bed that's going to be [02:05] versatile that you can use in many [02:07] different situations um I also think [02:09] that it's important to use something [02:11] that's structured I think I mentioned [02:12] there that um you want something that's [02:14] sort of well defined so that it's [02:17] obvious if the dog is on the bed or not [02:19] on the bed because that allows you to [02:21] have a little bit more clear [02:23] criteria [02:24] um but it really can be it really can be [02:28] any bed I know know with our latest [02:31] puppy for whatever reason for months we [02:34] had two dog beds stacked on top of one [02:37] another oh that's right yeah in our [02:39] living room I don't know why maybe we [02:40] were trying to save space or something [02:42] and so when five alive learned how to do [02:44] this he learned to like step up on one [02:47] bed and then lay on the other it was [02:49] like a little princess in the PE [02:50] situation um that was very well- defined [02:54] yeah yeah uh Memphis Angel uh [02:56] two-month-old uh Dashi can have an off [02:59] switch yes please and you know maybe we [03:01] can talk a little bit uh even before we [03:03] go any deeper on this like how does how [03:05] does the off switch come to be um do you [03:08] want to take that off it's sort of a [03:09] weird uh it'll restart no this is okay [03:12] this okay um oh also looks like the [03:15] puppy's snipping sniffing your face I [03:17] mean oh I like this puppy who's a good [03:20] boy I it's a girl who's a good girl I [03:23] know her in real life now she's so cute [03:26] um what did you ask me uh like how does [03:28] an off switch come to why why would this [03:30] skill turn into an off switch yeah I [03:32] think it's important I love that you're [03:34] using the term off switch and perhaps [03:37] you stole it from our Linko but um it's [03:40] great because a lot of dogs um I would [03:43] say most dogs don't come with an off [03:46] switch you actually have to teach your [03:48] dog to have an off switch there are some [03:50] dogs that may be a little bit more mild [03:52] than their temperament or their energy [03:53] and they're happy to kind of be lazy and [03:55] lie around um but I would say that a lot [03:57] of puppies are not like that so we need [03:59] need to instill things that create that [04:02] type of mentality when they're when [04:03] they're young um and also make it easy [04:08] for them to do it um so that it's [04:10] something that they actually look [04:11] forward to and that they want to do so I [04:14] would say in the early stages that when [04:17] you have a puppy they don't necessarily [04:19] have an off switch right away you are [04:22] going to spend weeks or a couple months [04:24] teaching them through various exercises [04:27] how to have an off switch and then [04:28] you're going to be man managing them to [04:30] help them kind of follow the progress um [04:34] consistently [04:36] uh but I think eventually they uh they [04:40] learn how to kind of they know the rules [04:43] of the house they sort of know what's [04:44] valuable they know the places to go and [04:47] it it actually becomes pretty easy [04:49] awesome okay you ready to go yep uh and [04:53] just start off nice and easy once they [04:55] have a a basic idea of what they're [04:56] supposed to do we can take that bed and [04:58] we can start to put it in the areas [05:00] where we're actually going to be using [05:01] it in real [05:02] life okay so let's go back to our main [05:06] camera for a second so I saw instructor [05:08] Robbie also mentioned this uh she said a [05:10] bed with boundaries is is really nice [05:12] you know it's it really provides a [05:13] definitive Edge for the puppy makes [05:16] makes it's also for you you know you [05:17] talk about this with uh agility training [05:19] you know sometimes the visual uh I don't [05:22] know what signal Q uh boundary when [05:25] you're doing contacts is is is as much [05:27] for you as it is for the dog totally [05:29] yeah dogs dogs really like black and [05:32] white information they like things to be [05:34] very clear and consistent and [05:37] unfortunately humans are not always [05:40] naturally very clear and consistent so [05:43] if we can set ourselves up to have [05:46] um uh criteria that's easy to maintain [05:48] they're either on the bed or they're not [05:50] and when we say on the bed we mean like [05:53] all of the body the tail the toes [05:55] everything um and then when that starts [05:57] to you know break it's easy to see that [06:01] they're no longer on the bed so that [06:02] criteria just makes it easier for you to [06:04] be consistent about Okay so we've talked [06:06] about where to train it we've talked [06:08] about what to use as the uh as the bed [06:11] now we're going to talk a little bit [06:12] about building value because I know uh a [06:14] lot of you guys at home probably you [06:16] know have a puppy who listens sometimes [06:18] or you know you couldn't keep them in [06:20] one spot for very long or a dog that [06:22] sort of learns to ignore you a little [06:24] bit so we need to build a little bit of [06:25] value for this place cuz the dog's not [06:28] necessarily natur going to choose that [06:30] location or that bed so we need to uh [06:34] figure out how to incorporate [06:37] that uh from lots of links luten Super [06:41] Chat let's go I to drop here one second [06:45] it'll be in in a second so from uh lots [06:47] of links this is a great question is it [06:49] bad used a raised cot to train this [06:51] skill no not at all yeah no you can use [06:54] any anything that is has a clear defined [06:57] criteria the only thing I would say [06:58] about that is that if you're using a [07:00] raised cot that's several inches off the [07:02] ground just be mindful that the puppy [07:05] the puppy's height that you're the [07:07] height of your puppy is conducive to the [07:10] height of the bed because we do do lots [07:12] of repetition where the dogs jumping on [07:14] the bed and coming off and sometimes [07:16] those raised CS can be pretty high for a [07:18] small puppy um so just make sure that [07:20] the height of it would be appropriate [07:22] for their growth but yeah that'd be [07:24] totally fine I like this I'm just going [07:25] to put it up instructor Robbie we want [07:27] to say thank you so much for the [07:28] detailed review of our videos as we work [07:29] through puppy Essentials and life skills [07:32] amazing so nice Okay let's dive into [07:36] this when we're first starting to [07:38] introduce the bed to the puppy basically [07:40] all we're going to do is just little [07:42] Association I want him to learn that any [07:44] part of his body that goes on the bed is [07:46] going to earn him a reward and also [07:47] anytime I teach my puppy anything new [07:50] I'm not really that concerned about the [07:51] command that I'm going to say I really [07:53] want to get the behavior rehearsed a [07:55] little bit and then I can name it from [07:56] there so I have several treats in my [07:58] hand I'm just going to lure him over to [08:00] the bed yes good boy and I'm going to [08:02] reward as soon as he touches the bed and [08:04] in the early stages I'm not going to [08:06] worry about a specific position just get [08:09] on the bed get a reward it's that easy [08:11] he's actually defaulting oh that was an [08:13] accidental down we're going to take that [08:14] yes good boy and sometimes that'll [08:16] happen right like sometimes these [08:18] accidents happen and you you really need [08:20] to capture those moments and let the let [08:22] your dog know that they're making a [08:24] great choice yeah ideally I think [08:25] sometimes when people start this [08:27] exercise sometimes any exercise is they [08:30] start by getting the puppy on the bed [08:32] they tell the dog on the bed and then [08:34] they walk away and they wonder why the [08:35] dog doesn't stay so we recommend that [08:37] you teach these um skills in steps and [08:42] perfect the first step before going on [08:44] to the second that actually allows the [08:46] dog to have a much deeper understanding [08:47] of the skill which means it actually [08:49] works and has reliability and um you can [08:52] substain it all of those types of things [08:55] um so although this puppy did lie down [08:57] truly all we care about in the early St [08:59] stages is just teach the puppy that [09:01] getting on the bed's fun that that's it [09:03] um and then from there we raise the [09:05] criteria get on the bed and do a [09:06] position and once that's great we raise [09:08] the criteria get on the bed stay and [09:10] you'll see as we go through the steps [09:12] but we layer the expectation so that [09:15] it's really easy for the puppy to be [09:17] good at whatever step we're doing he's [09:18] just automatically sitting when we get [09:20] on the bed all of that is great now when [09:22] I actually train on your bed as a skill [09:25] I personally really like the um on your [09:27] bed to mean get on your bed lie [09:30] down look at that that was not that was [09:34] actually movie Magic it was the um treat [09:37] that's in my hand in in perfect down [09:39] position so that looked really great but [09:41] it was really because my hands down low [09:43] I want it to mean get on the bed lie [09:45] down and remain in position until I [09:47] release you so I'm guessing the first [09:49] cou that this puppy right now although [09:52] oh look he's Crossing his paes oh that's [09:54] very um you train that trick too yeah [09:57] yes you can um so although this he looks [09:59] like he's doing an excellent job and he [10:01] is you'll notice that when I'm feeding [10:03] him the second I go to pull my hand away [10:05] to like grab more treats and I'm not [10:06] really talking about this in the video [10:08] but the second I pull my hand away to [10:09] get more treats or to reward him if I [10:11] don't have my hand perfectly on this [10:13] puppy's nose at this point he's just [10:14] getting up off the bed and that's very [10:16] normal for the early stages and that's [10:19] something that we work towards but at [10:21] this stage I don't really care but [10:23] you'll see that I'm being very [10:25] particular about how I grab the food how [10:28] I reward so so that I don't know if you [10:30] back it up like 3 seconds I'll probably [10:31] do it again but um just watch how [10:33] quickly I replace him into the down [10:36] using the food I don't I don't let him [10:38] get all the way off the bed and then I'm [10:40] still digging in my bait bag for treats [10:42] the second he goes to move out of [10:44] position I'm reinforcing him back into [10:47] that down before he even has a chance to [10:48] think about doing anything else so that [10:50] timing and reward placement are crucial [10:53] for this exercise to mean get on the bed [10:55] lie down and remain in position until I [10:58] release you [11:01] going to beasy I'm Ling down so as we [11:03] can see when I drop my hand he lies down [11:05] very very quickly so we're going to go [11:06] ahead and add that step so I'm going to [11:08] lure him over drop my hand down to the [11:11] floor and then I'm going to yes and [11:12] reward multiple [11:15] times yeah so when you start training [11:18] this exercise a lot of people say like [11:19] well I mean he he's just following the [11:21] food you know I can't there's nothing I [11:23] can do this is such a common thing oh [11:25] you know he just every time I move my [11:26] hand he follows food and that will [11:28] happen that's going to happen you need [11:30] to know what step the first couple [11:32] progressions for sure yeah we're trying [11:33] to assign value to a spot in in this [11:36] case it's it's the bed um but don't uh I [11:39] mean don't you're not we're not fooling [11:41] anyone thinking that the dog's not [11:43] following the food it's focused on the [11:44] food eventually once your dog has [11:47] understanding of like how to stay put [11:48] and how to not to follow you you can [11:51] we're going to show you in this video [11:52] how you're going to do that but it would [11:54] be unrealistic to think that the very [11:56] first time that you set out to train [11:57] this with your dog that they could stay [11:59] on the bed as you walk away that would [12:01] be miraculous um so that's why we're [12:05] using the food and honestly it's [12:06] exercises like this I think that can [12:08] simplify it a little bit more for you at [12:10] home like exercises with clearly defined [12:12] boundaries when you're working on a go [12:14] lion your bed it'll start to allow you [12:16] to understand your dog a little bit [12:18] better and it'll also because you've set [12:20] such clear boundaries with that bed [12:22] it'll also allow you to go farther go [12:24] longer between rewards because over time [12:27] your dog's going to start to learn that [12:28] huh all I have to do is lay down here [12:31] boy this is an easy job I just have to [12:33] remain down on this bed and I get more [12:35] and more treats or I get whatever the [12:37] reward is so that's an important thing [12:38] for your your dog to begin to understand [12:41] putting in a little bit of effort for [12:42] you brings them something great [12:45] yep [12:49] okay oh Super Chat from Shane Slama Shan [12:53] I'm going to grab that in just a second [12:55] we'll run through this [12:56] first now when I have a puppy that is [12:59] moving so freely with the treats he's [13:01] getting on the bed he's not afraid he's [13:03] lying down in a position everything is [13:05] going really smoothly I can already [13:07] start to think about adding a command [13:09] now um Stephen does not know how to stay [13:11] on the bed at this point so we're going [13:13] to talk about that as a separate step [13:15] right now I'm going to start doing a [13:16] little word association ready I'm going [13:18] to say the verbal first on your bed good [13:20] boy lie down yes good boy now I'm going [13:24] to reward a couple times before he has a [13:26] chance to get up and then I want it to [13:28] be my idea that he comes off the bed [13:31] okay good boy so that's another really [13:34] important point that I think a lot of [13:36] people um forget about if I want him to [13:40] understand to stay on the bed instead of [13:41] getting off a million times I need to [13:44] make sure that I teach him to wait for [13:45] me to release him so if I feed him and I [13:47] pull my hands away and I stop paying [13:49] attention I start doing other things and [13:50] he just gets up and wanders away off the [13:53] bed whenever he feels like it he sort of [13:55] learns that it's his idea to stay on the [13:57] bed or not on the bed so I need to take [14:00] u a little bit more control of the [14:02] situation Yay good boy by beating him to [14:05] the punch bit so on your [14:07] bed yes good boy so I'm going to pull my [14:10] hand away momentarily yes and then [14:13] reward good boy pull my hand away yes [14:16] good and I could start to say good on [14:18] your bed I could reiterate that command [14:20] woo that was a really crunchy one good [14:22] okay you didn't mention this in the [14:24] video but you did use it a couple times [14:26] uh with your uh yes uh um the [14:30] conditioned reinforcer um maybe you [14:32] should talk about that because you're [14:33] using it here to sort of uh you know uh [14:36] elongate it yeah separate the time [14:37] between rewards but maybe you can just [14:39] mention that while you're using it so we [14:41] use the word yes as a marker when our [14:43] dog does something correct to let them [14:45] know that they're right and that a [14:46] reward is coming their way um we also [14:49] use praise and that usually comes after [14:51] the yes so I would say yes good on your [14:53] bed good down um and we like to use our [14:58] voice in in a way that sort of helps buy [15:01] the time between when I've rewarded my [15:03] puppy and when I need to get more food [15:06] out because it sort of keeps the dog [15:07] attentive if I'm completely quiet [15:09] there's a lot of puppies that will just [15:10] get you guys probably know how easily [15:12] distractable they are and then they're [15:14] off doing their own thing so using that [15:16] voice in between can be really helpful [15:18] um the other thing I'm not sure if we're [15:21] going to touch on it or not but I've [15:22] already been doing it so much in the [15:23] video is that you'll notice that I very [15:26] deliberate and when I'm using the uh [15:28] command okay the command okay is what we [15:32] use as a release command which means we [15:34] train our dogs to continue doing the [15:36] behavior that we're asking until we [15:39] release them from it and say okay now [15:42] the puppy that I'm working with there I [15:43] had only worked with a couple times [15:45] doesn't belong to us it's um um actually [15:48] a puppy who's in our puppy Essentials [15:50] program at the school we stole him for [15:52] the video um but he doesn't know okay [15:55] yet he just started puppy classes uh but [15:59] it looks like he does only because I [16:01] have good timing and I'm not trying to [16:03] toot my own horn here I'm just I'm [16:04] wanted [16:06] to 21 time world champion dog trainer so [16:09] you can toot all you want okay [16:11] absolutely not the direction I was [16:13] heading I'll toot for you anyways um [16:15] what I was trying to do is say okay [16:19] almost like it was my idea so that he [16:22] wasn't rehearsing lying down getting my [16:25] treats and then just deciding okay I [16:26] don't feel like doing this anymore so [16:28] you'll notice every time he gets up I'm [16:30] always saying okay before he does that [16:33] so that eventually once we Implement [16:35] more practice in training he'll know to [16:37] wait until I say okay so I can control [16:39] how long he stays on the bed it could be [16:41] a couple seconds it might need to be you [16:43] know a half hour depending on you know [16:45] where we are in our our training you [16:48] know this is one of those things that [16:50] can totally change your training because [16:52] you are you're preemptively using that [16:55] okay and I think a lot of people [16:56] wouldn't they obviously wouldn't know to [16:58] do that but it makes such a clear rule [17:00] about the okay that like until I say [17:03] that word my expectation is you keep [17:05] working you keep doing that thing and [17:08] you're you talk we talk a lot about [17:10] consistency but from the day one from [17:12] the first time you've worked on this [17:13] exercise with this brand new puppy uh [17:16] you're making sure that whether it's day [17:18] one or day 100 or you know whatever year [17:21] 10 there's consistency there that word [17:23] means the same thing I love these little [17:26] things it's funny you know you and I [17:27] I'll talk at dinner about something and [17:29] I'll think like oh boy that's we'll talk [17:31] about something about dog training [17:32] something and uh I mean that's all we [17:35] talk about most of the time uh but we'll [17:38] we'll talk about this kind of thing and [17:40] then I'll think oh that's such a great [17:41] little nugget of information uh that [17:43] it's perfect for a new dog owner and you [17:46] know it's hard it's hard to sometimes [17:48] capture that moment but things like that [17:50] things like the preemptive release with [17:51] your okay so that it stays consistent [17:53] are exactly those kinds of things that [17:54] are going to speed up your training [17:56] totally um two things to mention uh [17:59] number one Mary H with the super sticker [18:01] thank you Mary welcome back to the train [18:03] station and exercise Enlightenment uh [18:06] the super sticker as well thank you very [18:08] much if you have any questions uh we'll [18:10] have our moderators keep an [18:14] eye uh what did you do there I just [18:17] wanted to look at the answer to that [18:19] question oh I [18:20] see it's okay okay um so let's go back [18:25] before we get to the conclusion of the [18:28] command of lure uh let's grab the [18:32] Shan gra here somewhere I can just read [18:36] it there until you put it up okay good [18:37] idea um hi hi we have a 12we old pity [18:42] mix got her three weeks ago working to [18:43] stop her from nipping and biting use the [18:45] collar Scruff grab and settle command [18:48] doesn't need set doesn't seem to be [18:49] sinking in is this normal any thoughts [18:52] thank you um this is a very difficult [18:56] one to answer Shane without knowing you [18:59] and your puppy or seeing what you're [19:01] doing there are lots of times that we [19:03] hear people say this method of stopping [19:06] my dog of nipping and biting is not [19:08] working and this method of stopping the [19:10] nipping and biting isn't working um and [19:13] sometimes well there's a a long list of [19:15] things that could be the reason um [19:18] number one it could be the technique uh [19:21] number two it could be your timing [19:23] number three this is always a big one [19:25] your [19:26] consistency um number four um [19:29] is the puppy getting a lot of [19:30] opportunity to rehearse that behavior [19:33] you're setting them up to be in a [19:34] situation where it's super easy to to [19:37] nip and bite and make errors we actually [19:39] literally did a video entirely on that [19:41] because I find sometimes the people who [19:43] are having a lot of nipping and biting [19:45] issues are not managing the puppy very [19:48] well um learning some different tactics [19:51] on how to manage with the leash or the [19:52] crate or or uh training skills or things [19:55] like that shifts the puppy's mindset so [19:58] that they're thinking about working for [20:00] you rather than using you as a as a pin [20:02] cushion um so I don't want to speak to [20:06] the um correction style specifically [20:08] because there's just so much to it to to [20:12] give advice without knowing you and your [20:13] puppy and I wouldn't want to put you in [20:15] a um you know a bad situation but I will [20:18] say consider your consistency consider [20:21] your timing you know are you addressing [20:23] it right away or are you letting the [20:24] puppy nip and bite for several seconds [20:26] before you're doing anything about it um [20:29] are you being firm enough are you being [20:31] fair are you then looking for [20:33] opportunities where your puppy is making [20:35] a good choice and then balancing that [20:37] out by rewarding them and then again [20:38] Shifting The Narrative so that they're [20:40] not rehearsing the situation um over and [20:42] over again um you've only had the puppy [20:45] for a couple weeks so um the good news [20:48] is you've only had the puppy for a [20:49] couple weeks and you have lots of um you [20:52] have you have lots of time uh however it [20:55] is really important that it does get [20:57] addressed uh really early early and uh [21:00] you know when it comes to nipping and [21:02] biting this is something that we talk [21:03] about a lot in our puppy programs and [21:06] why I'm sort of a avoiding giving a very [21:08] specific answer is we know that there [21:12] are different levels of discipline [21:13] there's different techniques of [21:14] discipline there's all kinds of [21:16] different ways that we will suggest [21:18] based on the person and the puppy [21:20] because I'm not going to correct nipping [21:23] and biting with a pitbull puppy um even [21:27] though they tend to be actually be Mar [21:28] mows um in comparison to a Jack Russell [21:31] puppy in comparison to a Shih Tzu puppy [21:33] in comparison to a newy puppy they're [21:35] all very different in size maybe in [21:37] tenacity so one of the things that we [21:40] try to do in our classes is get to know [21:42] you and your dog and your situation so [21:44] that we can make sure we're directing [21:47] exactly the right thing that you need to [21:49] do with your puppy to make sure that [21:50] this is not something that you're [21:52] struggling with week after week after [21:54] week after week because if it's done [21:56] well it it's actually a very very fast [22:01] thing to fix and I that's really [22:04] important especially for those of you [22:05] who are new dog owners is there's [22:07] there's so much Nuance in dog training [22:09] that I know you're looking for the [22:11] answer to the thing and um some of the [22:14] answers uh might be there might be right [22:17] in front of you and you'll try this [22:18] thing and it'll work and some of the [22:19] answers may be a little bit more [22:21] difficult and will require more work or [22:22] a different approach um it's important [22:24] to know that that's normal yeah you know [22:26] that's totally normal and to not get [22:29] frustrated and to know that uh sometimes [22:32] you just need to keep working at it and [22:34] uh you know you you'll start to see the [22:36] change or or do it for a little bit [22:37] longer sometimes just a little can you [22:38] hear me gulping in the thing a little [22:40] bit that's okay um and uh you know [22:43] that's where you're going to see your [22:43] wins I saw a great question here that I [22:46] just wanted to touch on before I was too [22:48] far away Zach said love to hear about [22:49] how you incorporate an off switch to [22:50] relax on the bed versus trying to earn [22:52] another treat and sometimes demand [22:54] barking if it doesn't come soon enough [22:56] this is good so do we want to mention [22:58] that now or in a couple steps um let's [23:01] wait till we get to duration okay but [23:03] that's a that's great question we'll [23:05] definitely touch on that good on your [23:07] bed good boy good on your bed okay yay [23:11] is that okayish that last Street I could [23:13] release him from there good boy now you [23:16] can see we got a smart little puppy on [23:17] our hands here when you start to see [23:19] that your puppy goes hm something about [23:21] this Bend earns me rewards you can start [23:24] to increase your repetitions you can [23:25] start to increase the amount of time [23:27] that you have your dog remain on the bed [23:29] what I would not increase at this point [23:31] though is the distance from the bed it [23:33] would be much better to work on duration [23:34] with you standing nice and close so that [23:36] you can deliver the rewards quickly and [23:38] efficiently rather than having the dog [23:40] on the bed and move away you'd get to [23:41] that point but right now duration and um [23:45] distraction we could work on but I'm not [23:46] going to worry about going uh at a [23:48] distance that is a really important [23:51] thing to understand um do we want to [23:53] talk briefly just about why uh you're [23:56] going to stay close and maybe work for [23:58] longer yeah definitely um because the um [24:03] the most important thing that we want to [24:05] work on in the early stages is the dog [24:08] understanding to remain on the bed [24:10] keeping in mind that dogs learn within [24:12] one second we need to make sure that we [24:15] are close enough that if the dog if the [24:17] puppy chooses to leave the bed which is [24:19] going to happen when they're when [24:20] they're learning that we're right there [24:22] to get them back on the bed and into the [24:24] down position within a second if [24:26] possible when I start to build distance [24:28] when I have my puppy on the bed and I [24:30] move away and perhaps my puppy's not [24:32] ready for that type of Independence and [24:35] they rehearse getting up off the bed and [24:37] running across the living room and then [24:38] I ask them to go on the bed and then I [24:41] tell them to stay and I walk into the [24:42] kitchen and they get off the bed and [24:43] they run and I have to walk them back [24:45] there's so much time passing between [24:48] when the dog's breaking position off the [24:50] bed and when they're being brought back [24:52] to the bed that the puppy's actually not [24:54] going to correlate those repetitions in [24:56] their mind they're doing like 800 [24:58] repetitions of a new thing there's no [25:01] information about duration so in the [25:05] early stages I need to be close enough [25:08] that if my puppy gets off the bed before [25:10] I've given them that okay permission [25:12] release I'm able to assist the puppy [25:15] using the treats in the early stages um [25:18] into that down position until I'm able [25:21] to kind of you know sit there for 10 15 [25:24] 30 seconds without feeding and have the [25:27] dog say say okay I can do this [25:29] independently and then from there I can [25:31] start building distance which I'm going [25:32] to show you how to do that a little bit [25:33] later in the video um but the main [25:37] component is because you need to have [25:39] good timing if you want your dog to [25:41] learn to do this independently and now [25:43] that you are starting to get a sense of [25:45] where we're where like the foundation of [25:47] this skill uh I mean what do you think [25:50] you could use this for I'll tell you [25:52] some of the things that we use it for in [25:54] fact uh it's when we first you may have [25:57] seen this in one of our puppy Vlogs but [26:00] when with our puppy five alive kale and [26:02] I at some point were both really busy [26:04] and we would uh around dinner at the [26:07] dinner hour we would want to get make [26:09] dinner get dinner ready and but we also [26:12] had a little puppy there who you know [26:14] depending on his doing something with [26:16] his brain he needed to be doing [26:17] something yeah I know you've probably [26:19] felt like this too you're like oh my [26:20] goodness this puppy or this dog is [26:22] constantly going I need to do more with [26:24] them and that's exactly how we felt too [26:26] so an exercise like this is a great way [26:28] to exercise your dog's brain and what [26:31] kale and I would do is one of us would [26:34] start to get dinner ready the other one [26:36] would work with the puppy now a lot of [26:37] people say oh there's only one of me you [26:39] know I know there's not two people in [26:40] the house I did it by myself when you [26:42] weren home exactly but you know don't [26:44] don't think for a moment that that [26:45] excuse is going to cut it with us um so [26:48] you know maybe you're partially getting [26:50] uh your dinner out or maybe you're [26:51] pretending to this is generally what [26:52] we'll do is like we'll be pretending to [26:54] do something whatever we want to uh pair [26:56] that um skill with uh pretending to do [26:59] something but we're actually training [27:01] the dog so uh we would teach five alive [27:04] to go lie in his bed every single time [27:06] we started making [27:08] dinner so we would follow the steps we [27:11] we're showing you here uh including some [27:13] of the ones we're going to talk about in [27:14] a couple of minutes so that we could get [27:15] farther away from him and so that he was [27:17] on that Lo on that place for a longer [27:19] time but uh we would work on it and it [27:22] got to the point even when he was really [27:24] young how young was he what when was he [27:25] just like offering the behavior like at [27:27] like 12 weeks or something yeah at like [27:29] 12 weeks old we would go and grab the [27:31] handle of the oven or go beep beep beep [27:34] turn on the oven when we're going to [27:35] have some dinner and he would go lie on [27:37] his bed it was only like three weeks of [27:39] him being home four four weeks I guess [27:41] right of him being home than us [27:43] practicing that he was already starting [27:45] to coordinate the oven to lying down and [27:49] it's not because he's the most smart [27:51] puppy I mean I think he's pretty smart [27:53] but that's just because of our [27:54] consistency and like practicing it you [27:58] know does it does not take long for them [28:00] to start to figure it out yeah uh CJ is [28:02] it okay to give them a toy or two on the [28:04] bed to have them stay longer um yes well [28:07] we're going to get to that as well um it [28:10] is it is okay to do that um but I think [28:14] it's a butt here yeah but I would make [28:16] sure that you do that while you're like [28:18] hanging out with the puppy so I wouldn't [28:20] if if my puppy doesn't know the exercise [28:23] inside out and backwards I'm not going [28:24] to give them a chewbone and then like [28:26] walk away and forget about them I might [28:28] choose to have my puppy like lie in the [28:30] bed and chew in a bone when I'm like [28:32] already like sitting down and like [28:34] watching a TV show and you know maybe [28:36] I'm like sitting down on the ground with [28:37] the beside the dog bed often I'll sit on [28:39] the dog bed on the ground with a puppy [28:42] um with my house line on and then I'll [28:43] have a chewbone or something for the [28:45] puppy to chew so that I'm not like [28:47] constantly having to give the puppy [28:48] treats just to let them learn to kind of [28:50] settle their mind and kind of relax [28:52] that's actually a good suggestion for [28:54] the person who had asked earlier about [28:56] the dog that like too excited about the [28:59] treats and then just barks and is [29:02] getting ramped up because of the food [29:04] this might be a good thing for you to [29:06] practice as well just like more Chill [29:08] Vibes on the bed or the dog's doing [29:10] something um we can Circle back to that [29:13] um as well but that would be something [29:14] that I would suggest um I do want to um [29:20] comment on something that I think she's [29:23] one of our online students but she asked [29:24] an absolutely uh no up yeah Liz there [29:29] right here um such a clever question and [29:34] literally without you without knowing I [29:36] can tell by this question that you are [29:39] one of our students because of how [29:41] spot-on it is uh if the puppy is to [29:43] leave the bed do you lure them back and [29:45] reward or do you just use the house line [29:47] to bring them back and then reward after [29:49] the bit after a bit after they've [29:52] stayed so smart Liz um so here's the [29:57] deal when you're first starting with the [29:59] puppy we would just lure the puppy back [30:02] on the bed and feed it right away we [30:03] don't care so much about um the timing [30:06] of that but once I've done a session or [30:08] two I absolutely do want to make sure [30:11] there is a delay between when my puppy [30:14] returns to the bed and when they're [30:15] getting a treat because we have a lot of [30:17] very clever puppies out there that start [30:19] to go huh every time I get off the bed [30:22] you whip out a treat lure me back and [30:24] then you feed me I bet the more times I [30:26] get off the bed the more treat I'm going [30:28] to get because of the correlation so [30:30] you're rightless when that starts to [30:32] happen what we would do once the puppies [30:34] gets to better understanding is rather [30:36] than luring them back with a treat we [30:38] just take them by the house line [30:39] encourage them to go back onto their bed [30:41] and have them lie down and hold position [30:43] for two 3 four 5 seconds and then we [30:47] would bring out the rewards to reinforce [30:49] the dog that way the puppy has a super [30:51] clear picture that getting off the bed [30:54] doesn't bring anything staying on the [30:56] bed brings reward and that's how you [30:59] really start to hone in a stronger [31:02] understanding but um if you want if you [31:04] want to be asking great questions like [31:06] Liz uh join us join us in in our online [31:09] training programs where you uh get get [31:11] even more insight so many people don't [31:13] even great questions detail awesome [31:16] great um I've got Andreas you got a [31:18] question I'm going to jump back into [31:20] this and we'll come right back to your [31:21] super chat here in a moment now have we [31:23] shown this one I don't quite [31:25] remember I don't know [31:28] uh all right it's clear that Stephen is [31:30] a little yes is a little brain child [31:32] here so I'm going to show you another [31:34] little exercise that you can do that can [31:36] actually start creating Prett sure you [31:37] just called him a little brainchild yeah [31:39] I did he was a little brainchild yeah is [31:42] that a thing I don't know on [31:44] this up until now to get uh Steven on [31:47] the bed I've been taking the food and [31:48] actually luring him onto the bed I'm [31:50] showing him exactly what to do one of [31:53] the cool things about dog training [31:54] though and puppy training is something [31:56] that we call offering the behavior and [31:58] this is where we can really start to see [31:59] whether the dog is putting together what [32:01] behavior that they're doing that is [32:03] actually earning the reward so this time [32:05] what I'm going to do is I'm going to [32:05] show him the treat but I'm not going to [32:07] lure him onto the bed I'm going to [32:08] actually see yes good boy without [32:12] guiding him with a treat does he [32:14] understand that coming over here onto [32:15] the bed is what actually is earning the [32:17] reward okay good [32:20] boy yes I'll take that now he's not [32:24] lying down that's okay I don't expect [32:26] him to do the down yet I actually don't [32:27] think he knows how to lie down [32:28] completely independently although he may [32:30] surprise us all I want to know now is [32:33] that if he goes yes onto the bed oh you [32:36] missed buddy will he get a reward okay [32:40] yes good boy so I need to get my yes out [32:42] quickly and efficiently good boy I bet [32:44] we have a lot of really great dog [32:46] training Fanatics watching in uh [32:48] watching our videos and something that [32:50] you may have noticed me do that was very [32:52] subtle is even though I wasn't taking a [32:54] treat and deliberately luring him onto [32:55] the bed and I wasn't telling him where [32:57] to go I was actually very slightly using [33:00] my body language to kind of open up the [33:02] possibility to go to the bed here your [33:04] pu running away boy so for example if I [33:06] was to stand like this with my back to [33:09] the bed it would be very cool if he [33:12] decided to walk past me and go onto the [33:15] bed but me presenting my body this way [33:17] very inviting but if I turn and face the [33:20] bed it sort of puts a little nugget in [33:23] his mind that he should actually go [33:24] there good boy so early on I could just [33:27] move my body in that direction to help [33:29] him without actually yes without [33:31] actually pointing and as time goes on I [33:34] might start to slowly fade away some of [33:36] that extra body language yes um so that [33:39] he's doing it a bit more independently [33:40] but when you're puppy training there's a [33:42] big difference between on your bed and [33:44] actually showing the puppy versus just [33:46] suddenly turning your body towards that [33:47] can be a really helpful step to add in [33:49] especially for young dogs recording a [33:51] video that's a that's a challenge I mean [33:54] my the dog trainer watching the dog [33:55] trainer yeah when I'm not multitasking [33:58] and speaking to a camera there's all [34:00] kinds of things I would have re were [34:02] rewarded there if I was actually in full [34:04] dog trainer mode there uh from Andreas [34:08] uh can I use a 10 meter Long Leash in [34:09] the woods uh where's that question 10 [34:12] meter Long Leash in the woods when I'm [34:14] trying to stop him from pulling it to be [34:16] consistent with the short one 3 m [34:18] everywhere 2-year-old [34:20] retriever so can I use a 10 met Long [34:22] Leash in the woods so here's some you [34:25] want to talk about consistency and like [34:26] the two different commands that we have [34:28] for not y it might be most appropriate [34:30] yeah so I do like the idea um about you [34:34] using two different um lines I think [34:37] both are quite long though um 10 m is a [34:42] lot of line to manage in my opinion I [34:43] feel like that's very long if my math we [34:46] are we're we do feet over here Andreas [34:49] no we don't I mean kale does yes we do [34:51] we Canadian we don't do meters yeah sure [34:53] we do no we don't we absolutely do not [34:56] we don't use the metric system we use [34:58] feet and inches oh boy the Canadians are [35:01] going to come after us oh how you know [35:04] we're on the metric system who's been in [35:05] Europe who's been in Europe more me or [35:07] you you without do meters there yes [35:10] that's right we do not we use feet and [35:12] inches here so somebody says something's [35:15] 10 meters how many feet is it 30 in [35:17] change 33 yeah three we're having a [35:21] domestic up here yes I'm going to get [35:23] back to your question now uh so if [35:25] you're using a 10 m 30ft leash in the [35:27] woods when I'm trying to stop him from [35:29] pulling it or be consistent with the [35:31] short one uh 3 m 15 ft everywhere with a [35:34] 2-year-old retriever um if [35:37] you're she's wrong okay [35:43] um I I I would go two ways number one if [35:47] you're going to be using a long line um [35:50] it's I'm so distracted by people like [35:52] calling me we only use that if we are [35:55] near a border okay really is it an [35:58] American thing I feel like you should [36:00] sing of Canada right now just to is it [36:02] really an American thing yes yeah oh I'm [36:04] so embarrassed for myself hey I don't I [36:08] want to do what's Canadian what's the [36:10] speed what's the [36:12] speed symetric uh unit of measurement [36:15] literally I never use meters for [36:17] anything ever in my life I only use feet [36:20] I'm sorry to break it to K okay guys [36:23] fine well maybe I is smart I'm [36:29] disappointed okay okay the point let's [36:32] talk about andreas' uh H okay if you're [36:34] out in the woods then a longer line [36:37] would be fine but it is not fine if [36:41] you're giving your dog this big Long [36:43] Leash and he's still pulling that if [36:45] that's the case then I would be working [36:48] on a much shorter leash I would be [36:50] working on a six foot leash how many [36:53] meters is that uh two because we use [36:56] them here in Canada okay uh we do we say [36:59] six foot leash we don't say two met [37:02] leash to be honest we're it's quite a [37:03] mixed system like we often will use them [37:06] interchangeably or use both Robbie it's [37:08] okay you're an awesome dog trainer and [37:10] that's what [37:11] counts so you need to be using a shorter [37:14] leash Andrea so that you have more [37:16] control over your dog so that you can [37:18] train your dog not to pull so we have a [37:20] a saying around here and that is [37:23] training your dog to walk on a loose [37:25] leash is much different than just taking [37:27] your dog off for a walk on a leash you [37:30] actually have to train your dog not to [37:31] pull and that really can only be done on [37:33] a leash that's short enough that you can [37:35] move and turn and redirect and reward [37:38] and all of those things with your dog um [37:41] much much closer to you and I would [37:43] honestly start in [37:44] [Music] [37:46] um I can't believe I've never been this [37:48] crucified in ch ever before it literally [37:52] is hysterical to me right [37:55] now so funny um [37:58] I would take some time to work on uh [38:00] teaching the dog not to pull in a less [38:02] distracting environment so not the woods [38:05] if you are going to go out and give your [38:07] dog you know a little bit of freedom to [38:08] run around and play use the the line but [38:12] perhaps don't have it in your hands or [38:14] don't go for like a half hour walk [38:15] through the woods instead go to the park [38:17] and sort of um move more randomly um [38:22] back and forth and like in a 5550 area [38:25] or whatever it might be don't make me do [38:27] The Meters [38:28] now I wasn't going to um and then once [38:32] you have a little bit more uh Focus then [38:34] you can start to go uh straight when [38:36] you're trying to teach your dogs not to [38:38] pull believe it or not going straight in [38:40] a straight line is absolutely the [38:42] hardest thing it's much better to move [38:44] in a more random pattern so you're a bit [38:46] more unpredictable so it forces the dog [38:48] to have to pay attent pay attention to [38:50] you that's going to be a better way to [38:52] start out um Lou and Frankie we're [38:55] metric here in Australia and I still use [38:56] pounds and ounces for baby weight [38:57] otherwise they don't know the size yeah [38:59] and I think pound the Aussies are much [39:02] like us you know we sort of use them [39:04] interchangeably uh honestly I a th% [39:08] thought I was right otherwise I wouldn't [39:10] have come out you so hard got to be [39:11] careful I was I'm probably I mean I was [39:14] right one time like or wrong one time [39:16] four years ago but I and I mean it could [39:18] happen again but it's unlikely oh it [39:20] will I mean I think I'm mostly right oh [39:23] yeah for sure not with sayings though [39:25] that I screw up you're always right when [39:27] it comes the training and I guess that's [39:28] the important part okay ready for this [39:31] one next one Canadians never use metrics [39:33] other than [39:35] kilometers thanks Dan I like uh uh I [39:38] think Dan's on my side Uncle Yukon said [39:40] uh you need to change your leashes and [39:42] long lines when you're cross the [39:44] boorder that's good okay let's get down [39:47] to the training that's really funny you [39:49] ready now what I can start to do is [39:51] teach him how to go to the bed on a [39:53] command now one of the sneaky ways that [39:55] you can do this is just add the command [39:58] that you want to use on your bed to the [40:00] behavior when it's already in action so [40:02] rather than me standing here and saying [40:04] on your bed on your bed on your bed and [40:05] have him look at me like I have three [40:06] heads if he doesn't know I'm going to [40:08] wait for him to go on his [40:10] own on your [40:13] bed that was a bit pre there hey you [40:17] were the thir come here but okay let's [40:19] so what did you do there why did you do [40:21] that like he was taking too long to do [40:22] it and sometimes the dog stalls out yeah [40:25] and and why I why he should [40:27] uh preface he wasn't taking too long to [40:30] do it because he was being naughty he [40:32] was taking too long to do it because he [40:33] doesn't get it he doesn't know what he's [40:35] doing so if he knew what he was doing he [40:38] would have hopped right on that bed [40:39] really quickly so I recognized in that [40:42] moment that it was useless for me to [40:44] continue standing there for 10 years as [40:46] he sniffed the bed he's not he's not [40:48] doing the behavior so sometimes when [40:50] that happens you want to reset so that's [40:52] why I stopped him I'm going to regain [40:54] his attention when I have his full Focus [40:56] then you'll see we try again and you [40:58] mentioned uh taking 10 years uh and and [41:01] here in Canada we use metric time so [41:03] that was do want to change it to days [41:05] that was uh 3610 of an hour uh for all [41:09] of our American friends I'll tell you [41:11] about what I use for temperature in a [41:13] second try something on your bed yes so [41:18] you have to be a bit patient there I'm [41:19] waiting for him to offer and then I can [41:20] reward from there that's so good look at [41:25] you look at you you uh that was really [41:29] good so you could see with a little bit [41:31] more Focus From the puppy I just um I [41:34] didn't lure him with the treats but you [41:36] saw just to get his Focus I just sort of [41:37] showed him that I had the treats and [41:38] then I pulled them away from his nose to [41:41] kind of make him think about doing it a [41:42] bit more um independently that can be a [41:45] good way to reset your puppy if you find [41:46] that you're kind of battling for their [41:49] attention a little bit yeah yeah and [41:50] it's better than just waiting it's [41:52] better than just sort of like waiting [41:54] too long to see uh what's going to [41:56] happen [41:58] um what what temperature do they use in [42:00] the states faight okay so for the [42:04] temperature in the summer I like to use [42:08] Fahrenheit and in the winter I know like [42:12] strangest thing he always get so [42:13] confused and in the winter I like to use [42:15] celsius it's the strangest thing I do we [42:17] just Maggie price one of our heart [42:19] supporters uh really nice comment you [42:23] said I totally recommend the online [42:24] training offered by McAn dogs the help [42:26] the offer is incredible has meant [42:27] everything to our process with our [42:29] 5-month old Border Collie ter border [42:31] terrier Luna megie has worked her little [42:34] butt off with her dogs as well I get [42:37] great updates from instructor Robbie and [42:39] instructor Shannon on you megie all the [42:42] time so we've talked a little bit about [42:45] uh where to start it uh the bed to use [42:47] like what you should be using as that um [42:49] you know Target or whatever the bed that [42:51] you're going to be teaching your dog to [42:52] lie on we've talked about some of the [42:53] uses uh that you should be using this [42:55] for in your home so uh a lot of people [42:58] struggle with doorbell rings or knock [43:00] comes to the door um let's talk a little [43:02] bit about using this exercise in that [43:04] situation it's actually a super common [43:06] one that we'll help our students with [43:08] yeah it's a really good idea to um so [43:11] this can be a helpful exercise for many [43:12] situations but it also can be a great [43:15] one to use in situations where perhaps [43:18] your your dog or your puppy and you can [43:20] do this with dogs too like you don't [43:21] have to do this we're showing you with [43:23] the puppy but if you have a dog that's [43:25] you know a little bit older you can [43:26] still do exactly the same training age [43:28] absolutely doesn't matter here um but [43:31] what you can start to do is condition [43:32] your puppy that or your dog that when [43:34] somebody Rings a doorbell when somebody [43:36] walks up to your front door when [43:38] somebody some dogs when somebody closed [43:41] the car door outside or they knock on [43:43] the door whatever whatever trigger your [43:45] dog is you can actually turn the trigger [43:48] into a queue for going to lie on their [43:51] bed and all you're going to do is don't [43:54] wait for someone to come to your door [43:55] for this you're going to [43:57] yourself you know do the trigger so [44:00] knock on the door and then immediately [44:02] work the on your bed exercise and reward [44:04] your dog and repeat that over and over [44:06] and over again until your dog starts to [44:10] independently um start to move towards [44:12] their to towards their bed without you [44:14] even needing to ask and what's cool [44:17] about this is as soon as somebody Rings [44:19] a doorbell or somebody knocks on the [44:21] door instead of your puppy barking and [44:23] reacting and running towards the door [44:26] they learned that uh another behavior is [44:29] you know equally as rewarding and fun [44:32] but it does take um good timing and [44:34] consistency on your part to practice it [44:36] in a very low stimulating environment uh [44:40] in order for it to work you can't do it [44:42] when the Amazon guy comes or whatever [44:44] you know if you've not done the work to [44:46] lead up to that otherwise the moment's [44:48] just too stimulating you've got to work [44:50] your way up to being able to use it in a [44:52] real life situation we uh here's a [44:55] little secret uh student Studio 905 [44:57] creates all the um Mand dog's uh content [45:01] and uh we were working on a video uh for [45:04] a doorbell dog had a problem with [45:06] doorbells every time the doorbell would [45:08] ring he'd go charging to the door [45:09] barking and jumping and screaming and uh [45:12] so we go to this person's house we shoot [45:14] the video and um it worked brilliantly [45:19] we were doing with working on this [45:21] exercise with instructor Carol showing [45:22] some of the things we're talking about [45:23] here as well as how to incorporate some [45:25] of this training into your everyday the [45:27] dog did it learned it so fast it broke [45:30] the behavior so fast that we didn't have [45:33] a video I know like it was just it was [45:35] just remarkable the video would have [45:36] been 30 seconds long yeah I mean the [45:38] training yeah but the the other thing is [45:40] you know no one could see themselves in [45:42] the situation because the dog I mean the [45:45] right information changes everything [45:47] when you give your dog good information [45:49] and you're consistent about it even when [45:51] you're like setting up situations that [45:53] may have been a nuisance behavior in the [45:54] past if you can do the right tweaks then [45:58] your dog is going to choose the thing [46:00] you want and uh that video never made it [46:02] to uh the Youtube channel it probably [46:04] went I mean there's a bunch of things we [46:07] use our content for repurpose but um [46:10] that was a great example of this skill [46:12] with that situation so if you struggle [46:14] with that knock on the door ringing the [46:16] doorbell car door outside um call your [46:18] buddies and hey somebody uh let me know [46:21] when you arrive or you know family [46:23] member hey when you go to the store [46:25] let's when you're coming back can you [46:27] can we work on this skill with uh you [46:29] know our dog um these are the sorts of [46:32] uh this is the extra effort that you're [46:33] putting in now um that is going to be [46:36] you're going to thank yourself for later [46:38] um but being really intentional but [46:40] working on a skill like this I'll tell [46:41] you it change it changes everything and [46:44] that dog uh would now go to run on his [46:46] bed go to his bed when someone Rings a [46:48] doorbell [46:50] y okay let's jump to this one somebody's [46:52] asking if we have trainers in Florida so [46:55] we don't have any we only have one Lo [46:57] physical location here slam Ontario [47:00] Canada where we use metric system and we [47:02] don't care uh we don't talk about it [47:05] yeah but um we have tons of students [47:08] from Florida on our um our online [47:11] program yeah you would not be [47:15] alone okay let's grab this clip this [47:17] one's going to be important the other [47:18] thing to remember is that if you're [47:20] going to work on having your dog remain [47:22] on a bed and you're going to give them [47:23] something to do like chew on a bone or [47:25] have a Kong make sure your rules about [47:27] staying on the bed still apply so um the [47:30] house line should still be on it can be [47:31] in your hand or under your foot so if [47:33] they decide to wander away and do their [47:34] own thing you can interrupt them and [47:36] bring them back to the bed um same thing [47:38] when they're chewing the item if it [47:39] happens to you know fly off the bed and [47:41] they just go and lie down and chew it [47:43] there don't waste the opportunity to put [47:45] value on the bed stop get the bone get [47:47] the Kong bring it back to the bed make [47:49] this area The Sweet Spot that your dog [47:51] wants to head to all of the time but [47:53] criteria stays the same whether you're [47:55] giving food from your hand or whether [47:56] you're giving them a separate item yeah [47:59] so this someone had mentioned earlier [48:01] about uh you know how do how do you [48:02] increase the duration how do you do this [48:04] so the dog doesn't uh isn't just it's [48:06] not a trick you know they're just [48:07] working for the food yeah that's a good [48:10] question because sorry sorry great you [48:13] had your [48:15] ring um uh yes there are some dogs that [48:20] will um especially if they have a very [48:22] food motivated dog sometimes it turns [48:25] more into [48:27] what appears to be like the dogs doing [48:29] it like a trick because they're not [48:30] lying on the bed in a chill way they're [48:32] lying on the bed like oh my God are you [48:34] going to give me a treat and for those [48:36] dogs and it sounds like the person who [48:38] had asked about this before um the dog [48:41] would even get so impatient that it [48:43] would start barking so in those [48:46] situations if you have a dog that's not [48:47] really their mind isn't really relaxing [48:49] on the bed you want to try and get [48:51] through the steps quickly until you get [48:53] to the one where you can start to link [48:56] than the amount of time in between the [48:59] rewards so for a dog like that I would [49:01] actually reward less provided the dog [49:04] can still remain on the bed but if I'm [49:07] going to do that I might keep my [49:08] distance a little closer so that I can [49:11] have good timing um I also might switch [49:15] to a lower value reward I might use [49:17] their kibble I might use Cheerios [49:19] something that's boring and Bland that [49:22] sort of brings the dog's mind down a [49:24] little bit and um further to that I also [49:27] might incorporate more touch as my [49:30] reward rather than exclusively food if [49:34] you go back and you pet the dog slow [49:37] Strokes you don't want to go back and [49:38] say oh good on your bed that's so great [49:40] just fire the dog up go back good down [49:43] good on your bed nice slow pets to get [49:46] the dog in a more relaxed State and then [49:49] perhaps calmly give them a treat or [49:51] don't if they're like the affection then [49:53] give them a few little Pats and then [49:54] walk away a few steps and then come back [49:56] good that's better um we had one bordic [49:59] col that we had with us for about a year [50:02] or so that we were training for my [50:04] younger brother and she was a very [50:08] highminded not naturally settling dog [50:13] and um she was similar to this she [50:14] wouldn't bark at us but when we were [50:16] using food it sort of became like um [50:19] like tricks like we didn't feed her [50:21] she'd like throw other tricks at it [50:23] she'd drop you know she we taught her to [50:24] drop her head we taught her to win we T [50:27] her to cross her PA those types of [50:28] things so if we didn't give her a treat [50:29] she's like well clearly lying here still [50:32] can't be the only thing you're asking me [50:33] for how about this how about this how [50:35] about this and um what actually worked [50:38] well for her is um I would sit at the [50:41] either the dining room table or my my [50:43] desk or whatever it might be I would [50:45] pull the dog bed over I would put her on [50:47] leash I would put the leash under my [50:49] foot or I'd sit on the leash so she had [50:52] like one two feet of area to move and um [50:56] I would just encourage her to go down on [50:58] the bed and I would pet her from time to [51:00] time and if she got up off the bed I [51:02] would just place her back down again and [51:04] then I would just sort of ignore her [51:06] although I was paying very close [51:08] attention to her but the more I engaged [51:10] with her the more she was like too [51:13] excitable and it took the first time [51:15] that I did it probably 15 to 20 minutes [51:18] for her to act go oh wait a second are [51:20] we not doing anything here before she [51:22] actually would like lie down and like [51:24] almost fall asleep and have a nap um I [51:28] don't think I've ever had a dog wait [51:29] that long to do that but it helped her [51:32] immensely um with that exercise because [51:35] it was just a different way of going at [51:36] it so again there's all kinds of [51:38] different ways that we can do things [51:39] with dogs it really just depends on what [51:42] that particular dog needs and that's why [51:45] um training is so important that's why [51:47] training with guidance and coaching is [51:49] so important because when one cookie [51:52] cutter method isn't working for you and [51:53] your dog we can say you know what your [51:56] dog May needs this little bit or your [51:58] dog really needs this little bit and [52:00] because we can work through that um it's [52:02] a lot easier to kind of get to where [52:04] your goal is even though it might be [52:06] different than somebody else and you [52:07] know to this point jenet says when can I [52:09] just snuggle on the coach or do I need [52:10] to be training 100% of the time this is [52:13] a great question this is exactly this is [52:15] exactly why we're working on exercises [52:17] like this when we talk about leadership [52:19] a grade on your bed is a good indication [52:21] that your dog gets it you know they they [52:24] get all they're going to have some uh [52:26] more luxury in life they're going to get [52:27] more opportunities to do more with you [52:29] because they understand that they need [52:31] to listen and they can work when they [52:32] need to and they can just be a happy [52:34] go-lucky family member that can go more [52:36] places with you um but uh W before you [52:40] know as you're training this thing um as [52:43] you're working on a skill like this your [52:45] criteria is very clear uh go lie in your [52:47] bed you're working on that training [52:49] exercis slowly You're Building distance [52:51] and duration Etc your dog's learning to [52:53] stay there more time but when they're [52:55] starting to get this skill uh as an [52:57] example when they understand that [52:59] they're only they can only come up when [53:00] they're invited up and they need to get [53:02] off when you say hey buddy get off we're [53:03] going to go into the kitchen now or [53:04] something um that's when you can you [53:07] should be hanging out with your dog on [53:09] the couch that's when that's what we're [53:11] working towards yeah you absolutely can [53:13] have snuggles times on a couch we we you [53:15] know I do that with my dogs all the time [53:17] I do that with my puppies too um but I [53:20] will do it only I will only give them [53:23] the opportunity to get up you know near [53:25] my face and you know that type of thing [53:29] when you know my puppy's aren't nipping [53:31] me anymore my my puppy is listening [53:33] pretty well and you know if you do [53:35] things right that doesn't take very long [53:37] to get there we're not talking you know [53:39] six seven eight months old it could be [53:42] within a couple weeks but you've got to [53:43] be doing the right things with the puppy [53:45] because if you're getting nipping and [53:47] biting if you're getting a puppy that's [53:48] pushing boundaries and then you're also [53:50] bluring the lines by giving them all of [53:52] these luxuries of freedom and elevation [53:54] in your house and opportunity to get get [53:56] near your face where they're snuggling [53:58] all a sudden the next thing you know [53:59] they're you know biting at your chin or [54:00] grabbing your ponytail that's you [54:02] blurring the lines for your puppy and [54:05] that's not a great way for them to learn [54:07] what to do so you know we don't want to [54:10] put an age limit on when you can do [54:13] something with your puppy totally [54:15] because the better dog trainer you are [54:17] and the better information you give your [54:19] dog the earlier you get to do all the [54:22] fun stuff the earlier you get to give [54:24] your puppy Freedom the earlier you get [54:26] to hand everything to your dog on a [54:28] silver plow our dogs are so freaking [54:30] spoiled it's ridiculous but in return we [54:34] have dogs that listen very very very [54:37] well to us so I am happy to give [54:40] everything to them on a silver Potter [54:42] because when I call them when I tell [54:43] them not to jump up when I do all those [54:45] things they they listen happily um and [54:49] you can get there quickly if you do the [54:51] work so it's not really about the age [54:55] it's about what are you doing in order [54:57] to get yourself there faster yeah yeah [54:59] it's not about the age it's about the [55:00] stage you know how how much do they [55:02] understand uh that is important you just [55:04] make that up right now I think I've used [55:06] it before but it did come to mind and [55:08] it's it's working on skills like this [55:09] that can actually change your dog's Liv [55:11] it can get you to that Finish Line [55:13] faster that will allow you to have more [55:15] fun with your dog and I love where your [55:17] head is uh on that kale of course um I [55:21] know that someone mentioned Canada days [55:23] coming up uh this weekend yeah uh July [55:25] 4th for our American friends is just [55:28] around the corner and that involves [55:30] fireworks and we have some sound [55:32] sensitive dogs yeah we have some sound [55:34] sensitive dogs we do and a few years ago [55:37] we were on a uh trip with one of our [55:39] sound sensitive dogs and we were [55:41] struggling because she was a little bit [55:43] on edge the whole time so what we did [55:45] when we got back is we started working [55:47] with music creators in the digital space [55:49] to create music for dogs it's called [55:51] McAn dogs music we actually have [55:53] playlists that were generated [55:54] specifically for thunder and [55:56] specifically for fireworks because it's [55:59] these are much lower tones I mean I [56:01] don't understand the musical science [56:02] behind a lot of it but we also have all [56:04] sorts of uh relaxing uh um music that [56:08] fills the your room with space or fills [56:10] your space with music and um you know I [56:13] couldn't be more proud of the thing of [56:15] the the product I literally listen to it [56:17] without my dog while I'm working yeah [56:19] it's like funny story so uh I came in to [56:21] the living room one day when we were at

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 99/199,~Ken #mccanndogs #dogtraining === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] it is not uncommon at all for people to [00:01] think that their dogs aren't food [00:03] motivated but what if I was to tell you [00:05] that it's not so much about your dog not [00:07] being food motivated and more about the [00:08] things you're doing in everyday life [00:10] that's teaching your dog not to take the [00:12] treats in this video instructor Meg is [00:14] going to break down exactly what those [00:16] mistakes are that you're making and how [00:17] to get your dog more food motivated so [00:19] you can get back to amazing training I'm [00:22] Dan welcome back to McAn [00:24] [Music] [00:27] dogs stop overfeeding your dog if you [00:30] are offering your dog food they are [00:32] leaving food in their dish and are no [00:34] longer interested in it you are killing [00:36] your dog's food drive so when I offer my [00:39] dog treats when I offer my dog food I [00:41] expect them to eat it even for young [00:43] dogs we do not want to have uh a dog [00:46] that is uninterested in eating because [00:48] you have given them too much when I feed [00:50] a meal I'm going to measure that very [00:53] carefully and I don't give my dog any [00:55] extras throughout the day it's very [00:57] important that you don't have an [00:58] overweight dog if you have a dog that is [01:01] overfed it's going to make them far less [01:04] likely to find that that food to be of [01:06] value and they're not going to work for [01:08] you because they're not hungry we want [01:11] to have a hungry dog that's going to [01:13] make them significantly easier to train [01:16] Plus for their health it's very [01:18] important even from a young age that we [01:21] do not let them get overweight every [01:23] dog's different so for some dogs like a [01:25] golden retriever they would probably eat [01:28] plain old kibble every single day of [01:29] their lives most of them anyway other [01:32] dogs tend to be a little bit pickier so [01:34] I do think that it is extremely [01:36] important that you have a hierarchy of [01:39] rewards so I know for my dogs one of my [01:42] goals when they're baby puppies is deter [01:44] is to determine what is like a level one [01:47] or a level two reward what is like a [01:50] middle of the- Pack level five reward [01:52] and what will they do anything for what [01:55] is their number 10 but where a lot of [01:58] people go wrong is they offer the number [02:00] 10 all the time until the dog no longer [02:03] cares about it it would be like if you [02:05] had chocolate cake every single day [02:07] breakfast lunch and dinner after a while [02:09] you kind of get sick of chocolate cake [02:11] so I like to have a variety of rewards [02:14] that I know they will work for in low [02:17] distraction environments a variety of [02:19] rewards that they'll work for in medium [02:21] or a middle of the- pack uh at [02:23] distractions but then I need to know [02:25] that I have a number of these number 10 [02:28] rewards that I can rely on when things [02:30] are really really tough you need to find [02:34] the time of day or the environment or [02:36] the reward which they do care about or [02:39] changing the way that you do reward them [02:41] so for example I know that my young [02:43] puppy who's not terribly food food [02:45] motivated that has a very small stomach [02:48] is not going to take food when we are in [02:52] a distracting environment I do know that [02:55] he will take food two or three times a [02:57] day when he's really hungry in [03:00] environments that we have already worked [03:02] in and that he's successful in I [03:04] actually would start out with a puppy [03:05] that said I'm not interested in food I [03:08] would start in the bathroom I would [03:09] start in the most boring room of your [03:11] house where there's no distractions and [03:13] there's no options for outside uh [03:15] distractions to come bug your training [03:17] session and I would try to find any [03:20] behavior that they could do that I could [03:21] reward so maybe it's something as simple [03:24] as they voluntarily look at me I would [03:26] say yes and feed that if they don't want [03:29] to take the food sometimes you can [03:31] stimulate it by even saying yes and [03:34] tossing the food by moving the cookie [03:36] that way it can actually make it a [03:37] little bit more exciting uh I will see [03:39] if I can um move the treat around a [03:42] little bit I will mix it with something [03:44] that's maybe even higher uh value if I [03:47] need to but I would say the most [03:49] important thing is finding any [03:52] environment that they will take food in [03:54] and only practice there until you can [03:57] reliably predict that they're going to [04:00] take the treat from you I don't want to [04:02] offer a treat or a meal anything to my [04:06] dog if I think that they're going to say [04:09] me I'm not interested I don't want to [04:12] allow them to rehearse that so until I'm [04:15] confident they will take that treat in [04:16] that environment I don't train there I [04:19] only train in the environments where I [04:20] know I can be successful all these [04:23] Concepts that Meg's talking about in [04:24] this video are things that we cover in [04:26] our online and inperson dog training [04:28] programs so make sure you check check [04:29] out our website [04:31] www.

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 101/199,com to find out which program is [04:34] perfect for you and your dog so uh my [04:37] little 7B puppy has never really been [04:41] fed um any food out of a food bowl for [04:43] the most part almost every single reward [04:47] uh or food item that he's ever gotten [04:49] has been from me from my hand and the [04:52] reason for that is when your dog only [04:54] eats like a quarter of a cup at a meal [04:57] that's my entire training session for [04:58] the morning I'm going to use every [05:00] little bit of his food for our training [05:03] to build that relationship to build that [05:05] engagement so I don't give a lot of [05:08] structured meals if any to a small dog [05:11] and I only train him for probably about [05:14] 2 or 3 minutes at a time I think the max [05:17] amount of time that he's ever been [05:18] trained for uh for the last couple of [05:20] months has been about 5 minutes and [05:24] because of that he has rehearsed taking [05:27] the treats being hungry I actually try [05:30] to feed him often after we've had some [05:32] exercise as well so I will play with him [05:35] engage with him uh take him on a nice [05:37] long hike and I make sure that he's [05:39] really hungry and then I do the training [05:41] session with him a lot of dogs don't [05:44] have enough food drive because they [05:45] don't get enough activity and uh Andor [05:48] stimulation so I try to make sure that I [05:52] offer only food from my hand and I make [05:55] sure that he is in a state where he is [05:57] absolutely starving when I offer it are [05:59] you you free feeding your dog and what [06:01] that looks like is a bowl a dish put [06:04] down for your dog all day long and you [06:07] might put the food down and have it [06:09] completely full at all times or perhaps [06:11] you do measure out their given meals [06:13] their breakfast and their dinners but [06:15] you put the food in the bowl walk away [06:17] and again the dog can pick and choose [06:19] when they want to eat that food the [06:22] problem with that is that when you have [06:24] food available at all times the dog [06:27] doesn't see that food as value [06:30] it's something that they have access to [06:31] whenever they want so why would they [06:34] work hard for something that they can [06:35] take whenever they want to we never [06:38] freef feed our dogs we only give our [06:41] dogs our structured meals if I'm [06:43] training I'll even take some of their [06:45] food from their meal and I'll put it in [06:46] my pocket and that's the training treats [06:48] that I use for my puppy throughout the [06:49] day at my home the rest of their meal [06:51] they can have in their bowl but even [06:53] where I feed them their meals is [06:55] important I don't take food put it in a [06:58] dish and put it on the floor in my house [07:00] when I have a young puppy I take that [07:02] food and I put them in their crate two [07:05] things from this it helps to build value [07:07] for the crate so they say wow the [07:08] crate's a really great place I get all [07:10] of these really great treats or food [07:12] from there but it also ensures that the [07:15] dog doesn't have the option of having a [07:18] little bit of food maybe a couple of [07:19] bites and then choosing to walk away [07:21] they get that food for maybe five [07:23] minutes while I'm making my breakfast or [07:25] my morning coffee maybe even 10 minutes [07:28] if I get distracted with the kids but [07:30] then when I choose to I'll come back to [07:32] the crate I will open it up take that [07:34] dish out and that's the last that [07:36] they're getting of that meal until the [07:38] next time I offer them food I might [07:40] offer them food again in a meal form or [07:42] it might be in a training form but they [07:44] don't get to just graze on that meal and [07:46] walk away from it that's going to [07:48] decrease their value or work ethic for [07:51] that food that you're offering now that [07:53] you've learned how to unlock your dog's [07:54] drive for food it's important to unlock [07:56] their drive for toys and to do that [07:58] you're going to watch check out that [07:59] video right there and on that note I'm [08:02] Dan happy training ================================================== CONTENU DE: 2024-06-29_Is_Your_Dog_Stubborn__Leash_Walking_Mistake__7.

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 116/199,~Ken === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] if anybody's ever told you that house [00:01] training your puppy is easy well they've [00:04] lied to you you can have the best plan [00:06] in the world but if you making some of [00:08] the common mistakes that a lot of people [00:09] make with house training it's really [00:11] going to set you back so today I'm going [00:12] to talk to you about all of those [00:14] mistakes so that you can avoid them I'm [00:16] K mccan welcome back to mccan [00:19] [Music] [00:21] dogs the first one is having poor timing [00:24] so I mentioned this before but a lot of [00:26] times people are giving their puppies so [00:28] much Freedom that it's so easy for them [00:30] to sneak off and have an accident [00:32] without us seeing um or they're just not [00:34] able to read the sign sometimes it the [00:37] process of teaching your puppy to [00:39] indicate to you when they have to go out [00:41] is missed because we're just not paying [00:43] attention or we don't have the puppy [00:44] close enough to you um if you play your [00:47] cards right you can teach your puppy how [00:49] to ask you to go outside within just a [00:50] couple weeks of them being home the [00:52] process really isn't difficult if you're [00:54] consistent and you are actually watching [00:56] your puppy um the other thing that [00:59] people will often do is have poor timing [01:01] so um if your puppy does have an [01:04] accident and you see it I've had some [01:06] people say to me well my puppy knows he [01:08] was wrong because when I walked in and I [01:10] saw the accident on the floor he put his [01:12] ears back and he slinked away he knew he [01:14] was wrong and I chuckle to myself when I [01:17] hear that because you know people just [01:19] really don't understand how dogs think [01:21] they really think in the moment and [01:22] another thing people forget is that dogs [01:24] even young baby puppies they read humans [01:28] better than anybody else else and when [01:30] you walk in and you see an accident on [01:32] the floor and you clench your fists or [01:33] you sigh or you swear or however you [01:36] react your puppy's not dumb they'll put [01:38] their ears back and go uhoh mom's mad [01:40] they don't know why but they can read [01:42] you and their reaction is more to your [01:44] body language and your emotion they [01:46] don't say to themselves oh four hours [01:48] ago I peed on the carpet and now you [01:51] know they're mad at me for that they [01:53] just they don't understand those types [01:55] of things they really do live in the [01:56] moment so it is important that if your [01:59] puppy as an accident you know after the [02:01] fact you don't go and rub your puppy's [02:03] nose in it or do anything like that you [02:05] know it's just sort of cruel to the [02:07] puppy because they truly don't [02:09] understand unless you catch them right [02:10] where they're going um right when [02:13] they're going excuse me uh it's just [02:15] your loss basically you need to be a [02:17] better supervisor for the next time now [02:19] this might be an unpopular um opinion [02:22] but one of the things that I would never [02:24] do with my puppies if I was teaching uh [02:26] house training is I would never use a [02:28] pead with them um you know often when [02:31] you get a puppy home from their litter [02:33] however um the breeder would have done [02:35] some initial house training with them [02:37] could have been with PE pads it could [02:38] have been with shavings it could have [02:40] been with newspaper um you know they're [02:43] being brought to your house in a in a [02:44] completely different scenario so that's [02:46] actually the best time to uh show them [02:48] something new sometimes if you go right [02:51] to PE pads and you put the pee pad by [02:53] the door or whatever it might be it can [02:55] be a little bit confusing for your puppy [02:57] to understand that it's okay for them to [02:58] go inside um in one area but then not [03:02] okay to go inside in other areas really [03:05] the best thing to do is just cut cold [03:06] turkey and go right away to teaching [03:09] your puppy to go out the only time I [03:11] might um suggest a pea pad situation [03:14] would be somebody who's living in an [03:15] apartment building and I would then have [03:17] them put the pead like on the patio [03:19] outside I wouldn't actually have it [03:21] inside um the house now if you're [03:22] thinking to yourself oh boy I've been [03:24] using PE pads now what am I supposed to [03:26] do if I've screwed everything up um [03:28] Don't Panic you're just going to um move [03:31] the ppad to outside the door for now and [03:34] you're going to go through the same [03:35] process that I've talked about uh [03:36] earlier in the video catch them in the [03:38] ACT if they look like they look if they [03:40] look like they have to go outside I'm [03:41] going to then take them outside either [03:43] put them on the pead outside or I'm [03:44] going to take them to grassp right away [03:46] you're just going to basically it might [03:48] be a tough couple days for them to [03:49] transition but then you'll be a way to [03:51] the races um but I would not suggest [03:53] going that route um you know you can [03:55] teach your puppy to indicate by going to [03:57] the door or coming to find you much more [03:59] easily and the process can be a lot [04:01] faster another common um question that I [04:04] will often get is when people have a [04:06] puppy whove had an accident they've [04:08] caught them in the ACT they've done all [04:09] the good things they've taken them [04:10] outside they want them to finish their [04:12] business outside they take the puppy [04:14] outside and now the puppy won't go [04:15] either they're like stunned on what just [04:17] happened 5 seconds ago or they're a [04:19] typical puppy and they get outside and [04:20] they just want to party um and then [04:22] people will bring them in you know to [04:24] moments of coming inside the puppy [04:26] squats and have has an accident inside [04:28] the house and I can imagine [04:30] just how frustrating that would be as a [04:32] dog owner but you know puppies have a [04:34] very small attention span and you know [04:36] if you know that your puppy has to go [04:39] don't bring them in and just let them [04:41] have the freedom because the likelihood [04:43] of them having an accident at that point [04:44] is very very high a better thing to do [04:47] is to take them out if they won't go [04:49] then bring them right back inside and [04:51] immediately put them in their crate not [04:53] in a in a punishment type of way just in [04:56] a you're are going to hold out and hang [04:57] out here for a few minutes let the [04:59] puppies settle let their mind settle let [05:01] them get a little bit more calm and then [05:03] take them outside just a few minutes [05:04] later and and just pop the house line on [05:07] take them right outside keep things very [05:09] very calm and most often than not the [05:11] puppy will will go to the bathroom or [05:13] will have a a PE a poo at that point um [05:16] right away but you know if you know they [05:18] have to go don't give them the [05:20] opportunity to have an accident use the [05:21] crate as sort of that that little um [05:24] momentary hold between going outside um [05:28] you know the first time and the second [05:29] time that will really really help but [05:31] it's not uncommon for puppies to come [05:33] inside and now that the distraction [05:35] level is smaller all of a sudden they go [05:36] oh wait I do have to go to the bathroom [05:38] I do have to pee and then they just [05:40] squat right then and there so sometimes [05:42] you have to play a little bit of a game [05:43] with them by going in and out but soon [05:45] or later you'll get them on the right [05:47] track I've talked about using the crate [05:49] as a form of um controlling the amount [05:53] that you have to supervise them it would [05:54] be nice to be able to put them in the [05:55] crate and then they're out of side out [05:57] of mind and you can do all the things [05:58] you need to do and not have to to worry [05:59] about them typically speaking most [06:01] puppies are not going to have an [06:03] accident in the crate but it does happen [06:05] I've owned several puppies that have had [06:07] accidents in the crate over the years [06:09] and there's a couple things that you can [06:10] do to help prevent this um number one [06:13] look oh that looks like a fun toy bring [06:15] that to me um number one is make sure [06:18] that your crate is appropriately sized [06:20] so if your crate when your puppy is [06:22] quite small is too large sometimes what [06:24] puppies will do is they'll go to the uh [06:26] bathroom they'll have an accident at one [06:28] end of the crate and then they still [06:29] have the other half of the crate that's [06:31] clean and you know nice to play in or [06:33] sleep in typically puppies do not want [06:36] to have a messy Den um so have the [06:38] crates small enough that your puppy can [06:40] lie down comfortably they can lay and [06:42] stretch their their legs out they can [06:44] stand up and the crate's not going to [06:45] top touch the top of their head and then [06:47] that's about it now once you're through [06:49] the house training process you can give [06:50] your dog the biggest crate in the world [06:52] if you want to but for house training [06:54] through that process having a smaller [06:55] crate can be ideal the other thing that [06:58] is really helpful [07:00] to get through any accidents in the [07:01] crate is take out any absorbent material [07:04] that might be in there so if you have [07:05] beds um stuffed animal toys things like [07:08] that remove that number one it could be [07:10] a chewing Hazard and that's a whole [07:11] other video um but sometimes what [07:14] puppies will do is they'll they'll pee [07:15] on soil on the the bedding and then [07:18] they'll push it off the side and again [07:19] they still have a nice clean bed so um I [07:21] know it sounds like absolutely torture [07:23] to have your puppy sleep on like a metal [07:25] tray or plastic bottom but um it's they [07:29] don't don't really care in fact I've had [07:30] some puppies like the coolness of that [07:32] and they will actually push their [07:33] bedding off to the side on their own um [07:35] it's not long lived but if your puppy is [07:37] having accidents in the crate that is [07:39] definitely something that I would [07:40] suggest that you do is remove the [07:41] bedding from there um and then of course [07:43] if it's really bad that you might need [07:45] to uh to supervise them a little bit in [07:47] the crate and again be good about [07:48] knowing when your puppy has to go out um [07:51] acknowledge if they're making noise in [07:53] the crate use your gut as to whether you [07:55] are they asking you to to take them out [07:57] or are they just being a little bit of a [07:59] brat making noise in the crate you have [08:01] to kind of use your gut feeling for that [08:03] but the crate should be a place where [08:04] you can take send them and have them lay [08:07] so that it's their place to be calm and [08:08] relaxed um it should be their their you [08:11] know lovely Den that they feel great [08:13] about um but if you're having accidents [08:14] remove the bedding keep the crate small [08:16] those are two things it can often be a [08:18] really quick fix for [08:19] you I would say that the um majority of [08:23] um reasoning behind puppies still having [08:26] accidents in the house is absolutely [08:29] like of supervision and um lots of times [08:32] people think that they're supervising [08:33] their puppy but they're multitasking and [08:35] they're not really paying attention um [08:37] you know if your puppy is still being [08:39] able to have an accident here and there [08:42] uh it really comes down to you being a [08:44] better supervisor and it is important [08:47] that you um that you're being really [08:50] really good at this and if you are a [08:51] good supervisor they might try they [08:53] might have an accident once or twice in [08:55] your presence but if you have great time [08:57] you can catch them you're going to stop [08:58] that so quickly but you know supervising [09:01] means active two eyeballs on the puppy [09:04] that's what supervision means it doesn't [09:06] mean that they're in the same room while [09:07] you're watching TV or you're talking to [09:09] your friend on the phone or you're [09:11] cooking dinner or whatever it might be [09:13] if your puppy is you know not being [09:15] actively engag with you it's really easy [09:17] for them to show signs and you know it [09:19] could be that you're helping your kids [09:21] with homework or you're talking on the [09:22] phone and your puppy actually has gone [09:24] to the door two or three times you've [09:26] completely been oblivious to it because [09:27] you're busy and now the puppy's had an [09:29] accident in front of the door or [09:30] somewhere in the house and now you're [09:31] upset with them and you know maybe they [09:33] they showed you that they had to go [09:35] outside a little bit earlier so it is [09:37] important that you supervise them and [09:38] remember this stuff does not go on for a [09:41] long period of time you can get house [09:43] training really rocking and rolling very [09:45] very early and then you don't need to be [09:47] quite so crazy about supervising their [09:49] every single move but if you don't do it [09:51] well in the first couple weeks that your [09:53] puppy is home it can be really hard to [09:55] break those habits you know it's up to [09:57] us to kind of show and mold our puppy [09:59] into how we want them to learn about [10:02] this and the number one thing that you [10:04] need to be good at is supervising them [10:06] today we talked a lot about house [10:08] training and how a lot of the problems [10:09] are caused because of lack of [10:11] supervision so to find out whether you [10:13] are giving your puppy too much freedom [10:15] and perhaps you're not the best [10:16] supervisor

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 130/199,~Ken #dogtraining #mccanndogs === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] okay so um I see lots of Link exp menion [00:03] somebody's officially snoring uh that's [00:06] Sam CAW oh I [00:08] see classic Sam okay so um what's [00:12] interesting about this is that only you [00:15] guys who are here for the live show [00:16] we'll get to see what's happened up [00:18] until this point so now we're diving [00:20] into the uh video on demand we're going [00:21] to dive into some of the content uh and [00:24] if you are watching this as a replay you [00:26] missed out on all the fun stuff where I [00:28] actually talked about the greatest food [00:30] on Earth and uh whether or not [00:33] you kale was sang a song and danced same [00:36] time yeah I'm that talented when we talk [00:39] about leadership one of the most [00:41] impactful things whether you have a [00:43] puppy a young dog in training or even [00:45] like an an adult dog who you know you're [00:47] just trying to brush up fix up speed up [00:50] some of those skills um one of the most [00:53] important things that you need to be [00:54] mindful of is supervision this is [00:57] without a question the secret [01:00] to faster training to better puppy [01:03] training especially when we're talking [01:05] about a puppy or a young dog that [01:06] doesn't have any skills or background [01:09] supervision is so critical um if you [01:11] don't see the mistakes happen you can't [01:14] fix them and and so many people talk [01:16] about like well your dog he knew it you [01:17] know I came home he pooped in the corner [01:19] he knew it you know he could just tell [01:21] that's not the case and um you've [01:24] actually in that instance if you your [01:26] your dog has an accident in your home [01:28] and you don't catch them in the act [01:29] you've missed a great training [01:31] opportunity catching them in the ACT is [01:32] really important but this also applies [01:34] to things like barking chewing uh to be [01:38] honest anything even outside you know [01:41] when you're uh you're struggling maybe [01:43] your dog's digging in the garden uh or [01:45] or something like that supervision is [01:47] critical when you have that dog in [01:49] training if you have any expectation of [01:51] your dog having offleash skills or even [01:53] really caring about what you have to say [01:55] you need to be supervising because [01:57] timing is important we talk a little bit [01:58] about supervising uh when it comes to [02:00] you know having that young dog in [02:02] training and really wanting to have uh [02:04] Snappy responses yeah I think that [02:07] sometimes people need to learn a little [02:09] bit about maybe some supervision tactics [02:11] because sometimes people think that [02:13] they're supervising their dog but maybe [02:15] they're multi tasking maybe their mind [02:17] is on something a little bit different [02:19] and they don't actually see their dog [02:21] you know eating that thing or getting [02:23] into that thing or chewing that thing or [02:24] whatever it might be so supervision is [02:26] really important um obviously you can [02:28] probably imagine we're big lovers of [02:31] crate training and utilizing the crate [02:33] for times where we can't supervise very [02:35] well um we try our best when we are [02:37] raising a dog um that we don't only use [02:41] a crate when we're going to leave or go [02:43] to sleep and teach that dog that the [02:45] crate is something that makes us go away [02:47] from them we use the crate in times [02:49] where you know we have to jump in the [02:51] shower we have to cook dinner we have to [02:52] do things that we know I can't put my [02:54] full focus on my puppy right now so I'll [02:57] just you know happily put them in their [02:58] crate for that that little time um and [03:01] then as the puppy gets home for a few [03:03] weeks and you get a little bit more [03:04] comfortable we want to leave the puppy [03:06] out of the crate to spend a little bit [03:08] more time with the family um we'll do [03:11] two things that will restrict the dog's [03:13] ability to get into as much trouble [03:16] number one the puppy is never without a [03:19] house line attached to their collar okay [03:21] in fact uh lots of links uh sent me back [03:25] to the studio before i h on the train [03:27] with an actual house line [03:30] to don't underestimate the value of [03:32] something as simple as this so yes it [03:35] looks like a leash but what's different [03:37] about these is we the material that we [03:39] use is very lightweight um and there's [03:42] no handle on the end so you don't [03:43] actually walk your dog on this it's a [03:46] material that's you know designed to [03:48] move around your house behind your dog [03:50] to slip and slide around the house um we [03:53] also have it designed with this white [03:54] line down the middle and the dirtier the [03:57] line the better dog trainer you are [04:01] because that means it's spending more [04:02] time on your dog if this is crispy white [04:06] we know you're not using it as much as [04:08] you should um so this line is really [04:10] important okay just to Sor to because I [04:12] think this is a perfect segue into [04:13] talking about supervision and using [04:15] something like a house line or or your [04:16] dog wearing a leash or something in the [04:18] house [04:20] um we we we often get people who will [04:23] say like oh I tried using a house line [04:24] with my puppy but he just chews through [04:26] it that is the perfect indication that [04:29] you aren't supervising enough because [04:32] address it yeah catching your puppy in [04:33] the ACT is exactly what you need to do [04:35] because of course it's going to feel uh [04:37] like it's a toy you've just attached to [04:39] your dog and they're now they're [04:40] dragging around this fun little chew toy [04:42] all over the place but um catching them [04:44] in the ACT stopping them and then [04:46] getting them to work a little bit maybe [04:47] you work on a Sit maybe you work on a go [04:49] lie down and then giving them something [04:50] that they are allowed to chew on is [04:52] exactly the kind of steps exactly the [04:55] kind of leadership that supervision can [04:57] really like speed up it's one of these [05:00] honestly at the more I see comments on [05:02] our YouTube videos and see some of the [05:03] communication back and forth with the [05:05] new dog owners it's one of the things [05:07] that dog owners just or dog trainers [05:10] just get and when you get little wins [05:13] like this uh boy oh boy does it change [05:15] the training relationship yeah um and [05:17] the thing is like whether they chew the [05:19] house line it's the we treat it the same [05:21] way as if they were chewing your shoes [05:23] they were chewing your table leg you [05:25] know we just we just address it the same [05:26] way we would do all of those other [05:28] things so the house Line's really [05:29] important [05:30] the other thing that we do is we use [05:31] baby gates for our puppies so you know [05:34] if we're cooking dinner for example and [05:36] you know both of us are in the kitchen [05:38] and we're whatever going to have dinner [05:39] together one of us will be on puppy Duty [05:41] one of us will be cooking and we'll baby [05:44] gate the um puppy in the the kitchen so [05:47] that they can't sneak out and get into [05:49] our dining room and you know chew on the [05:51] couch or eat the corners of the carpets [05:54] or go to the bathroom whatever the [05:56] situation might be that we restrict them [05:58] so they are always in in the same room [06:00] that we're in and just makes it easier [06:01] for us to supervise them um so that's [06:04] going to be really really important and [06:05] what's nice is as your dog starts to [06:07] learn the rules of the H the house a [06:09] little bit more they start to make [06:10] matter choices then it's easier for you [06:13] to wean off of how much time you're [06:14] using the crate it's easier to then [06:17] maybe give them a bit more Freedom by [06:19] have giving them a little bit more [06:20] access to the house or perhaps you know [06:22] can wean off of not wearing the house [06:24] line so all of these are tools that [06:26] we're using while our dogs are in [06:28] training and don't be surprised is um [06:30] you know we often refer to doing this as [06:32] puppies because we we want you to start [06:34] this while your dogs are puppies puppies [06:36] but um we do exactly the same steps with [06:40] people who come to us with you know [06:41] eight-month old dogs or 12-month old [06:43] dogs that are making poor choices in the [06:46] house we do exactly the same steps with [06:49] the you know those older dogs um as we [06:51] do puppies it's all the same thing so [06:53] don't get too hung up on age yeah I [06:55] think that's actually a really important [06:56] Point um what you need to understand is [06:58] that your dog is learning all the time [07:01] and whether they are a uh an 8 week old [07:04] puppy or an 8-year-old new dog in your [07:07] house what they what their you know [07:10] their experience whether it's good or [07:12] bad is going to influence the choices [07:13] that they make next time so you want to [07:15] make sure as a great leader you are [07:17] letting them know when they're making [07:18] the wrong choice that you are there to [07:20] acknowledge the good choices that they [07:22] make it's funny when we uh you know [07:25] sometimes our dogs dogs young dogs when [07:27] they're in training they'll like go and [07:29] lie down on a bed and we'll always tell [07:32] them exact what a great job you know [07:34] Mark those moments really let them know [07:36] that what a good choice buddy maybe [07:37] we're and we can do that because we're [07:39] supervising because you're supervising [07:41] because you have your eyes on your dog [07:42] all the time so you know um if if your [07:45] dog is making mistakes in your house [07:48] your your puppy's chewing on their house [07:49] line and they're doing it because it [07:51] feels good without information that [07:53] that's the wrong thing they're going to [07:54] think that's the right thing supervision [07:56] is the moment is the um is the strategy [07:59] that's going to allow you to tell them [08:01] that hey buddy that's not what we want [08:02] here why don't you go lie down over here [08:04] and maybe you can chew on a bone maybe [08:05] we can work on some tricks or something [08:07] like that but uh supervision is the key [08:10] and um because it allows you to have [08:12] great timing [08:14] but supervision can be really difficult [08:17] if because you know your puppy's with [08:19] you 24 hours a day you have a life to [08:22] lead you know you can't be eyes on your [08:24] dog all the time because that's what [08:25] supervision means we want you we're [08:26] talking about watching your dog watching [08:29] your pupp in training um and that's [08:31] where management comes in kale talked a [08:33] little bit about management and uh the [08:36] value that something like a houseline [08:39] can have you know we've talked a lot [08:40] previously about you know you can get a [08:42] leash at the dollar store uh and cut cut [08:44] the loop off it you know regardless of [08:46] your the size of dog you find an [08:47] appropriate size leash cut the loop off [08:49] now your dog drags around the house um [08:51] these are our McAn uh puppy house lines [08:54] but um you know you could you could [08:56] decide that to use something [08:57] comparable that's just in in the house [09:00] kale talked about the crate what are you [09:02] what what are you doing when you have to [09:03] leave the room you have to go you know [09:05] to work you have to go to the store you [09:07] know you can't have your eyes on your [09:08] puppy all the time crate is a nice [09:10] option for that baby gates controlling [09:13] the space that they have access to if [09:14] you're struggling with house training if [09:15] you're struggling with uh your dog [09:17] chewing on things baby gates are a [09:20] savior you know you don't have to be uh [09:24] making sure your puppy doesn't go into [09:25] the living room doesn't go upstairs it's [09:27] uh it allows you to um you know take it [09:31] a little more easy but those aren't the [09:33] only management tools that we use in our [09:36] training in fact uh there are a few more [09:38] what are the things are we using for [09:39] management that is so specific to um you [09:43] know getting well-timed information or [09:45] not allowing your dog to make [09:46] mistakes I don't know and you're trying [09:49] to set me up but I don't know what you [09:50] mean I'll tell you oh okay something [09:53] like a weird set up something like a [09:55] long line uh especially when we're going [09:57] outside to take our dog outside to uh [09:59] these long long lines to go PE or poo uh [10:02] something like a long line having a [10:03] leash or a line like yeah this one's in [10:07] fact 21 ft it's our Mand dog's brand new [10:09] 21 foot Mand dog's long line let's talk [10:12] about using a long line when we take our [10:13] dogs out uh to go yeah I really really [10:18] like using long lines outside for uh [10:21] dogs who are in training of any age and [10:23] I specifically like it because my goal [10:25] down the road with all of my dogs is [10:27] that they don't pull on a leash and that [10:29] they learn to have good leash respect [10:31] and when you have a untrained dog that's [10:34] energetic and you try to take them [10:36] outside to go potty or to go out and [10:38] play and they are on a six foot leash or [10:40] 4 foot leash or whatever you're using [10:42] that doesn't give the dog a lot of [10:44] leeway and it's pretty common that the [10:47] dogs will be pulling on that short that [10:50] short leash so while dogs are in [10:52] training we love to use the longer lines [10:54] because it does give the dogs a little [10:56] bit more freedom but you can control [10:58] whether it's one foot or 21 feet you can [11:00] control all of that um and you can let [11:04] the dogs just you know move around a [11:06] little bit more the long line though can [11:09] be used for all kinds of situations I [11:11] used it when I take my puppy out for a [11:14] potty break and instead of going to the [11:15] bathroom they want to you know Pick Up [11:16] Sticks in their mouth or they want to [11:18] you know look for that chipmunk that [11:20] just ran across the backyard or whatever [11:22] it might be I can use the long line to [11:24] redirect their attention and to [11:26] interrupt them from digging in things or [11:28] chewing things that they're not not [11:29] supposed to or just simply ignoring me [11:31] because there's something that's [11:32] attached between me and the dog um I can [11:36] follow through and then eventually that [11:37] long line goes from in my hand to [11:40] dragging on the ground and then later on [11:42] uh down the road it leads to being able [11:44] to have a dog that has really really [11:46] excellent off leash control um which is [11:49] important I mean you and I sat on the [11:51] veranda the other day and we had our [11:52] bord col out and like she just [11:55] understands to stay near us like we [11:58] don't even have to tell she just sort of [12:00] stays close but when she was a puppy she [12:02] was raised on a long line and when she [12:05] was a puppy you know of a butterfly [12:07] would go by she would be like woo what's [12:09] that and then she'd follow it but [12:10] because we had control all of the time [12:13] she just learned through good [12:14] information what to do and what not to [12:16] do but the nice things about these long [12:17] lines in particular they're made out of [12:19] Bane so they made out of what Bane [12:22] biothane y I think it's a trademark name [12:24] so I want to make sure we absolutely [12:26] know okay yeah I thought I was saying it [12:27] wrong byan bio thing okay that's better [12:31] okay you're weird uh anyways uh but [12:34] what's nice about it it's super soft on [12:35] the hand but also when it's outside and [12:37] if it drags through the mud or if it [12:39] rains or if it's whatever it just stays [12:42] so much cleaner on the dog so we've been [12:45] using these for a while and we've been [12:47] really hoping to get to the point where [12:48] we could you know add them to our our [12:50] product store um of course Maan blue [12:53] what's better um but anyways I'm really [12:55] pleased with this and every single one [12:57] of our dogs that we have we raise uh [12:59] using one of these lines um when we're [13:01] outside I teach I use it to teach fetch [13:04] I've actually been using it to teach my [13:05] youngest dog to swim so that I can you [13:08] know keep them safe so yeah they're [13:09] awesome the reality is and this is a [13:12] mistake that I see a lot of people make [13:13] they'll go to the park they'll go [13:14] somewhere where their dog is in an [13:15] awfully situation um and they'll try to [13:19] get a response to like a response to [13:20] name or a recall and if you have a dog [13:23] in training and you aren't absolutely [13:25] sure that the dog is going to turn when [13:27] you call them to listen when you you [13:30] know make a request whatever that might [13:31] be they better have a leash or a line on [13:34] because good leadership means that you [13:37] can do something when they make the [13:38] wrong choice you know you can catch up [13:40] to them and you can train through it but [13:42] if you call their name over and over [13:44] again and this here's the classic one [13:46] let me know if you're making this [13:47] mistake because I see it so often you [13:49] let your dog outside late it's late at [13:50] night you're ready to go to bed just I'm [13:52] tired let's shut things down and you see [13:54] a skunk you or you even you just let the [13:56] dog outside you let the dog in the [13:58] backyard and you're like okay he's [13:59] probably done his business by now and [14:01] you're like scooter scooter and scooter [14:04] doesn't listen scooter finds a skunk or [14:06] Scooter's eating the flowers or just [14:08] sniffing the grass scooter scooter [14:10] scooter scooter I'm going to go get his [14:13] bag of treats and he shake the bag of [14:14] treats that is the worst leadership you [14:17] can possibly have scooter is a very [14:19] clever dog Scooter's training you [14:21] scooter has you has you has you trained [14:24] absolutely so uh you know using [14:27] something like a long line going out [14:28] with scooter when they if scooter [14:31] doesn't know how to respond to their [14:32] name is exactly the steps you need to [14:34] take that's great leadership uh we're [14:36] going to talk in a little bit about [14:37] please tell me somebody on this chat has [14:39] a dog name Scooter because it is our [14:41] favorite well Ken specifically favorite [14:43] example dog name we have a uh we have a [14:46] video from a long time ago likeing [14:48] fluffy too that scooter with uh scooter [14:50] and it's actually a really interesting [14:51] story if you can let me know if you can [14:53] find that with the scooter the dog the [14:55] video um it was one of our like an [14:57] actual scooter yeah jet yeah it was Jose [15:00] I remember her um Stacy with the Super [15:04] Chat let's see what Stacy's got to [15:06] say uh Stacy how do I uh how do I lead [15:09] without confusing my three-year-old and [15:11] five- Monon sensitive rescue goldens [15:13] they're always close and they're [15:14] obviously at different levels thanks [15:15] that's a good question yeah um when you [15:18] have a multiple dog household it [15:19] definitely makes training a little bit [15:21] more complicated I mean coming from us [15:23] we have uh four dogs in the house and um [15:27] everybody's at different levels of [15:28] training typically we have our older [15:30] guys and then we have our younger dogs [15:32] um my recommendation to you Stacy is [15:34] that when you are training the dogs [15:36] specifically because they're at [15:37] different levels it's really important [15:39] that you are training and um doing stuff [15:41] with them independently um you want to [15:44] make sure that you're developing [15:45] independent relationships with those [15:47] dogs you're working on you know good [15:48] management skills and and basic training [15:51] and getting things sort of understood [15:53] separate and then what you can do is um [15:56] when you bring them together the the way [15:58] that I pref prer to do it is if one dog [16:00] becomes well trained enough that you [16:02] could like tell it to lay down and stay [16:04] on a bed or whatnot then you could do [16:06] that that's what I do with my dogs I [16:07] have my older dogs lie down and stay and [16:10] then I train my puppy while the other [16:12] dogs are lying down and staying and I [16:14] specifically do that because the puppy [16:16] knows that the dogs are there but [16:17] they're not like running and playing [16:19] with ball or doing anything super [16:21] exciting and stimulating they're just [16:22] sort of being bumps on a log and they're [16:24] not you know pulling my dog's attention [16:27] my puppy's attention away from me if [16:29] that can't happen for you then maybe you [16:30] know have h a friend or a partner or [16:33] something like that um you know have the [16:35] other dog unleash at a fair distance and [16:37] then work one dog to work response to [16:39] name leave it recalls sit stays those [16:42] types of things while the other dog is [16:44] present but there's no interaction um [16:47] and then switch the dogs off and then [16:49] eventually you're going to work them a [16:50] little closer together so you're [16:51] probably thinking to yourself gosh that [16:52] sounds like a lot of work um it is a lot [16:54] of work there's no there's no fast pass [16:56] to training multiple dogs but the [16:59] absolute best thing to do is to isolate [17:01] train separately and then as the skills [17:04] start to develop you'll be able to come [17:06] back together with Harmony so we've [17:08] talked a little bit about um two of the [17:11] uh five things we're going to mention [17:13] tonight in the uh video about lead great [17:15] leadership and we started off with [17:17] supervision and uh Karina says I found [17:20] 100% supervision so stressful yep and [17:24] and it it can be for sure one thing that [17:26] I want you to really be mindful of whe [17:28] regardless of your age of dog regardless [17:30] of their level of training is I want [17:32] people to be more intentional when they [17:34] have their dog when they're supervising [17:35] their dog when they're out of their [17:36] kennel or crate uh because if you're [17:39] doing things right you're likely going [17:41] to have a dog that when you aren't [17:43] interacting with them when when you [17:44] aren't engaging with them when they go [17:46] in their kennel or crate they're ready [17:48] to lie down I mean I think what some of [17:51] the mistakes I made long before I was I [17:54] was introduced to McAn dogs as a dog [17:56] owner maybe just like you is I just [17:58] thought the dog to to be wandering [17:59] around all the all the time like just be [18:01] out of her kennel or crate she you know [18:02] I didn't even have a kennel at that [18:04] point I didn't understand the value of [18:05] cring I just let her like Meander around [18:08] the house behind me and for some reason [18:10] I thought that was good for her and in [18:11] hindsight and after helping so many [18:13] students after I became a trainer um I [18:15] realize how uh I could have done things [18:18] way better um talk just about like what [18:21] is an average day when you have a a [18:22] dogin training what does like an average [18:24] day look like yeah um an average day for [18:28] me looks like multiple training sessions [18:31] throughout the day for short periods of [18:33] time um and that might mean 5 or 10 [18:36] minutes so when I get up you know in the [18:37] morning the very first thing that I do [18:39] before I worry about myself is I get my [18:41] puppy outside to go to the bathroom um [18:44] and when we do that I don't just like [18:46] mindlessly walk outside let them pee and [18:48] then come back inside um I'll go outside [18:51] let them pee and I might spend five [18:52] minutes you know calling their name and [18:54] running away and letting them chase [18:56] after me and doing a little bit of play [18:58] I might take some cookies out with me [18:59] and do some sits and downs I might um [19:02] you know work on some sits at the door [19:04] just little things where I'm not uh [19:07] expecting the puppy to do things I'm [19:08] teaching the puppy I'm showing the puppy [19:10] making it dead easy for them we might [19:12] come back inside I might you know feed [19:15] breakfast or whatever time it is at that [19:17] at morning breakfast time I might do a [19:19] little bit more training for breakfast [19:20] and then the remainder of their [19:21] breakfast I would put in their crate I [19:23] would put the puppy in the crate shut [19:25] the door and then while they're eating [19:26] their breakfast I would go about [19:27] finishing getting myself already for the [19:29] morning that would include you know [19:31] showering getting ready for work packing [19:33] my bags letting the other dogs out um [19:36] exercising them all of that all that [19:38] time my puppy's in the crate then um I [19:40] mean I have the luxury of taking my [19:42] puppy to work but from there you know [19:44] when I take my puppies to work I'm not [19:46] hanging out with my puppy all day I'm [19:48] teaching other people how to train their [19:50] dogs so once I get to the work another [19:51] quick pee back into the crate they go I [19:54] teach for a couple hours in between [19:56] classes I come get the puppy out we go [19:58] outside for 5 or 10 minutes and we do a [20:00] few more things together it's very [20:02] concentrated isolated time where I'm [20:04] interacting with my dog once I've done [20:06] that puppy goes back into the crate and [20:08] I go you know Zoom calls meetings [20:11] whatever I'm doing puppy's in the crate [20:12] for all that and then a little while [20:14] later bring the puppy back out do a few [20:16] more things and then puppy goes back in [20:17] the crate and then by the time I get [20:19] home from work I know my puppy needs a [20:21] bit more attention so we might do a few [20:23] more training things and then we might [20:25] have some quiet time so you know rather [20:27] than you know going back in the C right [20:28] away we might you know sit in front of [20:30] the TV for a half an hour you know [20:32] chewing on a bone while I hold the bone [20:34] and have the puppy nearby me just some [20:36] some not intense time but just close [20:39] time where the puppy's learning just to [20:40] chill and be with me we've had a long [20:42] day they've had lots of exercise I know [20:45] they've been fully taken care of I'm [20:47] winding the puppy down to start getting [20:49] ready into like sleepy mode we go [20:51] outside one more time and then in the [20:53] crate for bed so they are in and out of [20:56] that crate a million times throughout [20:57] the day but if you added up the time [21:00] they were in the crate versus the time [21:01] they were out of their crate the time [21:03] that they are in their crate in the [21:05] early stages far outweighs the amount of [21:08] time that they're out of crate before [21:09] you start to panic and go that's mean I [21:11] don't like that I guarantee you that [21:14] this less time that I spend with my [21:16] puppy is way more quality time than the [21:19] average person spends with their puppy [21:22] that just let them roam around learning [21:23] to make all these mistakes our puppies [21:25] don't really learn to do a lot of poor [21:28] things in the house like stealing things [21:29] chewing things house training that kind [21:32] of stuff because they don't really get [21:33] an opportunity to kind of Be Free Will [21:36] in the house to make their own choices [21:37] our engagement with the puppies while [21:39] they're young is so focused on [21:41] development bonding relationship [21:43] building training that when the puppy [21:45] comes out of the crate even after only a [21:47] few weeks coming home the puppy comes up [21:49] and they just like stare at us they're [21:50] like okay well what are we doing then [21:52] yeah because that's just what they're [21:53] used to they're not ignoring us and [21:54] running around the house they don't want [21:56] to all they want to do is be close to us [21:58] because that's how we raise them and [22:00] then over time you know a couple hours [22:03] in the crate turns into less time and [22:05] less time and less time until you know [22:07] many of our older dogs never have to go [22:08] in a crate ever so lot guaranteed [22:11] someone's going to be saying like well [22:12] you're a dog trainer you can take your [22:14] dog to work like what do I do my dog's [22:16] not out at work they're in a crate the [22:17] same way that you would be at your job [22:19] toally for sure so someone if you're [22:21] thinking like well I have an 8 hour day [22:23] what how on Earth am I going to do this [22:24] well for great leadership purposes [22:26] you're going to get a friend or a family [22:28] member to let your uh dog out during the [22:30] day you're going to maybe get a dog [22:31] walker like this is a commitment you've [22:33] made you've made a commitment you don't [22:35] even need that forever like once your [22:37] puppy is you know four five 6 months old [22:40] and they can hold their bladder for [22:41] eight eight hours 7 hours while you're [22:43] sleeping which they should be able to do [22:46] by the way this is overnight maybe [22:47] you're sleeping work I don't know yeah [22:49] um this is overnight but they should be [22:51] able to do that during the day as well [22:54] um but obviously you have to teach your [22:56] dog how to do that you can't just shove [22:57] them in a crate for hours the hope that [22:59] they're okay you've got to build into [23:01] that but they're perfectly capable of [23:03] you know spending some time in the crate [23:05] and you know we often say to our people [23:06] you know if they feel guilty about that [23:08] you know what would you want your dog to [23:09] be doing while you're away at work if [23:11] you ask me that question I would want my [23:13] dog to be like going somewhere and lying [23:15] down sleeping maybe chewing a bone you [23:18] know not running around my house not [23:19] getting into my things just lying down [23:21] sleeping well they're going to do that [23:22] in a crate yeah so when I have a young [23:24] dog that I can't trust I'm I would can't [23:27] fathom leaving them loosen the house to [23:29] their own devices so that they get to [23:32] kind of make up their own little [23:33] schedule for the day that is not [23:35] happening so it's really important but [23:36] like when you're when you're talking [23:38] about this kind of thing this uh starts [23:41] early uh you know you have this plan [23:43] great leadership is what you do before [23:45] you leave yeah you know it it's you [23:47] you're making the plan maybe you're [23:48] getting up half an hour earlier than you [23:50] normally do 20 minutes earlier whatever [23:52] that might take and you're going out of [23:54] your way to exercise that dog Tire them [23:56] out mentally physically um you know [23:59] you're really making sure that when they [24:00] go in their kennel they lie down and [24:03] that's they want to be in there they [24:04] want to relax and that's how you start [24:06] to get those wins it's always surprises [24:09] me people really seem to struggle [24:11] overnight with with puppies and it's [24:13] fascinating to me but I understand that [24:16] you know people aren't starting that [24:17] bedtime schedule at dinnertime like if [24:20] you have a puppy or or you know a dog [24:22] that's young enough to to have uh issues [24:25] with potty you're going to start that [24:27] strategy from dinner on you're going to [24:29] start planning out the things you're [24:30] going to do we have several videos to [24:32] talk about that but that's how you get [24:33] the wins cuz that's great leadership [24:35] that's leadership that makes you go out [24:38] of your way to do what's best for the [24:39] dog yeah rather than what's most [24:41] convenient for you totally um we've [24:44] talked a little bit about uh let's see [24:46] here uh supervision management we need [24:49] to talk about I actually think I have [24:51] some slides for this I [24:54] do look at that smart this is this is [24:57] the acronym that we're building this Lon [24:59] on we probably should have led with that [25:00] anticipate think like a puppy does it [25:03] look like it could be chewed up or peed [25:04] on you better put it where I can't get [25:06] it this doesn't only apply to puppies [25:09] this also applies to uh situations when [25:11] you're out on a walk and you see a [25:14] challenge come up in front of you when [25:16] you're uh out at the park and you think [25:19] boy uh I don't have a line on or you [25:21] know my dog's probably pretty interested [25:23] in those kids running around at the [25:24] swing set this is anticipation and good [25:27] leaders know what their dogs are capable [25:29] of and they have a good sense of what [25:32] they need to do to either avoid having [25:34] them H having to like uh deal with the [25:37] situation when the dog makes a wrong [25:38] mistake or they know what to do way [25:40] before it we talk about that concentric [25:42] Circle sometimes where we talk about [25:44] it's we call it the training Target [25:46] where the dog's uh definitely going to [25:47] fail in the center as the bullseye [25:49] they're likely to fail or they may fail [25:51] on the second Circle and then they're [25:53] not going to fail at all in the green [25:55] circle and good leaders know that they [25:57] need to make decision in the green and [25:59] the yellow circle so they're [26:00] anticipating when do I need to start the [26:02] training uh in this situation soaka [26:06] maybe anticipating challenges with uh [26:08] dogs you know when you're trying to get [26:10] your dog off leash or working on a [26:11] recall yeah I can actually give you a [26:13] personal example so um we have a border [26:15] collie who's um seven or eight years old [26:18] now and when she was younger um she was [26:22] really um kind of a little bit [26:25] uncomfortable around um people that [26:27] would just like kind of walk out of the [26:29] blue if I was at the park and all of a [26:30] sudden we you know she thought we were [26:32] alone and then somebody would just [26:33] appear um she would get a little bit [26:35] worried and she'd spook bark at them or [26:37] she'd you know get her hackles up and be [26:39] like a little bit afraid and we got to [26:41] the point where her off leash control [26:43] was pretty good but I always had to be [26:45] very aware that if somebody wishes to [26:47] come out that she could potentially [26:49] while she was younger and not fully [26:50] trained yet um she could bark and want [26:53] to run over to to where those things [26:55] were so um when I was working on off [26:57] leash control contr with her I would [26:59] have my leash um you know around my [27:01] shoulder and I would have just a long [27:03] line on her and we would take her to the [27:04] park we give her a little bit of freedom [27:06] and you it' be lots of training but I [27:08] was always kind of scanning around a [27:10] little bit so that I could make sure I [27:11] could see those people before Beed um [27:14] and then if I did see people I would [27:16] just very calmly call her back not be [27:18] come back here be stressy because then [27:20] she would be like what are you what's [27:21] wrong with you I would call her back [27:23] over I'd have her sit I'd tach my leash [27:25] so I had a bit more control I would have [27:27] her move into my side I would use some [27:28] treats I would let her you know she'd [27:30] see the people and she'd start to get a [27:32] little bit unsure and i' just say leave [27:33] it and I would turn and go the other [27:34] direction I would keep her busy walking [27:36] with me and turning and sitting and down [27:39] and all these things to kind of keep her [27:41] engaged and she'd have one eye on the [27:42] people but then she SED go wait a second [27:44] what are we doing here and what started [27:46] to happen is she got to the point where [27:49] she would notice the people but instead [27:51] of learning to react to them she had [27:54] rehearsed so much reconnecting and doing [27:56] stuff with me that she started to do [27:58] that all by herself um but that was [28:00] because I anticipated I didn't wait [28:02] until she saw the people and was running [28:04] across the field barking at them before [28:06] doing something about it I was quick to [28:08] say I'm pretty sure I know what's going [28:10] to happen here I don't want her to [28:13] rehearse making poor choices or learning [28:14] bad behaviors or even just being worried [28:17] or or whatever so I would anticipate put [28:19] the leash on and I would be proactive in [28:21] my dog training and that same [28:24] anticipation needs to happen for dogs [28:27] that you know are barking at the window [28:29] when the people are walking by let's [28:31] anticipate that happening and let's stop [28:33] letting the dog stand at the window for [28:34] 3 hours barking at you know people [28:37] walking by um anticipation means that [28:40] you are one step ahead of the bad choice [28:43] so that we're stopping the bad choice [28:45] from being rehearsed being practiced and [28:47] we have an opportunity to redirect the [28:49] dog to do something that's better and [28:51] because we have great timing because [28:52] we've anticipated it um we're going to [28:55] conquer that challenge much much more [28:57] easily because we're ready for it um so [28:59] anticipation is huge anticipation comes [29:01] with experience it also comes with [29:03] getting to know your dog um to you [29:06] know have a good idea of when this [29:09] happens your dog might do this um and [29:11] it's always better to weigh on the the [29:13] side of caution and and if you're not [29:15] sure just treat it like something bad [29:18] could happen and get your dog under [29:20] control let me know in the chat I want [29:22] you to type yes if you have been in a [29:25] situation where you thought oh boy I [29:27] don't know this is going to work maybe [29:29] you're outside maybe you uh you know [29:32] you're going for a walk and you think to [29:33] yourself like oh you know he's this dog [29:36] is definitely going to Lunge or or pull [29:38] at that other dog or he's going to jump [29:40] up on uh Aunt Flo or whoever uh I want [29:43] you to type yes in the chat if you've [29:45] ever made a bad decision about something [29:48] like that or you've called them they're [29:49] off leash or they're in the backyard and [29:51] you're like fluffy and they don't come [29:53] back it's so common because I think [29:57] sometimes we we like to gamble it's [29:59] easier to if they come back in that's [30:01] great if not oh no big deal but in [30:04] reality you're accidentally being a bad [30:06] leader for your dog once they learn that [30:08] they don't have to listen once they [30:10] learn that they may get to pull you up [30:12] to that person walking down the street [30:14] they don't have to run back in the house [30:17] when you call them once they learn that [30:19] it's uh just as valuable as The Times [30:22] They may have made the right choice and [30:24] that's accidentally being a bad leader [30:26] the other thing I yeah and I see uh [30:28] Terry Stacy uh the cotton home team yes [30:30] yeah yep and says yep I mean these [30:33] things happen and what I love about uh [30:36] train station episodes like tonight is [30:39] starting right now you can stop making [30:42] those or you'll start being more aware [30:44] of them because every time you make one [30:46] of these bad choices it compounds and [30:48] your dog learns more and more that they [30:50] don't really have to listen you know no [30:53] big deal I'm not going to come right now [30:54] but she's going to call me again in a [30:56] couple of seconds so maybe I'll run back [30:58] then these are really important [31:00] realizations for you as as a as a young [31:02] or as a new dog owner and um when you [31:05] start to figure this out what what do [31:07] you start doing you start having better [31:08] management strategies you stop calling [31:11] when you're not sure what the result is [31:13] going to be and maybe you go set the dog [31:14] up to be right let's imagine a situation [31:16] where your dog's out let's say at the [31:19] park or whatever your dog's out in the [31:20] backyard and and they've gotten out [31:22] there or you've let them out there and [31:23] you've thought to yourself oh you know [31:25] what I probably shouldn't call them [31:26] because I don't know if they're going to [31:28] run back so you're going to put your [31:29] slippers on you're going to go in the [31:31] backyard clip your leash on and then you [31:33] can practice it there because if they [31:35] don't respond you can train through it [31:37] and maybe next time put the line on [31:38] beforehand absolutely in fact if you [31:41] have one of these biothane one of our [31:42] incredible biothane keep it at the door [31:44] that's what we do with ours we literally [31:46] keep it at the door so that when we go [31:48] outside part of our training to go [31:51] outside like with our puppies is to [31:53] learn to sit at the door they have to [31:56] hold a sit while we attack the long line [31:58] and then unattach the house line and [32:00] then we say okay and then let them get [32:02] up and we literally do that every single [32:06] time we go outside and uh the puppies [32:09] learn to do it independently because [32:10] we're consistent about it but it just [32:12] becomes a bit of a routine and that's [32:14] leadership right there it's just you [32:16] know not that difficult to do it's it's [32:18] an easy thing to be consistent with um [32:21] but that way we know that when they're [32:23] outside we're always going to have an [32:25] opportunity to um be ready absolutely [32:29] ready for action yeah it's just so [32:31] important when you're anticipating when [32:32] you're anticipating your um what your [32:35] the choices your dogs going to make it's [32:36] like a great coach you know a great [32:38] coach might work you hard might you know [32:40] might make you really work for it [32:42] sometimes but you're going to be [32:43] motivated about it they're not going to [32:44] let you fail over and over again they're [32:46] going to hold you accountable they're [32:47] going to hold you accountable that is so [32:49] important I know I I've seen a lot of um [32:51] online students that's my favorite thing [32:53] to do as a coach myself in the chat uh [32:56] let us know let let me know I want to [32:57] hear from all our online students you [32:59] know uh cuz we hold you accountable in [33:02] our online training and in the nicest [33:05] way oh absolutely for sure but that's [33:07] what that's what you need that's what I [33:08] needed when I went to Mand dogs as a [33:09] student many years ago you know I needed [33:11] to be accountable um you and I were [33:14] talking about nighttime routine I just [33:15] saw one of our uh uh lots of Link Luton [33:17] sent me a message saying we actually [33:18] have a nighttime routine video coming [33:20] out this weekend so uh it's great timing [33:23] if you're if you're struggling with your [33:25] overnight and what to do with your dog [33:27] uh make sure you check the channel on [33:28] Saturday morning but accountability is [33:32] hugely important [33:33] and I think it might be one of those [33:36] things that you know you need someone [33:38] there to sort of guide you to help you [33:40] you know it's hard because life gets [33:42] busy things get in the way it's nice to [33:44] be part of a community that's also going [33:46] to support you that's exactly what you [33:48] could be part of in our online training [33:50] Community um and and that's kind of the [33:52] exciting part of seeing a lot of our [33:53] online students yeah and I think it's [33:55] important to say you hopefully a lot of [33:57] you guys are our live stream today [33:58] because you've seen one of our our [34:00] educational training videos on YouTube [34:03] and we do share a lot of our training [34:04] methods on YouTube which is great but [34:07] what you don't realize with our YouTube [34:08] videos is they're part education they're [34:10] also part entertainment and um the order [34:13] in which we train things and how long we [34:16] train for and what exercise we put [34:18] together and when we go on to steps we [34:20] don't include any of that in YouTube and [34:23] that's something that we do in our [34:24] programs we sort of show you how to put [34:26] all of the ex exercises together step by [34:28] step by step so that you know exactly [34:30] what to do um and the online program is [34:33] not just limited to watching videos um [34:37] it also comes with a ton of support from [34:38] our instructors you also get to interact [34:42] and you know see the questions and [34:43] answers from other people that are in [34:45] the program sometimes you'll learn that [34:47] like 20 30 other people are having [34:50] exactly the same problem that you are [34:52] and then you get to you know learn all [34:53] about it and then sometimes you'll see [34:55] things and you're like gosh I didn't [34:56] even know that could be a problem now [34:58] I've seen I'm ready for it if it happens [35:00] with my puppy um so the community [35:02] community aspect is really important [35:04] something that we really it's why we [35:06] didn't come out with online um program [35:08] for such a long time is because you know [35:10] we're so used to our in-person um [35:13] classes where we have such a close [35:15] connection with our students because we [35:16] work with them you know every single [35:18] week we get to know them and their [35:19] students and their dogs so much and so [35:22] we wanted to make sure that we were able [35:23] to have that same feeling with our [35:26] students online and [35:28] um you know I believe our online team is [35:31] very very good at that yeah I see some [35:33] really great uh especially instructor [35:35] Robbie you'll get to know her very well [35:37] instructor Robbie was my first life [35:40] skills one instructor um and many years [35:44] ago is it 17 years ago 18 years ago now [35:46] something like that uh but instructor [35:48] Robbie what's so interesting is I didn't [35:49] really want to go to dog training I [35:51] didn't want to have to train my dog and [35:53] I went to Mand dogs my vet said uh he [35:55] couldn't assess her and he's like listen [35:56] this is not not going well you need to [35:58] go over to ma dogs these guys are great [36:01] and I decided that I had to go and um I [36:05] I couldn't believe how well it worked I [36:07] couldn't believe how much fun it was [36:09] like I really I really had so much fun [36:12] teaching my dog how to listen because [36:13] you know I made some bad choices and I [36:15] didn't I didn't really know what I [36:17] didn't know um but boy oh boy did it [36:19] change the course of my life as you see [36:21] me sitting here beside kale you got a [36:23] train dog and you got a wife that's [36:25] right yeah pretty [36:26] remarkable we talked a little bit about [36:28] accountability um uh not only for the [36:31] human but for the dog so we don't [36:33] guarantee wives with your program no so [36:37] we need to talk about um redirection [36:39] what that means you know when your dog [36:41] makes the wrong choice whether it is a [36:42] puppy problem or a a you know adult dog [36:45] problem redirecting is really important [36:48] it's the follow through that we talk [36:50] about and this is where often times [36:52] people fall short and this is where your [36:54] leadership completely falls apart yeah [36:57] so we believe that it's important to let [36:59] your dog know when um when they're [37:02] making a wrong choice and that's why we [37:04] have leashes and lines and long lines [37:07] and house lines on our puppies so that [37:08] we're never you know red when we say [37:11] redirection we literally mean physically [37:14] redirecting your dog to something that [37:16] they should be doing instead but we are [37:18] not big lovers of people actually [37:20] grabbing on to the actual dog itself [37:23] because a couple things could happen if [37:24] I reach and try and grab my dog and pull [37:26] something out of it mouth or try and [37:28] catch my dog some dogs will think it's a [37:30] game and um you know they'll they'll [37:34] turn into a bit of a catch me if you [37:35] hand game and they'll take off and they [37:37] think it's really fun other dogs will [37:38] turn back and nip and bite at you and [37:40] jump all over you um you know it's not [37:43] not super effective and some dogs can be [37:44] worried and scared of that which is [37:46] certainly not our goal either either so [37:48] the redirection is something physical [37:50] but the other thing that we really [37:52] strongly believe in is that if you are [37:54] going to tell your puppy or your dog at [37:56] any time that something is wrong you [37:59] must then redirect them to something [38:01] that is right so if you don't like this [38:05] great tell them that but what should [38:06] they do instead redirect and then that [38:09] we because what we want to do is say no [38:11] or this is wrong and then we want to [38:13] find an opportunity to say woo look at [38:15] you what a great choice so we can praise [38:17] and reinforce the dog for what is [38:19] correct and so many people miss that [38:22] spot they just end up saying no no no [38:24] stop that stop that stop that and their [38:26] whole day is [38:28] is built around you know being [38:30] frustrated with the dog and stopping [38:31] them from doing this and stopping them [38:33] doing from that because there's no [38:34] follow-through there's maybe all the [38:36] other things we talked about poor [38:37] management poor supervision all of those [38:39] types of things but then they're not [38:41] taking the time to then show the dog [38:43] what they should be doing differently [38:44] you know when people come to the door [38:46] what do you want your dog to do well [38:49] train them to do that if you don't know [38:50] how that's why you come to classes and [38:53] we'll show you that um you know if you [38:55] don't want your dog to bark in the [38:57] situation what would you rather them do [38:58] instead teach them how to do that [39:00] instead um it's all about the [39:02] redirection and and that comes with with [39:04] being consistent and having the follow [39:06] through um redirection also is important [39:09] with the follow through is I think you [39:10] mentioned this a little bit earlier with [39:12] one of your examples but you know people [39:14] are really bad for repeating the their [39:19] commands to the dog and just I don't [39:22] know hoping wishing thinking the dog is [39:24] eventually going to listen to you hoping [39:27] yeah [39:28] if your dog was going to listen they [39:31] would just listen the first time um if [39:33] they you're having to do it 5 six 7even [39:35] 8 nine 10 times the dogs ignoring you [39:37] they had nothing wrong with your hearing [39:39] they are just ignoring you and either [39:41] they are pushing your buttons and seeing [39:42] whether you're going to follow through [39:44] or they don't know what you're asking [39:47] them to do they're not ignoring you [39:48] because they're bad they're ignoring you [39:50] because you've actually not done the [39:51] work to deserve getting them to listen [39:54] to on the first time so that's another [39:56] thing that sort of Blends in with [39:57] redirection and follow through and [39:58] things like that you want to be careful [40:00] that you're not you know recom [40:02] commanding your dog and and teaching [40:04] them that your words don't matter um the [40:06] other thing you threw bird I do yeah in [40:09] the uh the train station they probably [40:11] flew [40:12] in the other thing that's really [40:14] important to understand is that dogs [40:16] will do what what's rewarding as you [40:17] were talking about that maybe it's uh [40:19] maybe it's barking outside maybe it is [40:22] pulling un leash maybe it is uh sniffing [40:25] in the flower garden it doesn't matter [40:26] what it is if you aren't there if you [40:28] aren't able to redirect and and sort of [40:31] get them get their change their mind get [40:33] them uh focused on something else then [40:35] they'll just continue being rewarded by [40:37] the thing jumping up on somebody it [40:39] could be the most rewarding part I mean [40:42] you know the dog jumps up on your on [40:44] your neighbor and then you pull them [40:45] down off well the dog's already been [40:47] rewarded for that thing so if you aren't [40:50] able to redirect as it's happening [40:52] before it happens before it happens is [40:54] the best timing but if you aren't able [40:56] to to redirect then your dog is [40:58] continually having the opportunity to be [41:00] rewarded doing the thing that they want [41:01] to do and the thing that's driving you [41:03] crazy yeah because you're accidentally [41:06] being a bad leader you aren't [41:07] anticipating you aren't managing you're [41:09] not redirecting the redirection is a key [41:12] part of being a great leader because it [41:14] very clearly and quickly shows your dog [41:17] okay this is what I want I don't like [41:18] that this thing isn't going to work for [41:20] us but this you know you get them back [41:22] their brain back on training you get [41:23] them back on you you get them walking at [41:25] your side again whatever the correction [41:27] is whatever the thing is that you get [41:28] them back on track then you can quickly [41:31] start rewarding them again and letting [41:33] them know this is the good stuff pal M [41:35] so important so important for [41:38] leadership we talked a little bit about [41:40] after that redirection let's say the dog [41:42] your dog uh you know you've learned that [41:44] actually you know what let's let's uh [41:46] got a Super [41:47] Chat $20 Super Chat from 5js D Coleman I [41:52] have a three-year-old Boston Terrier and [41:53] a new 3-month-old my older one seems [41:55] very standoffish in the house house he [41:57] doesn't correct the puppy's Behavior he [41:59] rolls him and tries to mount him is this [42:01] okay outside he rolls him and tries to [42:04] mount him um [42:06] so when you have multiple dogs you have [42:09] a dog that's older and then you have a [42:10] dog that's younger there are some older [42:14] dogs that will naturally step into that [42:17] leader role and are very comfortable um [42:21] you know disciplining a puppy um I would [42:23] say a lot of dogs are not though and it [42:26] can be very stressful for an older dog [42:28] to be put in a situation where you're [42:30] like okay go teach the puppy a lesson [42:32] and they're like I don't want to do that [42:34] like this puppy's irritating you're [42:35] you're you're supposed to one that's be [42:37] the one to do that you're the one in [42:38] charge um so it is important that you [42:42] are not putting your older dog in a [42:44] situation where you're kind of leaving [42:45] it to them to figure it out um you know [42:48] it's up to you to step in and and make [42:50] the changes that are necessary um we [42:53] really are big Believers in separating [42:56] puppies from older dogs for quite some [42:58] time you know when I'm raising a new [43:00] puppy in the house they are not really [43:02] having a lot of free time with my older [43:03] dogs until they are well over six or [43:07] seven months old um so that means that [43:09] if my puppy loose in the house and we're [43:11] doing training and we're doing [43:12] activities my older dogs are either in [43:14] their crate or they're behind a baby [43:16] gate or they're separated so that my [43:18] puppy cannot rehearse going and jumping [43:21] and being on their heads and that type [43:22] of thing because I don't think it's fair [43:24] for my older dogs to be put into the [43:26] situation where they need to do that um [43:28] so separation side's going to be [43:30] important so really important you talked [43:32] about what you do but why you do it you [43:34] know I said you don't think it's fair [43:36] but also you're going to have terrible [43:37] timing the dog's going to be rewarded by [43:38] jumping on the older your older dog [43:40] didn't get a choice here you know you've [43:42] brought this puppy home you've been like [43:43] here you go uh and it's it it just isn't [43:46] fair you can't give your dog great dog [43:48] training is all about information well [43:50] timed information and if uh it's also [43:54] about teaching your dog that you're [43:56] worth listening to yeah they already [43:58] speak the same language you know they're [44:00] they're already able to communicate very [44:01] well and you're trying to get your puppy [44:03] to start to understand you know that [44:05] your voice has value so why would you [44:07] put yourself in a situation where you've [44:08] got a lot to overcome when rather than [44:12] asking rather than listening to you say [44:14] sit or go lie down or do whatever the [44:16] thing is skill that you're working on [44:17] they can just go play with the older dog [44:19] that is you know already has probably [44:21] lots of Freedom lots of opportunity [44:23] maybe uh you know has their own chew [44:25] toys and now the puppy's going to share [44:27] with them um you you really want to set [44:29] yourself up to in your puppy's eyes look [44:32] like a leader and the way to do that is [44:34] supervision management anticipate [44:37] redirect all of these things apply to [44:39] this specific situation so be careful [44:41] that you're not accidentally being a bad [44:43] leader after those uh after the [44:45] supervision management anticipation [44:48] redirection we've talked about it [44:49] several times we dropped these little [44:51] nuggets and this is one of those things [44:52] where people will say like well you [44:55] catch your puppy chewing on the house [44:56] line then what well you catch your puppy [44:58] chewing on shoes then what do you do [45:00] what do you do after you've redirected [45:02] the dog the puppy or dog away from that [45:04] thing and I love this because this is [45:06] the difference it's not just about the [45:08] redirection it's about what you do with [45:10] their brains next yeah well then I would [45:12] redirect them to something that they [45:14] should do so perhaps I would give them [45:16] you know a one of their own bones to [45:19] chew on so they learn you know when you [45:21] want to go over there don't do that go [45:22] over here and chew on your bone instead [45:24] so I would give them something else to [45:26] do or I might just give get them to do [45:27] an obedience behavior that puts the [45:29] dog's Focus back on Me Maybe I ask for a [45:31] Sit maybe I ask for a down maybe I ask [45:34] for you know a couple moments of of Look [45:36] At Me eye contact and then we can move [45:38] on from there because what you don't [45:40] want to do is sometimes people will [45:41] redirect by you know the dog's got the [45:44] shoe in its mouth and then what they do [45:46] is they go over and they just put a toy [45:48] in the dog's mouth instead and they [45:50] think that's redirection um but if you [45:53] think about timing and dog [45:55] training you need to make sure that [45:58] you're not um you're not rewarding your [46:01] dog with the redirection and the fact [46:04] that they think that this bone or toy or [46:06] treat appears every time they go and put [46:09] their mouth on your running shoes yeah [46:10] so the redirection needs to have good [46:12] timing we're redirecting we're moving [46:14] the dog away from the area that's [46:16] causing the problem we are getting a [46:18] little bit of focus and then we are [46:19] reinforcing with something that is [46:21] better so that there's a few seconds [46:23] that go by between when they're you know [46:26] in doing the things they're not supposed [46:27] to and then doing the thing that they [46:29] are supposed to do but you don't want to [46:31] go one right after another because you [46:33] will um get mixed messages then you know [46:37] when we uh when we talk about getting [46:38] dogs motivated the McAn method [46:40] essentially is about figuring out how to [46:42] get your dog motivated to work to to to [46:44] listen to you you know for for training [46:46] to be interesting exciting and fun but [46:48] very clear-cut rules [46:51] um I love that step that step is about [46:54] hey don't do that thing but if you work [46:57] for me if you do this sit if you we do [46:59] this trick or if you do something I just [47:01] love that sort of transfer of of not [47:04] power but like the transfer of like [47:06] leadership yeah transfer of leadership [47:08] is so it's a non-confrontational way to [47:11] say you're not allowed to do that you [47:13] need to listen to me yeah and and having [47:15] seen it multiple times uh you know in [47:18] real life you know working through it [47:19] with the dog that's when you start to [47:21] get a dog who will look to you for [47:23] information you know uh people always [47:25] say things like oh you know it's amazing [47:27] how much your dogs look at you you know [47:29] whether it's teaching classes or just in [47:30] general and people say my my dog would [47:33] never look at me well why would they why [47:36] would your dog look at you you know what [47:37] are you offering them what are you [47:39] getting them to do have they ever [47:40] learned to that just checking in with [47:43] you is worth it yeah and that doesn't [47:44] always mean food maybe it's they check [47:46] it this is cool because I see this [47:49] happen especially when we working with a [47:50] dog that's pretty high energy is they [47:51] check in with us or they turn back to us [47:54] in in a situation and kale will in this [47:56] loud bubbly voice go y good and she'll [47:58] play this game of tug with uh you know [48:01] like a puppy tug or something but she'll [48:02] have this huge game where the the the [48:05] dogs the dogs being rewarded with a toy [48:09] what's so wonderful about an interactive [48:10] toy like that is that uh it's all about [48:13] you and them like they find it so much [48:15] fun they love that interaction but um [48:18] it's also the reward that they didn't [48:21] even know was coming so in this moment [48:23] just checking in with you all of a [48:25] sudden you explode with excitement you [48:27] have a game of tug with them and they [48:28] think well gez next time I'm you know [48:31] out here why don't I just check in with [48:33] my human you know what will happen maybe [48:35] maybe it'll be just as exciting as last [48:38] time and by you know repeating these [48:40] kinds of things showing them that [48:42] remember dogs will do what what's [48:44] rewarding checking in with you on a walk [48:46] checking in with you at the park [48:47] checking in with you in the backyard [48:48] doesn't matter where it is if you make [48:51] it rewarding then they're likely to [48:52] repeat that behavior it's really really [48:55] valuable I I think we we really need to [48:59] think about leadership in a different [49:00] way I know that uh leadership in [49:03] especially in like the dog training [49:05] space a lot of people might think like [49:06] well that sounds like it's heavy-handed [49:09] boy that sounds harsh um but that's not [49:11] it at all looking for those [49:12] non-confrontational ways to get a win [49:14] with your dog to get them putting in [49:16] some effort that's exactly what the me [49:18] method is about it shouldn't be harsh no [49:21] should be har for sure yeah and you know [49:23] we want to teach you how to do it in a [49:24] way that you feel comfortable and [49:26] confident and that your puppy looks to [49:28] you for guidance and we're not using [49:30] intimidation we're not using anything [49:32] like that to get the dog to listen we're [49:34] using motivation and good information so [49:37] the dog actually says I like listening [49:40] to you more than I like not listening to [49:43] you the more than I like going and [49:45] self-serving and finding my own ways to [49:47] reward myself they look to us for those [49:50] things instead by how we deliver the [49:53] information and how we motivate them to [49:56] work for us love it instructor Robbie [49:57] leadership is about giving direction [50:00] yeah clear consistent Direction I love [50:03] that that's so important dogs do love [50:05] their leaders so we uh you you guys are [50:08] the first you at home are the first [50:10] people to know about these this product [50:12] nobody hot off the press it is hot off [50:15] the press they got here

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 136/199,~Ken === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:01] getting a new puppy does not mean you [00:03] have to sacrifice your sleep and your [00:05] sanity that's exactly why instructor [00:07] Megs going to break down four skills [00:08] that you can do every night with your [00:10] puppy so that you're only four steps [00:11] away from [00:14] this instead of [00:17] this I'm Dan welcome back to Maan [00:20] [Music] [00:23] dogs so I don't want a puppy who is [00:25] really pushy for food golden retrievers [00:27] tend to really love their food [00:30] so right yes from the get-go I want him [00:33] to learn yes not uh to [00:37] be yes impulsive with food and we can [00:41] teach this yes at a very early age just [00:44] with some simple exercises so if he gets [00:46] up to go for the treats before I've [00:47] indicated I just simply move my hand [00:49] away right now or I could close my hand [00:51] yes good but it's teaching him some nice [00:54] impulse control this way good [00:57] boy excellent job yes good yes well [01:04] done yes good [01:08] boy Genius good [01:11] man good job baby good boy okay yes good [01:16] job we did a little Shake want to do [01:19] another one good [01:20] boy yes good boy now because he is so [01:25] young I would keep this training session [01:27] um maybe between four and five minutes [01:29] that would be it I want to do a little [01:31] bit uh using some of his food probably [01:34] from his uh dinner if I was working in [01:36] the evening or his breakfast if I was [01:37] doing a little morning session he's not [01:39] going to get a lot of extra treats [01:41] during the day um what he needs right [01:43] now is a little bit of food from his [01:46] regular meals to make sure that we don't [01:47] upset his stomach good boy I am not [01:50] purposefully trying to fatigue this [01:52] puppy's body right now uh to do that I [01:55] would do more games like retrieving and [01:57] tugging and taking him for walks right [01:59] now I'm getting him to be a little bit [02:01] more mindful I want him listening I want [02:04] him learning commands I want him [02:06] learning the basics of following food [02:09] and responding to my voice my touch my [02:12] body language all things that I'm going [02:14] to utilize in our training good boy he [02:17] is moving around a little bit of course [02:19] with any of this physical stuff uh that [02:22] I'm doing but these types of exercises [02:25] are not meant to physically fatigue him [02:28] but he is going to be using his bra rain [02:30] for all of this stuff often uh we find [02:32] that puppies need that last little bit [02:34] of exercise last bit bit of training [02:36] right before bed and if I was at my own [02:39] home these are the sorts of things I [02:41] would be doing with an 11 week old puppy [02:43] teaching them how to take food yes uh [02:46] teaching them how to take food gently [02:48] teaching them how to follow food okay [02:50] good boy yes good boy yes good boy now [02:56] because I don't know what commands this [02:57] puppy knows right now I'm simply helping [03:00] him with some food yes good boy making [03:03] this a fun experience for him get it [03:07] good Stephen yes good [03:10] boy excellent job and you don't need a [03:14] lot of space to do this sort of stuff [03:16] any little training area will do in your [03:18] house ready what this get it Steph Yes [03:23] good [03:24] boy good man here po up yes good job J [03:30] ready here here here yes good man taking [03:35] that collar again excellent job I don't [03:39] even know if you know any tricks yet [03:41] good boy that's a nice sit yes good boy [03:45] look at me yes good man look at me yes [03:50] good boy and again again a puppy this [03:52] age he's not going to last that long [03:54] maybe just a few minutes of this and [03:56] then we would give him a break yeah get [03:58] that thing get that thing yeah that's a [04:00] good tug yes good boy that was excellent [04:04] yes good boy now sometimes people worry [04:07] about tugging with puppies they want to [04:08] make sure that we have good control uh [04:11] you know there's actually a a [04:12] misconception that tugging with puppies [04:14] actually makes them aggressive we really [04:16] feel differently about that we want to [04:18] make sure that we start the game yes and [04:20] stop the game in order to have good [04:22] control uh but we strongly believe in [04:24] letting puppies have fun with toys as [04:26] long as that involves playing with us as [04:28] well ready [04:31] see if he'll offer anything yes get it [04:33] good boy so I was waiting for him to [04:35] offer a sit there a little bit of [04:37] control so he's not diving for that toy [04:40] yes good boy and the moment he gave me [04:42] that sit I told him yes and get it I [04:45] have no idea if this puppy is going to [04:47] take off and go investigate this new [04:49] place he's never been to before yeah [04:51] good boy so I always have a house line [04:54] on my puppies to make sure that if at [04:56] any time he looks like he might need to [04:58] run to go to the bathroom room or he [05:00] decides just to ignore his name I can [05:02] interrupt him I can step on that line [05:04] and gently redirect him to get him to do [05:06] what I want him to do good boy I don't [05:09] want this puppy to learn that he can run [05:10] away from me that becomes a really fun [05:12] game of Catch Me If You Can uh where I [05:15] am the loser and he is the winner every [05:17] single time often after my puppies have [05:19] had a lot of fun with me I've tired them [05:22] out both physically and mentally it [05:24] might be time for both of us to chill [05:26] now this can happen with my puppy in a [05:29] crate or an expen there's nothing wrong [05:31] with that there's nothing wrong with [05:33] giving your puppy time to just go back [05:35] go away for a little bit this might [05:37] allow you to finish up your nighttime [05:39] routine some of the dishes that had to [05:41] get done uh maybe even getting [05:43] everything done that you normally do [05:44] before you to go to bed or simply having [05:47] a moment to yourself where you sit and [05:48] watch a show if the puppy can learn how [05:52] to settle and relax with you I think [05:54] this is also a very valuable skill that [05:56] I try to teach my puppies from a very [05:58] young age my goal is to have dogs that [06:01] know to either lie at my feet while I'm [06:03] relaxing on the couch or as you can see [06:05] since he's such a young puppy I'm just [06:06] sitting beside him here on the floor uh [06:09] I want them to learn how to have an off [06:11] switch now because he's a really young [06:14] puppy I like to help my dogs uh to be [06:17] successful when they're just learning [06:18] this so I will make it more valuable for [06:21] him to relax here and less likely for [06:23] him to go investigate other places in [06:25] the house so I've given him a really [06:27] valuable chew again something he's never [06:29] seen before I will often even hold this [06:32] chew with my own dogs when I'm relaxing [06:34] with them I want them to know that they [06:36] don't have to guard this item from me [06:38] I'm not going to take it away I might [06:40] even make chewing easier for them by [06:41] holding it for them sometimes I will um [06:45] uh let go of the puppies chew of course [06:47] and just let them relax with it this [06:49] might last five minutes it might last 10 [06:51] minutes if I'm lucky I don't want them [06:54] to be chewing on something like this for [06:56] a terribly long period of time uh so [06:58] once he's had a little bit time with [06:59] this I might take it away see if he's [07:02] able to relax on his own I could always [07:04] switch this out for something else like [07:06] a Kong or a nylon bone um but right now [07:09] he seems quite content with this so if I [07:11] was at home uh in the evening with my [07:13] puppy I'd probably let him chew this for [07:15] a little while if he got restless I can [07:18] always redirect him using the line so if [07:20] he was to get off of the bed I simply [07:22] show him that the rules of this game are [07:25] that you're not allowed to wander all [07:26] over the living room you're not allowed [07:28] to jump up on the couch you're not [07:30] allowed to go investigate what the cat [07:31] is doing during this time the only thing [07:34] you are allowed to do is remain on this [07:36] bed beside me I don't care if he's [07:38] sitting I don't care if he's lying down [07:40] I don't even care if he's moving around [07:41] and on his back with all four legs in [07:43] the air his only job is to remain on [07:46] this bed until he hears otherwise that [07:48] he's allowed to get up now we are just [07:50] scratching the surface on all these [07:51] skills and Concepts but if you want more [07:54] in-depth training and support you're [07:56] going to want to check out our online [07:57] and in-person dog training programs for [07:59] that check out the link in the [08:01] description below we want our puppies to [08:03] learn to go to the bathroom anytime we [08:05] need them to this is going to be [08:07] achieved by setting them up the exact [08:09] same way every single time we take them [08:11] out so when Stephen goes out for a potty [08:13] break we're going to take him out on [08:15] leash every single time and to really [08:18] help him we're going to take him to the [08:19] same location in the yard every single [08:21] time when he starts going to the [08:23] bathroom when he's actively peeing or [08:25] actively pooping we're going to repeat a [08:26] command over and over again I personally [08:28] use the command hurry up so as the [08:30] puppy's going to the bathroom I repeat [08:32] hurry up hurry up hurry up this allows [08:35] me to get the puppy to go to the [08:36] bathroom quickly anytime I need them to [08:40] now for a puppy to last all night long I [08:43] don't want to give them a whole lot of [08:45] food and water right before I put them [08:46] to bed so often after that very last [08:49] training session of the evening maybe an [08:51] hour or an hour and a half before I go [08:53] to bed I will offer him some water I [08:56] want to make sure that he has anything [08:57] he needs after that training session [08:59] after that I take the water away we [09:02] don't need to do multiple hours [09:03] especially during the hot summer months [09:05] we do need to make sure that water is [09:06] available to the puppy especially if [09:08] they're going to be going for an eight [09:09] hour night we don't want to take it away [09:11] for much much longer than that but we [09:13] don't want them to be guzzling water [09:15] right before they go to bed so after [09:17] that last training session I take that [09:19] water away I will let him go to the [09:21] bathroom one more time just before bed [09:23] but he's not going to get anything else [09:25] from me now that you know how to get [09:27] your sleep and your sanity back it's [09:28] important to figure out your dog [09:30] training plan to do that you're going to [09:32] want to check out that video right there [09:33] and on that note I'm Dan happy training

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 148/199,~Ken === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] there is a very good chance that without [00:02] even knowing it you're teaching your [00:04] puppy not to be motivated by toys that's [00:06] why in this video instructor m going to [00:08] break down exactly what you're doing [00:09] wrong and how to get your puppy not only [00:11] to like toys but to love toys I'm Dan [00:14] welcome back to M [00:17] [Music] [00:19] dogs too often people leave toys out for [00:22] their dogs to play with whenever they [00:24] want so that dog is going to be far less [00:27] likely to want to play and tug and [00:29] retreat with you because this is an item [00:32] that's just been sitting around on their [00:33] living room floor all day long if you [00:36] want to build good toy drive for your [00:38] dog make the dog work for that toy and [00:41] make the toy less accessible to them [00:44] don't leave the toy lying around on the [00:46] floor the dog can pick that up whenever [00:48] they want instead put it away have a toy [00:50] basket a toy box tease them with it [00:53] after the end of the training session [00:54] put it up nice and high somewhere they [00:56] can't get it and do not bring that toy [00:58] out until you are ready to play and [01:00] engage with the dog again toy drive is [01:02] built by making the toy exciting and [01:05] engaging with you don't have the toy [01:07] lying around instead have that toy [01:10] something that only comes out when you [01:12] are going to be tugging retrieving [01:15] playing with them and it helps to build [01:18] the the value of working with you and [01:20] helps to build your relationship with [01:22] the dog the only toys that I would leave [01:24] out on my floor would be chew items [01:27] something like a nyab bone um maybe a [01:29] com for my dog you will never see a rope [01:32] toy a tug toy lying around on my floor [01:36] and and can we call these toys [01:38] interactive toys and there's a reason [01:40] for that we are interacting with the dog [01:43] every single time we play with those [01:45] toys so those toys only come out to [01:48] build value for me working for me and [01:51] our relationship it becomes exciting [01:54] because they don't get it all the time [01:55] often we see people motivating their dog [01:58] with the wrong toy want to make sure [02:00] that the toy is something that I can [02:03] stimulate my dog with making it look a [02:05] little bit like prey I like to choose [02:07] long toys soft fuzzy toys something that [02:10] I can drag around on the ground if your [02:13] dog is absolutely ball crazy no problem [02:16] but put that ball in a string something [02:18] that you can drag around and have them [02:19] chase it still engage with you and tug [02:21] with you not something that they can [02:23] choose to run out grab and then sit [02:26] there by themselves we want it to be [02:28] something that they always want to bring [02:29] back to you for engagement and tugging [02:31] uh and playing with them helps to build [02:33] that retrieve and makes it really really [02:35] strong all these Concepts that Meg's [02:37] talking about in this video are things [02:39] that we cover in our online and [02:40] in-person dog training programs so make [02:42] sure you check out our website www.

welcome back welcome [00:05] back to maand dogs there's like a pause [00:08] there that's uh I believe it's called a [00:11] millennial pause or pregnant pause [00:12] what's he going to say next is what it's [00:14] called you always have these [00:15] informations don't you yeah all right we [00:18] need to talk about the first one win [00:20] that you can get every single morning [00:22] with your dog and I think this is [00:23] something that people for the most part [00:25] they naturally try to do but they make a [00:28] lot of mistakes when it comes to this [00:30] first win um we're going to talk about [00:32] some of the mistakes and how you can [00:34] avoid them but the very first win this [00:36] is especially important if you have a [00:37] puppy that you're currently potty [00:39] training but it's also important if you [00:41] have a any dog in training Al even a [00:43] senior dog like you can apply some of [00:45] these things to your senior dog because [00:47] you want to make sure that you're giving [00:48] them great information before you leave [00:50] for the day let's talk about the first [00:52] one that you can get with your pup um [00:55] well first things first especially if [00:57] you do have a puppy that they're in um [00:59] like their house training uh stage of of [01:02] learning um I think it's pretty easy [01:04] when we are our puppies wake up we sort [01:06] of think the first thing we need to do [01:07] is get them outside and go to the [01:08] bathroom quickly and and let them um [01:10] relieve themselves because it's been a [01:12] long night but that's actually a great [01:13] time to start teaching your dog how to [01:16] ask you to go out we find that really [01:17] really helpful a great skill to have is [01:20] to have your dog be able to indicate to [01:21] you when they need to go out so kind of [01:23] shifts a bit of the responsibility to [01:25] them so that we don't have to be um [01:27] quite so rigid with letting them out you [01:29] know every amount of hours um in the [01:31] morning though rather than rushing them [01:33] outside right away uh perhaps just put [01:35] them down in the kitchen and see what [01:37] behaviors they they do they could look a [01:39] little panicky and run to the door and [01:41] now you have your first indication which [01:42] is great or maybe they don't know the [01:45] rules of the the house quite yet and [01:46] they just you know go to the bathroom [01:49] right there in front of you and then [01:50] again kind of great because you can have [01:52] an opportunity to to um let them know [01:54] that that's not appropriate and get them [01:55] outside so that's a great thing to do in [01:57] the morning that can lead to faster um [02:00] faster process so so I mean there are [02:02] two big Parts there number one the first [02:04] win is getting your dog to pee or poop [02:06] when you go outside first thing in the [02:07] morning I mean it's pretty natural um [02:09] but the second win especially if you [02:11] have a puppy in who's learning potty [02:13] training is teaching them to let you [02:16] know it's time to go out or learning the [02:18] signals so that you know your puppy [02:21] needs to go out cu every puppy will be a [02:23] little different in terms 100% yeah I [02:25] know we have a a handful of potty [02:28] training videos for puppies that um talk [02:31] about getting your dog to come to you or [02:32] letting you know and I know a lot of [02:34] people are like I I'm just not seeing it [02:36] I don't know what it looks like we [02:37] actually shot a video when we had I [02:40] think it was five alive that [02:42] specifically captured the moment he was [02:44] starting to understand this yes and um [02:47] this is because of good practice at that [02:49] at the door at the door that leads [02:51] outside first thing in the morning [02:53] because you know your puppy or your dog [02:55] in training needs to go so when you put [02:57] them in that situation and and you've [02:59] already sort of rehearsed going in and [03:01] out a few times they're likely going to [03:03] indicate to that door or indicate to you [03:05] like hey what's going on here five even [03:08] went to the door and then was like [03:09] you're not paying attention to me and [03:11] then he kind of came over towards us and [03:13] it was like oh my gosh look at him he's [03:15] trying to communicate with us and we [03:17] were able to to pick up on those signs [03:19] yeah so so that first win um not only is [03:22] it like your dog going out and doing [03:24] their business outside but it's also you [03:26] going out with them if you have a dog in [03:28] training going out with them allows you [03:30] to know whether they have gone pee and [03:32] poo you know maybe they've done one or [03:33] the other and you don't want to set [03:36] yourself up for failure by coming back [03:37] in too early MH one of the challenges I [03:41] think people um Overlook or one of the [03:44] things I think what's up go and lay down [03:48] just chill the the tick tick tick on the [03:51] floor behind me is driving me bonkers oh [03:54] um one of the things I think that people [03:55] Overlook is uh supervision when they go [03:58] out when they when they goes out uh or [04:01] even in the morning if they're not [04:02] paying attention if you're not sort of [04:04] if you're not going you know to the door [04:06] with intention to try and find a sign [04:09] you know you're looking at your phone [04:10] you're getting your coffee or whatever [04:11] you're doing put your shoes on you're [04:13] not paying attention to the puppy um [04:14] sometimes the puppies are giving signs [04:16] but we're not seeing it but you're right [04:18] worse is outside you know we let our [04:20] puppies out we're not really paying [04:21] attention or a lot of people don't even [04:23] realize because they don't know that [04:25] they shouldn't do this but they give [04:26] their puppies too much Freedom they let [04:28] the puppy go outside completely off [04:30] leash or without a a line or anything [04:32] and when you have a puppy who doesn't [04:33] have a recall that's curious about [04:35] everything that wants to put everything [04:37] in their mouth um you know it's really [04:40] easy for them to make lots of mistakes [04:41] so the other one that you can get is [04:43] being able to go outside get business [04:45] done you know get some great listening [04:47] in and then get back inside with any [04:49] catastrophes yeah and the way that [04:51] you're going to do that is be proactive [04:53] so we highly recommend when you take [04:55] your puppy outside for any for any [04:57] reason um to use a um you know a leash [05:00] or even better because the leash doesn't [05:02] really give the dog a lot of freedom um [05:04] and then they end up rehearsing a lot of [05:06] pulling before they know not to um but [05:08] we love to use like a long line we have [05:10] like a 20 foot line sometimes longer um [05:13] we actually we have the maand dog's 21 [05:15] foot uh long line for small breeds and [05:18] uh regular dogs yeah um it's great it it [05:21] is that is such a useful tool um we [05:24] actually have them available at Mand do.
document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 163/199,[05:26] store I think in fact the last train [05:28] station we were on I think we launched [05:30] them we've sold out of them twice so uh [05:33] they really are fantastic though they [05:34] are amazing I used one last weekend with [05:36] that puppy that I said that we were [05:37] babysitting for the weekend and I kept [05:39] coming inside and being like Ken our [05:41] long lines are so good yeah they're so [05:43] so light and easy to use and Tangle very [05:47] much great but the uh functionality of [05:50] the long line is so important in this [05:52] situation let me know drop in the chat [05:55] are you guilty of this you get up in the [05:56] morning and you let your puppy out in [05:58] the backyard or you get up in the [05:59] morning you let your puppy out in [06:00] whatever stay inside stand on the deck [06:03] and don't with your puppy yeah and it's [06:05] a it's a really common mistake I think I [06:07] think a lot I mean I hear a lot of [06:08] people uh say that they they are doing [06:10] this and you miss out on a few important [06:12] opportunities we're going to talk in a [06:14] moment about uh another win that you can [06:16] get and why it's important but as to [06:19] Kale's Point like going out there with [06:20] them also you can help them do their [06:24] thing by keeping them from getting [06:26] distracted you know using that long line [06:28] using that leash to keep them from just [06:30] you know wandering around uh if you just [06:33] stand like a post you know you don't let [06:34] them sniff around in circles you don't [06:36] let them do a perimeter runs uh because [06:39] they're full of beans at that point in [06:40] the morning and you know really [06:42] interested especially if they're a young [06:43] dog really interested in the environment [06:46] so if you can uh you know have them [06:48] focused just a little bit you're going [06:50] to be more successful you're going to be [06:52] more efficient and so are they because [06:54] you're going to know that they've done [06:55] their business and it's going to happen [06:57] a lot more quickly in fact we have a [06:58] video that talks a lot about about well [07:00] talk specifically about how to teach [07:01] your dog to go uh potty on command uh [07:04] that maybe Dan can drop in the chat but [07:06] I know a lot of people will say like [07:08] well I watched your uh puppy Vlogs why [07:11] did you say hurry up why are you telling [07:12] that dog to hurry up and I think people [07:14] think that you're like being rude or [07:17] something it's the funniest thing you're [07:18] like hurry up hurry up oh because they [07:20] think why are you tell yeah let the dog [07:22] do it on their own time they're like [07:23] I'll give you a break yeah well I'm I'm [07:25] just going to put her in a kand why [07:26] don't you just just mention how you you [07:28] can cue that yeah I guess I've just [07:30] always said hurry up I really don't [07:31] think about it it's just my command I am [07:33] just not like the type of person that [07:36] would like go to a park and be like give [07:38] Mommy a pee pee give Mommy a poo poo [07:40] it's just not it's not my jam so I've [07:43] always said hurry up for my dogs to go [07:46] pee and this one's probably even funnier [07:49] or even weirder I say duties for the dog [07:51] to go poo and like I guess my parents [07:55] did it I was raised with those words and [07:56] so I don't really think anything else of [07:58] it uh but I mean realistically I do want [08:03] my my dogs to pee quickly um literally a [08:07] funny McAn family story when I was [08:09] younger my dad and I used to go to [08:11] competitions and in the morning we'd you [08:14] know take all the dogs outside to do [08:15] their business before we would like get [08:16] them in the car and go to the [08:18] competition and my dad and I would [08:20] compete to see whose dogs would like do [08:24] their business the fastest [08:27] and right here winter every time and I [08:29] even had more dogs that had to go to the [08:31] bathroom with him but uh yeah we do want [08:34] them to hurry up because if it's raining [08:36] if you're late like we don't need to [08:37] stand outside for 10 years like let's go [08:39] outside let's get it done because that [08:40] leads more time for training that leads [08:42] more time for playing that leads more [08:43] time for moving on so yeah there you go [08:47] um we talked a little bit about um [08:49] maintaining control of your dog at the [08:51] start of the day when you're going [08:52] outside for their their uh time to do [08:55] their thing um whether it's a leash a [08:58] house line or a long line Line This is [09:00] actually the second win you can get to [09:02] start your day is maintaining control of [09:04] your dog to begin the day for a bunch of [09:07] reasons remember we're talking about [09:09] efficiency we want you to be as [09:11] efficient as you can be whether you have [09:13] to go drive away to work whether you [09:15] work from home whether you're just [09:16] trying to start your dog with great [09:18] leadership in the morning that means the [09:21] moment they come out of their kennel or [09:22] crate or where wherever they're coming [09:23] out of I want you to put a leash or a [09:25] house line on them or a long line on [09:26] them if you're going outside H maintain [09:29] control because the last remember [09:32] they're just getting up they'll do their [09:33] Big Stretch and you're going to say oh [09:35] what a big stretch I mean it's reflexive [09:37] I totally get it but then they're going [09:38] to want to you know search the world [09:40] they're probably going to want to go do [09:41] their own thing and this is it's really [09:43] important that as you begin your day you [09:45] maintain a little bit of control so that [09:47] you can be efficient and so that you can [09:49] take advantage of a couple of the next [09:51] wins that we want you to get having [09:54] control at this point is so beneficial [09:57] because it takes this um if you don't [09:59] this 10-minute training plan that can be [10:01] you know really uh uh you know dense and [10:04] full of activity and exercise now the [10:07] dog's kind of choosing I don't really [10:08] want to uh pay attention to you right [10:10] now I want to go chase the cat around or [10:12] you know I'm interested in the kids [10:13] running around upstairs as they get up [10:16] uh really focusing on maintaining some [10:18] control with a house line a leash or a [10:21] long line is going to be beneficial and [10:23] this is actually a win that you can get [10:24] in the morning let's talk a little bit [10:26] about leadership and uh Freedom when it [10:28] comes to dogs and train yeah that's [10:30] literally what I was hoping just to to [10:32] step in with next is that you know [10:34] speaking of Segway yeah um that you know [10:37] having a line on and and again we're not [10:39] talking about like dragging our dogs [10:41] around or anything like that we're [10:42] talking about giving you something that [10:44] you can use to follow through when you [10:45] ask your dog to do something um because [10:48] that's really where leadership comes so [10:51] to us the more leadership you have the [10:53] more your dog views you as a leader and [10:55] we don't mean in like a dictatorship [10:57] like they need to listen to everything [10:58] you need you kind of thing I mean they [11:00] do but like not in a negative way um but [11:03] the more they learn to listen to you [11:05] that leak comes down to to leadership [11:07] and that comes down to a dog that [11:09] actually is listening because they want [11:11] to do things for you they're not waiting [11:14] for that treat they're not waiting for [11:16] you to beg them for some with something [11:17] they're not waiting you to for you to [11:19] say it five or six times before they [11:21] feel like getting around to to listening [11:24] um you know we want them to to listen [11:25] quickly and efficiently and um you know [11:28] just with the ability follow through and [11:30] you ask your dog to do something so they [11:31] can't just ignore you or do their own [11:33] thing it elevates your leadership so [11:35] much and what that does it starts to [11:37] strength in your relationship so that [11:38] you know when you go to teach them that [11:40] new thing or you go to take them to that [11:41] new place you have a better rapport with [11:43] your dog and then these challenges that [11:46] you end up getting um become a little [11:49] bit easier um every single time uh so I [11:52] think that that's really um important to [11:54] think about that follow through um even [11:57] using the puppy that we had on the [11:58] weekend um he's such a nice little guy [12:01] you probably have seen him on our our [12:02] YouTube channel before he belongs to one [12:04] of our instructors but um he hasn't [12:06] really spent much time with me he [12:07] doesn't really know me that well and [12:08] when I would take him outside to do his [12:10] business or go outside and play with him [12:11] a little bit I would keep the long line [12:13] on him but he's a young puppy so a [12:15] squirrel goes by he's really interested [12:17] in Birds um and then he would just kind [12:19] of Disconnect from me and I would like [12:21] call him to come back in the house and [12:22] he would be like hold on there's like a [12:24] bird over here and the average person [12:26] would a call the puppy again or be like [12:29] oh he doesn't really want to come in [12:30] right now he's looking at the bird or [12:32] like dog trainer brain I would say I [12:34] asked him to do something I need him to [12:36] follow through so I could just you know [12:37] use the line to redirect his attention [12:39] and then he sort of learned within two [12:42] days of having him that he needed to [12:44] listen every day that I had him he [12:46] listened better he was more connected [12:48] because I followed through and I never [12:50] had to raise my voice I never had to get [12:52] mad at him I never had to beg him um so [12:55] that's where that that control starts [12:57] and that's something that you need to do [12:58] all the time and and that's actually [12:59] what we consider training I think [13:01] sometimes when people think about you [13:02] know training your dog they think about [13:04] that like 10 15 20 30 minutes that you [13:06] set aside to like work on training your [13:09] dog to do a thing a skill what we're [13:11] talking about here is all the in [13:14] betweeny times you know what are you how [13:16] are you maintaining control of your dog [13:18] when you're not actually actively having [13:21] like a training session what does your [13:23] every day-to-day stuff look like what [13:25] does going outside for a pee look like [13:26] what does Meal Time look like what does [13:28] going for a walk look like what does you [13:30] know at the end of the night when you're [13:31] trying to sit down and watch a movie [13:32] with your family what does that look [13:34] like those are the things that we're [13:36] talking about here the inet training [13:38] sessions where we have um just a a [13:41] better way to control our dogs so that [13:43] they're learning to listen all of the [13:44] time um since we started this show we've [13:47] sold uh some house or some long lines [13:49] great I'm going to let you know right [13:51] now for those of you who are with us [13:53] live right now we have one regular house [13:57] line left or long line left uhoh there's [13:59] literally one somebody just sent me a [14:01] message there's one we have a bunch of [14:02] small breed long lines left but if [14:04] you're interested right now is the time [14:06] we actually have classes in the building [14:08] tonight as well so uh if this is [14:10] something you're like maybe I should [14:11] maybe I shouldn't there's one left I [14:13] know you guys can't see that on your end [14:15] but somebody just sent me a message [14:17] super valuable training tool can I say [14:19] something unrelated I saw somebody [14:20] asking about um my agility if I'm ever [14:22] going to post more agility videos um Aon [14:25] was kind enough to share um on the mchan [14:28] agility YouTube channel Chan but I'm [14:29] going to admit I'm terrible about [14:31] posting there uh if you want to watch [14:33] agility stuff go to the I'm way better [14:35] at [14:36] Instagram that's where you're going to [14:37] find most of the stuff is agility [14:39] Instagram and uh p uh patreon for uh [14:43] people who are for people who are doing [14:45] agil good but okay let's talk about the [14:48] third win that you can get every single [14:49] morning if you have a dog in training or [14:51] generally if you have a dog you know [14:53] it's funny how you view dog ownership in [14:56] in uh the world differently when you're [14:57] a dog trainer because you see some of [14:59] the ad advantageous choices that you can [15:02] make uh every single day with your dogs [15:03] who have a dog who like has more fun [15:07] listens better wants to listen lives a [15:09] longer life is generally just like [15:11] thriving constantly uh and that is [15:14] mental exercise is often overlooked and [15:18] we're still talking about those 10 [15:19] minutes at the start of your day things [15:21] that you can do to get your dog or your [15:24] puppy or your you know a new dog to you [15:27] engaged and using their brain a little [15:30] bit some of the exercises that we'll [15:32] often do with a a puppy or a dog in [15:35] training is could be as simple as luring [15:38] you know we're not we're not talking [15:39] about solving problems and we're not [15:41] talking necessarily about doing tricks I [15:44] mean this is if you have a little bit [15:45] older dog with a great you know some [15:47] skills then maybe we are working on [15:49] tricks but it can be as simple as luring [15:51] we talk a little bit about like you know [15:53] the five minute or thre minute uh uh [15:55] training plan we might do with a handful [15:57] of kibble yep [15:59] yeah I think anything we're getting to [16:00] your dog to problem solve is going to be [16:02] important one of the things that I [16:03] really like to do with my dogs um if I [16:05] only have like five or 10 minutes to [16:07] spare is even do trick training or [16:10] anything to do with like impulse control [16:11] and manner so um we actually I don't [16:14] know if we have any videos about this on [16:15] the channel yet or not but we certainly [16:18] focus a lot on this in our our our [16:20] actual programs but we teach a lot of [16:22] like rule out games where the dogs sort [16:25] of are faced with distractions right in [16:26] front of them and they're sort of [16:28] trained and taught to um you know [16:31] understand not to go for the distraction [16:33] in order to earn rewards and they sort [16:35] of have to problem solve and and um go [16:37] through the thinking process a little [16:39] bit independently and it's a great way [16:41] to kind of make them use their brains [16:43] and often five or 10 minutes of this [16:46] type of training can really Tire a dog [16:48] it's like having them Write a math test [16:50] like they have to really use their brain [16:51] to think through it so any type of rule [16:53] out games I find can be a really really [16:55] great way to Tire your dog up mentally [16:58] fast [16:59] um anything to do with problem solving [17:01] and self-control like I said um or [17:04] sometimes it could be you know tricks [17:05] like teaching your dog to spin or back [17:07] up or Shake A Paw or do anything that [17:10] sort of gets them moving but thinking at [17:13] the same time um you know believe it or [17:16] not like going outside and throwing a [17:17] ball for your dog for 10 minutes might [17:20] make them physically tired you know the [17:22] first 20 times that you do it but some [17:25] dogs will start to build up a tolerance [17:27] um and then that t times that you throw [17:29] the ball needs to turn into 20 needs to [17:31] turn into 30 before they're actually [17:33] tired but if you can mix in something [17:36] that's mental that makes them think [17:37] about things problem solve even just [17:39] throwing in some weights or stays things [17:42] like that um it will double the amount [17:46] of time that it takes to um Tire a dog [17:49] out and it tires dogs a happy dog and a [17:51] more well- behaved dog yeah for sure um [17:54] you know kale talked about a little bit [17:57] about uh falling food working on a stay [18:00] uh following food is a valuable skill [18:01] especially if you have a young dog in [18:02] training or a puppy that needs to learn [18:05] that it's worth putting in effort you [18:07] know sometimes people say like well my [18:10] dog's just not that interested in food [18:11] well maybe you haven't helped them learn [18:13] that it's worth it to follow food so [18:16] when we have a puppy and you if you've [18:18] seen any of our puppy Vlogs or you've [18:19] seen some of our morning videos we talk [18:22] a lot about uh taking your dog's meal [18:24] their their their breakfast and then [18:26] working with that it could be like [18:28] following through your legs maybe it's [18:29] just turning around in a circle maybe [18:31] it's simply luring into your shins so [18:33] that they're nice and close and [18:35] rewarding them for that making it really [18:37] easy and once they start to get the hang [18:39] of that then you can increase the [18:40] challenge a little bit I love Where kill [18:42] went with the idea of something like a [18:43] stay I would say that a stay is one of [18:47] the most important skills that you're [18:48] going to teach your dog in their entire [18:51] life and it has absolutely nothing to do [18:54] with its utility the fact I've I've [18:57] can't I can't even think of a Time [18:59] hard for people to wrap their head [19:00] around let's talk about just just I just [19:01] want to talk about stay so that maybe [19:03] this gets you interested in teaching it [19:05] to your dog we talk about the benefit of [19:07] a stay definitely we can talk about the [19:09] benefit of stay and the fact uh the [19:11] benefit of the stay on how we teach it [19:12] though because I think sometimes people [19:14] like oh yeah stay my dog can stay and [19:16] then they do the old tell the dog to sit [19:18] they snap and they put a treat in front [19:20] make the dog sit for 3 seconds and then [19:21] say [19:23] okay any dog like that's any dog can do [19:26] that it's very very simple it's not [19:27] really staying that doesn't I mean it [19:29] takes a bit of self-control to do that [19:31] but that's not really what we're talking [19:32] about here we're talking about a dog [19:34] that can learn to um hold any position [19:37] that you leave them in sit stand down [19:38] whatever it might be and if you tell [19:40] them to stay you only have to stay at [19:42] once and they understand to remain there [19:45] not lying down halfway through if you [19:47] leave left them in the sit not shimmying [19:49] closer to that distraction over there [19:51] literally staying in the same spot no [19:53] matter what's happening around them [19:55] whether that's um people other dogs food [19:59] tennis balls you know in our classes and [20:01] in our proofing training we have people [20:03] ride on skateboards and do all kinds of [20:05] crazy things to teach do moving around [20:07] them yeah so that you stay put no matter [20:09] what um so that we're able to go back to [20:12] the dog and release him from that stay [20:15] and um the cool thing about it is yes [20:17] the dog learns to stay there that's [20:19] great but really what the dog learns is [20:21] that they have to do something that you [20:24] say they have to they have to follow [20:26] through with a rule that you have and [20:28] what's great about it is because it's [20:31] very black and white for somebody to [20:32] teach they're either staying or they're [20:33] not so this allows handlers even the [20:37] greenest of handlers even the greenest [20:38] of students to be able to teach it [20:41] because it's very black and white you're [20:43] either doing it or you're not doing it [20:45] which that allows some consistency to be [20:47] built into the information and now the [20:49] dog goes gosh you're so clear this is [20:51] very easy for me to understand um and [20:54] you can sort of lay out an expectation [20:56] that you can follow through with and [20:58] that lesson in itself um is just so [21:02] instrumental in other lessons that your [21:05] dog's going to learn in other aspects of [21:07] their life um you know to be perfectly [21:09] honest with you I rarely use this day [21:11] with my dogs we have another um command [21:14] that we use called weight which is sort [21:16] of like a temporary stay and I would use [21:18] I would venture to say I use that [21:21] multiple times a day every single day um [21:24] because I don't really use stay but they [21:26] have the same Essence well I mean [21:28] because of the utility of the weight I [21:29] mean it it might mean uh don't move [21:32] forward anymore it might mean hang out [21:33] there for a second uh don't jump up it [21:36] might mean uh you know remain in that [21:38] sitting position that I just left you in [21:39] it might mean all a million different [21:41] things but um it is like a uh what's the [21:45] word I'm looking for a temporary uh [21:47] version of the stay command but think of [21:49] how simple the stay is for you to [21:52] understand for your dog to understand [21:53] all you have to do is don't move at all [21:56] yeah and I'll reward you for that this [21:58] is why I think this day is a great [22:00] exercise even for the uh you know newest [22:02] handlers to to work on but it's also a [22:06] great opportunity to exercise your dog's [22:08] brain in the kitchen in your living room [22:10] maybe it's in your sun room you know uh [22:12] after you just come in from outside [22:14] first thing in the morning with your dog [22:15] these mental exercises are really great [22:18] now kale mentioned uh little bit of [22:21] physical exercise which is the third win [22:23] that you want to Fourth win that you [22:26] want to get in your day but I know a lot [22:29] of people think well you know we'll get [22:30] up I'll get up nice and early we're [22:32] going to go to for a walk and we're [22:36] going to go to the mailbox and back and [22:38] then you know uh really what's going to [22:40] happen is the dog's going to drag the [22:41] person to and from but there's some re [22:44] way better ways that you can build [22:46] relationship uh teach some leadership [22:49] teach your dog a new skill when it comes [22:51] to physical exercise that has that [22:54] really doesn't have anything to do with [22:55] walks um let's talk about one of our [22:57] most favorite games with any dog in [22:59] training and why we love it so much yeah [23:02] favorite one of the favorite games that [23:03] we'll play with our dogs is teaching [23:05] them um to play tug with us so um you [23:08] know having the dog be able to grab onto [23:10] the toy and tug and play and growl and [23:12] have lots of fun but the other reason [23:14] why we love it so much is a it it's a [23:17] quick way to Tire a dog out because it's [23:19] very physical but B it's also a great [23:22] way to establish leadership with the dog [23:25] in a very non-confrontational easy way [23:27] so when we play tug um with our dogs we [23:31] Implement some rules that um allow the [23:34] dog to kind of know that we're in the [23:36] driver's seat so for example if we hold [23:38] a toy above them they're not allowed to [23:40] grab onto it until we give them [23:41] permission so we'll have a phrase or a [23:44] command that we'll use that says go nuts [23:46] let's have fun together um you usually [23:48] say get it or we literally say tug and [23:50] the dog grabs the toy and we'll tug and [23:52] we'll tug and we'll play when we're done [23:54] tugging and playing we'll also train the [23:57] dogs to release the it item the first [23:59] time that we ask and this is a great way [24:01] to teach an out command or a drop it [24:03] whatever you want to say because that [24:05] also could be used if my puppy's outside [24:07] and he picks up something off the ground [24:08] that he's not supposed to or if he gets [24:10] a shoe in his mouth or if he gets grabs [24:12] a tea towel off the stove he's had [24:14] experience he's been trained to listen [24:16] when I say out or drop it um we have [24:19] certain methods of training that we that [24:21] we do to teach this um and that way the [24:23] dogs can have fun they can let their [24:25] hair down they can have a lots lots of [24:27] of of uh activity but there is some [24:30] control involved um and then the cool [24:32] thing about playing tug with your dog is [24:34] that then can lead into playing fetch a [24:36] retrieve and again our expectation is [24:39] that they can have lots of fun but that [24:41] you don't like go and grab the toy and [24:42] then run around the backyard for 5 [24:43] minutes before you bring it back we want [24:46] them to think that the toy is associ [24:48] associated with us so if my dogs go to [24:51] grab a toy the very first thing first [24:54] thing they think about is to turn around [24:56] and bring it back to me as fast as they [24:57] can to play tug because that's the first [25:00] game that they learn is that playing tug [25:02] and and being with me and um we get to [25:04] the point where I'll play tug and I'll [25:06] let go of the toy and kind of push the [25:07] puppy away gently and then what they'll [25:09] do is jump back at me with the toy and [25:11] I'll grab the toy and push them away [25:13] with the toy so they start of say hey [25:14] keep playing with me so when they pick a [25:16] toy up they want to just bring it back [25:18] and bring it back and they know that the [25:20] tug is way more fun if I'm involved um [25:24] because of the way that we teach it um [25:26] but I've always [25:29] retrieving is actually tug and [25:31] retrieving I would say is something that [25:34] I train my dogs to do um before they [25:37] before they learn to walk on a leash [25:39] before they have um you know a a a super [25:42] reliable recall I'm already teaching [25:44] fetch um which also actually helps with [25:47] recoil training if I'm being perfectly [25:48] honest um because they're learning to [25:51] come back because it's fun because it's [25:53] fun totally um so it starts to get them [25:55] thinking about gosh I really like [25:56] running and chasing after her so much [25:58] fun there's lots of play involved [26:00] there's lots of reward involved um but I [26:02] put a lot of value on it because I know [26:05] it is a very quick and efficient way to [26:07] Tire my dogs out with something that [26:10] builds a bond between us that teaches [26:12] control that tires their mind that tires [26:14] their body so that by the time they need [26:17] to go in their crate and I need to whip [26:18] out the door to do whatever I do my dog [26:20] is being left you know very content [26:23] they've had all the things that they [26:24] need um and I will say some dogs are [26:27] crazy czy about playing tug right off [26:29] the bat like it's a very natural thing [26:31] they want to do sometimes dogs are even [26:33] over the top overzealous and we have to [26:34] work a little bit more on the control [26:35] aspect and then there's some dogs who [26:37] are not necessarily naturally interested [26:41] in toys and a lot of people will just [26:42] give up right away but there's actually [26:44] all kinds of training you can do to get [26:45] them more um interested in playing with [26:47] toys and in my opinion it's it is an [26:50] exercise that's worth working on because [26:53] of the value that it will bring in all [26:56] kinds of aspects of your of training [26:58] with your dog besides the one that we've [27:00] listed tonight I I I I couldn't agree [27:02] more this is one of those hacks that [27:03] I've understood and I've seen sort of [27:05] happen the light bulbs have gone on for [27:07] students as a dog trainer when you teach [27:10] something like this tug any sort of any [27:12] sort of interactive play uh rad was the [27:16] easiest dog to teach a fetch to because [27:18] he loved to tug and as soon as we [27:20] brought out a frisbee that he he could [27:21] tug on we would throw the disc out and [27:24] the best part I mean maybe you have a [27:26] dog at home who will go to get a thing [27:27] and then they'll lie down halfway you [27:29] know they're really good at going out to [27:30] get the thing and then they won't come [27:32] back well if you've really emphasized [27:34] the uh the ending the interactive part [27:37] of that thing you can actually have a [27:39] great retrieve because your dog will [27:40] bring the object back to you you can [27:42] play tug ask them to out and now you can [27:44] throw it again um R's a great example he [27:47] was just so intense on the drive back I [27:49] think you actually encouraged him to [27:51] jump up like into your chest as well [27:53] which you know may have heightened some [27:54] of that enthusiasm but um you know it [27:57] it's such a it's such a valuable skill I [27:59] also love that time that you spend with [28:01] them it's they understand that this [28:04] thing is good because you're here with [28:06] me this tug toy is great because I'm [28:08] doing it with you um you know that's [28:11] such a powerful moment uh to show your [28:14] dog that you're worth listening to [28:15] because I know we all think like oh I [28:17] love them and they must love me uh but [28:20] sometimes you need to work a little [28:21] harder to get a little bit you get them [28:23] to listen better to get them to put in a [28:25] little more effort these are really [28:27] valuable decisions that you can make [28:29] like using an interactive toy uh that [28:31] will change your training I also want to [28:34] talk about uh uh something we do with [28:36] all of our young dogs and training that [28:38] are ours also something we recommend for [28:39] all of our students uh is the restrained [28:42] recall um now I know that uh we have [28:45] sold out of the half inch long lines we [28:48] do have 38 for uh small breed like dogs [28:50] 15 pounds under was asking when the [28:52] bigger ones will come back in uh this I [28:55] don't know they're they're ordered but [28:57] we it's hard to keep the in stock cuz I [28:58] mean we have 18 small long lines left [29:01] right now and we have classes in tonight [29:03] so um the smaller long lines are good [29:05] for dogs that are like I would say 15 [29:08] pounds and under yeah yeah um but let's [29:10] talk a little bit about restrain recalls [29:12] these are great physical exercises that [29:14] you can do in 10 in that 10-minute [29:16] window in the morning but there's all [29:18] sorts of value there y for sure um it's [29:23] uh really great to do if you have [29:24] multiple people it's a great way to get [29:26] um your kids or other family members [29:27] involved D um because one person can [29:30] hold the dog while another person stands [29:32] in front and teases them with their [29:34] favorite toy and then they can take off [29:36] running it's a great way to teach them [29:37] to respond to their name or perhaps [29:39] respond to whatever your recall [29:41] command's going to be we use the command [29:43] come um for our recall or here um so you [29:47] can say the command and then take off [29:49] running and let release the puppy to [29:50] chase after the person who's got the toy [29:53] when the puppy catches you can have a [29:54] great game of tug um if you don't have [29:57] some somebody to help you you can still [29:59] play the game there's a couple ways that [30:01] you could do it you could have the toy [30:02] in your hand and with your other hand [30:04] face so you're facing your puppy your [30:06] your nose to nose with your puppy and [30:08] you're going to sort of tease him with [30:10] the toy just kind of push the puppy back [30:11] a little bit to give yourself a head [30:13] start and then take off and run and I'll [30:15] usually have my puppy drag like a long [30:17] line or something like that while I'm [30:18] doing this so that we have a safety [30:20] precaution um or you can be very [30:22] creative and you can make like a little [30:24] pulley system with two leashes or two [30:26] lines just sort of wrap the the one of [30:28] the lines around something loop it [30:30] around and sort of hold your puppy back [30:32] a little bit and then you can let go of [30:33] it when you call your dog um but and if [30:36] they're not that into toys you also [30:37] could do exactly the same exercise with [30:40] treats instead um I don't find they get [30:42] as tired if they're doing it with Treats [30:44] but it still is a great way to build [30:45] value get the dog running and chasing [30:48] after you and um you know regardless [30:50] it's a great exercise and you can work [30:53] on a few things I you talked about the [30:55] rec recall command which is come I mean [30:56] you get that dog really Ste you you'll [30:58] come and then you back away and release [31:00] the dog into you also response to name [31:02] you know so many people spot this spot [31:05] that spot spot spot spot spot spot spot [31:07] and spot stops listening because you're [31:09] saying it too many times what a great [31:11] way SP not spotting that's right so what [31:13] a great way to build some drive back in [31:15] really build some excitement into that [31:17] name if you get spot excited are you [31:19] ready are you set spot and you back away [31:21] and then uh pra and play with them after [31:24] know how you did not just excite all of [31:25] our dogs behind you well especially spot [31:27] he didn't even move imagine we did have [31:30] a dark Game Spot that would be [31:31] interesting I me we do we do have a uh [31:34] like a training dog that we we do to [31:36] model with he means a fake training dog [31:38] we have a a artificial dog our training [31:42] school that we can manipulate and put [31:44] into different positions for teaching [31:46] and his name is spot yeah um I should [31:49] mention I see a lot of people that are [31:51] you know they're they they have some [31:52] challenges in their training and and uh [31:55] they're asking for some pretty specific [31:57] advice [31:58] uh YouTube might not be the place to get [32:00] specific advice for you and your dog uh [32:02] our online training programs both for [32:05] puppies uh or for adult dogs that uh are [32:09] are need that need training um what do [32:11] we four months four months and younger [32:13] four months and under for our puppy [32:14] Essentials course or over four months [32:17] for our life skills course both courses [32:20] are excellent they just sort of diff [32:21] deal with different topics depending on [32:23] the age of the dog we sort of know [32:25] there's certain things we need to work [32:26] on when dogs are this age and this age [32:29] and other things we need to work on um [32:31] from there but the cool thing about our [32:32] online classes is that they're very [32:35] different than our YouTube videos our [32:36] YouTube videos are sort of give you like [32:38] a nugget a little glimmer of information [32:42] um in terms of of how we teach things in [32:45] our program it's much more stepbystep [32:47] progressional program kind of letting [32:49] you know when you need to work on what [32:51] um but honestly the absolute best thing [32:54] about training with us online if you're [32:55] close enough to come to us in person I [32:57] would highly recommend that we're in [32:58] flambro Ontario yep then we can see you [33:00] fa to face to face and it's great but if [33:02] you're too far we have our same great [33:04] programs that we teach in-house online [33:06] as well but the biggest difference um in [33:09] comparison to most online courses that [33:11] I've been a part of anyways or seen uh [33:13] is our support um our instructors are [33:16] there you know I don't want to say 24/7 [33:20] but it's pretty darn close um we really [33:22] get to know you and your puppy so that [33:24] we're able to give very specific advice [33:26] because everybody's journey is a little [33:27] bit different and um the goal is to [33:30] figure out the best ways to motivate [33:32] your puppy and lots of times you know [33:34] people will say well I'm doing this [33:35] thing but it's not working and then we [33:37] watch you know a 30 second video of you [33:39] doing it and we say okay well that's [33:41] because this this and this needs to [33:42] change um and then you know before you [33:45] know it you're a way of the races so the [33:47] support system and the community within [33:49] our online classes is worth its weight [33:51] and gold yeah if you're looking for like [33:53] quick answers and fast solutions to your [33:56] problems need not apply here we're [33:58] looking for people who are invested in [34:00] making a difference you know as Kell was [34:02] mentioning some of this stuff uh that we [34:05] use in our training it might sound like [34:07] a little bit of work because it is but I [34:09] will tell you it is so worth it you know [34:11] all of our trainers invest their time [34:13] and effort in you and all you have to do [34:17] in return is to just follow some of [34:18] their guidance and get success I see [34:20] some of our online uh training students [34:22] actually a lot of their names yeah yeah [34:25] but this is what I love about our [34:26] program is like our trainers are [34:28] actually invested in you you know we [34:31] have ongoing conversations about all of [34:33] our students in classes including our [34:35] online students and uh you know it's [34:38] important that you know that it's going [34:40] to be some work but it's going to be [34:42] worth it uh if you join us in our online [34:44] program totally I would like to talk [34:46] about a self-control win that you should [34:49] be [34:50] getting every single [34:52] morning before you go to work it's one [34:55] of those uh five uh one of these five [34:57] wins that you can get in your 10-minute [34:59] training plan and I actually have a [35:01] video that we can actually review love a [35:04] good [35:05] video CLI over here oh it's me yeah [35:08] we're going to watch we're going to [35:10] watch little Maple and we're going to [35:11] work through this um for anybody that's [35:14] so we've worked through some mental [35:15] exercise physical exercise we've got [35:17] control of this puppy and uh you've [35:19] already got one potty training win in [35:21] the morning this is your next step so [35:23] I'm going to circle back to something a [35:25] little bit more thoughtful we just [35:26] played a lot with the toys so now I'm [35:27] going to come back to work on some food [35:30] now when it comes to feeding your puppy [35:31] in the morning A lot of people are [35:32] missing a you're wild a lot of people [35:35] are missing um a really great [35:38] opportunity to again work a little bit [35:39] more training and brain work body work [35:42] um with the actual feeding of the dog's [35:44] breakfast and if I'm just putting the [35:45] food down and then walking away and [35:47] she's eating again I I could be actually [35:49] doing something more productive at that [35:51] time now I have no issue with you know [35:54] uh doing a bit of training with her and [35:55] for like the last little bit okay let's [35:58] just have a puppy pause for a second but [36:00] this is important so a puppy pause some [36:03] people would think like oh this is so [36:04] cute my puppy's like going wild they [36:06] can't wait to start training but you [36:08] recognize like okay I need you I need a [36:10] little bit more brain here so let's slow [36:12] this dog down and so this is again about [36:14] leadership I can do it in a way that's [36:16] now I'm not correcting the puppy per se [36:18] I'm just sort of saying you know what [36:19] we're being a little bit rude here and [36:21] it's just becoming it's because a puppy [36:23] is like feed me feed me it's coming from [36:25] such a cute place but um you know I can [36:28] teach her to be a little calmer and I [36:29] want her to learn that if she wants me [36:31] to give her the food she needs to sit [36:33] calmly and quietly so if I'm just [36:35] standing there letting her Bop all over [36:37] me that's also very self-rewarding you [36:39] can see she keeps doing it because it's [36:41] fun for her she's um you know she feels [36:44] like she's getting close to the food [36:45] she's jumping around she's sort of [36:46] letting her emotions get the best of her [36:48] so I need to interrupt that so that I [36:50] can kind of get her on a different path [36:52] that's better good so she was getting a [36:54] little bit obnoxious there for a second [36:56] so I just took a hold of her just worked [36:58] a bit of control yes good girl that's [37:01] now I'll reward her because I like to [37:02] the lesson the frame of mind um I have [37:05] no problem teaching her you know if [37:07] giving the last bit of her meal like in [37:09] her crate just you know walking away and [37:10] doing my thing but before I do that I [37:12] could work a little bit of manners which [37:14] I think we need right now and she's not [37:15] a bad puppy she's just like pumped for [37:18] the food and a little bit over excited [37:20] good so we're just going to work a [37:21] little bit of mindfulness and we call [37:23] this exercise rule outs and why we call [37:26] this um that is because we want her to [37:28] kind of figure out if you choose not to [37:31] dive bomb me with the food and you maybe [37:33] offer an sit yes then the food will [37:36] appear good girl and again for this one [37:38] I don't necessarily tell her to sit I [37:41] sort of let her kind of figure it out so [37:43] I'm just going to kind of move her out [37:44] of position a little bit let's see if [37:46] she'll default to that [37:47] again oops so I'm not going to let her [37:51] have [37:53] it hey hey stand on Tusk so again I'm [37:57] als I'm not going to let her walk yes [37:59] I'm not going to let her walk away and [38:00] just go and do her own that's another [38:01] important thing as well so again if you [38:03] know she was sort of in that puppy's [38:05] mind what was happening is she's like I [38:06] want the food I want the food I'm going [38:07] to jump on you I'm going to jump on you [38:08] that's what I think I should do I wasn't [38:10] giving her any feedback I wasn't letting [38:12] her have the food and instead of [38:14] offering the sit she was F kind of like [38:16] she's she's a little I don't want to use [38:18] the word selfish but she's sort of like [38:20] well I'm not really getting anything [38:21] here so I'm going to go elsewhere and [38:23] see what else I can find for myself [38:25] because this puppy has not learned yet [38:27] the idea is I work for a human I get [38:29] what I want um she started saying well I [38:31] don't really know what to do so I'm just [38:33] going to go do my own thing if I let her [38:35] go off and and reward herself elsewhere [38:38] I'm devaluing myself I'm I'm losing the [38:41] opportunity to teach her that like I'm [38:44] the one I'm the one where the good stuff [38:45] comes from it doesn't come from [38:47] underneath the curtains or by the you [38:49] know by the vent there I'm the one [38:51] that's important so I just interrupted [38:53] her to get her back on task and then [38:55] thankfully she was like oh my supposed [38:57] to do something with you and then I was [38:59] able to get a reward in when she offered [39:00] that sit for me I'm going to just keep [39:02] her engaged and when she holds that sit [39:04] I'm going to reward now you could ask [39:06] for any Behavior I know she kind of [39:08] understands sit already so I think [39:09] that's a great choice for this puppy if [39:11] your puppy has more skills you could [39:12] maybe wait for them to offer it down or [39:14] something more complex if they're ready [39:16] for that now the other thing that I want [39:18] her to do is also not note the puppy [39:21] house line you see that pupp the house [39:23] line on the puppy that it's just a way [39:25] to make sure that if the puppy does [39:26] completely check out K can reel her back [39:29] in and keep her engaged this is a common [39:31] challenge that a lot of people I think [39:33] have with a puppy is puppy's like okay [39:35] I'm just going to go do my own thing for [39:36] a minute and you're like all right well [39:38] I guess we're not training then insist [39:40] you know make sure that the puppy [39:42] understands that they're it's time to [39:43] work we need to put some effort in here [39:45] we would never train without some type [39:47] of leash or line on the dog we don't [39:49] necessarily have to hold it in our hands [39:51] but it just sort of dangles there kind [39:53] of not really doing anything unless [39:55] unless we need it grab the food until I [39:57] give her permission so I'm going to put [39:58] it down here oh I also love this and if [40:01] she goes for it I'm going to pull it [40:02] away this is a really valuable exercise [40:04] you can do with a dog of any age um but [40:07] it's really great starting your morning [40:09] getting your dog to uh learn some [40:11] self-control we'll do this with all of [40:13] our dogs you know as they're learning we [40:15] don't want them dive bombing the food uh [40:17] but what a great training opportunity [40:19] again to Kale's point I mean what is it [40:21] we're getting a little repetitive here [40:23] saying your dog learns that if they put [40:25] in a bit of effort they're going to get [40:27] what they want this is a great time to [40:28] do that and I'm not sure we've mentioned [40:30] this but Maple is not our puppy Maple is [40:32] a puppy that we've borrowed for this [40:33] video so um you'll see how how quickly [40:36] she catch on catches on to things [40:39] but my P me and this puppy have not had [40:42] any previous experience together I met [40:44] her about 5 minutes before we started [40:46] shooting not even really um so you can [40:49] see how quickly the puppies will start [40:51] to learn if they're being given good [40:53] information it's funny how often I'll [40:55] see someone like oh well that's clearly [40:57] a trained dog uh I mean you're in [40:59] hundreds of videos where we just hand [41:01] you in fact we have to like make sure [41:04] let see the do yeah you don't get to see [41:05] the dog it's like a surprise surprise [41:07] okay we're working with this breed and [41:08] this dog um they learn so fast well it's [41:11] because you give them clear information [41:13] like you know if you're giving the dog [41:14] good information it makes sense to them [41:16] hopefully it makes sense to you and you [41:18] get success faster away from her yes if [41:22] she Cho so what I'm trying to accom is I [41:24] want to be able to put the food down her [41:28] so I'm going to hold it out in front yes [41:31] oh my goodness so again she's having to [41:34] use her brain in order to do this yes I [41:38] mentioned [41:39] ear I know if I can get it all the way [41:41] down rule outs this is what I'm doing [41:45] here [41:47] oops wrong mistakes yeah so I want to [41:49] find a little spot in the middle CLE [41:51] putting it on the floor was too hard she [41:53] made a lot of Errors I can lift it back [41:54] up so again this is all incremental dog [41:56] training I'm trying to build on steps of [41:59] success what I don't want yes good girl [42:01] what I don't want to do is have be wrong [42:02] over and over and over again again all [42:04] of this time this is hardly taking any [42:06] time at all um this is just tiring her [42:09] out so by the time we've done you know a [42:11] handful of things and we're ready to [42:13] return back to our crate so that I can [42:15] leave for the day I have a puppy that's [42:17] happy that's tired out and I can leave [42:20] feeling a little bit more comfortable [42:21] wow look at you excellent pop good and [42:24] you can make this much progress with [42:26] your dog even if you've never worked on [42:28] this exercise I highly recommend that [42:30] you either scrub back in this video and [42:32] watch the section or go to this video [42:34] specifically where we've recorded this [42:36] you know you'd be amazed how quickly the [42:37] dogs pick up on this because they're [42:39] just not getting the thing that they [42:40] want and if you have great timing and [42:43] you know you uh practice some of the [42:45] things that Kale's talking about in here [42:46] you can see this kind of win in your [42:49] morning I still have a little bit of her [42:51] food oh yes good girl and make sure you [42:55] uh erupt with excitement if you're puppy [42:57] or dog chooses to go in their crate H [42:59] for the first time this dog that was [43:01] amazing this dog had never gone in that [43:02] crate she just offered to go in but she [43:05] started to learn the process she was [43:07] like oh I offer things to you and then [43:09] you reward me and then it was sort of [43:11] easy yay I still have a little bit of [43:13] her food left so I'm just going to [43:15] actually feed her the rest in the crate [43:17] this is a great way to build value with [43:18] the crate you can see that she's [43:19] starting to go where's that food give me [43:21] that food so I can either wait for her [43:23] to go in I don't okay so uh I I remember [43:26] the action if you have a dog that a lot [43:29] of people say like well I mean my dog [43:30] just won't go in their crate I toss food [43:32] in there I do all these things and my [43:34] puppy your dog just won't go in there I [43:36] want you to watch what kale does here [43:38] pay very close attention to how kale [43:39] gets the dog in the crate oh we're going [43:41] to capture that again yes good that was [43:44] pretty good I might throw a couple [43:45] cookies in there to kind of coax her to [43:48] go in or I could also just put her in [43:50] there as well come [43:52] on yes oh is is that exciting I not sure [43:57] going in so I'm just going to actually [43:58] put her in here's the house line again [44:00] good okay and you go and you go so yeah [44:04] you just put your dog in their crate [44:06] just do it it's not you know Maple in [44:09] this you know Maple's not upset uh it's [44:11] time to go in your crate she's about to [44:12] get fed if you're struggling with the [44:14] the situation with your dog make sure [44:16] you have your house line on regardless [44:18] of the dog's AG we call them a puppy [44:19] house line we had a a house line on a an [44:22] eight-year-old dog that was new to us [44:23] for the first few days that he was home [44:25] um just so that we had that little extra [44:27] bit of control but um this is a great [44:30] way to sort of get out of this exercise [44:32] as well you put your puppy or your dog [44:33] in their kennel and then they can get [44:35] the rest that's good girl make sure you [44:37] take the line off I don't want to leave [44:39] her in the crate oh gosh with the line [44:42] on cuz that's too dangerous and then [44:44] I'll just let me be the rest of her food [44:46] in her crate I can go and do my thing [44:47] and then I'll make sure I let her out [44:48] one more time before we're done so all I [44:52] have oh it looked like a train ran me [44:54] over oh my goodness I hope that's not [44:56] the case [44:58] um so you know at this now that you've [45:02] you've uh if you're following this [45:04] 10-minute training plan you've [45:06] accomplished a lot and uh that's just [45:09] one day I mean [45:11] imagine like our online students when [45:13] you have like day after day scheduled [45:15] training plans and understanding uh of [45:18] what little wins you can get every day [45:21] with your dog imagine how those things [45:23] build up imagine how you know the [45:25] accumulation of wins uh turns your dog [45:27] into a h pet family member that wants to [45:31] listen wants to learn you know it gives [45:33] you the uh confidence and ability to [45:37] give them great information and it all [45:39] starts in the 10 minutes before right [45:41] after you get up you know after you get [45:43] up in the morning we didn't talk much [45:45] about like going for a walk because if [45:47] you have a dog in training you you know [45:49] you have to exercise your dog before you [45:51] leave your home uh and we want to make [45:54] sure that you're doing it successfully [45:55] you're making the most of that time time [45:57] and if you're at a point where you need [45:59] to have this 10-minute training plan [46:00] your pro dog's probably not great at [46:02] walking on leash yet and I don't want [46:04] you to get out there and it's in fact [46:06] you know something we often caution [46:07] students against don't get out don't [46:10] take your dog for a walk until you've [46:12] taught them how to walk talk to yeah [46:14] yeah like really teach them how to walk [46:15] on on leash it's also the least [46:17] deficient of exercise in the morning [46:19] yeah throw you know if you can conquer [46:21] the retrieve or the restraint recall [46:23] totally in 10 minutes your dog will be [46:25] much more tired than a 10-minute walk [46:28] absolutely way more tired yeah before [46:30] you're going to work at the end of this [46:32] training plan you're going to go out for [46:34] another potty session make sure your dog [46:35] uh doesn't have to pee doesn't have to [46:37] poop you know they've done their [46:38] business and now that you've listened to [46:40] this um short session you'll know that [46:43] you're going out there with a house line [46:44] with a leash or with a long line so that [46:47] you can make sure that your dog is [46:49] successful and they don't get distracted [46:51] they don't you know have an opportunity [46:53] to just completely blow you off and you [46:55] under uh you uh uh undo a lot of the [46:58] great leadership training that you've [47:00] kind of established for [47:03] them um what else do you have to add [47:06] here gosh I don't know I feel like we [47:08] covered so many so many great things I [47:12] think to sort of sum it up it's you know [47:15] we want to try and be able to we have [47:17] not a lot of time to spend with our dogs [47:19] the goal is quality over quantity [47:22] absolutely and that you're going to try [47:23] to make the most of your 10 or 15 [47:25] minutes that you have [47:27] um by you know allowing [47:32] the um the natural information that your [47:36] dog is learning even though you might [47:37] not be intentionally training them uh to [47:40] be all good things and that's with [47:41] having good management that's looking [47:43] for looking for wins to reward you [47:45] should be spending more of your time you [47:47] know telling your dog that they're a [47:48] good dog and that they're making good [47:50] choices rather than no no no no no if [47:53] you're doing a lot of nose um likely [47:56] you're not set setting up your situation [47:58] to allow yourself to um have good dog [48:01] training opportunities and your dog sort [48:03] of you know getting too much rehearsal [48:05] of the wrong thing so um just try to [48:07] look at that and see if you can make [48:09] some changes so that you know things are [48:12] a little bit more pleasant to uh to deal [48:14] with um I'm trying to think of a fun way [48:16] to get out talking about the no nose or [48:19] the [48:19] nose like no apostrophe s n o there's [48:23] something there I'll put it together for [48:24] the next train station which will be in [48:26] weeks but maybe we'll be seeing you next [48:28] week in our online training program if [48:30] you're local to us in flamber

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 169/199,~Ken === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] one of the most popular things that we [00:01] do actually has nothing to do with a six [00:04] foot leash so I'm actually going to [00:06] switch out my leash which eventually [00:08] will work towards and I'm going to swap [00:11] it out whop for a long line now I've [00:16] given a little bit of freedom to Stephen [00:18] you can see he's going to check out the [00:20] uh flowers my training can literally [00:22] start now I'm going to try calling his [00:24] name Stephen Yay good boy so what I'm [00:29] going to do with my leash training is [00:31] just literally start on getting Steven [00:33] to listen to me without any tension on [00:37] the leash and it is a lot easier to [00:39] train this on a 20ft line than it is a [00:42] six foot line so I've given him a few [00:43] treats now I'm just going to tell him [00:45] okay I'm just going to sort of let him [00:47] wander around the backyard again I'm [00:49] going to change direction Stephen yes [00:52] good boy yay and when he's distracted [00:57] I'm going to call his name and encourage [00:59] him to come back to me you'll notice [01:01] when I reward him you'll see how close I [01:04] get him before I reward now you're [01:06] probably thinking this doesn't look [01:07] anything like leash walking I know [01:10] that's the point we're going to work a [01:12] little bit and I'm going to get a bit of [01:13] tension on the leash there we go I'm [01:15] going to work up first on just teaching [01:17] him how to have some leash respect and [01:19] some listening skills oh that's a good [01:21] boy now you'll notice when he moved that [01:23] direction the line actually went tight I [01:26] simply responded by giving him a couple [01:27] pulses on the leash which encouraged him [01:29] to come back in my direction now we're [01:31] getting a a puppy this just sort of [01:33] lying down now I like that he's lying [01:34] down and looking at me but I'm not [01:36] really getting much engagement so I'm [01:38] going to work a little harder to get him [01:39] come close to me ready stepen this way [01:42] Yay good boy right here this way good [01:45] boy that's it that's it good boy right [01:46] here Stephen yes good [01:50] boy he is like what the heck are you [01:53] doing lady good boy so I want to get a [01:56] little bit more engagement from this [01:57] puppy so I'm going to make it a little [01:58] bit easier Stephen [02:01] yes Stephen yes good Stephen Yay good [02:06] boy this way yeah so now what I'm doing [02:09] is increasing the reward the rate of [02:11] rewards and I'm not making him go too [02:14] far before he gets a reward yes come all [02:17] the way in so I'm never going to reach [02:19] to my puppy to give her a reward he's [02:21] always going to come in towards me look [02:24] at you making those [02:25] choices excellent good now the cool [02:30] thing about this yes is that I'm [02:33] actually able to just let the leash drag [02:35] a little bit now I don't have to hold it [02:38] because he's making such good effort wow [02:40] good boy okay I am loving what I'm [02:43] seeing here so the next thing that I'm [02:45] going to start to do is transfer some of [02:47] this movement to a six foot leash he was [02:50] able to stay within six feet of me there [02:52] so we're going to move on now I don't [02:53] have the oh yes good boy I don't have [02:55] the line in my hand so I'm just going to [02:57] step on it where are you going that's a [02:59] better better choice yes good okay yes [03:05] good so that was actually a great [03:07] example I love having the long line on [03:09] because if he decides to run away or do [03:10] his own thing I don't have to panic I [03:12] don't have to chase him I can just step [03:14] on the line wow yes okay buddy good that [03:19] was really good choice so did you see [03:20] that he went all the way almost to the [03:22] end of the line but he actually avoided [03:24] the tension that's telling me he's [03:26] starting to get this he's starting to [03:28] understand that tension is not good and [03:30] moving back towards me and being on a [03:32] loose leash and being close yes good boy [03:34] let's see what he does here yes [03:38] good good choice buddy there Yay good [03:45] boy so tension on the leash means you [03:47] need to move back towards me very good [03:50] boy okay let's go on to the next step [03:52] now some of you that are watching might [03:54] not have a backyard to practice in I [03:56] don't wa to get too stuck on the [03:57] location of the training while you're [03:59] really looking for is anywhere that has [04:02] even like literally a 10x10 space you [04:04] don't need a lot of area where you can [04:06] work with your dog with minimal [04:08] distractions with them on a leash and [04:10] you have the opportunity to move in a [04:11] couple different directions um you might [04:14] even start this exercise um in your [04:16] living room you know move the coffee [04:17] table out of the way or you know in your [04:19] kitchen and so that you can move with [04:21] your dog on a loose leash and then [04:23] graduate to somewhere that's a little [04:25] bit more um you know open and free uh [04:28] basketball courts baseball diamonds [04:30] things like that are always really good [04:32] because they're fenced in but keep the [04:34] area that you're practicing very small [04:36] at first and then you're going to work [04:38] your way into working uh into a bigger [04:40] location so Stephen did pretty well on a [04:44] uh on the long line and I only did it [04:46] for a few minutes so oops yay there we [04:49] go that's better what just happened [04:51] right there is super important to [04:53] comment on because the average person [04:55] often will get distracted by this person [04:57] talking to them or having to do that [04:59] thing and and then all of a sudden your [05:00] dog's been pulling on the leash or [05:01] dragging you somewhere and we haven't [05:03] done anything about it so in order to [05:05] really affect change with your dog [05:07] training it's important that it comes [05:09] first and you're intentional about what [05:11] you're doing so even if you're in the [05:12] middle of talking to someone if all of a [05:14] sudden the tension's on the leash or [05:16] your dog's you know misbehaving in some [05:17] way just put pause on the conversation [05:20] for a second address the dog get the dog [05:23] back there under control and then go [05:25] back to what you're doing it's really [05:27] really important that when we're [05:28] training our dogs that we don't [05:29] sacrifice our good timing for you know [05:32] things that are going on around us and [05:34] that actually will be one of the ways [05:35] that your dog's going to be able to [05:37] learn to listen with you while you're [05:38] able to do normal people things and the [05:41] dog just learns to abide to you instead [05:43] further to that the other thing that [05:44] will happen is if your dog starts to put [05:46] two and two together a lot of dogs are [05:48] very clever they will see that you're [05:50] distracted you're engaged you're holding [05:52] something you're talking to someone and [05:53] they know that when you're not um paying [05:55] attention to them you're not really [05:57] going to follow through and they [05:58] sometimes will be Ava a little bit [05:59] mischievous and they'll end up pulling [06:02] or or you know making poor choices [06:04] specifically while you're distracted [06:06] because you're know they know they're [06:07] not paying attention but you know if you [06:09] have eyes in the back of your head and [06:10] they do something and you stop what [06:11] you're doing and address it right away [06:13] that dog starts to know ah I get it the [06:15] the expectations are the same all of the [06:17] time no matter what the rules are are [06:19] easy to follow and that's going to allow [06:21] your uh training to progress a lot more [06:23] rapidly but the next thing we're going [06:25] to do hi is just work a little bit on [06:27] some leash respect um with the 6ot leash [06:30] and why this is important is that when [06:32] I'm teaching my dog not to pull on the [06:33] leash I actually want to avoid going in [06:36] long straight lines because that's [06:38] actually one of the hardest ways to walk [06:40] a dog what's actually better is to work [06:42] on walking in many different patterns [06:44] and directions um so that I can keep him [06:47] guessing it sort of puts me in a bit [06:49] more of the driver's seat so we're going [06:50] to start off not with some controlled [06:52] walking but a little bit more what we [06:53] call Casual walking leash respect okay [06:55] buddy okay so what I'm going to do is [06:58] take a couple steps whoops [07:00] Yay good boy and a few different [07:02] directions right here this way yes just [07:05] like I was doing on the long line yes [07:08] good for you this way good [07:10] boy wow this way yes good excellent good [07:17] boy so yes I'm using the food okay this [07:19] way good boy that's it but I'm also [07:22] using my voice I'm using nice happy [07:24] tones I'm moving briskly good boy [07:27] excellent so this is going great so what [07:30] I'm going to do now is I'm going to [07:32] start only rewarding him when he moves [07:34] to my left hand side and you're going to [07:36] see that I'm purposely going to move my [07:37] body in a way that he comes to my left [07:40] to get a reward so it's going to look a [07:41] little something like this okay yes good [07:45] okay yes I'm going to [07:47] turn yes [07:50] good wow that's awesome yes now I have [07:55] my leash hit uh held in my right hand [07:57] here my food is in my left hand [08:00] my bait bag wow Stephen you're amazing [08:03] is in on my left side so that way I can [08:06] deliver the treats quickly yes every [08:10] couple of steps yes good boy now there's [08:13] not much reason for him to look away [08:15] from me right now because he's getting [08:16] lots of Engagement and treats wow you're [08:18] a rockar buddy [08:21] good wow [08:24] amazing so okay can you take a little [08:26] break for a second so what's cool about [08:28] that is that I'm able to move around in [08:32] a few different directions and get him [08:34] moving at my left- hand side and I can [08:36] keep things interesting if I was [08:38] restricted to uh being on the sidewalk [08:41] where I could only go straight I love [08:43] bug um or you know all of a sudden [08:45] somebody walks past me with a dog or I [08:47] walk by somebody that has a dog behind a [08:49] fence or whatever it might be I'm going [08:51] to be bombarded with distractions what I [08:53] want to do is practice here in the [08:54] backyard where there's really not much [08:56] going on and I can get lots and lots of [08:58] Rewards for him making really good [09:01] choices one of the final things that I [09:03] need to make sure that my puppy [09:04] understands before we head out on the [09:06] sidewalk and we're are possibly going to [09:08] you know be interacted with distractions [09:11] I need to make sure that he understands [09:13] what to do when he's faced with the [09:15] distraction is he just going to pull and [09:16] drag me towards that thing or is he [09:18] going to understand to leave it and then [09:19] move with me so when it comes to [09:21] teaching your dog to listen around [09:23] distractions you want to start off by [09:24] using something that's fairly [09:26] distracting but not impossible for them [09:28] to deal with and what I'm doing is I'm [09:30] basically mimicking distractions that [09:32] he's going to see on the street whether [09:33] it might be garbage on the sidewalk we [09:35] might work up to working with a person [09:38] or maybe another dog that's nearby I'm [09:40] just starting with one distraction but I [09:42] might add distractions five or 10 sort [09:44] of create a little land mine around me [09:46] because I want him to understand that [09:48] there's going to be different [09:49] Temptations It's also really important [09:51] that when you're working with a [09:52] distraction that you do have something [09:54] that's pretty high value that can go to [09:56] battle with that distraction so if I was [09:58] using his favorite toy and then just you [10:01] know kibble or something low value I [10:03] might not get the same responses but I [10:04] have some pretty great high value treats [10:06] today and I'm going to battle against [10:08] the the tug toy um but you're going to [10:10] change up your distractions and if this [10:12] distraction is too difficult you're [10:13] either going to have the distraction be [10:15] farther away from you and your puppy or [10:17] choose something that is just you know a [10:20] little bit less tempting for your puppy [10:22] until you're ready to make it harder so [10:23] I'm going to put that toy out oh let him [10:26] check it out for a second now what I'm [10:28] going to do cuz I know know that he [10:29] doesn't know this perfectly yet is I'm [10:31] going to use a bit of food let's go yes [10:34] good boy this way good so I'm just going [10:36] to get him walking and then we're going [10:37] to walk leave it yes good boy I'm going [10:41] to walk closer to that distraction now [10:43] you'll notice I said leave it as soon as [10:45] I felt him yes him speed up yes good boy [10:50] towards the toy actually because I had [10:52] good such good timing there we have a [10:54] puppy that says I know the toy there but [10:56] I'm making good choices can we walk [10:57] closer to it let's go leave it [10:59] yes leave it yes good this way oops I [11:02] dropped it oops oops oops here it is [11:06] good let's try this way good yes come on [11:10] we're going to try going past it again [11:12] leave it whoa jackpot [11:17] y as you could see Stephen did awesome [11:20] with our little distraction with our tug [11:22] toy so for this puppy I would actually [11:24] start to up the antie in terms of the [11:26] difficulty um of the distraction so I'm [11:29] actually going to have um um somebody [11:31] come out so we can use a person so if [11:33] you have a family member or a friend at [11:35] home that could sort of act as that [11:37] person uh approaching you on the street [11:38] that would be great you can see he's [11:39] already a little bit excited okay so we [11:41] have a little bit of leash pulling so [11:43] what I'm going to do is gather my leash [11:44] up I'm going to give him a couple little [11:46] pulses on the leash for [11:47] pulling y good boy and then we're going [11:50] to go into our little drill that we've [11:52] been working on walking at our left hand [11:54] side yes good boy I'm going to walk near [11:56] the person yes leave it y hey good boy [12:01] excellent okay Dan what you're going to [12:02] do now is just walk past me good let's [12:06] go good let's go leave it yay good boy [12:10] let's try that again let's go yes good [12:15] boy excellent let's go good good boy sit [12:20] wow good for you now you're probably [12:23] going to say of course oops no pulling [12:26] young man there we go so again I got to [12:28] be consistent every time you pull I need [12:29] to remind him that's not okay he's with [12:31] me on a loose leash I'm going to reward [12:32] him once again but a lot of you are [12:34] going to say well of course he's doing [12:35] great you're you know we have food in [12:36] your hand you're rewarding them and [12:38] that's literally the point we are in a [12:40] full-fledged teaching phase right now my [12:43] goal is that this puppy does it correct [12:45] over and over and over and over again [12:48] until I can get to the point where I [12:50] don't have to feed quite as rapidly and [12:52] I can really work around some hard [12:53] distractions the other thing that we're [12:55] doing is not only am I using the food [12:56] and I'm using engagement the person [12:58] that's walk past him right now Dan's [13:00] being very neutral he's just walking [13:02] past he's not really making any noises [13:04] he's not looking at the puppy he's not [13:06] bending down and going gooo Gaga and [13:09] that's also really important as well [13:10] because sometimes when you cross people [13:12] on the street especially if you're [13:13] walking with a cute adorable puppy [13:14] they're the worst they bend down like oh [13:16] what a cute little puppy it's so cute [13:18] they have that high squeaky voice and [13:20] they bend over and then it's like a [13:21] nightmare to get oops to get your puppy [13:25] to not pull on the leash so when you're [13:27] starting this training think about how [13:29] you can set the puppy up to be [13:31] successful so that there're it's easier [13:33] for them to make good choices because we [13:34] can always have the person act crazier [13:36] and more distracting I can always [13:38] eliminate some of the food I can always [13:40] add more distractions to this controlled [13:42] environment and that's going to be [13:43] better than going out for a sidewalk [13:45] walk where I have unpredictable things [13:47] that can come at me at any moment and I [13:49] don't have a puppy or a dog that really [13:51] is ready to conquer those distractions [13:53] and I as a Handler might not be ready to [13:56] conquer those distractions so the idea [13:57] here is to control the environment so [14:01] that I can ease my puppy into [14:03] distractions gradually so that he's [14:05] always making great choices now up until [14:07] this point the puppy has been doing a [14:09] really great job and I've been doing my [14:11] very best to set him up so that he's [14:12] mostly successful but when you go to [14:15] practice this at home with your own [14:16] puppy it's likely that it might not look [14:18] like this now to be honest this puppy [14:20] really does not know how to walk on a [14:22] loose leash or to stay very focused [14:25] quite yet because he hasn't had a lot of [14:26] experience so what I'm going to do next [14:28] is actually work on ramping up the [14:30] distractions and give you a little bit [14:31] more of a realistic understanding or or [14:33] viewing of what might happen when we [14:35] make things a little bit more [14:36] challenging so this is a really good [14:38] example of how you could practice maybe [14:40] in your backyard with controlling [14:42] distractions now we are going to show [14:44] you a bit of an example what might [14:45] happen if you make things a bit too hard [14:47] so you can see Dan's wiggling a tug toy [14:49] around and that is proving to be a very [14:52] big distraction for this puppy and I'm [14:54] using a bit of a combo of leash [14:56] Corrections and directions redirections [14:58] and food to get the puppy back on track [15:01] now what you just saw there is I waited [15:02] too long to react that puppy was sort of [15:04] right on top of the distraction so I'm [15:06] going to work a little harder you see [15:07] I'm getting the food out a little bit [15:09] ahead of time he's had a few bad reps so [15:11] I'm going to have to practice a bit more [15:12] but I'm getting the food out early to [15:14] hopefully prevent him from making a good [15:16] choice look at that so um I was a little [15:19] bit more engaged with the puppy you also [15:20] saw Dan did a great job of not making [15:22] the toy as distracting now in this [15:25] situation before I could even get too [15:27] far ahead that puppy's already trying to [15:29] barge ahead so I'm see you're seeing [15:31] that I'm using a bit of change of [15:33] Direction in order to get him back on [15:35] track I'm moving myself further away [15:37] from the distraction and I'm looking for [15:39] opportunities to reward so you'll see [15:41] when he's disconnected I'm redirecting [15:43] with the leash when he's looking back at [15:44] me I'm rewarding and then I'm using an [15:46] opportunity to reward him for sitting on [15:48] a loose leash so that I can end with a [15:50] bit of a win so what did we just learn [15:52] there we were able to work through [15:54] various levels of distractions and we [15:56] were actually able to get to the point [15:58] where the threshold for Steven um was [16:00] met and we were able to see that with a [16:02] person walking by wiggling a toy making [16:04] noise was just too much for him to be [16:06] successful and the only way I could get [16:07] him to not pull on the leash and to stay [16:09] focused on me was to you know create a [16:11] bit of a wider birth around me so um I [16:14] think it's really important that we [16:15] learn that because I think sometimes [16:16] people look at the training sessions and [16:18] think like okay we just do that you know [16:20] one or two times in the backyard and [16:21] then we can go to the go to take it to [16:23] the streets from there and unfortunately [16:25] that's just not how it works you're [16:26] actually going to be spending several [16:28] weeks on these steps in order for your [16:30] dog to be successful and the way that [16:32] you know that you can move on to the [16:33] next step is if your dog is able to you [16:36] know meet the criteria of a loose leash [16:39] um you know fairly good Focus they can [16:40] change direction when you um when you [16:42] change direction without their leash [16:44] going tight they can maintain position [16:46] at your left-and side so you're going to [16:47] figure out good boy um what are the big [16:50] distractions for your dogs and um and [16:52] what aren't in this video we have built [16:55] a great Foundation of steps for walking [16:57] in our backyard but what what happens if [16:59] you take it to the sidewalk for that [17:01] check out this video on that note I'm [17:03] cam McAn happy training ==================================================

stress go through my body talking about [00:16] that they think they're tiring out their [00:18] puppy they think they're they think I [00:19] get a dog I get a puppy and I'm supposed [00:21] to I'm supposed to walk my dog you are [00:23] but like once you've trained it to walk [00:25] maybe it's time for you to learn some [00:26] new tricks on how you're going to dog [00:29] that needs new tricks you are the old [00:31] dog that needs new tricks when you get a [00:34] puppy and in the past for you when [00:36] you've gotten a puppy you are able to go [00:39] through the potty training phase with [00:41] either no accidents or like maybe one or [00:44] two how is that even possible what does [00:46] that what like what does that look like [00:48] how do you make that happen I think I [00:50] make that happen because I have I [00:54] understand about [00:57] um supervising puppies I understand [01:00] about utilizing the crate um I [01:03] understand about supervision I also know [01:07] how to read dog's body language so when [01:09] the dog starts to do something a bit [01:10] funny I've just seen it so many times [01:12] that I think to myself oh this is [01:14] probably what's happening so I'm I get [01:16] ahead of the storm I'm I'm preventing so [01:19] much but because I've done it I've [01:20] raised so many puppies yeah and although [01:23] there's I've had different um potty [01:25] training house training uh issues with [01:27] many of them um then I once once I had [01:30] that issue I'm like okay well now I know [01:31] how to deal with it so then the next [01:33] time something comes up if like the that [01:36] problem starts to come in I'm like oh I [01:38] can just do this because it worked for [01:40] this dog or I try that I'm like well [01:41] that's not working so I need to try [01:42] something new so every time you get a [01:44] new dog it's like easier but I think I [01:46] can get through with no accidents [01:48] because I'm just controlling every every [01:53] aspect of the puppy's life yeah that um [01:56] they just don't really have the [01:58] opportunity and then if they do have an [01:59] ACC [02:00] because I'm usually supervising and I [02:01] catch them I'm just not that worried [02:03] about it because it's like okay I've [02:04] caught them perfect there's my thing now [02:06] I've now I've done it now now we're way [02:08] to the races so I just I don't get [02:10] stressed about it because I've done it [02:12] and I just so for the person that is [02:14] stressed about it the person say it was [02:16] me and I had never taken dog training I [02:20] didn't know the best dog trainer in the [02:22] world to help me uh at 2 o'clock in the [02:24] morning when I say what the heck is [02:25] happening [02:27] um what does that like when you say [02:30] because I can control everything when [02:31] you say because I'm not stressed because [02:33] I know fill in the blank yeah what are [02:35] those things like if you were to break [02:37] that down what does controlling a puppy [02:40] in the potty training phase actually [02:41] look like like what what are those [02:43] things um I think a couple of the key [02:46] factors is um getting to know uh the [02:50] puppy's schedule quickly um and the way [02:54] that you would do that is by spending a [02:56] lot of time with the puppy um learning [02:58] to to read their their schedule [03:01] understand that you know they have to go [03:02] to the bathroom at certain times like [03:04] usually within the first mome I know [03:06] like regularly that this puppy goes poo [03:08] three times a day whereas like that [03:10] puppy only went twice this puppy usually [03:12] goes within 10 minutes after I feed her [03:14] or this puppy doesn't like you learn [03:17] that because you're spending so much [03:18] time are you just like keeping that in [03:19] your head or are you writing that down [03:21] um if you're new I would definitely [03:23] write it down I think that would be [03:24] great start a little phone log in your [03:26] phone and and you know um I literally do [03:29] that for my 17-year-old dog right now [03:31] because full circle we're full full [03:33] circle Ming uh with her over there but [03:36] that way I can look and be like okay we [03:37] haven't gone in like five hours like [03:39] probably going to happen but now I don't [03:41] think about it I just you know I'm [03:43] paying attention um but also my puppies [03:47] don't really have a lot of like free [03:49] range of the house when they're when [03:50] they're really really young um say I'm [03:52] in the kitchen the puppies in the in the [03:54] kitchen with me I'm utilizing baby gates [03:56] the puppy has a house line on I I'm [03:58] controlling where the puppy can go how [04:02] fast they can go what they can get into [04:04] whether they they can't like get behind [04:05] the couch and pee without me watching [04:07] because that's not even an option for [04:10] them um so it just makes my life easier [04:13] I'm paying attention to the time um I [04:16] try to be aware of whether I've um fed [04:19] the dog played with the dog whatever it [04:20] might be so I I can anticipate the the [04:24] problem coming um and then again the [04:26] body language thing that might not be [04:28] something that you'd be good at at first [04:30] but it doesn't take long to start to [04:32] recognize the different signs of your [04:34] puppy and all my puppies have done [04:35] slightly different things some will just [04:37] naturally go to the door sometimes I [04:39] have to um sort of for force the issue [04:43] um with with some pups but yeah I would [04:48] say it's just controlled because I'm not [04:49] I'm not allowing I'm not allowing the [04:52] typical house training issues to happen [04:54] because of the management tools that I'm [04:56] using which the good thing about that is [04:59] makes the process of house training go [05:01] faster which means I get to have a [05:03] younger dog that has more freedom than [05:05] the average person because I FastTrack [05:07] it because the isolation period of the [05:10] house training is so precise yeah that [05:14] like we get over the hump and now I [05:16] don't have an eight-month old dog that [05:17] I'm worried about peeing the house I [05:19] just don't think about anymore we've [05:20] already done it because I'm so [05:21] hyperfocused on it in the early stages [05:24] um but I also I'm I'm not overwhelmed by [05:26] the work every time I get a puppy it's [05:28] like right this is a lot of work my [05:30] entire day is focused around what I'm [05:34] going to be doing with the puppy and [05:35] when and then puppy goes away I can turn [05:38] my brain onto this now it's like okay [05:40] back to the puppy like it's just it's so [05:42] much but because I've done it a bunch of [05:44] times I know it's not long lasting I [05:46] think when people get puppies and [05:47] they've never done it before um or they [05:50] haven't done it very many times or it's [05:51] been years since they've had a puppy [05:53] they like are used to having a dog [05:55] that's like easygoing or they've never [05:56] had a dog before and it's like holy cow [05:59] this is is so much work their memories a [06:01] 13-year-old golden retriever that's [06:03] laying around totally like life is just [06:05] not like that like it will be like that [06:06] eventually um because I like the Quick [06:09] Fix thing especially to in everyone's [06:11] day and age everything is quick quick [06:13] quick but like puppy training is not [06:15] quick it's slow um but it can go faster [06:20] if you get good at it yeah you there [06:23] there's not a win in in speed in dog [06:25] training like there is in other things [06:27] like it's no because if you try to go [06:29] fast and skip steps it might like be [06:32] okay for a bit and then all a sudden you [06:33] run into problems because there was [06:35] holes in your training from early stages [06:37] because you you weren't fully you know [06:41] checking all of the boxes you're trying [06:43] to like well you felt guilty so you [06:45] didn't want the puppy to have to go in [06:46] the crate so much or you didn't really [06:48] want to do this because you wanted the [06:49] puppy to be able to like go in the yard [06:50] and have free time playing well now you [06:53] have a six-month old puppy does doesn't [06:55] call come when it's called because [06:56] you've let it do that because you were [06:58] lazy and put your shoes and your long [07:00] line on to go outside with a puppy I'm [07:02] willing to do all of that extra work [07:05] because I know I'm not going to have [07:07] holes and then later on I get to enjoy [07:09] the benefit of my puppy doing all great [07:11] things because I do all of the steps [07:15] yeah I don't skip steps in the early [07:17] stages that's really interesting but you [07:19] don't know you don't know yeah that's [07:20] why you got to take class that's right [07:23] that's why you got to have guidance so [07:25] that if you might not even know that [07:27] you're you're step skipping you might [07:29] think like oh like walking is a good [07:31] example people get puppies and then they [07:34] take their 12-week old puppy for like a [07:36] half hour walk I would never do that [07:40] never they think they're tiring out [07:41] their puppy they think think I get a dog [07:43] I get a puppy and I'm supposed to I'm [07:45] supposed to walk my dog you are but like [07:47] once you've trained it to walk yeah but [07:49] they don't know that so then they [07:50] rehearse and then they try to train it [07:52] well they've just accidentally rehearse [07:54] this bad stuff or whatever and then also [07:57] we say okay don't walk your puppy and [07:58] it's like okay well [08:00] what do what do I do with it then yeah [08:02] like what do you do with a puppy all day [08:04] if you're not walking it you don't know [08:06] you don't know yeah right yeah so for [08:08] the person that says I'm going to drink [08:10] out of my giant cup now [08:12] yeah wow does that have like a motor in [08:15] it to [08:17] get yep for the person that says okay [08:20] well if I can't walk my dog how am I [08:23] like it's a puppy it's got never ending [08:26] energy how do I Tire this sucker out if [08:28] I can't walk cuz walking is the only [08:30] thing that's going to Tire this puppy [08:31] out yeah so I have a good example for [08:34] you because again I'm a little bit [08:36] different than the average bear now [08:38] because when I get my own personal puppy [08:41] in the back of my mind I am raising this [08:43] puppy from the second I get them home to [08:45] a be my family pet but B be a world [08:50] champion in dog agility that's my goal [08:53] for my own dog so when I'm making up my [08:58] daily schedule of what I do with my [08:59] puppy because my goal is that it's going [09:02] to be a top level agility dog some of [09:05] the games and exercises and trainings [09:07] that I choose to do with my puppy at a [09:08] very very early age is leading its way [09:12] into my ultimate goal down the road even [09:14] though I'm not doing any Physical [09:16] Agility with a dog you're training [09:17] something that's going to come to [09:17] fruition EXA four years down the road [09:19] exactly I'm not doing any agility at [09:21] that age but I'm teaching foundational [09:23] skills that can put the puppy to set [09:25] them up to be successful um not long ago [09:28] as you know I uh raised a puppy for my [09:31] brother y not going to be an agility dog [09:34] and so that was an interesting process [09:36] for me because I had to be a bit more [09:38] creative in what I did with her to [09:42] satisfy her body and mind because I I [09:45] wasn't training her to become an agility [09:48] dog I was training her to be a family [09:50] dog but I was still had a bordoli who [09:53] has high hurting drive that was very [09:56] energetic I had to tire her out um [10:00] so I still had to think about things [10:02] that I could do before I could walk her [10:04] and then also on top of it she also had [10:07] ISS she was like she was wanted to her [10:08] cars um she was very stimulated by other [10:11] people and dogs so like I couldn't even [10:14] walk her because it would be a disaster [10:16] before she was trained to do it and she [10:17] was planning on living in a big city [10:19] where there was going to be lots of cars [10:20] lots of people exactly so it's like what [10:22] the heck do I do with this dog so I [10:23] tried to make sure that I had exercises [10:26] that would tire her out so very early on [10:28] I I was started to teach her to play [10:31] fetch um because it was a great way to [10:33] tire her out it was also a great way to [10:37] um uh give her something to do where she [10:41] was exuding energy that included me yeah [10:44] and she loved it but she then Associated [10:47] playing fetch or playing with toys and [10:50] tugging and all that stuff with me [10:52] because every time she got to do it it [10:54] was always with me so she would she was [10:56] cute she'd pick up a toy instead of like [10:58] going lying and playing with it by [11:00] herself she would just bring it over to [11:01] me yeah let's do this exactly let's do [11:03] something together so that was a great [11:04] relationship Builder um she had terrible [11:07] emotional control when she was puppy [11:09] borly high energy dog um and so once we [11:13] could play fetch and she learned she was [11:15] trained to get the toy bring it back we [11:16] would do things like you have to sit and [11:18] wait and then I'm going to throw the toy [11:21] and then you're going to wait for me to [11:22] release you or you're going to do a sit [11:24] a down a Shake A Paw you're a spin and [11:26] then I would tug with her cuz you're [11:27] trying to make her more mindful yeah [11:28] then I would make you sit and I would [11:29] wiggle the toy in front of her and throw [11:30] the toy and if she would uh sit so I [11:32] would say okay I know you love this now [11:35] you have to do a bit of mindfulness and [11:37] calmness and then your reward is that [11:39] you get to go and play have fun and that [11:42] would be great especially when I started [11:43] to implement those types of things with [11:45] her because at the end of 10 minutes she [11:48] was running but she was also using her [11:50] her brain as well because I think [11:51] sometimes people do you know leash Tre [11:54] Parks is a good example you take the dog [11:56] you let them run they completely forget [11:59] about you for x amount of time um and [12:01] also they're not using their mind during [12:04] that time and when people rehearse doing [12:06] physical activity with a dog day after [12:08] day after day after day and they're not [12:10] checking the mindfulness box you're [12:13] actually building a dog stamina so you [12:15] may could have tired them up in five [12:17] minutes but you do that for a couple [12:19] weeks now your dog isn't tired until 10 [12:21] minutes they're not not tired until 25 [12:24] minutes well what are you going to do [12:25] now yeah but with her I was able to do [12:28] something physical but also balance it [12:30] without something me with also something [12:31] mental um or teacher I did a lot of [12:34] trick training with her it's cute it's [12:36] adorable but that's not really what I [12:37] was doing it I was doing it because I [12:39] wanted her to have to problem solve I [12:41] wanted her have to use her brain um so I [12:43] did all kinds of stuff like that that I [12:45] you know sometimes it was raining I [12:47] can't go outside and play fetch so what [12:49] am I going to do in the house to tire [12:50] her out yeah so it would be trick [12:52] training or um you know we would get [12:55] Amazon boxes and teacher to like run [12:56] through the box and she'd run back and [12:58] forth for a tree we do that for 5 10 [13:00] minutes well now she's exhausted now I [13:02] can throw her in the crate and chill out [13:04] and she's happy she's had attention [13:06] she's had exercise she's been fed she's [13:09] done all of the things and now she's [13:11] good so like it was a good it was good [13:13] for me to um have to think about other [13:17] things to do with her that wasn't like [13:19] you know a lot of fives exercises as a [13:21] puppy although I did a lot of those same [13:22] things it was like training him to do [13:24] certain things that I was going to [13:26] utilize for agility later so he was [13:28] always using his mind and body body in [13:29] all kinds of avenues but if you're not [13:31] raising an agility dog what are you [13:33] going to do with them right very few [13:34] people are doing what I'm doing they [13:36] just need an average family pet that you [13:39] can you know deal with all day long feed [13:42] water walk get a snuggle every once in a [13:43] while exactly so I mean you're obviously [13:46] a wealth of knowledge and dealing with a [13:48] border collie that's going to be living [13:49] in a big [13:50] city you know how to train through those [13:53] things the person that doesn't and gets [13:55] a high stimulated borol and lives in a [13:58] big [14:00] City you just talked about all the [14:02] things that you're training and why [14:04] what's at risk if the person doesn't [14:06] train those like what type of dog are [14:08] they going to get God I literally just [14:09] felt stress go through my body talking [14:11] about that I am like a big advocate for [14:14] dogs too so I really think that if you [14:18] are going to invest time money emotion [14:23] into getting uh a dog you need to make [14:27] sure that you think big picture [14:30] and think about what your lifestyle is [14:32] going to be what's your personality like [14:34] how much time you going to devote to [14:36] this what your living arrangements like [14:39] and then you know just because you think [14:42] like a Bernie mountain dog is [14:44] cute it maybe you shouldn't get one [14:46] because your life isn't meant for it and [14:48] you're not talking correct me if I'm [14:49] wrong you're not talking about today [14:52] you're talking about today and 13 years [14:54] down the road yeah like anytime like [14:56] there are certain breeds like if you [14:58] were come to me and say kale I live [15:00] downtown Toronto and I love Border [15:02] Collies I would say find a new breed or [15:05] get a new home a border coli does not [15:07] want to live in a city can you make it [15:10] work yes but my brother has to do so [15:14] much to make it work he's trained the [15:16] dog to do disc he's done all kinds of [15:18] things so that he can stimulate this dog [15:21] enough that she can be happy with her [15:24] life yeah would she rather be on a farm [15:26] chasing sheep probably but if they live [15:29] in a an apartment all day long and [15:31] they're not getting the mental work you [15:33] start to get more problems you get you [15:35] know dog dog aggression issues you get [15:38] um you know dogs doing neurotic things [15:41] like chewing their own fur and like [15:43] there's all kinds of things dog will do [15:44] just out of their element they're not [15:45] wired exactly because they're not [15:47] getting what they need so I think it's [15:50] important that you pick your breed [15:52] wisely so that that's one thing that you [15:54] don't have going against you and if you [15:57] do I'm not saying that it can't happen [15:59] like if you want to get a breed that is [16:01] high energy and requires a lot um you [16:04] just might have to change your lifestyle [16:06] to make sure that the dog meets its [16:08] needs um because sometimes if a dog is [16:10] not properly exercised and trained um it [16:15] affects how they behave in their daily [16:17] life yeah because they're not getting [16:20] what they need yeah some people just [16:22] really shouldn't have a dog because when [16:24] like the 79-year-old tiny little old [16:28] lady comes in and somebody has just sold [16:30] her a 70b German Shepherd why why why [16:35] did that happen yeah it's like it's very [16:39] difficult yeah it's a very poorly [16:41] matched team well I think you were [16:43] talking earlier about having a North [16:44] star of this is what I want out of this [16:48] relationship this is what I want for [16:49] this dog this is what I want for my [16:51] family this is what I want competitively [16:54] whatever that is not everybody's going [16:55] to compete but knowing what that thing [16:57] is and if if all roads don't lead that [17:00] way maybe it's time to get a goldfish [17:03] yeah right dogs are a lot of work but [17:05] they also can be like lifechanging for [17:08] people like there's sometimes people you [17:10] know the only reason they get out to go [17:12] for a walk every day is because they [17:14] have a dog maybe they live by themselves [17:16] and like truly like it's like their [17:17] companion so like there's so many good [17:19] things about it but I I think people [17:22] should invest a bit more time in finding [17:24] out what their good matches yeah and [17:27] then also too you have to remember that [17:28] you could like breed traits but you know [17:31] we see we see like litter mates of dogs [17:34] in our classes all the time like we'll [17:36] have like three goldens from the same [17:38] litter in the same class personalities [17:40] of dogs totally different yeah and [17:43] sometimes you're like wow everyone was [17:45] like really well matched and sometimes [17:46] you're like that puppy should have gone [17:47] to that person that puppy should have [17:49] gone is it too late to switch yeah [17:51] obviously it is they're probably like so [17:52] in love with their puppy at that point [17:53] but you can just sort of tell like this [17:54] dog's a bit more chill and this person's [17:57] like maybe a bit more chill or maybe now [18:00] they have like the really high-minded [18:01] dog and like so yeah it's just you got [18:04] to do your research that you know so [18:05] that you can start off on the right foot [18:07] uh and if you don't know and you happen [18:08] to get a dog a breed that's a lot for [18:11] you or you've gotten you've had you know [18:14] Irish Setters your whole life and now [18:15] this Iris Setter that you get is just so [18:18] different than everyone you've ever [18:19] gotten you know sometimes you got to do [18:21] things that are different not not every [18:23] dog needs to be dealt with the same way [18:26] maybe it's time for you to learn some [18:28] new tricks on how you're gonna you're [18:30] old dog that needs new tricks you are [18:32] the old dog that needs new tricks yeah [18:34] um we're talking about breed Tendencies [18:37] and sort of dog wiring DNA stuff there's [18:40] a theory I've heard that um dogs need to [18:44] bite and chew at a young age to learn [18:47] bite inhibition I have heard this theory [18:49] yes I'm sure you have what what's your [18:52] take yeah is it is interesting because [18:56] there's some um truth to the theory but [19:00] not in the way that people think so [19:04] often if we see puppies that are like [19:06] gnawing on the owner's arm or whatever [19:10] um they'll say oh he's just teething [19:13] he's just teething it's not a big deal [19:15] um or you know I've had people say to me [19:17] the dog will be biting and then I'll say [19:19] you know we should really deal with that [19:20] oh he actually just has to this is how [19:22] he tells me he has to go to the bathroom [19:24] are we going to like keep that like when [19:28] this like German Shepherd becomes like [19:30] eight months or we're going to gnaw in [19:32] your arm to be to let you know like we [19:34] got to think like big here not just so [19:37] yes there is such thing as bite [19:39] inhibition for sure and you can teach [19:40] puppies how to be careful with their [19:43] mouth in in many ways I I do lots of [19:45] games where I will play with the puppy [19:47] with my hands and if you know they are [19:50] are being respectful maybe they might [19:52] put um their mouth on my hand um [19:55] accidentally but then you see them go [19:57] oops Yeah then I would good puppy but [20:00] sometimes they don't know to do that [20:02] they'll put the hand and then you don't [20:03] react and then they're like okay well [20:05] that works so maybe I'll like grab under [20:07] your shirt or I'll bite a little harder [20:09] and if I'm not reacting to those things [20:10] because I think my dog is learning bite [20:12] inhibition I'm kind of sending mixed [20:15] signals a little bit so [20:17] um there are also other ways that you [20:20] can teach by inhibition with like [20:22] playing tug for example so that the [20:23] dog's like biting a toy rather than your [20:25] hand there's other things that you can [20:27] do so the idea of teaching bite [20:29] inhibition is great but I think just [20:32] people do it wrong yeah you don't you [20:34] don't have to be on the on the other end [20:36] of the bite no for the puppy to learn [20:38] yeah like sometimes they look at [20:39] people's arms and they look like a pin [20:41] cushion like there's just [20:44] like yeah I think oh my God go by puppy [20:46] tug and yeah like we that's too much um [20:50] and sometimes it's because the puppy [20:51] biting and they don't really know what [20:52] to do yet but other times people are [20:55] accepting that as as like the puppy Pro [20:59] but like that is not normal that's not [21:01] normal you know I've raised puppies and [21:03] I've like they've never even touched my [21:07] skin with their mouth before and if they [21:09] did they only did it once and I was [21:11] grabbing the colar and [21:12] saying what do you think you're doing [21:14] and the Pu like oh I didn't realize I [21:16] was supposed to do that and then once [21:18] you've laid the rule down now yeah they [21:20] don't know what they don't know about it [21:21] they think they're doing to go and then [21:22] we can move forward with that [21:23] conversation already being had and then [21:25] I don't really have to be strict about [21:26] it again but yeah so so yeah it's a [21:29] theory because there's some validity to [21:31] it but I think people just take it like [21:33] too far and they don't actually [21:35] understand that there's rules to yeah [21:38] how you do it and that you know it's [21:40] much easier especially if you're a if [21:42] you're a um an inexperienced dog owner I [21:46] would just have a cut and dry rule of [21:48] puppies shouldn't put their mouth on you [21:49] at all keep it simple like if you're not [21:51] able to determine um you know the [21:54] difference of things don't even let it [21:56] happen in the first place be very black [21:57] and white the puppy will have a much [21:59] easier time figuring out your rules if [22:02] if you don't have gray areas in it [22:05] um sort of in the same vein of talking [22:08] about things that maybe are [22:09] misunderstood or there's different [22:11] theories on it uh you were talking [22:14] earlier about management and supervision [22:16] and controlling your puppy uh have [22:18] successful training sessions and have a [22:20] successful sort of puppyhood for for [22:22] your dog there's a lot of different [22:25] thoughts on crates and we use crates a [22:28] lot [22:29] um what's at risk if in your opinion if [22:32] you don't use a [22:34] crate oh so much [22:38] um obvious the obvious answers would be [22:43] um probably will take you longer to uh [22:46] go through the house training Journey um [22:49] it will take you longer to and maybe [22:52] you'll really have struggles with um [22:54] teaching the puppy about um chewing [22:57] things in your house stealing things you [23:00] know any of those like um inside house [23:03] problems are way way harder to um [23:07] overcome if you're not using a crate [23:09] because of the inability to supervise [23:11] your dog every second of every day um [23:13] you just can't do that so there's going [23:15] to be times where if you can't crate [23:16] your dog um you can't pay attention but [23:19] also there's other things like how do [23:22] you leave your house if you can't crate [23:25] your dog are you just going to leave [23:27] your you know four-month-old five-month [23:29] old puppy Loos in your house while you [23:31] go and just hope that they don't [23:33] renovate your house while they're gone [23:35] or chew an electrical cord and hurt [23:37] thems or get their their collar cotton [23:41] literally I'm giving you examples of [23:42] what have H happened to students dogs [23:44] getting their collar caught in like a a [23:47] vent crate on the floor choking dying [23:50] like that's maybe a bit drastic no but [23:52] it's a reality yeah it is like you would [23:54] never leave your you know 12-month-old [23:57] child [23:59] alone even for like a moment and be like [24:02] good luck hope you're still intact when [24:04] I come back you would just never do that [24:05] there's a reason we use play pens and [24:07] cribs and yeah x pens and crates and [24:11] yeah I actually had um a couple um they [24:14] had a rescue dog so um the dog had not [24:17] been created so now they have this dog [24:20] that's I don't know I can't remember how [24:21] old it is it was like maybe 10 or 11 [24:22] months old and um it's been home to [24:25] their house for a couple months now [24:27] honeymoon period's over he was pretty [24:28] good up until this point and he's [24:30] generally a nice dog but he's pushing [24:32] boundaries now he's um not listening [24:35] he's getting into things he's chewing a [24:37] few things now um he's pushing the [24:40] boundaries a little bit they can't [24:42] really create him because he's never [24:44] been created before so they have a [24:45] little bit more of a job to do and I [24:47] said okay well like how do you like go [24:49] for dinner or like what happens when you [24:51] both have to work or shower yeah they're [24:54] like oh we have to drop them off at my [24:55] parents house so I said so you're [24:57] telling me this dog is never alone and [24:59] they said nope anyways they were like [25:02] please help me I want to be alone like [25:04] they they wanted to work on it so we [25:06] talked about obviously their crate [25:08] training issues because they're they [25:09] don't know what the dog's life has been [25:10] before how we would go through the crate [25:12] training process with a dog who's highly [25:14] stressed when he go he when he goes into [25:16] a crate he's not like just being a jerk [25:18] he's he's afraid so we have to go [25:20] through more steps and I can get into [25:22] that if you care about that but um what [25:25] would be better to do is don't get [25:27] yourself in that situation in the first [25:28] place because like what happens if your [25:30] dog has to go to the vet like look at [25:32] bee situation she broke her toe she [25:34] literally in the Netherlands had to go [25:36] to emergency be away from me for 12 [25:38] hours in a different country not that [25:41] she knew it was a different country she [25:42] doesn't care about that I did though um [25:44] but she's with a whole bunch of people [25:45] she's never seen she's in a crate she's [25:48] casted she's got an iv in her leg like [25:52] can you imagine if on top of that she [25:53] wasn't comfortable being in a crate she [25:55] and still had to fly home yeah [25:57] absolutely in a crate in a crate with a [25:59] bro with a broken toe like so many [26:00] things um again extreme example but you [26:03] got to think big picture reality yeah [26:06] but any the thing that I was going to [26:07] get to that I talked about the obvious [26:08] choices is the unobvious choices uh [26:10] unobvious reasons about crate is just [26:13] overall like relationship and control [26:15] because sometimes when people are having [26:16] leadership issues with like nipping [26:19] biting not listening barking [26:22] uncontrollably you can't stop them all [26:23] of those types of things if I can take [26:26] Freedom away from that dog and control [26:29] whether they can have access to that [26:31] possibility of making mistakes or not it [26:33] automatically elevates me in my ability [26:36] to uh be in charge of the moment if I [26:39] can't ever take those situations away [26:41] because I have nowhere I can put my dog [26:43] it's harder for me to say hey you need [26:45] to respect me because all I'm ever doing [26:47] without a crate is being like no no no [26:50] no no I'm just telling the dog no all [26:52] day long which is really making our [26:55] relationship like this it's making me [26:57] frustrated my dog's continually [26:59] rehearsing the wrong thing so I'm just [27:01] giving them such poor information so we [27:04] talked about before like how fast I go [27:07] through periods of of of issues with my [27:11] puppies I whiz through it I whiz through [27:13] it because I'm I don't go through my day [27:16] saying no no no to my puppies I say it a [27:19] little bit they're puppies they're not [27:20] robots they make mistakes but because [27:22] it's so controlled I do it a couple [27:24] times puppy learns its lesson okay check [27:26] that we we understand we're not supposed [27:27] to chew this now I don't have to worry [27:29] about it again but somebody who's not [27:30] using a crate and not utilizing control [27:34] they're just going from problem to [27:36] problem to problem to problem and it's [27:38] just so much harder um to deal with it's [27:42] so interesting this idea of being tired [27:44] of having to say no like then start [27:46] training so you can start saying yes [27:47] like yeah and it's so funny to me [27:49] because people are just they feel so [27:50] guilty about putting the dog in a crate [27:53] but like do you not feel guilty that [27:55] you're frustrated and angry with the dog [27:57] all day yeah like to me I would rather [28:00] and your dog's picking up on that your [28:02] dog knows what's happening and like this [28:04] is taking longer to accomplish because [28:07] you're not you're you don't want to [28:08] utilize the crate and the dog's opinion [28:12] of a crate is based on the owner's [28:16] opinion on the crate right like I have [28:19] never owned a dog ever in my life that [28:22] didn't love love a crate why because I [28:26] love crates yeah so I I've I've [28:28] instilled that in my puppies right from [28:30] day one I don't like get a puppy home [28:33] and be like okay I've had you home for [28:34] three weeks now I'm going to start crate [28:35] training and your goal is not to get a [28:37] dog so they can stay in a crate no yeah [28:39] my my old dogs never go in a crate slam [28:42] he's 13 years old now he he's in a crate [28:44] in my car and he's in a crate right now [28:46] at work but at home but he could also be [28:48] laying here with us right now and [28:50] absolutely yeah he'd want a pet CU he's [28:51] that kind of guy but yeah we just want [28:53] you to hold him and kiss him and tell [28:54] him how much you love him um but like if [28:56] there's a crate door open at home go in [28:58] and lie down and go to sleep because [29:00] he's been trained that it's a safe place [29:03] that it's a comfortable place especially [29:05] too I have multiple dog home um my dogs [29:08] know if they want to get away from the [29:09] other dogs or if they want quiet um you [29:12] know and there's a thunderstorm on or [29:14] the garbage trucks there beine or one [29:16] dog who's really sound sensitive she [29:18] will just quietly exit the room go and [29:20] find her crate or find like a cubby hole [29:22] or somewhere yeah and she'll just be [29:24] like okay I feel safe here I don't have [29:26] to tell her she just she feels that and [29:29] so she goes and she seeks it out all on [29:31] her own Lucy does that if I stay up too [29:33] late like if I'm up too late she's like [29:35] this is too late for me she's like Yo [29:37] close the door on your way by would you [29:39] like she does right yeah because you've [29:41] taught her that that's how she should [29:42] feel about it yeah uh it's so [29:44] interesting we were talking earlier [29:45] about like North Star people were like [29:47] what do you want uh to be able to do [29:50] with your dog yeah I think an [29:51] interesting question that we could be [29:53] asking students and and people watching [29:55] online is like what do you want to be [29:56] able to do without your dog as well [29:59] because you talking about like this [30:01] student that's like I just want to go [30:02] for dinner then let's talk about how we [30:05] can get there for you cuz if you want to [30:07] be able to go for walks on beaches and [30:08] be able to go for dinner without your [30:10] dog let's train through that if you want [30:12] to be able to go for uh walks on beaches [30:14] with your dog and go sit on a PA [30:16] somewhere with your dog so true let's [30:18] let's figure that out too both things [30:19] are attainable if we train it early and [30:22] I think that's like the life skills [30:23] thing too like you want to try and think [30:24] about in every situation like you know [30:26] it's like 9:30 10 o00 at night you've [30:28] worked all day you've exercised the dog [30:31] everything's good like if you didn't [30:33] want to create your dog What would life [30:35] look like at that time like for us [30:38] especially having multiple dogs you know [30:41] we want to be able to like sit down and [30:43] chill and all dogs have found a spot [30:46] some are chewing on a bone some are [30:48] sleeping some are like going and lying [30:51] in the crate in the kitchen on the bed [30:52] tower that you've built yep we love we [30:54] love a bed Tower in our house um but [30:57] like everybody know knows that like no [30:59] one's rough housing no one's getting [31:01] into stuff yeah everyone just knows to [31:03] go and chill um but they didn't always [31:06] know that as a puppy we had to like [31:08] train them to do that yeah like there's [31:10] been many times when five was like a [31:12] little baby puppy that we would like sit [31:14] down and watch a movie and I would just [31:16] bring him on the couch and get his bone [31:18] and have him lie with me and two on the [31:20] bone and there he'd do it for like you [31:22] know 10 15 minutes and then be like with [31:24] the other dogs out or on his own not in [31:26] the early stages cuz that would be too [31:27] attracting for him but I would isolate [31:29] other dogs would be away we'd baby gate [31:31] the stuff off or put them in the crat or [31:32] whatever uh five would be out as a puppy [31:35] and he could do it for like 10 minutes [31:36] and then he'd get like a bit like [31:37] fidgety he'd either be like tired he'd [31:39] go to sleep which would be great or he'd [31:41] be fidgety and so i''d either like try [31:43] to try to engage him or I'd be like okay [31:47] we're going in the crate then not as a [31:49] disciplinary way but be like okay you're [31:51] not ready the longer you did it the [31:52] longer he would learn to chill until now [31:55] he gets it like you turn the TV on you [31:57] sit down the dogs literally like settle [31:59] into their spot and like boom we're done [32:01] yeah you were talking earlier about um [32:04] can I just add though yeah but also [32:06] during the day they've had something [32:08] where they've been exercised they've had [32:10] a run like at the end of the day [32:14] everybody's been satisfied you've done [32:16] the physical you've done the mental yeah [32:18] yeah so like if we sit down to chill I [32:20] don't have a dog that's been like tied [32:22] up in the backyard all day long or [32:24] that's been in a crate all day and I've [32:25] done I need to go for a run [32:28] you know I wouldn't be surprised if you [32:30] got home if you not if you're not um uh [32:33] in what's the word I'm looking for I [32:36] don't know if you haven't done what you [32:38] what you need to do with a dog yeah you [32:39] also unless they're like a lazy dog by [32:41] Nature you can't expect them to do those [32:43] things right so you have to make sure [32:45] that you're doing your job so that they [32:47] can do theirs yeah I think it's [32:49] brilliant um you were talking earlier [32:51] about having a hyper puppy and people [32:54] instinctually think puppy walk [32:58] um you often will say there is there is [33:02] a time for that right now is not the [33:05] time to teach a puppy how to walk or [33:07] even just go like training aside just go [33:09] for a walk with your puppy not the time [33:11] uh why is that what's at risk if [33:14] somebody is trying to tire out their [33:16] puppy and just takes them out for a walk [33:19] a couple things um when I have a young [33:22] puppy and by young puppy I mean like I [33:24] would say under like six months um [33:28] they're also super impressionable so [33:31] like if you take your puppy for a walk [33:33] and something bad happens maybe there's [33:37] like somebody else on the street with a [33:39] very poorly behaved dog that like barks [33:41] or snaps at your puppy as you walk by [33:43] maybe you walk by a neighbor's yard and [33:45] that dog um you know rushes out until [33:48] like they get close to the electric [33:49] fence and then your puppy's like scary [33:51] maybe a garbage truck goes by what [33:53] whatever it is something happens before [33:56] your dog has training or even like a [33:58] strong relationship with you where you [34:01] can help them through recovery now that [34:03] impression is in the dog's mind and you [34:06] put me in dangerous yeah situations they [34:08] don't know how to deal with it so then [34:09] you have that hurdle you have that [34:11] hurdle maybe you have the opposite maybe [34:13] you don't have a dog that's like a we [34:14] maybe have dog that's like a bull in a [34:15] china shop and they are just dragging [34:17] you here and they're picking this thing [34:19] up in their mouth and they're pulling [34:20] you over here and that's what your walk [34:22] looks like dogs learn through rehearsal [34:25] so if you're rehearsing that style of [34:27] walk every sing single day you're [34:29] essentially training your dog to walk [34:31] that way even though you don't mean to [34:32] be doing it it's not intentional you're [34:34] rehearsing you're rehearsing it [34:36] incorrectly yeah um which now rather [34:39] than starting um to go for a walk and [34:45] the first time I go for a walk my dog [34:47] has already been trained not to not to [34:49] pull on a leash they've already been [34:51] trained to sit at my side they've [34:52] already been trained to respond to leave [34:53] it they've already been trained to look [34:55] at me on command they've already been [34:56] trained to do all those things [34:58] now I'm taking a dog that's got all [34:59] those skills and now I'm going for a [35:01] walk boy does it look different yeah um [35:04] because I can ask my dog to sit and look [35:07] at me and then the puppy does it because [35:09] they've been trained to do it yeah um [35:11] and you would use that if there is a dog [35:12] on the other side of the road like hey [35:14] look at me man don't worry about that I [35:16] got a distraction like okay we trayed [35:18] for this I know what to do in this [35:20] situation um so that's sort of the [35:22] difference that it would look like um [35:24] and then also too like there's ways that [35:26] you can take your dog out like some [35:27] people say well how do you even take [35:28] your dog outside then like if you're [35:30] taking your dog out on a six foot leash [35:32] and your puppy has zero concept of leash [35:34] respect then yeah they're probably going [35:36] to drag you even if you're just taking [35:37] them out for a pee um my puppies aren't [35:40] they're GNA get full use of the full six [35:41] feet for sure at the end yeah they're [35:44] proba they don't know any better um but [35:46] I would say that my puppies are barely [35:49] ever on the leash that I'm even going to [35:52] walk my puppy on as a puppy they're [35:54] either on a house line in the house [35:56] that's not in my hand is dragging around [35:58] or if they take them out to go potty [36:00] they're on like a long line like 25 ft [36:04] and why is that so that they're not [36:06] dragging me on on a leash got um and so [36:09] that I'm not worried about like as a [36:11] puppy I'm not I'm not worried yet about [36:14] them staying at my left- hand side like [36:16] I don't have the restrictions on a a [36:19] young puppy that I do as they maybe get [36:21] a little bit older and I'm taking them [36:22] for a walk I'm giving the puppy a bit [36:24] more freedom without having freedom [36:27] without having the ability they can't [36:29] run away from me when I have a long line [36:30] on they can't chew that stick when they [36:32] have a long line on because I can stop [36:34] them from doing those things yeah um uh [36:38] and then from there while I'm doing that [36:41] I'm training all of those skills in the [36:43] house or in class or whatever it might [36:45] be so that eventually those two things [36:47] can be melted together yeah melded [36:50] molded molded melted I feel like melted [36:53] is Right another common struggle I hear [36:55] people that have just gotten a puppy [36:58] uh either say in the comment section on [37:00] YouTube or students or just out and [37:02] about is my breeder was using a certain [37:05] kind of food I want to use this kind of [37:08] food my puppy came home my puppy [37:10] stressed and isn't eating any of the [37:12] food so um I've just left a bowl down to [37:16] try to like leave it there so that he'll [37:18] eat when he's ready yep what's your take [37:20] on this what what should people be doing [37:22] that's challenging for sure especially [37:24] when a puppy's not eating like that is [37:26] challenging and it's also a bit [37:27] upsetting because you're like crap like [37:30] I want my puppy to eat like you know [37:32] it's scary um [37:34] so backtrack a little bit if um anytime [37:38] I've brought a puppy home that um wasn't [37:41] raised in my own house because we've [37:42] brought puppies too so that's always [37:44] been easy but when you bring a puppy [37:46] home and they eat a different kind of [37:48] food than what you're going to feed them [37:50] I would always recommend to people to [37:53] like blend the two Foods together for [37:55] quite some time right and then slow [37:57] slowly shift over to the food that [37:59] you're going to be feeding your puppy um [38:03] I would personally never if my puppy [38:07] wasn't eating um my first go-to thing [38:11] would never be to put the bowl down and [38:13] leave it for an extended period of time [38:15] because that actually encourages very [38:17] poor eating habits for a puppy um it [38:20] teaches them to graze which means they [38:22] will eat little bits all day long and [38:24] you really don't have any concept how [38:27] much they're eating and when it also [38:30] will be harder to house train the puppy [38:32] because now I can't match the eating [38:35] versus when the puppy has to go outside [38:36] because I don't know when they're eating [38:38] it also diminishes my ability to train [38:40] the puppy with treats or food because [38:43] are they hungry right now I don't know [38:44] they could have just eaten maybe they [38:45] didn't eat so I am out of control um so [38:50] I would meal feed the puppy I would put [38:52] the food down for 15 minutes 20 minutes [38:55] tops if I'm just starting out um and [38:57] whatever the puppy doesn't eat I would [38:58] lift up and then I would put back down [39:00] at whatever the next scheduled meal time [39:02] is I would give them the same amount of [39:03] time and if they literally eat nothing I [39:06] would just not worry about it and try it [39:10] again the next day a healthy puppy will [39:13] never not eat for multiple days in a row [39:16] and if that is the case I would be [39:18] taking that puppy to the vet and [39:19] figuring out what the issue is um not [39:22] all food also agrees with every puppy as [39:24] well like sometimes maybe like just like [39:28] like some puppies you know they like [39:30] certain flavors of food brands of food [39:33] you could try switching it up but I've [39:35] also had some people like switch it up [39:37] and switch it up and switch it up and [39:38] switch it up and that's their problem [39:39] yeah it's like just chill yeah like [39:42] let's let's let it simmer a little bit [39:44] what do you say to the puppy and puppy [39:45] owner that um maybe not to the puppy but [39:49] uh to the puppy owner love talking [39:50] straight to [39:51] puppies uh my puppy only will eat if I [39:54] put shredded cheese on top I I person [39:57] have seen friends family that have a dog [39:59] that looks at them like they're crazy if [40:02] they put if there's not cheese on top [40:04] yeah yeah it's the same thing that I [40:06] would say about like to stop freef [40:08] feeding the dog I would just stop that [40:10] cold turkey offer what you're going to [40:12] offer and if they don't eat it pick it [40:14] up offer it again at meal time um you [40:16] want to be careful about doing that [40:18] because you some puppies will be very [40:20] particular about it um I know that dog [40:23] that I I referenced before um that I was [40:26] training for my brother mother she was a [40:28] terrible eater in the early stages um [40:31] and if I would give her higher value [40:33] treats then she wouldn't want her kibble [40:35] anymore um so I tried to train with her [40:38] kibble a lot and like for a little while [40:40] I didn't give her anything higher higher [40:42] value so that her only source of food [40:45] was the was the kibble that's it um I [40:49] also learned that she ate better at noon [40:52] than she did at 8:00 a.

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 185/199,right so um [40:56] yeah took a [40:58] while [40:59] um what do you think we're talking about [41:03] some some mistakes that people are [41:05] making that maybe they're not even aware [41:06] of what do you think is after all your [41:09] years of training all the dogs you've [41:10] trained all the students you've talked [41:12] to all the comments you've seen on [41:14] Facebook and YouTube and Instagram and [41:16] all the [41:17] socials what's the number one thing [41:19] people are doing wrong with new puppies [41:21] if you could change one thing [41:23] drastically what would it be in all new [41:26] puppy owners uh [41:29] um anything that has to do [41:35] with [41:36] leadership [41:38] so people in today's ages too are [41:45] drastically different in the way that [41:47] they think they should raise a puppy [41:49] than even like 10 or 15 years ago right [41:52] everybody babies their puppy um [41:55] everybody's so careful about what they [41:57] have to do and then you get these [42:00] puppies that like are so young and [42:04] completely run the show and the specific [42:08] things that people are doing wrong that [42:10] causes this is either they're worried [42:14] about using a crate they are um so many [42:18] people [42:20] like think that puppies should like [42:24] automatically I don't even know if this [42:25] is what they think but like they treat [42:27] puppies like they're trained when like [42:30] they're not trained so like they'll come [42:31] to class for the very first week like [42:33] baby puppy very first time theyve never [42:35] like I'm assuming this puppy knows [42:36] nothing they come in and they're like [42:39] fluffy fluffy fluffy sit sit sit here [42:41] fluffy sit like it's like but they've [42:43] never taught it no of course they [42:45] haven't they haven't taught it and also [42:47] if they had taught it the puppy would be [42:48] listening to it yeah but the puppy's [42:50] like looking over here sniffing over the [42:52] here like the person's like brown and so [42:55] the puppy's now learning that is going [42:57] to bark all these orders to me not make [42:59] me do any of those things I I'm not I'm [43:01] not even paying attention and they're [43:02] just like there's such a disconnect [43:05] between the dogs and the people because [43:07] there's like no expectation there and [43:10] it's not even about expectation it's [43:11] like they don't understand they have to [43:13] like teach puppies to do those things [43:16] before you can like take the show on the [43:18] road it's the same thing as like they're [43:20] walking their puppies they doing all of [43:22] these things but they've not actually [43:24] trained the puppy how to do it right um [43:28] and then also like the whole Freedom [43:30] thing like the the amount of times like [43:33] when I get people to describe their day [43:36] with their puppy to me I think gosh that [43:39] sounds so stressful yeah like it sounds [43:43] like chaos and Mayhem did you know it [43:45] didn't need doesn't need to be like that [43:48] if you put a house line on and you [43:49] bought yourself some baby gates and you [43:51] used a crate and you scheduled your day [43:54] a little different like the stress level [43:58] of having a puppy would like Reduce by [44:01] 80% yeah but it's like what they're [44:04] doing in the household is so drastically [44:07] wrong that like the puppies are just [44:10] learning such bad things yeah so it's [44:13] very very difficult to say it's like [44:15] it's not really like one thing it's like [44:17] it is that one thing it's the leadership [44:20] but that is caused by so many things [44:23] being done incorrectly yeah it sounds [44:25] like you're saying leadership and [44:26] supervision if you have those two things [44:28] in order this could be a pretty easy and [44:31] decent process but without those two [44:33] things so much easier it's going to be [44:35] Mayhem yeah you're always going to have [44:36] a set of problems and every puppy that [44:37] you're going to have is going to have [44:38] slightly different things like I said [44:40] even I'm a I'm a good dog trainer I've [44:42] I'm an experienced dog trainer I've seen [44:45] it all but also there's lots of things [44:47] that have come up with my puppies and [44:49] I'm like H this is interesting I have to [44:51] do this a bit different with this dog [44:52] than I did that dog um so it's also like [44:56] being open to [44:58] like not necessarily having to do things [45:01] exactly the same for every single dog [45:03] because sometimes they need you to be a [45:04] bit different sometimes this dog [45:06] requires you to beit be a bit more [45:07] strict sometimes this dog requires you [45:10] to be a bit more soft to build your [45:11] confidence like every dog's a bit [45:13] different so you have to be able to mold [45:15] to what they need why does all of this [45:17] conversation matter like I we've heard [45:21] the Mr knowt all that's like I never did [45:23] dog training my dog turned out perfect [45:26] why does all this stuff that you're [45:27] talking about matter [45:29] yeah it matters [45:32] because we hope that you've gotten a dog [45:36] to be like a very large part of your [45:40] family and the way that you will be able [45:43] to enjoy the benefit of that to the [45:46] highest degree is if you take the time [45:49] to train your dog and and to do it well [45:53] and to do [45:54] it very um intentionally when they're [45:58] young if you can uh because it's easier [46:01] you can obviously train old dogs too of [46:02] course um but it means that your life [46:06] with that dog which hopefully is going [46:08] to span over 12 to 15 years is going to [46:10] look very very different than if you [46:14] don't spend the time to do it early it's [46:17] a much more enjoyable process [46:20] yeah over all the years you've obviously [46:24] evolved immensely as a dog owner as a [46:27] dog trainer um if you think back to all [46:30] the dogs I forget how many you said [46:32] you've owned over the years is there one [46:34] dog that stands out to you that you [46:36] think back now and just go like man if I [46:38] had just known what I know [46:39] now that could have been different or [46:42] like is there is there a specific dog or [46:44] a specific thing with that dog uh that [46:47] you wish you would have known what you [46:48] know today yeah definitely I think the [46:51] dog that I got when I was 13 when I was [46:52] just like on the brink of like kind of [46:54] thinking I knew what I was doing um he [46:57] was a hard dog too like he was um sort [46:59] of a independent more self-serving dog [47:02] by nature and I didn't really know that [47:06] much about like building relationship [47:08] and Leadership I was making very typical [47:11] mistakes about like you know letting him [47:14] have a toy and then like running around [47:16] running around and thinking it's cute [47:18] what breed is this dog uh he was a whip [47:20] it Border colie Jack Russell and what [47:22] was his name Cosmic Cosmic okay yes and [47:25] uh nice dog great great dog talented dog [47:28] but like he in the early stages didn't [47:33] really care about me a whole lot he [47:35] cared about himself but I allowed him to [47:37] be that way because I didn't know any [47:38] better yeah so I think about he was very [47:41] cool so I feel like and as I got older [47:43] like obviously I got him when I was 13 [47:45] so by the time I was 19 you know we had [47:48] turned our life around a little bit I [47:50] played fball and Agility and disc and [47:51] all kinds of things with him he turned [47:52] out to be great but in the early stages [47:55] very painful could he have done more do [47:58] you think in his later years had you [48:00] known more as a yeah oh yeah he would [48:02] have been a way very talented dog in [48:04] many ways but he didn't have very good [48:06] foundation um if I had done it better [48:09] from the beginning it would have been he [48:10] would have been a much easier dog um to [48:13] live with even just in everyday life [48:15] stuff what's your message to the [48:18] people the person that is thinking about [48:20] getting a puppy or just got a puppy what [48:23] do you if you were to give them a [48:25] two-minute pep talk [48:27] what are you saying to them I would say [48:30] if you get a puppy or you're thinking [48:31] about getting a puppy do not wait to [48:36] start training like literally start [48:39] educate educating yourself on what you [48:41] should be doing with the puppy before [48:42] the puppy's even home and then as soon [48:44] as you get the puppy like get to [48:45] training right away and if you don't [48:46] have a hot clue what you're doing get [48:49] yourself into a dog program classes [48:51] something you know a person eh I do I [48:53] happen to know I happen to know a really [48:54] good dog training school um but uh [48:58] Shameless plug of course train with us [49:01] but um but that's not even what it's [49:03] about it's about training right away [49:06] because if you can start early the uh [49:10] success that you have is just so [49:13] different than trying to muddle through [49:15] things on your own and then having to [49:18] like even if you even if you've never [49:19] done it before and you start right away [49:21] you're still going to make a lot of [49:22] mistakes like so many mistakes but at [49:24] least you're gonna have somebody being [49:25] like hey [49:27] you're making a mistake with this yeah [49:29] maybe we should try doing it this way [49:30] and we can pivot you before you get so [49:32] far down the road that if you're getting [49:33] a puppy get ready to make mistakes yeah [49:35] and be okay with it and but you you need [49:37] to be seeking out guidance if you don't [49:39] really know what you're doing because it [49:40] makes the process that much better and [49:42] then like if you're going to make the [49:44] decision to have a dog honestly have a [49:46] trained dog because it's just it is a [49:50] completely different experience having a [49:53] well-trained dog than a dog that like [49:56] you're embarrassed to take everywhere [49:58] and it lives in the backyard for you but [50:00] also like think about the dog's [50:02] perspective the life that they get with [50:05] by being well trained is so different [50:09] than the poor dog that has no recall [50:12] training that you can't clip its [50:14] toenails you can't do all like think [50:15] about the life that that dog lives it's [50:18] not it's not the best life it can have [50:20] which is also kind of sad too so it's [50:22] like not even about the person it's also [50:23] about the dog yeah well there you have [50:25] it now you have all the information you [50:27] need and if you're still here [50:28] congratulations let us know in the [50:30] comments section below by saying still [50:32] here now that you have everything you [50:33] need to know how to put it all together [50:35] so to be able to do that you're going to [50:36] want to check out that

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 2/468,~Ken === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] you get your brand new puppy home you're [00:01] super excited you get in the door you [00:03] put them down what are you supposed to [00:05] do with them we don't really want you to [00:07] going in to survival mode in fact [00:08] there's actually some games that you can [00:10] play the very first day that you have [00:12] your puppy home that is going to lead to [00:14] a wonderful first day it's going to [00:16] build a great relationship with your [00:17] puppy and also it's going to Tire them [00:19] out which hopefully means that first [00:20] night is a success I'm kale this is 10e [00:24] old working cocker spaniel peasy welcome [00:26] back to McAn dogs [00:31] one of the first games I like to play [00:32] with my puppies the first day home is I [00:34] like to see what their general interest [00:36] is in toys now the reason for that is I [00:39] love to use toys in my training so I [00:42] have another way to reward my dog to [00:44] motivate my dog other than just treats I [00:47] also know that if you can get your dog [00:49] linked up to toys and they like them [00:51] that's going to lead to being able to [00:52] play fetch with them that's going to be [00:54] able to lead into restra recalls you [00:56] know calling them to a toy which also [00:58] means exercising and tiring out a puppy [01:01] it's such a great way to have a game [01:03] that's active that allows my puppy and I [01:06] to build a bit of a bond together now [01:08] peasy seems to really love this toy [01:11] which is great now these are our long [01:12] puppy tugs and one of the reasons why I [01:14] like to start with something like this [01:16] is they're long so it keeps my hands out [01:18] of the picture she doesn't really know [01:19] much about nipping and biting quite yet [01:22] uh but also it's very soft material so [01:24] even this small breed dog oh you get [01:27] that thing you wild child even this [01:29] small breed can uh sink her teeth into [01:31] it very easily and it's very graat uh [01:34] gratifying right away now I'm just going [01:36] to just play around move the toy around [01:38] just see if I can get her to latch on [01:40] pretty good and even from the early [01:42] stages I will actually start to engage [01:44] in tug and get some hands on my puppy so [01:48] I might put my hand under her chin put [01:50] my hands on her body a little bit and [01:52] the reason why I'm doing that is I want [01:53] to get her very comfortable with my [01:56] hands in nice and close and I do not [01:57] want her leaving the toy and going to my [02:00] hands but if I can do that while I can [02:02] get her really engaged in the toy it's a [02:05] great it's a great way to uh teach her [02:07] to be comfortable with that now she [02:09] drops the toy I'm just going to whip it [02:11] around and make it very exciting there [02:13] we go and once she latches on we can [02:16] play once again good girl now the other [02:19] thing that I'll start to do even from [02:20] the early stages is start to work a bit [02:23] of a trade so once I have her stuck on [02:24] the toy here I have some uh kibble in my [02:27] pocket and I'm just going to stop [02:29] playing in a second and I'm going to see [02:30] if she'll trade me for some of her [02:32] kibble and we like to use the command [02:34] out or drop it which means that they [02:37] need to release what's ever in their [02:38] mouth now this is Handy to practice [02:40] because as a puppy she's going to try [02:42] and pick up things that she's not [02:44] supposed to and I can start to this [02:46] training right away so I'm going to stop [02:48] tugging put the food right on her nose [02:50] when I'm ready [02:52] out yes I'm just going to hide this away [02:56] good [02:57] girl now did you notice that I took a [02:59] moment moment to say out what I didn't [03:01] want to do is say the command before I [03:03] was ready to actually do the trade she [03:05] was still sort of wiggling in front of [03:06] me there [03:08] puppy she was wiggling in front of me [03:10] there and I wouldn't want us have to say [03:11] out multiple times she doesn't know what [03:14] these commands mean yet but what I'm [03:15] doing is setting the tone to teach her [03:17] that when I give you a command I do want [03:19] you to respond on the first try so when [03:21] she's a puppy I'm going to set it up so [03:23] it's easier for her to do that good girl [03:25] so I'm going to show you again I got her [03:27] tugging like a maniac here which is [03:28] great I have some kibble in my hands out [03:33] trade yes and I can sneak those the that [03:37] treat the tug behind me here so that she [03:39] can't just snatch it before I'm ready [03:41] feed her a couple times and then okay [03:44] tuck tuck tuck tuck tuck get it get it [03:46] get it get it get it get it get it get [03:47] it get it get it get it get it get it [03:48] get it get it now you'll notice when [03:50] ignite her Chase Drive I'm wiggling the [03:53] toy and moving it away from her resist [03:54] the temptation to wiggle the toy in a [03:57] puppy's face believe it or not puppies [03:58] actually do not like that uh move it [04:00] around make it exciting and what I might [04:02] also do um this is sort of not popular [04:06] uh demand or popular opinion in the [04:08] early stages sometimes I'll let her win [04:10] now I don't let her run away with it but [04:12] I'll let her win and I might tug on it a [04:14] bit let her win tug it on a bit let her [04:16] win now why do I have this line in my [04:18] hand because even from the very first [04:21] moment that we are together day one I do [04:23] not want her to learn that if I give her [04:25] something that she should run away and [04:28] and take it from me and keep keep it [04:30] from me so by having this house line on [04:32] I can stop her from grabbing it and then [04:34] moving away eventually I want her when [04:36] she gets a toy the very first thing that [04:38] she thinks about is to bring the toy [04:40] back to me and that's why it's important [04:42] that even though I'm not necessarily [04:43] using the line I will use it to ensure [04:46] that if I give her the toy or she [04:48] decides to do her own thing she's not [04:49] going to go away from me she's going to [04:51] stay nice and close see you can't do [04:53] that you can't do that you got to [04:55] involve me this is all steps yes these [04:59] are all steps that I'm taking to start [05:01] building a relationship with my puppy [05:03] and these things can start literally day [05:06] one now this puppy is not mine she [05:08] belongs to somebody else I've met her [05:09] for about 10 minutes now and you can see [05:12] even though she doesn't even know me she [05:14] still just wants to follow me around and [05:16] when I change direction I get too [05:19] far good girl they will just sort of [05:22] seek people out and I think sometimes [05:24] what happens is when we take this um for [05:27] granted we end up losing some natural [05:29] things that we can be capturing from our [05:31] puppy so if I change direction and she [05:33] seeks yes she seeks me out this would be [05:36] a great time to [05:41] reward good whoop Yay good girl so I can [05:46] draw her in rewarder good girl good okay [05:53] good yes good girl so if I change [05:56] directions I can yes and reward her and [05:59] I don't even need to call her when I do [06:01] this I can just reward yes her natural [06:05] ability to sort of say hey that humans [06:07] go places I want to go [06:12] too yay good [06:16] girl so that was cool she stopped She [06:19] Went wait where are you going she looked [06:20] at me didn't make the decision to leave [06:22] quite yet and as soon as she made that [06:24] first step in my direction you'll notice [06:26] I said yes to capture that response [06:29] here's a few other people out here that [06:30] she's pretty excited about but let's see [06:32] if she offers to pay attention Yay good [06:35] girl [06:37] yay so this is a great little game to [06:40] play I can be rewarding and reinforcing [06:43] my uh behaviors and also I want to pick [06:45] her up so that I didn't chase her around [06:47] I just stepped on the line now I can [06:49] pick her up easily without having to [06:51] chase a puppy around the lawn and I can [06:54] get control this is one of my absolute [06:57] favorite games to play with my puppies [06:58] the first night home and we're going to [07:00] do a couple things that's wonderful [07:01] about this game number one is we're [07:03] going to start to work right from the [07:04] beginning on teaching our puppies a [07:06] little recall I'm going to talk a little [07:08] bit about specifics uh in a moment with [07:10] that but the other thing this is going [07:11] to do is Tire your puppy out so [07:13] hopefully you're going to have more [07:15] success in that first night uh sleeping [07:17] in their crate now in order to do this [07:19] game the sort of the the purpose of it [07:22] why we call it hallway recalls is when [07:24] we're in a hallway and we have all the [07:26] doors shut we have all the distractions [07:28] gone there is a very very limited chance [07:30] that our puppies are going to make [07:31] mistakes it's very easy for them to [07:33] rewrite so that's why when you do this [07:35] find a long skinny hallway or makeshift [07:37] something where the puppy can't Dart off [07:39] and do their own thing that's going to [07:41] allow your puppy to be successful each [07:42] and every time now I have some of pey's [07:45] dinner um just that I'm going to use for [07:47] training and this can be done on your [07:49] own but it's really fun to do with [07:51] multiple team members or family members [07:54] so uh Dan's going to come out and join [07:56] me and we are going to split up some of [07:59] her meal here so [08:03] grab that so when she gets to you you're [08:05] going to give her just like a couple [08:07] okay and I'm going to grab equal amount [08:09] I think I actually might put puppy down [08:11] because I know she's [08:14] hungry okay so I'm going to hold a bunch [08:16] of treats in my pocket now what we're [08:18] going to do to begin and put this off to [08:21] the side woo you are Speedy is I'm going [08:24] to just bring her a little close to Dan [08:26] here for a second and just show her the [08:28] treats there there we go now I'm going [08:30] to set her down as soon as she sets down [08:32] you're going to say Po and reward her [08:34] for coming [08:35] close [08:37] yes and when the puppy gets close you're [08:39] going to get some reward then Dan's [08:41] going to spin her around I'm going to [08:43] come in nice and close show her that I [08:44] have treats now she was just rewarded by [08:46] Dan so chances are she's going to think [08:48] about him oo [08:51] ready yes now when the puppy gets close [08:55] you'll notice how I'm drawing her nice [08:57] and close now ideally [09:00] it would be great if you could get down [09:01] on the floor and I know this might seem [09:04] like a bad thing to do at this stage but [09:06] I actually like the puppies to jump up [09:08] and get really close to me for the treat [09:11] because I'm trying to get her [09:12] comfortable with being in close quarters [09:14] with coming right into me what I would [09:16] not want to do is yes and feed with my [09:18] hand stretched out like this and teach [09:20] my puppy to come and stop right in front [09:22] when she gets close I'm going to draw [09:24] her in woo and I'm going to give her a [09:26] couple little treats to reward her for [09:28] being close we're not so worried about [09:30] using repeating the p p pup command [09:33] because it's something that they would [09:34] have had repeated right oh you clever [09:36] girl right from the [09:40] get-go Yay good girl um so it's okay to [09:43] repeat that the sound it's not so much [09:45] that you're saying po po pop it's more [09:47] that it's a light cheery sound it's a [09:49] really easy way to kind of capture your [09:50] your puppy's attention but in the early [09:52] stages I would try to avoid saying peasy [09:55] peasy peasy peasy peasy and just make [09:56] her think you're going to say it a bunch [09:58] of times stick to one time and if you [09:59] want to add more cheer after that you [10:02] could say yay good girl you can add that [10:05] back in but try to refrain from [10:07] repeating yourself okay ready set [10:12] pey yay now another thing that's really [10:15] helpful is while I'm feeding with the [10:16] treats in this hand my other hand can be [10:19] touching her all over I can maybe be [10:21] putting my hand in her collar I can be [10:23] touching her ears rubbing my hand down [10:25] her body I want her to get really used [10:28] to me being in her space me touching her [10:30] getting very comfortable with that she's [10:32] already in a really happy mood she [10:34] thinks this is lots of fun so it's a [10:36] great way to get her comfortable with me [10:38] touching her and why this is important [10:40] is that I'm going to have to pick her up [10:41] I'm going to have to put her leash on [10:43] I'm going to have to put her in and out [10:44] of a crate I'm going to have to touch [10:45] her all over and when she feels hands [10:48] coming in I don't want her to react or [10:50] be worried or intimidated so I can start [10:52] to initiate a lot of this Comfort by [10:55] applying it to little games that we play [10:57] good you don't care at all good the [10:59] point is to work it so that they never [11:01] care so that we don't have to go back [11:03] and fix things later now what happens if [11:05] you're practicing this and your puppy is [11:08] not responding maybe you're calling [11:10] their name or you're saying pup P pup [11:11] and your puppy is just too enthralled [11:13] with whatever distraction the person um [11:15] has there's a couple things that you [11:17] could do number one shorten the distance [11:19] we were able to back up to the end of [11:21] the hallway um because she was [11:23] successful but perhaps you might stay [11:25] only a few feet away from each other in [11:26] the early stages the other thing you [11:28] might need to do is rather than having a [11:30] whole bunch of treats in your hand and [11:31] expect your puppy to run away from you [11:33] to the other person I might feed her and [11:36] then get rid of the food in my hand so [11:38] I'll give her a couple of the treats and [11:40] if I have leftover treats I can keep [11:41] them in a container off to the side and [11:43] that way when I'm holding her I don't [11:45] have any extra things that will [11:47] encourage her to stay with me the other [11:49] thing too is think about that's a good [11:51] girl think about the value of reward so [11:53] she is seems to be very happy just to [11:56] work for her kibble for her dinner um [11:58] but per perhaps when you do this you're [12:00] going to practice with you know a little [12:01] bit of cheese or some hot dogs or maybe [12:04] a nice little puppy treat in order to [12:06] get them to be more Focus maybe [12:07] something that's a bit more high value [12:10] now we can actually utilize our crate to [12:12] play a game with our puppies the first [12:14] day home now believe it or not we're [12:16] going to start introducing the crate to [12:18] our pups the very first day we have them [12:20] home we're not going to wait to do this [12:22] now eventually I would just put her in [12:23] the crate to have a nap or to feed her [12:25] whatever I need to do but the other [12:27] thing I like to do is take a few minutes [12:28] just to play some fun little games with [12:30] her to make going in and out of the [12:32] crate a bit more of a positive [12:34] experience now to do this I have several [12:36] cookies in my hand here I do have her on [12:38] the line so that if I need to get [12:40] control I can and all I usually like to [12:42] do is start off by taking some food and [12:44] just sort of throwing it inside yay and [12:48] letting her get it when she comes out [12:50] okay oh she says I'm hoping that there's [12:52] more in there that's good when she comes [12:55] out I'm actually not going to reward her [12:57] I'm going to try and save every treat [12:59] for when she goes in the crate so I [13:00] throw another little cookie in there [13:02] okay yay good girl and then I'll let her [13:05] sort of search around a little bit and [13:07] then I can let her come out now you [13:09] could throw one treat in there you could [13:10] throw a couple treats in there she's [13:12] very food motivated puppy okay there we [13:14] good so that's why she's sort of [13:17] thinking about going in oh look at that [13:19] she wants to go in again good so once [13:21] you've done this a bunch of times kenel [13:24] yay and your puppy is willing to go in [13:26] you could start to add a little command [13:28] to it you you should say in your crate [13:30] you could say kennel you could say go to [13:31] bed whatever okay whatever command that [13:34] you want to use Good Girl Ready Set [13:38] crate whoops let's talk a little bit [13:41] about some problem solving things now [13:42] this puppy obviously is going into the [13:43] crate very easily she's highly food [13:45] motivated um she's gotten the game [13:47] pretty quickly but not all puppies might [13:49] look like this I want you to take a few [13:51] things into consideration number one [13:52] what uh type of crate are you using and [13:55] is the size of the crate well matched [13:57] for the puppy so this is a nice small [13:59] crate it's very much like a den it's a [14:01] great size for this puppy for now I [14:03] think she'll probably grow out of it [14:04] before too much longer um but if you [14:07] want to make the crate a little bit more [14:08] appealing you could also practice this [14:10] with a larger size crate that's a little [14:12] bit less intimidating perhaps you would [14:14] choose a wire crate over a plastic crate [14:16] because it's a little bit oh you locked [14:18] yourself in um it's a little bit more [14:20] open feeling yes what a good girl um [14:23] that could be a helpful thing to do as [14:24] well the other option that I've tried [14:26] with some puppies that are really [14:27] apprehensive in the past is I'll [14:29] actually take so this crate comes apart [14:31] if you just take all these Clips off I [14:33] would actually take the lid of the crate [14:35] off and just have the puppy go in the [14:37] base of the crate because then there's [14:38] nothing over top of them yes good girl [14:41] again it's um far less intimidating but [14:44] what you want to do is resist a [14:45] temptation to force the puppy to go in [14:47] the crate when you're playing this game [14:49] now again there's going to be a time in [14:51] place where you're just going to put [14:52] your puppy in because you've got to have [14:53] a shower or you've got to leave or [14:55] whatever the situation might be you want [14:56] to go in there go in there go in there [14:59] there yes good get it get it get it get [15:02] it um and and you'll make them go in in [15:05] that moment but if you're trying to [15:07] build motivation and make this a [15:09] positive thing you're only going to go [15:12] as much as the puppy will allow you to [15:13] go and if you know your training session [15:15] ends with you just being able to get [15:17] like one paw in the crate then that's [15:19] great you're just going to build on it [15:21] from there we're not going to force the [15:22] puppies to do this game this is [15:23] something that's supposed to build a [15:25] positive feeling towards the crate and [15:27] not create any stress to give you a [15:29] little context on time pey's um mom [15:32] brought her home last week so she's had [15:34] this puppy for one week and you can see [15:36] how easily this puppy is going in and [15:38] out of the crate and I know her mom is [15:40] very diligent and she's probably [15:41] practiced this a lot so just taking a [15:43] few days to practice this you go from a [15:45] puppy who could be totally uncertain [15:47] about a crate not used to a crate at all [15:48] to a puppy that happily goes in and out [15:51] you know crate guilt or stress around [15:52] the crate often has to do with the [15:54] person and not about the dog and our job [15:57] as an owner is to introduce the crate in [15:59] a positive way so that our puppies don't [16:01] even blink an eye about going in the [16:03] crate um this puppy also gets a lot of [16:06] her wo you little sneaky um she gets a [16:08] lot of her meals in the crate so for [16:10] some of her meals she's being trained [16:12] for that type of thing and if there's [16:14] any of the meal left or she's you know [16:16] doesn't want to train she will actually [16:17] give her her breakfast or her lunch or [16:19] her dinner in the crate with the crate [16:21] door closed and again it gets the point [16:23] where you start to you know put the food [16:25] in the bowl and your puppies will [16:26] actually without being asked race to the [16:28] crate and go in because they know when [16:30] they go in there good things happen so [16:32] again this puppy has had a little bit of [16:33] experience but in the grand scheme of [16:35] things really not that much she's only [16:37] been home for a week and you can see how [16:40] easily um the puppy is going into the [16:42] crate with zero stress which is exactly [16:44] what we're looking for now that you have [16:46] an idea of what to do for your first day [16:48] home you're going to need to have a plan [16:49] for the rest of the puppy stages and we [16:51] have figured that out all for you check [16:53] out that video right there on that note [16:55] I'm kale this is peasy happy training

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 13/468,~Ken === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] so often we hear students and you guys [00:02] on YouTube saying I just got a puppy [00:04] should I buy this or should I buy that [00:06] should I do this or should I do that [00:08] should I train this or should I train [00:10] that and it can be very very confusing [00:13] but it doesn't have to be and that's [00:15] exactly why I sat down with 21 time [00:17] world champion kale mccan to make things [00:19] easier for you and your four-legged [00:21] family member I'm Dan welcome back to [00:24] Macan [00:27] dogs Bing or no beding in the crate [00:30] initially first time you get the puppy [00:33] home I would say no betting to begin [00:35] with uh and then leading into being able [00:38] to add a [00:39] bed as as long as they're not going to [00:41] chew it or be on it couch or no [00:45] couch like in your home or the dog being [00:48] on the couch or not uh dog being on the [00:50] couch I mean I think you should have a [00:52] couch in your [00:53] home our dogs are allowed on the couch [00:57] um I love that I have that role uh [01:00] however the um possibility of being able [01:04] to have Coach privileges is if they will [01:07] get on and off without question when we [01:10] ask like nicely and if they don't is [01:13] there like a uh detention period Then I [01:15] take them by the caller and I say get [01:19] off caller or no caller in the house so [01:23] puppies always have a collar always [01:26] because they need to be able to attach a [01:28] line or whatever but [01:30] I will admit as they get older and [01:32] they're fully trained I actually [01:35] sometimes like to take a collar off [01:37] because I don't like when the dog gets [01:38] the collar line because I think they [01:40] look very beautiful without a kink in [01:43] their fur Ken's going to cringe at this [01:46] question because he thinks a CER should [01:49] be on all the time which is valid [01:51] because he's a firefighter and like in a [01:53] moment of danger it's probably better to [01:55] have a caller on with identification [01:57] pead or no pead [02:01] not a pead person I feel like it opens [02:03] up more problems than Solutions the only [02:07] time I would say pead would be okay is [02:09] if like you live on like the 20th floor [02:11] of an apartment building and the pead's [02:13] like on your porch or something then I [02:16] could see how it would be helpful but if [02:18] you have a house with a door and a place [02:21] to go to the bathroom outside or to the [02:22] washroom outside then I would not be [02:25] using one picking up your puppy crate or [02:28] lap for the first ride [02:31] uh I do lap despite [02:34] maybe what you may think um I usually [02:38] have a towel and I just hold on to the [02:40] puppy I think it's like a good bonding [02:42] thing also the puppies are usually like [02:45] very overwhelmed in that moment um so I [02:49] will usually uh hold them on the way [02:51] home but that's I don't do it after that [02:53] after after we've done that and we're in [02:56] a car the puppy will be in a crate up [02:57] until the day they die in a car for [02:59] safety reasons but that very very first [03:01] ride home I will I will hold them I [03:04] won't be like it's okay it's okay it's [03:06] okay or anything like that I would just [03:08] hold them like a normal person like a [03:11] normal person or a normal uh a normal [03:13] person but although maybe normal people [03:16] do the goooo Gaga thing I'm not too sure [03:19] but like I wouldn't do that first night [03:20] home y uh new food or breeders [03:25] food uh first night home probably [03:28] breeders food and then following day [03:31] start a little mixy mix real bone or [03:34] synthetic bone yeah I don't use real [03:36] bones with my uh personally with my own [03:38] dogs um I know lots of people do and I I [03:41] think it's okay but um if we're talking [03:43] puppies um and my older dogs I [03:46] personally use like nylon bone or like a [03:49] Benny bone or something like that um if [03:52] it's a puppy puppy then I might use [03:53] something it's a bit softer so it's a [03:55] bit more encouraging while their mouths [03:56] are more sensitive um but my don't get [04:01] cooked bones real bones or anything like [04:02] that really um I just feel sometimes [04:07] they can be unsafe so I stick with what [04:11] I know is safe and healthy for them dog [04:14] park or no dog park never a dog park [04:18] unless um I would be completely by [04:22] myself and there was no chance of [04:24] anybody else coming in and the second [04:26] somebody did come in I would leash on [04:28] leave even if I was there there for 10 [04:30] seconds uh because I am never going to [04:34] put my dog in an opportunity where there [04:37] could be risk where I don't know that [04:39] person or that dog um because I just [04:43] would never want to put my dog in a [04:45] dangerous [04:45] situation um and I know that there's [04:48] other ways that I can socialize them [04:49] that's safer and better for me and the [04:53] dog flexi or leather [04:55] leash um leather [04:58] leash uh how however I do like a [05:01] retractable leash for um very old dogs [05:06] like I have a I have two dogs now that [05:08] are hard of hearing and I find the flexi [05:11] like the retractable leash very helpful [05:14] um because my older dog if I use a long [05:17] line with her she can't really move so [05:19] she gets all tangled um up until that [05:22] stage though I would say leash because [05:26] again I'm trying to teach them not to [05:27] pull on the leash and if I'm using a ret [05:29] actable leash that constantly has [05:31] tension it's hard for the dogs to [05:33] understand about the idea of leash [05:35] pressure because leash pressure is [05:37] always there pure bread or mixed [05:42] breed I don't feel that you can choose [05:46] one or the other okay I'll pick mixed [05:48] breed because I can't stand people who [05:51] are like Pro only having a pure bread I [05:54] think that's so dumb they're Mi missing [05:56] out mixed breeds are like the best of so [06:00] many worlds mixed together so I love [06:03] them but I love me abort and a toy [06:06] boodle small dog or large dog small dog [06:09] large being medium large anything [06:12] outside of small dog if I had to choose [06:14] one I would say um [06:16] like like between 20 and 40 pounds would [06:21] be my ideal uh however after owning [06:24] hippie Shake I could see us owning a [06:28] small dog also cuz they're so [06:36] fun dog [06:38] mom ew Pitbull love stubborn dog

you know what we'll let uh [00:07] you at home pick want you to give me [00:11] um two of the biggest challenges you [00:14] have with your dog training right now [00:16] keep it like a couple of words keep it [00:18] short just two of the biggest challenges [00:20] that you have right now and we're going [00:22] to apply the three steps excuse me that [00:25] um you're going to need to use Excuse me [00:26] to stop any unwanted Behavior I see [00:28] Maggie price joining us another dog [00:30] supporter I need to start setting alarm [00:32] for this every other every other [00:34] Thursday as long as Ken and I are both [00:37] in the country at the same time yeah [00:39] which is most th most every other [00:40] Thursdays except except the next train [00:42] station I'll be in Texas oh and then the [00:44] following train station I think you all [00:46] be in Belgium yeah yeah okay other than [00:48] that it's every other Thursday just [00:49] every other Thursday go with that with [00:51] that said um I see uh some people are [00:54] giving us ping leash is a common one [00:56] okay so uh jumping as we apply these [00:59] three steps uh we'll be talking about [01:01] some of maybe I'll be talking about your [01:03] current challenge but understand as I [01:05] mentioned at the top of the show that um [01:08] you can apply all three of these steps [01:09] to any unwanted Behavior what we love to [01:12] do on our YouTube channel is give you uh [01:14] you know rather um broad sweeping advice [01:16] that can be applied to so many different [01:18] things and can help them as the most [01:20] people possible um as we get into some [01:22] of the more finite stuff if you need [01:25] specific advice for you and your dog [01:27] that's where we can get into our [01:29] training programs at the training [01:30] facility or our online training programs [01:32] or help people from all over the world [01:33] but you know that we need that [01:35] relationship with you to give you more [01:37] specific information but tonight's show [01:38] we're going to be talking about those [01:40] three things let's start with the top [01:44] and the the first thing that you need to [01:47] recognize is that for any unwanted [01:49] Behavior there needs to be a [01:51] consideration of foundation and fairness [01:54] what is the foundation skill behavior [01:57] that your dog understands um let's talk [02:00] a little bit about you know uh leash [02:02] pulling specifically the foundation and [02:04] fairness for that what's fair to expect [02:06] of your dog well I think for off I think [02:09] what Ken sort of said there and I'm just [02:11] going to embellish on it is that we have [02:13] to remember that dogs don't just show up [02:15] to our house knowing a bunch of things [02:18] and so you have to really evaluate your [02:19] expectations and one of the most common [02:21] mistakes that we see people do is they [02:24] get frustrated or they complain about [02:26] things that their dogs do wrong but [02:28] they've actually never taught their dog [02:30] how to do it in the first place they [02:32] just sort of expect that they can attach [02:34] a leash on the dog and then take it for [02:36] a half hour walk and they wonder why it [02:37] pulls and what why wants to grab things [02:39] off the floor and why wants to bark at [02:41] that dog and why wants to all these [02:43] doing all those things yeah what our [02:45] approach is is we try to train the dog [02:49] how to have life skills literally the [02:52] name of our program uh how to have our [02:55] how to have life skills so that we know [02:57] how to manage those types of things so [02:59] that if and when we are faced with a [03:01] challenge or whatever the situation [03:03] might be we already have the tools to [03:05] deal with that and the dog already has [03:07] an idea of what their expectation is [03:09] because of how we start with the [03:10] foundation so to give you a very clear [03:14] example if my dog cannot sit beside me [03:18] on a loose leash while there's [03:20] distractions around my dog can probably [03:23] not go for a walk around the block with [03:26] distractions don't underestimate that [03:28] like there's something really important [03:30] about that and so many people will say [03:32] like oh why don't you use a crazy dog [03:34] that pulls like mine uh because we [03:37] because you shouldn't it's not good for [03:38] the dog um let's expand on that a little [03:41] yeah and then often what happens is then [03:42] okay we don't train the dog we try to [03:45] take the dog for a walk around the the [03:46] block and that's not working so then we [03:48] you know throw a pinch colar on the dog [03:50] or we do stuff like that and um you know [03:53] we see so many people that have all [03:54] these tools all these gadgets that are [03:56] trying to you know solve their leash [03:58] pulling problem but they've never [04:00] actually done any foundational training [04:03] in the first place and um that's really [04:05] we where we want you to start so back to [04:07] my original point you know you need to [04:09] make sure that when you walking there's [04:11] a lot of things that you need for [04:12] walking number one you need the dog to [04:14] understand leash respect which means [04:15] they've learned all of the lessons about [04:17] how it's not okay to pull regardless of [04:19] whether they're walking or not number [04:21] two your dog needs to learn to listen to [04:24] you when you ask them to do something um [04:27] something even simple as respond to [04:28] their name or look at you on command um [04:32] those two things alone there's lots of [04:34] other things to do too but those two [04:35] things alone will really help your dog's [04:37] ability to be able to walk better and [04:39] those things can be trained just [04:41] stationary literally at first in your [04:44] kitchen or your living room you know in [04:46] your dining room you know in your [04:48] driveway in a very controlled space [04:51] where you can um decide the length of [04:54] time the amount of distractions all of [04:57] those types of things you can you can [04:58] make all those decisions you can control [05:00] the environment so that mainly when [05:02] you're practicing your dog is doing [05:03] things correctly and not until you feel [05:07] super comfortable about how the dog's [05:09] going to respond to you would we then [05:11] suggest that you you know take your dog [05:12] for a full-blown walk and so many people [05:15] are flabbergasted by that because they [05:18] think well you have a dog like what do [05:19] you do if you don't walk it um and [05:22] that's literally we have like all kind [05:24] of videos on that million things you [05:26] should do instead of taking your dog for [05:28] a walk that build relationship and TI [05:31] your dog Tire your dog out yeah [05:33] socialize your dog there's all kinds of [05:35] ways that you can do that without [05:36] walking your dog um you know you might [05:37] be surprised to know that when Ken and I [05:39] get a puppy they don't really go for a [05:41] walk around the block until they're [05:43] probably like 6 months old oh yeah now [05:45] that doesn't mean that that puppy is not [05:47] going out lots of places they're going [05:49] all over the places they're meeting all [05:51] kinds of people but we're not actively [05:53] like putting leash on dog and just like [05:55] blindly going for a walk for a half an [05:57] hour um I might be outside for a half an [06:00] hour with my dog on a leash but I might [06:02] be like Ping ponging around my driveway [06:03] or doing circles around toys on the [06:05] ground or stopping at working sits I'm [06:08] training my dog to walk so my dog says [06:11] gosh you're so cool you're so fun I love [06:13] looking at you I love listening to you [06:14] and then when I go out and I walk them [06:16] around distractions I don't have to [06:18] battle for their attention because I've [06:20] already trained them to do that so the [06:21] foundation is so important for us and [06:23] you need to really think to yourself [06:25] when it comes to unwant behaviors that [06:27] your dog's doing that you just cannot [06:29] stand pulling on leash jumping on people [06:31] and they come to the door have you ever [06:33] taught them to do something different or [06:34] do you just yell at them a bunch of [06:35] times sit sit sit off off off do they [06:39] know what that means and have you taken [06:41] the time to actually train it have you [06:43] given them an alternate Behavior have [06:45] you prevented it how often is the dog [06:47] rehearsing the bad thing over and over [06:48] and over again and then people are just [06:50] yelling at the dog not to do it and [06:52] there's no effect being you know no [06:54] change being made um that becomes [06:56] stressful for us because our dogs are [06:58] being irritating the moment and it's [07:00] also stressful for your dog even though [07:02] sometimes they're having a look like [07:03] they're having a riot but there's no [07:05] rules there they don't know what they're [07:07] supposed to do so they just make up [07:08] their own set of rules um but so often [07:10] we just put our dogs in a situation [07:12] where they make errors and it's really [07:14] not their fault it's just because we're [07:16] perhaps not making the best choice for [07:17] them in the moment yeah so having a [07:20] foundation of learning or a foundation [07:22] of understanding is really important I [07:23] think you covered that to Great Lengths [07:25] in in terms of fairness you know um not [07:28] only do you need to uh give your dog uh [07:32] the right information you also need to [07:34] prevent the bad stuff from happening [07:36] because dog your dog's going to do [07:38] whatever it is that's rewarding and [07:40] maybe it could be as simple you'd be [07:42] surprised it might be as simple as being [07:43] able to look at another dog to be able [07:45] to stare hard at at a person it could be [07:48] something as easy as chasing them or [07:50] sniffing the grass or you know uh [07:53] jumping up the how many times have you [07:56] uh you know been surprised maybe it's [07:58] out on a walk maybe it's someone in your [07:59] home and your dog's just so excited to [08:01] see someone and they jump up and they [08:03] jump up the the the act alone is [08:05] rewarding enough so you need to make [08:08] sure that you are preparing for these [08:10] kinds of situations and when we talk [08:12] about foundation and fairness you can't [08:15] have an expectation that the dog's going [08:16] to make the right choice until they're [08:17] taught something uh but you also need to [08:20] make sure that you're prepared for when [08:22] things don't go right and I saw [08:24] instructor Robbie mention in the chat uh [08:26] she was mentioning about to get off [08:28] leash the best thing you can do is get a [08:30] longer leash so that your dog feels like [08:32] they're off leash and that the uh my [08:34] absolute favorite way to teach walking [08:36] in verbal control is with the long line [08:38] so you know as you're as you have these [08:40] tools and you're not allowing your dog [08:42] to rehearse the bad stuff learn the bad [08:45] even worse stuff make sure you're using [08:48] the tools that are right for your dog so [08:50] we uh I I I hope I did I tried to post [08:53] some stuff that we use that we created [08:55] because we know the struggle that you [08:57] have kale mentioned earlier she said [08:59] that people spend all kinds of money on [09:01] things that aren't helpful that was me [09:04] that was me before I I went to the know [09:06] any better right you don't know I must [09:07] have spent $1,000 on harnesses and [09:10] collar and beepers and buzzers and [09:12] whistles and sprays and things none of [09:15] it work yeah I was trying to F make it [09:18] bouncy it felt fun uh but uh the reality [09:22] was good information is exactly what [09:24] turned that my my young dog's life [09:26] around like that's really what helped us [09:28] build a relationship was a good [09:29] information so when we post stuff like [09:32] I've put um I think I put a house line [09:34] if you have a uh if it's in the house [09:36] problem I also put a long line [09:38] underneath the chat uh video player [09:41] these are the kinds of tools that you're [09:42] going to need when you're working [09:44] through some of this stuff so if you [09:46] have a nuisance Behavior you definitely [09:48] need doesn't matter what it is I don't [09:49] care if it's digging in the yard barking [09:51] at the window doesn't matter you need [09:53] some way to interrupt that behavior you [09:55] need to be able to in a moment get [09:58] control of your dog because as we just [10:00] said The Barking could be [10:03] self-satisfying the Barking could be [10:05] enough that's all it takes they see the [10:06] cat they see the neighor bark bark bark [10:08] bark bark you tell them hey knock it off [10:09] and they knock it off the damage has [10:11] been done your dogs just learned boy [10:13] that felt good did you see those people [10:14] jump startle when I barked at the [10:16] windowed that worked right this is the [10:19] thing you need to keep in mind [10:20] foundation and fairness have the right [10:22] tools teach give your dog maybe an [10:24] incompatible Behavior I saw a couple [10:26] things a couple of our uh heart talk [10:29] supporters Maggie and Evelyn both [10:31] mentioned jumping they both mentioned [10:32] jumping was a challenge so for you for [10:35] everyone that's got a jumping problem as [10:38] well as anyone who's dealing with uh [10:39] walking and Leash challenges I I have a [10:41] video loaded up that kale and I are [10:43] going to talk a little bit about um in [10:46] the next element yeah we're going to [10:47] talk a little bit about some of the [10:48] progressions that's going to give you [10:50] better timing for these kinds of [10:51] situations but um before we get there [10:55] [Music] [10:57] um you mentioned a an incompatible [11:00] Behavior so for jumping up an [11:02] incompatible Behavior might be your dog [11:03] has a great reliable sit on leash beside [11:06] you you know maybe you start you see [11:08] someone coming up and you work on that [11:10] sit that's right but if your dog doesn't [11:12] find that sit at your side very [11:15] rewarding guess what it's not going to [11:17] work and it doesn't matter what you say [11:19] it's just not valuable enough remember [11:22] this is the thing that I struggled with [11:23] a little bit and I know it's something I [11:24] see a lot in the comments but like your [11:26] dog doesn't naturally want to walk at [11:28] your side you know your dog doesn't [11:30] naturally want to listen to you they [11:33] want to do whatever it is that makes [11:34] them feel the best so we need to coach [11:36] them teach them set them up so that [11:39] they're learning that listening to you [11:40] is the best thing all they've got to do [11:42] is sit in position and not get up yeah [11:45] and they get rewarded petting praise [11:47] food doesn't matter what the reward is [11:50] you have to make it valuable you have to [11:51] make it more valuable than um you know [11:53] committing the crime so to speak can I [11:55] use an example that we like to share [11:57] that just seems very simple so Ken and I [12:00] have a young dog he's two now maybe [12:02] actually almost three now um and just [12:05] thinking of um you know replacement [12:07] behaviors making something fun when 5ive [12:10] was a puppy I spent a ton of time [12:13] teaching him to run and go and lie on a [12:16] dog bed for treats um and then I would [12:18] work towards getting him to stay there [12:20] and he just thought basically the same [12:21] way he gets excited about shake a ball [12:23] and roll over he felt that way about [12:25] running on a bed he just thought oh my [12:27] God I should run on a bed I lie down he [12:28] would run and it the bed would slide as [12:31] he would lie down and he'd turn around [12:32] because he was so he loved it so much it [12:34] was like a little game we played and [12:36] then what happened is as he got a little [12:39] bit older and he got to the point a [12:40] little bit older I mean by like four or [12:42] five months old um I started the bed [12:44] training when he was 10 or 11 weeks old [12:47] and continued it through um but even at [12:49] four and a half 5 months old when he [12:51] would be in the kitchen um Ken and I [12:53] would be making dinner one of us would [12:55] be making dinner one of us would be [12:56] puppy training and what we would do is [12:58] every time we would be getting stuff out [13:00] of the stove or off the stove we didn't [13:02] want five you know running around in our [13:04] feet just so it was dangerous we would [13:06] tell him to go on his bed and then one [13:08] of us would reward him on the bed while [13:10] the other person would do the stove and [13:11] we did this you know day after day we [13:14] after week after week and before too [13:16] long if either one of us would literally [13:19] go over to the stove we didn't even say [13:20] anything to him we would put our hands [13:22] on the stove to open it he would [13:24] automatically without being asked raise [13:26] to his bed Turn Around lie down look at [13:27] us and so we were able to teach him [13:30] rather than coming and jumping on our [13:31] feet and you know trying to dive your [13:33] head in the stove which is not something [13:35] that we wanted to chance happening um he [13:38] figured out that when they do this I do [13:41] that and then I get rewarded so um the [13:44] same thing can happen when somebody [13:45] comes to your door what do you want your [13:47] dog to do you know when you're sitting [13:49] down to eat dinner and you don't want [13:50] maybe you get to the point where you [13:51] don't want to have to put your dog in a [13:52] crate what do you want your dog to do [13:54] when you sit down to watch TV what do [13:56] you want your dog to do think about all [13:58] of those things but before you do the [14:01] behavior so before I taught five to lie [14:05] on a bed while opening the stove he had [14:08] weeks of rehearsal of learning that [14:11] lying on the bed was something to be [14:12] excited about and that sort of circles [14:15] back nicely to our first point about [14:17] foundation and fairness you teach the [14:19] dog the skill so they say oh my gosh [14:22] this is great and I teach it without any [14:23] distractions I make it all about the [14:25] things the dog thinks it's that's great [14:28] then once the dog says I love this I get [14:30] it got it then I can apply it to a world [14:33] life sit a real life situation and see [14:35] how it goes um but that's sort of what [14:37] what we're talking about here but the [14:39] dogs are so smart if you can have um you [14:43] know good progression and good timing [14:44] here's something I want to do um we have [14:46] a pretty active chat uh I want to know [14:49] after this conversation and some of the [14:51] tips that Kale's given you what's the [14:53] incompatible behavior for your problem [14:56] that you're having right now I want I [14:57] want to know what you took away from [14:59] that you know I want to have a sense of [15:02] uh are you able to apply some of these [15:04] skills already um let me know now [15:09] um the next point is we you going to [15:13] show that video the uh I wanted in the [15:15] next one I think so yeah let's show it [15:17] in the next one um hold on one [15:21] sec one [15:23] second moment um I actually just while [15:27] you're doing that um I noticed that um [15:30] Maggie headset which is really nice I [15:31] can't recommend puppy Essentials and [15:33] life skills more highly so much help and [15:34] so much support um I do want to speak to [15:36] that because that's something that we're [15:38] really proud of with our online dog [15:39] training classes you know we've been an [15:41] in-person training school for you know [15:44] the last 30 years and in the last little [15:46] while we went online and one of the [15:48] reasons why it took us so long to take [15:50] our courses online is we didn't want to [15:53] not have the same face-to-face quality [15:56] in relationships we built such deep [15:58] relationships with students that we were [16:00] worried that if we went online we [16:01] wouldn't be able to do that so we've [16:03] worked really really hard to figure out [16:05] a style of program that allows our [16:08] instructors to actually be very involved [16:11] in our online students um Robbie's one [16:13] of our our head you know instructors um [16:16] in the program and you know on any given [16:19] day I can ask her she can tell me all [16:21] about people's dogs and their lives and [16:23] what they do for a living and you know [16:25] what the dogs learned this week like and [16:27] the support group is really important as [16:28] well matters like not just just for [16:30] something to say or like something to [16:32] hold high it's because it matters we [16:34] care about your success but the support [16:36] group it's not just from the instructors [16:38] you actually actually get to have [16:39] support from all the other people that [16:41] are in the program we have a great group [16:43] where people can ask questions you can [16:45] see other people's questions you can see [16:46] other people's answers you guys can [16:48] commiserate on things that are driving [16:50] you crazy you can celebrate about the [16:52] things that you you know have we have [16:53] Wednesday wins where everybody shares [16:55] what they're doing so the support really [16:57] goes a long way so that you know if [16:59] you're thinking oh I'm too far away to [17:00] go to school there um you know our [17:03] online program really is great the [17:05] support part I think is one of the best [17:06] part that that changes things so I I'm [17:09] not seeing enough incompatible behaviors [17:10] yet like I really think it's important [17:12] you know I want you to take action here [17:13] I want you to problem solve and think [17:15] because we can break those down a little [17:17] explain more what you mean by that well [17:18] I mean we just talked for uh a a great [17:22] length about uh if you have a pulling [17:24] problem maybe you need to start with a [17:26] sit at your side you know if you have a [17:27] jumping up problem you a leash on and [17:29] and you're prepared for when someone's [17:31] coming in your home what's your [17:32] replacement behavior for your problem [17:34] absolutely we I you know I really think [17:35] it's important I really want you to um [17:39] be creative too you know there are a [17:40] million things that are going to be fun [17:42] to teach your dog that aren't this [17:44] problem Behavior now to be better uh [17:47] about when we talked a little bit about [17:49] what to do now we need to talk about [17:52] when to do it because the when may be [17:54] more important than the what depending [17:56] on your dog timing is critical when it [17:59] comes to solving some of these nuisance [18:02] behaviors timing is so important we [18:04] talked a little bit earlier about how [18:07] it's a lot of these things are [18:08] self-satisfying your dog is really [18:09] excited to bark at the neighbor your dog [18:11] feels great when they get to jump up on [18:13] your aunt you know whatever that is your [18:15] Aunt yeah your aunt your auntie you say [18:19] Aunt yeah or your your aunt aunt okay [18:23] your aunt you get jum I don't think I've [18:26] ever I don't think aunt and your [18:29] [Laughter] [18:32] uncle they you know it's super [18:34] satisfying for them to get away with [18:35] that kind of thing so you need to know [18:38] when you when to interrupt and there are [18:40] a few signals that your dog's going to [18:42] give you before they actually commit the [18:44] crime let's talk for a moment about uh [18:47] jumping up as an example you know Evelyn [18:49] and Maggie both mentioned that jumping [18:51] up is a struggle of theirs yeah uh and [18:53] jumping up can be difficult especially [18:55] if a wiggly and energetic dog like [18:57] sometimes it just they jump so fast um [19:00] and it's hard to get a hold of them so [19:01] number one you know if you're in a [19:03] situation where your dog could perhaps [19:05] jump I would High recommend that you [19:09] have your dog on a leash or a long line [19:10] so that you have something to control [19:12] the physical dog with if they don't have [19:14] a leash on and you're trying to grab at [19:16] the dog pull at the dog's collar pull at [19:18] the dog's body um number one you could [19:20] scare the dog and number two mostly [19:22] number two is some dogs just think it's [19:24] a game they think it's fun um so having [19:26] a leasher line is going to be really [19:27] important the other thing you want to do [19:29] is get really good at reading body [19:31] language and jumping up on people this [19:33] is actually going to be the same advice [19:35] for if you have a dog that's jumping up [19:37] on countertops and stealing things um [19:40] dogs will always give a precue to their [19:43] bad behavior whether it's jumping [19:44] whether it's barking whether it's [19:46] pulling whatever it might be there's [19:48] always a preq and the preq is often the [19:50] thing that the average person misses but [19:53] a dog trainer gets so as a dog trainer I [19:56] know the precues for all the things so [19:58] when my dog is thinking about doing the [20:01] bad thing I'm on it because I know it's [20:04] about to happen I can see it in the [20:05] dog's body language I can see it in the [20:07] dog's energy and I can react so for [20:10] jumping what a lot of dogs will do is [20:12] they'll make direct eye contact with the [20:13] thing they want to jump up with and then [20:15] typically what they'll do is they'll [20:17] coil down a little bit to give [20:19] themselves a little ump for when they [20:20] jump and then they'll jump up so when I [20:22] see that look in that coil that's when [20:25] I'm going to try and stop the dog from [20:26] jumping and that could be a quickly [20:29] saying hey sit getting the dog to do [20:31] that alternative Behavior we've been [20:32] talking about or perhaps I might take [20:34] the leash and stop them from jumping up [20:36] at the leash and place them into a Sit [20:38] get them doing something else but what I [20:39] must do is I must stop them before the [20:43] feet land on the person before the feet [20:45] land on the countertop and now they're [20:47] mwing down half a Christmas turkey um [20:50] it's very important that we're doing our [20:53] uh getting our dog to stop early because [20:55] if my dogs now polished off that turkey [20:58] you know and then I'm trying to get the [21:00] dog off the counter yes we're still [21:01] correcting the dog yes we're still [21:02] getting the dog off and the dog's like H [21:04] would have like the whole turkey but [21:05] half will just suit me just fine I'm [21:07] going to try later to get the other one [21:08] because I was successful so you've got [21:10] to get them before the crime is [21:13] committed and follow through by reading [21:16] the dog's body language and getting [21:17] really good at reading those precues [21:19] because that's going to give you the [21:21] best timing you possibly could have yeah [21:23] it's uh funny I was trying not to uh [21:25] smile too much because you want turkey [21:27] well no uh although I could use some [21:29] turkey uh I had that exact thing happen [21:31] like precisely that I uh she ate half a [21:34] Christmas turkey not a Christmas turkey [21:35] but a turkey why else do you have turkey [21:38] uh it was a Halloween turkey it was a [21:40] seasonal turkey it just wasn't quite [21:41] exactly the same um no it was this was [21:45] prior to us being married well long long [21:47] before I was uh I had even come to McAn [21:49] dogs it was um but I I left having [21:53] Halloween turkey by the way right right [21:54] of course not um but I'd left the turkey [21:57] on the counter and I'd gone outside I'd [21:59] actually gone out to the store or [22:00] something gone away and I come back in [22:01] the turkeys on the floor anyway long [22:03] story short was an uncooked turkey thank [22:05] goodness with that said um so you talked [22:09] about I think it's important to [22:11] understand kale mentioned that like you [22:12] interrupt the behavior you know do [22:13] something to get the dog's attention [22:15] away when is the most when is when is [22:18] the time that you're most likely to be [22:21] successful you know the moment that your [22:23] dog decides that thing is interesting [22:26] that moment especially if you're [22:27] struggling with jump jumping up [22:29] especially if you're struggling with [22:30] pulling if you're what it doesn't matter [22:32] what the thing is that you see them and [22:34] this is why supervision is so important [22:36] we talked to we talk a lot about using [22:38] house lines and having eyes on your [22:41] puppy when they're free to make [22:43] decisions their own decisions in your [22:45] home it's really important the same [22:47] thing applies in your yard the same [22:49] thing applies at the park wherever you [22:51] are if you have a dog in training and [22:53] you're not sure what they're what choice [22:54] they're going to make you have to be [22:55] supervising them people say like oh that [22:57] sounds like so much work cuz it is it is [23:00] work happens when you get a dog it's [23:02] work right but this is exactly until you [23:04] get to enjoy it because it's not work [23:05] anymore because you did such a great job [23:07] training them exactly this is EXA this [23:08] is precisely how you get great reliable [23:11] decision making from your dog by not [23:13] allowing them to make the wrong choice [23:14] all the time people always say was how [23:16] do you guys have four dogs it's so easy [23:19] they all they just it's no work because [23:22] they listen it's nowhere yeah we're also [23:24] quite intentional which we talk in some [23:25] of our puppy training schedules or in [23:27] dog training schedule stuff we're quite [23:29] intentional about you talked about like [23:31] some exercises things that we do that [23:33] aren't walking walking's fine you know [23:35] we love to take our dogs for walks and [23:36] Hikes and whatever but there's some way [23:38] better ways to build relationship like [23:40] restrained recalls playing tug teaching [23:43] tricks teaching tricks yeah teaching [23:44] them to play fetch totally these are the [23:46] keys these are the secr this is the [23:48] shortcut you know you know we always [23:50] talk about shortcuts that can undo your [23:51] training these are the shortcuts that [23:53] make your relationship stronger make [23:55] your dog learn how to learn and able to [23:57] problem solve a little bit better as we [23:59] talk about timing I want to talk about [24:02] the uh training Target so why don't we [24:05] jump into this because I think it'll be [24:06] valuable for any of you in in this one I [24:09] think we're jumping up so this in this [24:11] clip we're talking about jumping up but [24:14] the same thing applies if you have a dog [24:16] who is uh driving ahead on leash or [24:19] whatever barking at the window you know [24:21] whatever the thing is if it if it [24:23] involves some some sort of distraction [24:25] then this is for you I want you to pay [24:27] close attention to this so let's dive [24:29] into that um video give me one [24:32] sec oh it's a great shot of me it's just [24:35] looks like I'm about to sneak looks like [24:37] we to sing yeah yeah I want to introduce [24:40] to you the concept of a training Target [24:42] so you know what a Target looks like I [24:44] want you to think about those different [24:45] areas as different thresholds that you [24:47] can use with your dog to make things [24:49] either easier or more challenging as [24:52] your dogs training progresses so if you [24:53] look at the biggest um circle on a [24:56] Target it's the usually the easiest one [24:57] to achieve aeve it's going to be the [24:59] same thing with your dog training if [25:01] you're working with your dog around [25:03] other people think about having those [25:05] people stay in now you know if if it's [25:08] if it's pulling on leash if it's jumping [25:10] up if it's uh you know barking at people [25:13] or dogs I want you to really think about [25:16] what does your target look like you know [25:18] in this instance that red box this is a [25:21] dog named uker and uh the red box is the [25:24] area where uker is definitely going to [25:26] jump up uker is going to do something [25:27] and it's it's there she just has no [25:29] chance being successful burgundy um okay [25:32] the yellow is where is is your training [25:35] Zone in the green uker couldn't could [25:37] care less you know uker is just [25:38] interested in kale at this point but [25:40] think to yourself how what's what are [25:42] these distances for my dog that we're [25:44] working with that they're going to be [25:46] successful that they might be successful [25:48] and that we're definitely going to fail [25:49] I want you to think about that as we you [25:51] listen to this in the biggest area of [25:52] the target the furthest away from your [25:54] dog um in order for your puppy to be [25:56] successful now if they're a distance and [25:59] your dog is able to sit on a loose leash [26:01] they're able to check in with you [26:02] they're able to be attentive you can [26:04] then have that person close into the [26:06] middle part of that Target they can come [26:08] in a little bit closer and this is where [26:10] really where you're going to need to [26:11] work your butt off now it doesn't all [26:13] need to be perfect it's okay if somebody [26:16] starts to get close and your dog makes [26:18] an error but what you do about that [26:20] error is going to make all of the [26:21] difference let's talk first step so [26:23] you're out for a walk with your dog your [26:25] dog happens to see somebody at at a [26:26] distance you can kind of tell they're [26:28] going to come in to want to say hello to [26:29] your dog what's the first thing that you [26:31] should do well the first thing you need [26:32] to do is get your dog's attention before [26:35] they get locked on to that distraction [26:36] so I might interrupt her I might use a [26:38] bit of food hey pup what's this hey hi [26:41] what's this and I might lure her into my [26:43] side and go to a control exercise that [26:46] she's been working on so she understands [26:48] that when she's sitting at my side yes [26:50] that she needs to remain in that [26:52] position even though there's [26:54] distractions around and this is an [26:55] obedience skill that we drill into them [26:57] and when they're young to help teach [26:59] emotional control that goes back we [27:01] should mention briefly that this is a [27:03] dog that's not super food motivated you [27:05] know we had we had to teach her to be a [27:07] little bit more food motivated by uh so [27:09] how did you do that how did you get uh [27:11] more food drive out of that dog oh [27:13] that's a very large answer that you're [27:15] asking me right now okay do you want me [27:17] to do the large answer um I mean I think [27:20] a lot of people will say like oh my [27:21] dog's not interested in food especially [27:22] when we go outside yeah you got to work [27:23] at it you know she basically all of her [27:26] meals we worked for her meals I of [27:28] course I tried different types of food [27:30] to get her more motivated um but [27:34] basically I just sort of stuck at it and [27:37] um she really for the first several [27:39] months of her life didn't really she [27:42] didn't really eat out of dog dish and [27:43] know that probably sounds absolutely [27:45] strange but she wasn't really interested [27:47] in that so because if I would feed her [27:49] and she would eat and then I would want [27:50] to train her with treats she'd be like [27:52] me I already ate I'm not that interested [27:54] in it and then I couldn't really train [27:55] her so I had to kind of combine the two [27:58] so for all of her meals she basically [28:01] had to do stuff for me in order to get [28:03] the food because she was hungry um and [28:06] that was really great because it kind of [28:07] killed Pur with funstone and got her to [28:09] eat but it also taught her that like [28:11] food the thing that she wanted came from [28:14] me which elevated um how she felt about [28:17] me which was you know really really [28:19] important to do yeah it's also important [28:21] to understand that like in this specific [28:23] case as because it's easier to shoot a [28:25] video that's not from a kilometer or [28:27] point seven miles or whever long it is [28:29] away the your your circle your um [28:33] training Target it could be the Red Zone [28:35] could be enormous and when you go [28:37] outside the moment you step out your [28:38] door your dog's like Oh yay forget it [28:41] I'm I'm out of here what that means is [28:44] you're going to have to start to get [28:45] some success before you even go outside [28:47] of the door you know your dog needs to [28:48] have a foundation to be fair they need [28:51] to understand that putting in a little [28:52] bit of effort is worth it so that may be [28:55] your starting point and know a lot of [28:56] people are like oh as soon as I step [28:57] with the door I've lost them well you [28:59] better start getting some Su success [29:01] inside yeah and keep in mind too this [29:04] puppy um she has already before we [29:07] started working this greeting manner [29:09] training she already knows to sit at my [29:11] side on a loose leash so the skill that [29:13] she's doing right now she has done this [29:15] many many many times and that goes back [29:17] to what we said at the top of the show [29:19] is that Foundation I can't train her not [29:21] to jump on people if I haven't taught [29:24] her that sitting beside me is wonderful [29:26] so she knows that we've worked a lot on [29:28] that with nobody around so that when she [29:31] sits you can see she's licking her lips [29:32] she's got a loose leash she's looking at [29:34] me she's been trained to do that and [29:36] because I have that skill now I can go [29:38] and combat more challenging things like [29:41] people being around but if my if the [29:43] puppy doesn't know how to do this y [29:45] you're not going to have people walking [29:46] in because it's just going to be a total [29:47] dumpster fire so you want to make sure [29:49] that you're teaching the the [29:51] foundational skill first and your puppy [29:54] says I got this this is simple I sit [29:56] beside you you feed me I look look at [29:58] you Mya L this is great she loves to do [30:00] this exercise I've made it fun now it's [30:02] easier for me to combat distractions [30:04] because I can rely on this so my dog's [30:06] in the control position and as that [30:08] person approaches I'm just going to say [30:09] hey how's it going just hold on wait [30:11] there one second I'm just going to [30:12] instruct them to just sort of stop at a [30:14] distance good girl okay come a little [30:16] closer yes good girl good sit yes and my [30:20] focus is going to be more on the dog and [30:22] less on the person now if that's [30:24] important so very important let's talk [30:26] about that if you have a jumping up [30:27] problem or leash pulling problem or [30:29] whatever your problem is uh you need to [30:32] be more focused on your dog yeah all you [30:34] know 90% of your attention is going to [30:35] go into what are they looking at what [30:37] are they doing where are they you know [30:38] are they close enough to affect change [30:40] are they too close to the distraction [30:42] but it's all you're really focused on [30:43] here and then the rest of it you know [30:45] the rest of your awareness of the [30:47] environment is per peripheral vision you [30:49] know when we teach our um in our life [30:51] skills programs we teach walking un [30:53] leash past tough distractions and uh we [30:55] talk a lot about you know as you're as [30:58] you're walking with your dog you know [30:59] you're almost eyes are almost set on [31:01] your dog at the beginning because you [31:03] want to know when they start to leave [31:05] you when the leash goes tight you want [31:06] to know when it's the perfect time to [31:08] reward and you're certainly able to see [31:10] when uh tough distractions are coming [31:12] and how far you're walking uh you know [31:15] but but we really want you to be not [31:16] only uh like physically V you know [31:19] visually focused on your dog but also [31:21] mentally focused on your dog yeah um [31:24] just one more thing um you know a lot of [31:27] the times in this situation uh you'll [31:29] notice when Ken was approaching me there [31:31] just in case you didn't know that's Ken [31:34] um people were fool yeah um is I was not [31:39] just standing there crossing my fingers [31:41] hoping that uker would make a good [31:42] decision I was helping her make a good [31:45] decision by rewarding her every couple [31:47] of seconds I was rewarding her at that [31:49] rate because she she doesn't really know [31:52] this yet she's in training right now [31:54] she's learning so if I was just to sit [31:56] there quietly and not say anything thing [31:58] I know for sure she would have got up [32:00] from that leash and and from that sit [32:02] and jumped on Ken so I try to be more [32:04] proactive now of course I'm working [32:06] towards being able to not shove food in [32:08] her mouth every two seconds and and that [32:10] type of thing I'm working towards that [32:11] but I've got to start some in a place [32:13] where she can be successful so you can [32:15] see I wasn't really paying attention to [32:16] Ken I was feeding and talking to her and [32:18] rewarding her but you'll notice I wasn't [32:20] forcing her to stay at my side my leash [32:22] stayed loose that whole time I'm not [32:24] holding her back because when you hold a [32:25] dog back you do not make them use [32:28] emotional control anymore you do all the [32:29] work for them if she wanted to get up [32:31] she could I'm just getting her to choose [32:34] not to because I'm making being with me [32:36] more valuable and you'll see she's [32:37] probably going to make a mistake in a [32:38] second um and you'll see what I do if [32:40] she gets up but I want to just make sure [32:42] I I drive that point home so we're not [32:45] forcing the dog here we are are making [32:47] the better choice more rewarding so that [32:49] she wants to make the better choice that [32:52] she's oops if she's overd distracted and [32:54] she can't hold that sit I'm just going [32:56] to ditch the food and I'm I'm just look [32:58] at how happy she is she's so cute you're [33:01] like melting sit good girly I'm going to [33:04] place her back into that sitting [33:05] position see being put slack back in the [33:07] leash as soon as I put her back on my [33:08] side and once she's on a loose leash [33:11] there's okay so let's talk we talked [33:13] about foundation and fairness the [33:14] foundation is uker has had uh experience [33:18] or she's been taught to sit in at your [33:20] side you've worked on that timing the [33:23] moment she got up and this is something [33:25] so many people do make the mistake of [33:27] doing the moment your dog gets up that's [33:30] the moment you need to stop them bring [33:31] them back because you've got the right [33:33] tools on them you know you've got your [33:34] six foot leash uh you have some way of [33:36] controlling them but the the moment it [33:38] happens you need to stop it and then you [33:40] can place them back in position then [33:42] you're going to put them back where you [33:43] want them and as kale mentioned once you [33:45] get you can see they've sort of settled [33:47] in they've started to relax they're [33:48] understanding oh this is what you want [33:50] you can start rewarding I one more thing [33:52] yeah and have expectations something [33:55] that I just makes me [33:58] want to shake my head is when people say [34:01] oh well he just wants to get up and say [34:02] hi all right it's like people the dog [34:05] the dog supposed to be sitting you told [34:06] the dog to sit the dog just gets up and [34:08] they oh well he's just friendly he wants [34:09] to go say hi so yeah of course he does [34:13] we get that and we're not saying that [34:15] that's not okay what we're saying is not [34:17] okay is that the dog shouldn't choose [34:19] when to listen and when not to listen it [34:21] would be one thing for that dog to hold [34:23] a sit at my side on a completely loose [34:25] leash wait for me to say okay go say hi [34:28] and then let them go it's another thing [34:29] for the dog to say I'm going to sit here [34:31] until I feel like it and then I'm going [34:32] to get up and do other things that's the [34:35] part where leadership comes in and if we [34:37] don't have clear expectations and we [34:38] don't follow through we're going to get [34:40] into the consistency piece in just a [34:42] moment but that's really not going to [34:44] allow you to to have success so you need [34:46] to make sure that you you have a [34:49] consistent um or a clear expectation and [34:52] that the dog isn't dictating what [34:54] happens you're dictating it um that's [34:56] really really important well and I think [34:58] to get back to foundation and fairness [35:00] it's not fair for your dog to think that [35:03] sometimes they can get up to greet the [35:05] person and other times what are you [35:06] doing you know oh he knows how to sit um [35:09] but last time you know you let him get [35:10] up uh in in this time that Nana walks in [35:13] the door and he gets up and he jumps on [35:14] Nana you're like what are you doing fine [35:16] yeah you know it's it's uh it's just not [35:18] fair so um really be aware of that you [35:20] know control the situation and it's a [35:22] great leadership opportunity you're [35:24] going to find a million um natural [35:26] training opportunities a super simple [35:28] one and this is so easy is before you [35:30] start your walk you you insist that the [35:33] dog sits you get them in a sit before [35:35] then you gently open the door maybe it's [35:37] just a little bit you reward them for [35:38] remaining in that sit then you can open [35:39] a little bit more if they're still [35:40] sitting you reward them for that then [35:42] you step out the door some of these acts [35:46] that uh people are like well you got to [35:48] be the leader in the alpha I go through [35:49] the door first it has nothing to do with [35:51] that it has everything to do with [35:53] getting the dog to understand that if [35:54] they work yeah yeah if they can control [35:57] their emotions just for a moment they're [35:59] going to be rewarded by it so you know [36:01] it's it's going to be uh it's an [36:03] important thing to understand my papa [36:05] runy I'm going to yes and reward once [36:07] again okay come in and try again sit yes [36:11] now if she's able to hold the sit as [36:13] that person gets close I can then say [36:15] all right you can pet her good girl oops [36:17] oh my goodness oopsie so I want her to [36:20] maintain that sit even though she's [36:22] being padded so she gets up the [36:24] opportunity to be padded sort of is is [36:27] non not on the table anymore try again [36:30] yes good girl yes good girl yes now the [36:35] next thing that I can the other thing I [36:36] want to talk about with timing is uh the [36:39] amount that kale was rewarding when uker [36:41] was in a sit at her side like I mean [36:43] your dog is maybe like this too uh they [36:46] might be so excited that they just can't [36:49] there's oh yeah they can't contain [36:52] themselves so what Kale did is rewarded [36:54] uker several times when it was the [36:56] toughest the hardest part is when [36:58] someone's you know actually petting your [36:59] dog or when they're coming in really [37:00] close so kale is like really being over [37:03] the top about rewarding cuz she needs to [37:05] make it the rewarding and sit more [37:08] valuable than jumping up getting up you [37:10] know being around someone do is I also [37:13] could give her permission to go and say [37:14] hello but when I do that I'm going to [37:16] keep my leash handy and I'm going to [37:18] instruct that person just to be calm now [37:20] another issue that we've had with uker [37:22] is that if she's starting to feel um a [37:24] little bit over excited sometimes she'll [37:27] actually submissively pee and it's even [37:29] worse if people are squeaking and [37:31] squawking and bending over top of her so [37:33] I'll often just encourage people to [37:34] either stand up tall or bend down and [37:37] and sort of keep their body upright and [37:38] then I'll let her go and say hello good [37:40] okay good go say hi okay go say hi hi [37:43] buddy off good girl good how nice is [37:46] that how nice is that that the that uker [37:50] not only did she uh automatically sit [37:52] but she also turned back and look toward [37:54] Kale like wouldn't you don't you want [37:56] that don't you want your dog looking you [37:58] for like hey are we doing yeah this is [37:59] great eh uh you that's our Canadian [38:02] coming out that great e yeah yeah [38:03] totally oh yeah no doubt about it um [38:06] don't you want your dog looking to you [38:08] for information in a situation where [38:10] they're like I'm not sure what the right [38:11] choice is what do you think you know if [38:14] people had that kind of relationship [38:15] with their dogs because this is what [38:17] allows the independence like this is [38:19] what allows the freedom is because you [38:21] can let your dog have an absolute blast [38:23] and go for a run in a wide open field [38:26] because you know when you call your [38:28] dog's coming back this is these are like [38:31] those in between steps that you need to [38:33] take to get to this point but it's [38:34] because of a solid foundation of [38:36] understanding Fair expectations of the [38:38] dog the right equipment and good timing [38:40] I want to jump back to um you just [38:43] reminded me of something of like back [38:45] when we when we first started hanging [38:47] out when you were not a dog trainer MH [38:52] um when we would take my dogs for a walk [38:54] and I used to let them like all run off [38:55] leash and you would have you would have [38:56] like a lot of anxiety about them all [38:59] being off leash because that's not [39:00] something that you were used to and I [39:02] would like be all relaxed and Ken would [39:03] be like shouldn't you put them on a [39:05] leash like blah and I'd be like no they [39:09] they they come back right yeah and and [39:12] now look at you obviously it's totally [39:13] different it's been so it's been so long [39:14] now but it's just you end up interacting [39:17] with your dog in such a different way [39:19] when you know you can trust them because [39:20] you know they're going to listen and now [39:22] you actually can like enjoy that hike [39:23] you can enjoy taking them off because [39:26] you just don't you just don't think [39:28] about it you don't worry about it [39:29] because you know they're going to listen [39:30] it's just such a a more stressfree to [39:33] spend time with your dog it's what you [39:35] want like that's I didn't truth be told [39:38] I didn't want to go to dog training uh [39:40] my vet said I had to go get training [39:42] because he couldn't assess my dog in [39:43] like an examination and but I I thought [39:46] like oh this is going to be so much work [39:47] I don't really want to do it and after [39:49] two lessons in our life skills program I [39:50] was like this is incredible she's she's [39:53] listening like she's starting the skills [39:55] are there like we're starting to move [39:57] forward and in fact for those of you who [39:58] it's your first time instructor Robbie [40:00] was my very first instructor which is [40:02] very cool for life skills but um so uh [40:06] you know that's the kind of life you [40:08] want to live with your dog that that's [40:10] the kind of experience you want to have [40:12] and it's going to take a little bit of [40:13] work you know there's going to be some [40:15] effort involved but I will tell you [40:17] without a doubt it is so worth it it's [40:20] so worth it because then you can go more [40:23] places do more things your dog can be [40:25] involved in more things they can be out [40:27] and around your family in more [40:28] situations it's going to lead you to [40:30] have uh you know what I think um your [40:34] dad would say uh those train dogs live [40:36] longer too which totally makes sense for [40:38] a whole bunch of Reason absolutely do [40:40] now with that said I want to quickly get [40:42] to the uh the next Point Natasia Lopez [40:46] is asking if we're married oh yeah we [40:48] are in fact we are married MH yep um [40:52] consistency we have to talk about [40:54] consistency when we um do we not act [40:56] like a married couple I think we must [40:58] it's confusing that we don't have the [41:00] last same last name I suppose is it I [41:02] don't know it's the way it's it seems [41:04] normal to me I don't know yeah we marri [41:07] if you spent a little bit of time with [41:08] us you would very quickly realize we are [41:10] very much from the amount the kale yells [41:12] at [41:12] me that's not it from the amount that I [41:15] don't laugh at your jokes and roll my [41:16] eyes even though they're hilarious am I [41:19] right we have to talk about consistency [41:21] when it comes to your training in some [41:22] of those nuisance behaviors um kale [41:25] talked a little bit uh about in that [41:27] jumping up demo and this is especially [41:30] important when it comes to stuff like um [41:33] having accidents in the house pulling on [41:35] leash you know I S I know a lot of [41:38] people are struggling with pulling on [41:39] leash and they're like well you know uh [41:41] I mean I have to exercise the dog um or [41:44] I love this one he's great the first [41:46] half of the walk like we're doing great [41:48] and then all the way home he pulls me he [41:51] drags me home so we need to talk about [41:53] consistency because moving back up to [41:55] the foundation never go home it's it's [41:58] unfair yeah it's unfair for you to um [42:02] let your dog pull half the time and then [42:04] insist that they walk great half the [42:06] time it's just not it's not fair because [42:08] they won't know when to choose so there [42:10] are a few steps it we take to um allow [42:12] our dogs a little bit more freedom in [42:14] walks but we'll also make sure that [42:16] we're not putting ourselves in a [42:17] situation where our dog is probably [42:19] going to fail let's talk about [42:20] consistency we'll talk about maybe [42:21] pulling on leash for the first one and [42:23] we'll get to a couple others sure yeah [42:25] um pulling un leash [42:27] um it's insanely important that you are [42:30] consistent because uh pulling on leash [42:33] is one of the harder things to to it's [42:35] one of like one of the final things [42:37] pulling on leash and recalls I would say [42:39] are one of the two um skills that take [42:43] the longest to do and one of the reasons [42:45] why is that it's it's difficult to be [42:47] consistent about those types of things [42:49] so um in order to be consistent you need [42:51] to have an expectation of course you [42:53] need to have a clear idea of sort of [42:54] what you're going for and you need to [42:56] make sure that you're consistent in the [42:59] way that you follow through so um you [43:02] know in our training classes we will [43:03] teach you a lot about how to reward how [43:05] to correct how to change direction those [43:07] types of things so you have the tools to [43:10] manage the different decisions that your [43:12] dog makes and you know how to react to [43:13] them um but it's really up to the person [43:16] to be consistent about that because as [43:18] Ken sort of mentioned if sometimes [43:20] you're following through and sometimes [43:22] you're not um the dogs kind of learn to [43:25] have you know two sets of rules um you [43:28] know the other thing that will happen [43:29] with consistency is we have lots of dogs [43:32] that will come to class and they are [43:34] perfect little angels when they come to [43:35] class and then they walk their dogs to [43:37] the car and the dogs drag them or [43:39] they're at home and they they they just [43:40] pull it home and they never pull in [43:42] class or vice versa they're they're [43:44] totally distracted in class and they're [43:46] perfect at home and a lot of it has to [43:48] do with the person not having the same [43:50] type of consistency and expectation in [43:52] both locations and if the dog can learn [43:54] to do it in one spot they can learn to [43:58] do it in another spot um and a lot of it [44:00] comes down to just follow through in [44:02] your part absolutely um jumping up we've [44:06] talked a little bit about why being [44:07] consistent and that is important I think [44:09] we do also need to talk a little bit [44:11] about uh consistency of supervision if [44:13] you don't see it happen you can't stop [44:15] it that's the reality your your dog [44:17] learns within one second so whether [44:19] they're doing the thing that you want or [44:21] the thing that's driving you crazy you [44:24] have one second to let them know whether [44:26] it's right or wrong [44:27] um so you know I know a lot of people [44:30] struggle with digging in the yard [44:31] barking at the fence you know all of [44:34] these things you need go lean out the [44:35] door and like hey knock it off be quiet [44:37] out there too late you know um I chatted [44:40] with somebody um from work not that long [44:43] ago uh my other work I'm also I also [44:46] work as a firefighter and I mentioned to [44:48] him that um he's having trouble with his [44:50] dog barking the backyard I said well [44:51] what are you doing about it he's like [44:52] well every time he barks I'll go out [44:54] there and you know tell him to stop it I [44:56] said that's it's your first problem you [44:57] know you can't let your dog put your dog [44:59] in a situation where they have enough [45:01] time to uh commit the crime commit the [45:03] crime oh I like that self- rewarded [45:05] can't have the time to commit the crime [45:07] there you go take I'm making a t-shirt [45:09] of that uh but it's really really [45:11] important regardless of your nuisance [45:12] Behavior you have to be supervising we [45:14] talked at the top of the show about and [45:16] have some way to deal with it you know [45:18] have some sort of um uh management tool [45:21] leash uh house line long line some way [45:25] to interrupt that behavior or CR creates [45:27] a great way because you can't supervise [45:29] 24/7 no somebody said that I can't be [45:31] with my dog 24/7 so how you toally you [45:34] can't always watch them how do you make [45:35] them listen when you're not there oh [45:36] it's great this is a perfect example [45:38] yeah yeah this is how you be consistent [45:40] yeah so you're going to go out of your [45:42] way to exercise your dog make sure all [45:44] of their needs are met they're fed [45:46] watered exercised they're ready to have [45:48] a nap and then you're going to put them [45:49] in their crate y because you can't watch [45:51] them all the time you know it's so [45:53] important and yeah and if they're not [45:55] trustworthy if you can't them to be [45:58] loose in your house while you're not [45:59] there they should not be loose in your [46:01] house while you're not there we would [46:02] never dream of and our dogs are well [46:05] trained you know when they're young they [46:07] get trained very very fast sure I would [46:09] never leave a six-month-old puppy loose [46:11] in my house while we go out to work for [46:13] the day because you know as much [46:15] training as I'll do with them they're [46:17] young they're curious they're [46:19] investigating like you know what if they [46:21] eat something and they get hurt and they [46:23] die like I know that's a bit dramatic [46:25] but you know you you can't you have to [46:28] make sure that until you can 100% feel [46:32] that you can trust your dog ons [46:33] supervised that they are controlled when [46:35] they're unsupervised and then when they [46:37] are supervised you have tools that you [46:39] implement that allow you to be [46:42] consistent that allow you to have good [46:43] timing that allows you to to follow [46:45] through with types of things like the [46:47] long line the house line we have baby [46:49] gates in our houses so there puppies [46:51] can't just like sneak off into the [46:53] living room if we're in the kitchen [46:55] whatever it might be we control all of [46:57] the things that we make our lives easier [46:59] to do the puppy training we don't have [47:01] to wonder what where the puppy is or how [47:03] to control them because we've we set up [47:05] the environment around us to help us be [47:08] in a winning situation with our dogs [47:10] Isabelle joining us from Tasmania [47:12] Australia one of our heart dog [47:14] supporters uh Belle's from the future I [47:16] think it's Friday there isn't it uh we [47:18] have a lot of students from Australia [47:20] tons in New Zealand which is very cool [47:22] um I also see Sam khaw has joined the [47:25] chat welcome Sam uh welcome back from [47:28] your little nappy poo uh hopefully it [47:30] was a good one um yeah so so speaking to [47:33] consistency speaking to supervision yeah [47:37] because Sam's he's an old fell okay yeah [47:40] I think that's what he called it one [47:41] time [47:43] um consistency is key you know uh and [47:46] supervising managing your dog [47:48] appropriately these are all the ways [47:50] that you can win and it it might be one [47:53] of the more important steps when you're [47:55] solving an an unwanted uh Behavior any [47:57] nuisance behavior is being consistent [47:59] about your expectations I don't want you [48:02] to do this ever you know [48:04] [Music] [48:06] um I think that's good I think I think [48:09] we can probably leave it at that is [48:11] there anything you wanted to mention uh [48:13] a sort of big picture for nuisance [48:15] behaviors people that are struggling [48:17] with their dog pulling un leash jumping [48:18] up on people barking at the neighbors [48:21] honestly we've covered it all well [48:24] invest the time right yeah really it's [48:26] it's going to be some work it's going to [48:28] be work yeah these are not easy things [48:30] to fix if you're if you're out here [48:33] searching for a quick fix in order to um [48:36] get your dog trained and become a well-b [48:38] behaved family [48:40] pet you're not going to find it here you [48:43] know there's lots of things there are [48:45] many things that you can uh get better [48:47] results quickly but dogs are are not [48:51] robots they're living and breathing [48:53] animals they're learning and taking [48:54] information every single second of the [48:56] day just like you are as a as a human um [48:59] and sometimes things take time and [49:01] consistency and that type of stuff but [49:04] if you put in the work for the first you [49:06] know year of their life um you get to [49:10] enjoy the next 13 15 16 17 years with [49:15] just enjoying all of the hard work you [49:16] put in the one year I think sometimes [49:17] when you're in the the foundational part [49:20] of the training it thinks like oh my [49:21] gosh this is so much work how long is [49:23] this going to take and then all a sudden [49:24] you're like huh wait a second I talk [49:26] listen really well I can just I can just [49:29] roll with the bunches so um yeah take [49:32] take the time to do it right and sort of [49:35] to to um to your point you know it's not [49:36] a straight path like some days are going [49:38] to be great and you're like I think the [49:40] problem solved maintain that consistency [49:42] don't don't be lulled into a sense of [49:44] security uh because there going to be [49:46] some great days some tougher days um but [49:48] believe me you know don't I don't want [49:51] you'd ever feel like this is too much [49:53] you know like this is I don't know I'm [49:55] just going to stop Trading together cuz [49:57] it's too hard because there are [49:58] resources available you can watch our uh [50:01] content on YouTube you can actually get [50:03] personalized support from uh our online [50:06] training programs you can come come to [50:08] our training facility and get you know [50:10] uh you know iners support um it's it [50:14] this is what it changed everything for [50:16] me you know I I can't I just can't say [50:17] enough about it and every time I have a [50:19] conversation with an instructor or we [50:20] hear from a student you know I feel [50:22] really great about uh being able to help [50:25] people with their dogs because um you [50:27] know it's so so rewarding and and it's [50:30] worth it before we go can we tell them a [50:32] little bit about our pool for some of [50:33] our local people sure yeah go ahead yeah [50:35] so um very excitingly last week our we [50:40] just put in a 40 foot dog specific dock [50:44] diving pool um and it just opened for um [50:49] for everybody's use uh last week which [50:52] is really exciting we were hoping it [50:53] would be earlier in the summer but um [50:55] there's still lots of lots of wonderful [50:57] weather left before uh before it's too [50:59] late um so it's exciting you can rent [51:02] the pool to exercise your dog um if [51:05] you're not interested in dock diving [51:07] specifically there's two really nice [51:08] ramps that the dogs can go down so they [51:10] can go swimming um we have a 13-year-old [51:13] dog and you know we're not jumping him [51:14] off the dock because he's too old for [51:16] that uh but he goes down the ramps and [51:18] he really enjoys swimming it's been so [51:20] good for his body uh we go in the water [51:22] with the dogs too and swim um so rental [51:25] if your dogs never swam before maybe you [51:27] want to learn about how to teach them to [51:28] be you know comfortable with water we [51:30] have um dock diving um and swimming uh [51:34] private lessons and um four-week [51:36] programs where you can learn all about [51:38] um all kinds of stuff like that so it's [51:40] tons of fun so if you're a local [51:41] definitely stop by and check it out um [51:43] we'll probably have it open for another [51:45] month and longer hopefully if if the [51:47] weather is um nice but uh yeah we're [51:49] pretty pumped about it if you if you use [51:52] music for your dog maybe you're working [51:54] on crate training maybe you're working [51:56] on uh you know them getting stressed [51:58] when you leave your home we worked with [52:00] some digital music creators to make the [52:02] perfect music for dogs we followed the [52:04] right beats per a minute we use the [52:06] right tones these are sounds and songs [52:07] and music that fills the environment so [52:10] some of those environmental sounds don't [52:12] stress them out so much at the end of [52:13] tonight's show uh you're going to be [52:15] redirected so that you can check out the [52:17] Mand dogs Music Channel we have two [52:18] 24-hour streams

a [52:26] month which is very exciting but um it's [52:29] great on uh Spotify or apple music or [52:31] any of those music I fall asleep to it [52:33] all the time yeah cuz because it works [52:36] anyway big picture guys uh lots of [52:40] information now it's time to do the work [52:42] so with all of the teaching all hang on [52:45] one sec we're going to go back here I [52:47] want to bring

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 29/468,~Ken === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:02] when we have dogs that are getting older [00:04] we really truly want them to live [00:06] forever I want to share with you today [00:08] some of the things that we do with our [00:10] senior dogs that I think makes a big [00:12] difference in their overall well-being [00:14] and care and hopefully it helps your [00:16] dogs too I'm kale this is Grand Slam [00:20] welcome back to Maan [00:22] [Music] [00:23] dogs I'm sure you've heard that popular [00:26] phrase you can't teach an old dog new [00:28] tricks um but I'm going to kibos that [00:30] because you absolutely can teach an old [00:32] dog new tricks in fact I actually think [00:34] it's a great idea to do things that [00:36] require your older dog to use their [00:38] brain um mental health is so important [00:41] for the dogs because as they get older [00:43] maybe they aren't as physically capable [00:45] of doing what they did when they were [00:46] younger you still want to encourage them [00:48] to use their brain so continuing to do [00:51] training with your dog is a great way to [00:53] help them feel young whether that be [00:55] through um brain games there's so many [00:58] fabulous um food puzzle type of games [01:01] out there on the market we have a couple [01:03] that we really love to use with our dogs [01:06] um teaching them new tricks that type of [01:08] thing but also just maintaining their [01:10] good skills so if you know if he's had a [01:12] lot of recall walking all the training [01:14] in the world he's had over his lifetime [01:17] as they get older you know it's just [01:18] like putting gas on the car once you've [01:20] trained them for the first couple years [01:21] of their life it doesn't mean that when [01:23] they get to be 13 years old like slam is [01:25] they're still going to be picture [01:27] perfect at listening so I still want to [01:29] make sure that I'm following following [01:30] through with my expectations and then [01:32] also understanding that he might not be [01:33] able to do things as quickly or as [01:35] efficiently as he once was able to the [01:38] other thing that you want to think about [01:39] and you'll notice this mostly when you [01:41] are thinking about the training aspect [01:44] um is everyday life you know one of the [01:46] things I started to notice when he [01:47] wasn't listening as well is I actually [01:49] started to realize that he was losing [01:51] his hearing and he can't really hear [01:53] very well anymore only about you know 10 [01:55] 15t away can he really hear me so I've [01:58] had to utilize some of the training that [02:00] I've had done with him in the past in [02:02] order to keep him safe and keep him with [02:04] me um one thing that I've noticed is [02:06] that if I clap that high pitch yeah that [02:09] high pitch clapping sound is a great way [02:11] to get him um to look back at me and [02:13] then when he was younger I trained a lot [02:15] of hand signals he knows how to sit lie [02:17] down come on a hand signal so if I can [02:20] get him to look back at me I can give [02:22] him that hand motion to run back and I [02:24] don't have to worry about yelling and [02:25] screaming because he can't hear me [02:27] anyways when I know that I want to give [02:29] him a little bit more freedom and I want [02:31] to make sure he's safe then sometimes [02:33] I'll walk him on a long line so he would [02:35] have had this back on you know early in [02:37] the early days when he was learning to [02:38] come when he was called but now it's [02:40] just a way for me to give him some [02:41] freedom to move around and have some fun [02:43] as an old guy but I know he's not going [02:45] to get so far away from me that he can't [02:47] hear me um heaven forbid he get lost um [02:50] the other thing I don't have it on him [02:51] right now because he was swimming [02:53] earlier but I'll also put like an air [02:54] tag or something like that on his collar [02:56] so that if he happened to get too far [02:58] away and he couldn't hear I always have [03:00] a way of getting him back make sure you [03:02] have identification on um their collar [03:04] but yeah some of the things that you [03:06] have to think about with an old dog is a [03:07] bit different than a young dog [03:09] especially when it comes to the age when [03:11] they start to to lose their hearing [03:13] there's a lot more things to think about [03:14] in terms of their safety when it comes [03:17] to exercising your senior dog um [03:19] exercise just in general is very very [03:21] important I think that one of the [03:23] reasons why I've had dogs live for as [03:25] long as I have my last dog I just lost [03:27] at almost 17 years old is because I [03:30] focus on making sure that I exercise [03:32] them every single I do something with [03:34] them every single day it might not all [03:36] be super intense come on bring that toy [03:39] you're going to make me go in the water [03:40] with my running shoes buddy oh there we [03:43] go get [03:45] it um but swimming is a really great [03:49] option for dogs because it's very gentle [03:52] on their bodies you can see he swims [03:54] nice and slow it's not a lot of impact [03:56] on his body but it really allows him to [03:58] stay fit um also he absolutely loves it [04:02] he looks forward to doing it every [04:03] single day obviously you might not have [04:05] access to a dog specific dog pool unless [04:08] you're local then come check us out um [04:10] but just swimming is a great thing to do [04:12] we will hike we'll go for walks um but [04:15] I'm also very aware of how much the dog [04:18] can do so my younger dogs might be able [04:20] to go for like a big long hike I might [04:22] be gone for hours on those ones I might [04:24] choose not to bring slam on those ones [04:26] because it might be a little bit too [04:27] much for him so you need to be really [04:29] aware of what you're your old dog can [04:30] handle um in terms of of not overdoing [04:33] it there's sometimes I'll see dogs out [04:35] there I'll sometimes see people that are [04:38] walking their old dogs and they're like [04:40] slowly walking behind on the end of a [04:42] tight leash you can clearly see that the [04:44] walk is just too much for the dog at [04:45] that point so just be careful that [04:47] you're not overdoing it but at the same [04:49] time make sure you're doing something [04:51] with them because the more mobile that [04:53] you keep them um as long as it's in a [04:55] gentle and thoughtful way um the fitter [04:58] they're going to be and the health year [05:00] longer they're going to live let's talk [05:01] a little bit about feeding our Senior [05:03] Dogs now when it comes to feeding you [05:05] may need to make some changes because as [05:07] our dogs get a little bit older they're [05:09] not able to have the same metabolism so [05:12] often if we're feeding the dogs the [05:13] exact same food the exact same amount of [05:15] food and we pair that with perhaps lack [05:17] of exercise a lack of movement it's [05:19] really easy for older dogs to become a [05:21] bit overweight so you may consider um [05:24] reducing the amount that you give them [05:25] or even just switching their food [05:27] entirely there's some great senior dog [05:29] food out there that has a little bit of [05:31] a better makeup in terms of fat protein [05:33] content um is also easier for your dogs [05:36] to digest it as well um in terms of what [05:39] to feed your dog it's best to talk to [05:41] your vet about that um something to [05:43] consider is that as dogs get older [05:45] sometimes they'll have thyroid issues [05:47] Grand Slam has some thyroid issues which [05:49] prevents me from being able to feed my [05:51] dog certain things some dogs have kidney [05:53] issues things like that so um it's [05:55] important that you talk to your vet [05:57] about what would be right for your dog [05:59] in that regard C the other thing that I [06:01] would highly recommend that you look [06:02] into is building in some type of [06:04] supplement into your dog's meal time um [06:08] as I get older adding some type of joint [06:10] supplement and anything like that um [06:12] Omega um Omega-3s those types of things [06:15] can be really great for your dog's [06:17] digestive system as well again in terms [06:20] of what supplements that you use you [06:22] need to talk to your vet because there's [06:23] lots of different things out in the [06:24] market tons of great things to choose [06:26] from but certain dogs will connect with [06:28] certain supplements another another tip [06:30] I have for you for feeding older dogs [06:31] and you actually don't have to wait till [06:32] they're older to do this is add water to [06:34] their food so if you're feeding kibble [06:36] adding water to the food is a great way [06:38] to just give more water intake but also [06:40] it often will slow the dogs eating down [06:43] so all of my dogs right from the [06:44] beginning actually if they're being fed [06:46] kibble I add a little bit of water to [06:48] just enough that that the kibble floats [06:50] and it's a great way for them to slow [06:52] their eating down so they're not [06:54] gobbling it up quite so quickly [06:55] something else that you can do to make [06:56] feeding time a little easier for your [06:58] senior dog is get a raised Bowl often [07:01] standing and leaning over top of a bowl [07:04] especially for some of our larger breed [07:06] dogs that can be uh a little bit harder [07:08] for them to do so as they get older I [07:10] actually like to feed them in a raised [07:12] Bowl so that they actually don't have to [07:13] lean over anymore this is also a great [07:16] tip for any of our dogs that have um the [07:18] flatter noses it's easier for them to [07:20] actually eat as well grooming your older [07:22] dog is also something you need to think [07:24] about and things change a little bit as [07:26] they get older um I would definitely [07:29] recommend checking their teeth on a [07:30] regular basis I found that my older dogs [07:33] aren't as apt to chewing as regularly as [07:36] they did when they're younger so they're [07:37] going to end up getting more plaque and [07:39] Gunk on their teeth so do check their [07:40] teeth often um again this guy's 13 years [07:43] old so he does have a bit of plaque it's [07:45] not too bad but perhaps you know [07:47] starting to brush your dog's teeth if [07:49] they're not chewing as much might be [07:50] something that you should do as they get [07:52] a little bit older the other thing you [07:54] want to think about too is um you know [07:56] when you're grooming or when you're just [07:57] doing basic like snuggle time get your [07:59] hands all over your dog's body because [08:01] as they get older they do start to grow [08:03] different lumps and bumps um that maybe [08:06] they didn't when they were younger and [08:07] sometimes they are like fatty tissue and [08:09] they're just not a big deal at all and [08:11] other times they could be of concern so [08:14] um just be aware on a regular basis of [08:16] of how your dog's body feels um also [08:19] getting them groomed on a regular basis [08:22] is great too because sometimes their [08:23] older coats will mat a little bit more [08:26] he has sort of like a massive undercoat [08:28] so we do have to brush him a little bit [08:29] more often and they feel so much better [08:32] after they've had um a more regular [08:34] groom um the other thing that's really [08:36] important to note are nails um my [08:40] experience is that dogs as they're older [08:42] their nails grow uh a little bit faster [08:45] usually it has to do with the fact that [08:46] they're not moving uh quite as much as [08:48] they were before and um the thing that's [08:51] really important to note with older dogs [08:52] as their nails get longer is their [08:55] muscles are also not as strong either [08:57] and if their nails grow too long um and [08:59] you don't clip them on a regular basis [09:01] their actual foot posture on the floor [09:04] can start to change and this can lead to [09:05] more discomfort this can lead to um more [09:09] arthritis so it is really important that [09:11] you trim those Nails on a regular basis [09:14] um to make sure that they're not growing [09:16] too long the other thing that can be [09:18] really helpful too just for stability uh [09:20] with your dogs sort of hand inand with [09:22] the nail thing hi Bubba is um if you [09:24] have a house that has slippery floors [09:27] kitchen floors laminate hardwood those [09:28] types of things it's not a bad idea to [09:30] put it down a few extra Runner mats you [09:33] know some of the higher traffic areas [09:34] for your dog that's just going to give [09:36] them a little bit more grip it's going [09:37] to prevent them from slipping and [09:39] falling especially as their Mobility [09:42] starts to get maybe not quite as as good [09:44] as it was before um and that's just [09:47] going to lead to your dog having just an [09:49] easier time moving around your home now [09:51] that you know some of the changes that [09:52] you need to make for your senior dog I [09:54] want you to check out some really fun [09:55] brain games that you can play with them [09:57] the video for that is right there on [09:59] that note I'm kale this is Grand Slam [10:02] happy training

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 42/468,~Ken === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] I've been training dogs for over 25 [00:02] years in that time I've also become a [00:05] doctor of Chiropractic and a certified [00:08] animal chiropractor too often people [00:09] come to see me with injured dogs that [00:11] are the result of things that they are [00:13] doing in their everyday life and they [00:15] don't even know it I'm instructor Meg [00:17] welcome back to McAn [00:19] [Music] [00:21] dogs often times I see pet parents doing [00:24] their absolute best to exercise their [00:26] dogs but there are a few things that we [00:28] can do incorrectly that can actually [00:30] harm our dogs one of the first things I [00:33] see are owners that are trying to [00:35] physically exhaust their dogs to the [00:37] best of their ability so they do lots of [00:39] high-intensity retrieves high-intensity [00:48] chuetsu without proper cool down and [00:51] with too many throws we're really [00:54] risking our dog's health I see dogs all [00:56] the time that are played with until the [00:59] point of fatigue and then even sometimes [01:02] pass that point the other thing that I [01:04] often see is what I call weekend warrior [01:06] syndrome that's a dog that might get the [01:09] walk around the neighborhood every [01:10] evening maybe a block or two due to [01:12] their owner's very busy schedules but [01:14] then on the weekends when you have a [01:15] little bit more time you take them on [01:18] really long walks or hikes sometimes [01:20] even upwards of 10 or 15 kilometers that [01:23] often then results in a dog that doesn't [01:25] have adequate exercise all week but [01:28] again is stressed to the point or [01:29] fatigue or injury on those weekends when [01:33] by doing what you think is best for them [01:34] you're giving them too much we need a [01:36] balance here we need dogs that are [01:38] exercised every day but not so much that [01:40] it's going to hurt them both mentally [01:42] and physically so what do we do instead [01:45] for one being able to recognize the [01:47] signs of fatigue in your dog or knowing [01:49] when to quit is really important in fact [01:52] I want to stop before my dog is showing [01:54] those signs of fatigue so perhaps [01:56] instead of throwing 10 balls you're [01:58] stopping when your dog's only had five [02:01] maybe seeing if your dog is showing less [02:03] enthusiasm you try to quit before that [02:05] point if your dog is showing less uh [02:08] speed with the things that you're asking [02:10] them to do those are all signs that your [02:12] dog is doing too much sometimes a dog [02:15] even shows fatigue by mentally not being [02:17] as sharp or as willing to do things for [02:20] you my goal is to always quit before I [02:23] see any of those signs in my dog the [02:25] other thing that I try to do to ensure [02:27] I'm not having this weekend warrior [02:28] syndrome myself is having daily walks [02:31] perhaps a little bit longer even if you [02:34] need to a shorter walk in the morning a [02:36] shorter walk in the evening in order to [02:38] get that same amount of exercise and not [02:40] pushing things too far on the weekends [02:43] just because I'm enjoying my time with [02:44] my dog you need to be careful that you [02:46] are not asking too much of a dog [02:48] especially at an early age and a later [02:51] age in life the awesome things about [02:52] dogs most of them is that they want to [02:55] play with you they want to engage they [02:56] want to work but they don't know when to [02:59] quit they're there are many dogs that [03:00] will play to the point of injury fatigue [03:04] and these types of dogs need to be told [03:07] when to stop and that's your [03:08] responsibility the other thing we need [03:10] to be quite careful about is that the [03:12] dogs need to be of a healthy weight if [03:15] your dog is overweight that is putting [03:17] significantly more stress on all of the [03:20] tissues in their body so if your dog has [03:22] an extra layer of fat on them they [03:24] shouldn't be going hard right now that [03:26] is going to result in a dog who is [03:28] likely to injure themselves [03:30] it is also our responsibility that we [03:32] keep our dogs nice and trim one of the [03:34] other things that I am very passionate [03:36] about is making sure that dogs are [03:38] trained on safe training surfaces here [03:41] at the hall we have wonderful rubber [03:42] floors this is great for dogs walking [03:45] for playing for retrieving any of the [03:47] exercises that we ask them to do when [03:49] I'm training my puppies at home I try to [03:52] choose surfaces that are going to [03:54] encourage good traction and safety so [03:57] even when my 8we old puppies come home [03:59] and I'm working some simple skills or [04:00] some trick training I make sure that I [04:02] have a carpet a rubber floor even some [04:06] foam mats that I can put out to give the [04:08] puppy good purchase when I'm asking them [04:10] to do things that's going to build their [04:12] confidence and it's going to ensure that [04:14] they're not slipping and sliding this is [04:16] not just for retrieving or for playing [04:19] even simple obedience skills I like to [04:22] work on when my dogs have good footing I [04:24] don't want to have a dog run down my [04:26] stairs in my house and then slip out on [04:28] the floor as they try to get out the [04:29] back door that is a perfect location for [04:31] putting a carpet Runner or a yoga mat to [04:34] ensure that the dog has good footing all [04:36] the way from the kitchen to the back [04:38] door where they're going out to go to [04:39] the bathroom I've talked about some [04:41] indoor surface issues it's also [04:42] important to talk about outdoor surfaces [04:45] when you're exercising your dog it's [04:47] important that they also have good [04:48] footing when you're playing with them [04:49] outside when I look outside if I'm going [04:52] to be engaging with my dog taking them [04:53] on for a run letting them play in the [04:55] park I'm going to make sure that I'm [04:57] doing that on nice dry grass living in [04:59] Canada we deal with a lot of ice that's [05:01] something that I take very seriously I'm [05:03] not going to take my dogs on a long hike [05:05] on an icy Trail at any time doesn't [05:07] matter what age they are this is [05:09] something to be aware of because dogs [05:11] don't always know to slow down they [05:12] don't know how to keep themselves safe [05:14] so it's up to you to choose where they [05:16] get to run and when they get to run [05:18] there are a few activities that I don't [05:20] let my dogs do especially from a very [05:22] young age one behavior that we know can [05:26] be very damaging to a young puppy is [05:28] jumping from Heights especially [05:30] repeatedly so I don't allow my puppies [05:32] to jump in and out of my car I don't [05:35] allow them to jump on and off of my [05:36] couch or on and off of my bed if you [05:40] have a small puppy best thing to do pick [05:42] them up lift them up to put them into [05:44] their crate in the car every single time [05:46] right now do the same thing when they're [05:47] exiting the car if you have a larger dog [05:50] or an older dog they make wonderful dog [05:53] ramps if it's too difficult for you to [05:55] lift your dog into the car no matter [05:57] what though we do not want to allow them [05:58] to repeatedly [06:00] hurt themselves by jamming those joints [06:02] jumping in and out of those Vehicles [06:03] another area that I'm commonly seeing [06:05] injuries in dogs is because of improper [06:08] use of toys or improper play when we're [06:11] retrieving or playing with our dogs it's [06:14] important that the toy is not going over [06:17] top of their head so if a dog is really [06:19] enthusiastic they're leaping launching [06:21] twisting their body and Landing [06:23] improperly when they go to retrieve that [06:25] toy for some dogs it's actually not the [06:27] Toy's fault the dog is so excited about [06:30] that toy that they are not taking good [06:32] care of their bodies I have a border [06:34] colleag that when I try to retrieve with [06:36] her she will go so fast that she will [06:39] actually hurt her body jamming into the [06:41] grass coming up with grass all through [06:43] her mouth in order to get that toy in [06:45] time for this dog I do a lot of throws [06:47] where I have her beside me I toss the [06:50] toy I wait for it to stop moving we call [06:53] that a dead toy then I give her [06:55] permission and send her out to get that [06:56] toy if I was to allow her to race and [06:59] launch after the toy she might flip she [07:02] might roll she might Jam her front feet [07:05] all of which could result in injury [07:07] especially when you consider that over [07:09] the lifetime of a dog they might do this [07:12] hundreds or thousands of times it's not [07:15] one retrieve that's going to get them [07:17] it's likely going to be those repeated [07:19] retrieves that's doing damage or risk to [07:21] their bodies you also need to consider [07:23] the setup of your house in my house I [07:26] have stairs I'm not going to discourage [07:28] owners from allowing their puppy to do [07:30] stairs but I will say I encourage them [07:33] to teach them how to do them safely I [07:35] often start with just one stair at a [07:37] time putting the puppy on the stairs [07:39] luring them and rewarding them for going [07:41] down the stairs slowly and thoughtfully [07:44] if your puppy can't be slow and [07:46] thoughtful I also recommend putting them [07:48] on a leash at first gradually I build [07:51] more and more stairs rewarding them [07:53] slowly each time they go down until [07:55] eventually you have a dog that [07:57] understands not to run up or down the [07:59] stairs at speed which also could [08:01] potentially harm you if they take you [08:03] out along the way but instead take their [08:06] time go down the stairs in a thoughtful [08:08] manner in my house I actually encourage [08:10] my dogs to stay behind me as I walk down [08:12] the stairs they're not allowed to blast [08:14] past me they're not allowed to blastp [08:16] pass my children and this keeps everyone [08:18] in the family safe I know I already [08:20] spoke earlier about dogs being [08:22] overweight but it's something that I [08:24] think is very important to highlight [08:26] from the moment your puppy comes home [08:29] often I have owners who think their [08:31] young puppy is supposed to be rolly poy [08:33] they're not in fact you are already [08:35] putting your puppy at risk by having [08:37] them be at an increased weight how many [08:39] of you put your hands on your dog every [08:42] single day this is something that I am [08:44] very mindful about with my own dogs I [08:46] don't look at the recommendations for [08:48] feeding on the dog food bag or on the [08:51] container that I serve from I am going [08:52] to be physically feeling my dogs to make [08:55] sure that I can feel their ribs they're [08:57] not sticking out but I can easily feel [09:00] their ribs and I see a nice tuck or an [09:02] hourglass figure in their body I also [09:05] want to see that same tuck underneath [09:06] their belly if your dog looks more like [09:09] a coffee table than an hourglass there [09:12] is a problem and that is also going to [09:14] be putting your dog at risk of injury [09:16] not only injury but there have been many [09:19] studies that have shown that the [09:20] longevity of your dog's life is directly [09:23] related to their weight some of the [09:26] longest living dogs in the world live on [09:28] farms are constantly in motion I know [09:31] that's not possible for everyone but if [09:33] you can ensure that every single day [09:35] your dog is not only walked but walked [09:38] to the point of panting and increasing [09:41] their heart rate you are going to be [09:43] doing them a huge favor for the rest of [09:45] their lives because let's face it we not [09:48] only want our dogs to live long lives we [09:50] want them to live healthy lives I don't [09:53] want a decrepit old dog that can barely [09:55] get up from the ground I want an old dog [09:58] that feels good and is happy to be [10:00] moving with me every single day of their [10:02] lives I have been looking at dogs and [10:04] physically touching dogs for a very long [10:07] time and I feel quite confident [10:09] evaluating their body condition not [10:11] every pet owner is going to be there are [10:13] a number of resources you can use of [10:15] course speaking to your own vet of [10:16] course they're going to be a valuable [10:18] Resource One of the resources that I [10:20] look to is a body condition score it [10:23] rates dogs from 1 to nine whether being [10:25] too thin or a little bit too big you're [10:27] looking for that ideal number or of a [10:29] four or a five that fits all of the [10:32] criteria that I already discussed being [10:34] able to feel those ribs without having [10:35] to push too hard having that nice tuck [10:37] in their body that is what you're [10:39] looking for if you're not sure I would [10:41] absolutely check that resource out or [10:43] ask your vet about it today we've talked [10:45] about injury prevention in dogs but [10:47] ultimately this comes back to being a [10:49] good leader for your dog in order to [10:51] make sure that you're not being a bad [10:53] leader check out this

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 52/468,~Ken === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] so often when people get a new dog they [00:02] think that socialization is the most [00:05] important thing and while this is true [00:07] there are possibly things that you are [00:09] doing that are going to hurt your [00:10] relationship and your training I'm [00:12] instructor Meg welcome back to McAn [00:15] [Music] [00:17] dogs I often hear from students that [00:20] they have reservations about taking [00:22] their puppy places because they're not [00:23] completely vaccinated while this is [00:25] important and the safety of your puppy [00:27] is of utmost importance we also want to [00:30] make sure that we give them these [00:31] experiences from an early age there are [00:34] many places you can still take your dog [00:36] we don't want to take them to high-risk [00:38] places we don't want to take them around [00:40] dogs that we can't ensure are vaccinated [00:43] but taking them taking them to a family [00:45] member's house taking them to a park [00:47] where there's not a lot of dog activity [00:49] bringing them out on the sidewalk in [00:51] front of your house those are all forms [00:53] of socialization that don't involve [00:55] putting them at risk for different [00:57] diseases my dog only needs to be handled [00:59] by me [01:00] I'm the only one who's going to be [01:01] involved in my dog's life so I don't [01:03] really need to socialize them with other [01:04] people your dog is going to have [01:07] interactions with other people that is [01:09] for sure they're going to need to go to [01:11] the vet depending on your dog's coat and [01:13] and physical needs they might actually [01:15] be going to a groomer at some point you [01:18] might have to have someone else handle [01:19] your dog it is so important that we give [01:23] young puppies positive experiences with [01:25] these people before they really need [01:27] them I love to take my puppy to the vet [01:30] when it's going to be a positive thing [01:32] like getting treats visiting just [01:34] getting their weight taken I don't wait [01:36] for the time where they're going in for [01:37] a needle or maybe they're going in for a [01:39] dental surgery I bring them by these [01:41] people that are going to have to handle [01:43] them for life if your dog is going to [01:45] need to be groomed bring them to the [01:47] groomer ahead of time let them have a [01:49] nice little visit maybe a bath maybe [01:51] it's not a big nail tram and a big cut [01:54] giving them these experiences with the [01:56] person that is going to be handling them [01:58] potentially for the rest of their life [01:59] life is going to be so helpful in the [02:02] long run you're actually doing your dog [02:03] a disservice by not exposing them to [02:07] different people things and [02:09] experiences if you keep your dog in your [02:11] home perhaps just on your yard these [02:14] dogs don't necessarily know how to [02:15] handle new people new smells new [02:18] experiences in their lives we want to [02:20] make sure that during those formative [02:22] times when they are growing up these [02:24] times when they need to see the world [02:27] around them they get those opportunities [02:29] my dog just isn't wired that way they're [02:32] always going to bark at other dogs when [02:33] they see them they're always going to [02:35] react when they see a bag blowing down [02:37] the street I don't agree with that I [02:40] think that many dogs do start out with a [02:42] little bit more baggage perhaps they're [02:44] a type of breed that is known for being [02:45] more Barky or known for being a little [02:47] bit more reserved or fearful if you come [02:51] into each situation with a training goal [02:53] and a plan in mind I believe that you [02:56] also can get your dog comfortable with [02:58] anything that they see in their [03:00] environment there are some things that [03:02] your dog just needs to learn how to [03:04] handle perhaps they're scared of a fire [03:06] hydrant as they walk by it maybe they're [03:08] not sure about a sewer great if you have [03:11] a young puppy there are ways to work [03:13] with them gradually increasing the level [03:15] of difficulty until they also can pass [03:19] by it having no problem with the things [03:21] that they see in their daily walk I [03:23] don't want to have to avoid something [03:25] with my dog in my neighborhood I want to [03:27] figure out at what distance can can they [03:30] make good choices at what distance can [03:32] they handle that distraction and still [03:34] function and gradually I show them that [03:37] there's nothing to be worried about and [03:38] if they are connected with me and [03:40] working with me then they can learn how [03:42] to walk right past it without difficulty [03:45] if you never challenge them though if [03:47] you always avoid if you only walk at [03:49] certain times of day to make sure that [03:51] you're the only one out in the [03:52] neighborhood that dog is never going to [03:55] learn how to make the right choices and [03:58] how to listen to you when the [03:59] distractions come out of nowhere I don't [04:01] want you to have to avoid other dogs I [04:03] don't want you to have to avoid things [04:05] that you see in your daily walk I would [04:07] like for you to learn how to handle [04:09] these dogs so that the reactions are [04:11] less so that the reactions are [04:13] controlled and we can have the dogs do [04:15] alternative behaviors that we like [04:17] instead each time they see these things [04:20] in their daily lives another common myth [04:22] that I often hear is that my dog needs [04:25] to meet lots of other dogs and they need [04:27] to figure out how to interact with other [04:29] dogs on the OWN own that's actually the [04:30] furthest thing from the truth when you [04:33] get a new puppy it is so important that [04:35] you give them positive experiences with [04:38] dogs that you know are safe and friendly [04:41] you want to pick your dogs friends very [04:43] very carefully that might mean finding a [04:46] family member's dog that is of similar [04:48] age and play Style finding a neighbor's [04:50] dog that you can meet up with regularly [04:53] even just to go on a casual walk with [04:54] them you want to think about protecting [04:57] your dog's confidence and making sure [04:59] that every experience that you provide [05:01] for them is a positive one another [05:04] misconception is that dogs need to be [05:05] physically touching in order to be [05:07] socializing dogs are learning at all [05:09] times whenever your dog is in the [05:11] presence of another dog they are [05:13] learning what our expectations are of [05:15] them do we want them barking lunging no [05:19] we want your dog to focus on you we want [05:21] your dog to see other dogs and have a [05:24] neutral response to them to not react to [05:26] them they can be happy they can be [05:29] friendly but we don't want them to think [05:31] that every dog they meet deserves an [05:33] emotional response we want your dog to [05:35] learn that even in the presence of other [05:37] dogs you are the most fun you are the [05:40] most valuable you are the one who [05:42] provides all things that are reinforcing [05:44] to them we don't want your dog to learn [05:46] that that other dog is more of a party [05:48] than you are so that's why we teach our [05:51] dogs from an early age see the other dog [05:54] but all good things come from me even in [05:57] the presence of another dog here at our [05:58] training facility we have puppies have [06:01] structured play sessions within their [06:02] own puppy class by doing this these [06:05] puppies are in a safe environment [06:07] well-controlled environment where we can [06:10] start and stop the play whenever we [06:12] choose this gives these puppies an [06:14] opportunity to meet other dogs have a [06:17] sniff have a play and a run and even [06:19] tumble around together but if at any [06:21] time we perceive that the puppy is in [06:23] over their head we can bring them away [06:25] from that play session if we feel that [06:27] your puppy is being a little bit too [06:28] pushy we can give them that information [06:31] and again move them away from those [06:32] puppies so that they learn what is a [06:35] positive play Style and what is a play [06:37] style that we're really not interested [06:39] in encouraging if you're interested in [06:40] learning more about training your puppy [06:42] we have both inperson and online puppy [06:45] classes that would be perfect just for [06:46] you another common statement I hear is [06:49] that the dogs will figure it out this [06:51] can be a very dangerous approach for [06:53] your puppy when we have puppies learning [06:55] how to interact with other dogs we want [06:58] them to learn what it means to be a bit [07:01] too pushy or what they should do if [07:03] they're a little bit reserved the last [07:05] thing we want is for you to allow your [07:07] dog to get in the face of an adult dog [07:10] and have them give them a very serious [07:11] tell off that's also not fair to the [07:15] adult dog to be put in that situation [07:17] you are your dog's leader not another [07:19] dog so it's up to you to let them know [07:22] this is a positive interaction this is [07:24] how you play and maybe this is when [07:26] you've pushed things too far I want you [07:28] to think about preventing your dog from [07:30] having negative experiences too often we [07:33] hear from students that I'm just going [07:35] to expose my puppy to everything and [07:36] they're going to learn how to handle it [07:37] on their own when this happens sometimes [07:41] dogs have very negative experiences that [07:43] can be so impactful that they never [07:45] forget them dogs that have a negative [07:48] experience with a child with a another [07:50] dog perhaps they're pounced on at a dog [07:52] park those dogs do not bounce back from [07:55] those experiences quickly and it can [07:58] result in a dog being uncomfortable with [08:01] those experiences for the rest of their [08:03] lives the reason why this is so [08:04] important is because it is significantly [08:07] easier to start with a puppy who doesn't [08:09] have these experiences building them up [08:12] gradually as they get older and meet new [08:14] people new things new dogs we do find [08:18] that there are some dogs who don't [08:20] recover from such a Negative experience [08:22] while there are some training things [08:24] that we can work through not everything [08:25] is so easily fixed and you may find that [08:28] you then have to manage that dog in [08:31] these different environments for the [08:32] rest of their lives taking my dog to a [08:34] dog park can teach them how to respond [08:37] nicely around other dogs we often see [08:40] two things happen from this situation [08:42] one is a dog who thinks of you as a taxi [08:45] driver that's just providing them with a [08:47] ride towards all the fun with their [08:48] friends they don't really value you they [08:50] don't value relationship all they think [08:53] about is how much fun other dogs are and [08:55] how unimportant you are the other thing [08:58] that unfortunately we do see sometimes [08:59] times are dogs that get hurt injured [09:02] scared or even scarred from their [09:05] experiences at these dog parks if your [09:08] dog is shy if your dog is small if your [09:11] dog is just learning about how to behave [09:13] around other dogs and they get rolled on [09:15] trampled jumped on maybe even bitten at [09:19] these locations those dogs often are so [09:22] scared that then when they see even a [09:25] single dog or a group of dogs in any [09:27] other situation they're fear F of those [09:30] situations because they don't know how [09:32] to handle dogs coming at them they've [09:34] had a negative experience and they don't [09:36] trust you as the owner to handle it they [09:39] don't trust that you have their back and [09:41] you are only putting them in situations [09:43] that are going to be safe and friendly [09:46] for them what you might hear me saying [09:48] today is that I want you to avoid all [09:50] dog parks and groups of dogs what I [09:52] really want to convey is that I want you [09:54] to keep your dog safe and I want every [09:57] interaction with other dogs to be a [09:58] positive one [10:00] I've taken my dogs to dog parks before [10:02] but I've worked in the parking lot I've [10:03] worked on the opposite side of the fence [10:05] so that my dog learns how to listen how [10:07] to have fun how to respond to me in the [10:10] presence of other dogs but without [10:12] necessarily always interacting with them [10:14] I want you to think about having a [10:16] neutral response with your dog to other [10:18] dogs they might see them passing by the [10:21] street not react not pull you towards [10:24] them not bark not lie on the ground [10:26] because they're not sure perhaps you [10:28] take them somewhere to have a nice [10:30] coffee I want you to have a dog who can [10:32] sit beside you as another dog walks by [10:34] the coffee shop doesn't even lift their [10:36] head because they know their job in life [10:39] is to remain with you be neutral watch [10:42] the other dog go by not necessarily [10:44] react to every dog that they see and [10:46] every dog that they see is not something [10:48] to be feared or to be played with that's [10:52] on me to decide what my dog gets to do [10:54] with other dogs that they see in life [10:56] what's important is that you are the one [10:58] who gets to control control the [10:59] environment you get to choose who your [11:01] dog interacts with you get to choose [11:04] when they get to interact with these [11:05] other dogs and for how long and your [11:07] dog's behavior and environment that they [11:09] are in is what is going to dictate how [11:12] long and how often they get to have [11:15] these types of experiences now that you [11:17] have all the information you need about [11:18] how to socialize your dog it's also [11:20] important that you know how to walk your [11:22] dog check out this video right here to [11:24] get more

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 64/468,~Ken === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] today I'm spending time with this Goldie [00:02] poo named Maple now Maple hasn't really [00:04] had any training with us whatsoever and [00:06] we're using her specifically today [00:08] because I wanted to take advantage of [00:10] the opportunity with a dog that doesn't [00:12] really have a ton of skill to show you [00:14] how I can take advantage of some pretty [00:16] natural training opportunities when I'm [00:18] just out and about we're here on the [00:20] property today there's you know not a [00:22] lot of distractions around but there's [00:23] enough as you can see just this bush she [00:26] has zero concept of least respect [00:28] whatsoever she has no problem trying to [00:29] drag me into this bush right now um we [00:31] might even make our way over to the [00:32] training facility and um I'm just going [00:34] to kind of go with the flow I'm going to [00:36] see what things that she struggles with [00:38] and we're going to talk about how we [00:39] would address this with a dog that you [00:41] might have yourself at home I'm Cal [00:44] somewhere in the bushes is maple welcome [00:46] back to McAn [00:48] [Music] [00:50] dogs first things first going for a walk [00:53] with this dog if this was something that [00:54] I had to do every single day in order to [00:56] get her exercise would not be a very [00:58] enjoyable experience you can see that [01:00] she doesn't really care too much about [01:02] leaning into the leash I can just tell [01:04] from her behavior that she's very used [01:05] to that so there's a couple things that [01:07] I can do to uh work on this I uh first [01:11] need to address the pulling but I also [01:12] need to teach her that I exist so I'm [01:15] just going to take a second to just get [01:16] a little bit of attention now I have her [01:18] on a leash in just a 6ot uh leash here a [01:21] regular collar in a 6ot leash Maple hi I [01:25] also have some training treats because [01:28] we don't really have much of a [01:29] relationship here so so I'm going to use [01:30] a bit of food to help her good girl and [01:32] I'm just going to start off by getting [01:34] her to move at my left hand side good [01:37] girl wow now sometimes when we are [01:41] thinking about walking our dogs people [01:43] forget that you actually need to train [01:45] yes good choice train your dogs to um [01:48] want to walk with us to want to pay [01:50] attention so I'm just going to use a [01:52] little bit of food on my in my hand here [01:54] my left hand and I'm going to place it [01:55] near her nose and just take a couple [01:57] steps and I'm going to stop and reward [01:58] her take a couple step stop and rewarder [02:01] take a couple steps stop and rewarder [02:03] good girl I might try turning around a [02:06] little bit yes so I'm not really going [02:09] very fast now I'm just sort of taking [02:11] the time to get yes to get her attentive [02:14] good girl now you'll notice when I give [02:17] Maple a reward it's always right in [02:19] position so if her she was out of [02:21] position I wouldn't reach back to give [02:22] her a treat I wouldn't pull forward to [02:24] give her a treat what I'm trying to do [02:26] here is teach her that when we go for a [02:28] walk I want you wow w i want you to stay [02:31] relatively close to me yes now you can [02:34] see Maple's pretty food motivated which [02:35] is going to make my training session a [02:37] heck of a lot more easy today yes good [02:39] choice We do have lots of training [02:42] videos about how to work with dogs that [02:44] are not as food motivated as Maple is [02:46] but this is going to be a bit of a treat [02:48] yes good the other thing that I'm always [02:52] going to do when I'm training my dogs is [02:54] look for opportunities to tell her that [02:56] she's right I don't know if you noticed [02:57] there but a few times she's very aware [02:59] that there's 's a cameraman right behind [03:01] her here she's a bit distracted but [03:03] she's looking at that hey you and then [03:06] she's offering to look back at me [03:08] without me even asking and we call that [03:10] a yes moment I'm looking for an [03:12] opportunity where I see her make a good [03:14] choice to connect with me to check in [03:16] with me yes good girl without me even [03:19] asking and each time she does that I [03:22] will say yes and then reward 1 second [03:25] later keeping good timing okay I'm going [03:27] to try and just build a little bit here [03:29] I I was feeding her a ton there because [03:31] we just have no Rapport whatsoever I'm [03:33] going to try not holding any food in my [03:35] hand now and I'm going to take a few [03:36] more steps as we go and if she maintains [03:38] pretty good attention in a loose leash [03:40] I'm going to get the food out to reward [03:42] her if I find that she's a bit [03:44] disconnected I'm going to do a bit of [03:45] leash management and change of Direction [03:47] oops just like that good so she goes to [03:49] pull ahead I'm just going to use the [03:51] leash to remind her that's better to [03:52] come back to my side okay let's go good [03:55] girl wow yes so I'm going from having [03:59] the food constantly in my hand [04:01] constantly on her nose hey but this way [04:03] yay to being able to keep her connected [04:06] B Yay good girl yes good Maple hey hey [04:12] yay oops right here yes good girl there [04:15] we go yes good excellent so she's [04:19] disconnected I'm going to use the leash [04:21] to correct her Maple this way yeah good [04:26] choice good this way oops CH a bit [04:29] distract CTIC yeah there she is good [04:31] this way yeah wow good can you sit wow [04:38] you're a little bit crooked but that's [04:39] okay we've never done that before so [04:41] you'll notice when Maple's distracted [04:43] I'm not bribing her and begging her with [04:44] food and it's important that we talk [04:46] about that because a lot of people see [04:47] how much food that we use in our [04:49] training here babe and they get really [04:51] concerned about having to be dependent [04:53] on the food already but you can see [04:55] we've been training for like what 2 [04:57] minutes 3 minutes here and already was [04:59] able to get a good stint of walking um [05:02] without having to hold the food in my [05:03] hand and using it as a reward when she [05:05] was a bit disconnected I would simply [05:07] use my voice and a leash correction to [05:09] get her back to my side once she was [05:11] back and connected again I would praise [05:13] and reward her for making good choices [05:16] this is about being consistent the other [05:18] thing is that we have um you know a good [05:21] like five minute walk to get over to the [05:23] training facility I have only walked [05:25] back and forth about 30 ft at this point [05:28] and we've been working away it's not [05:30] really about where or how um much [05:33] distance or how long you're traveling [05:35] it's about what's happening during that [05:37] thing and I think too many people just [05:38] want to get to the destination they want [05:40] to get to the park they want to do [05:41] whatever they need to do but their [05:43] criteria or the behavior of the dog it's [05:45] terrible on the way there what I'm doing [05:48] with her is trying to work on teaching [05:49] her we're going to go from point A to [05:51] point B but I expect you to do it in a [05:53] certain way so right now it's about [05:55] teaching and helping wow look at this [05:57] attention yes good girl something that I [05:59] want want you to take note of is that [06:01] I'm sort of asking for a little bit of a [06:03] higher criteria of walking I really want [06:05] her to walk up my left and I want her to [06:06] pay attention a bit more now that I have [06:08] a little bit more Focus though you are [06:09] going to see me loosen the rains a [06:11] little bit when I'm actually intending [06:13] to go for a half hour 45 minute hour [06:15] walk with her I do not expect that she [06:18] heals beside me staring at my face the [06:20] whole time she also needs to be a dog [06:22] and just sort of hang out what I don't [06:23] want to do right now though with a dog [06:25] that is prone to pulling is give her so [06:27] much leeway that just a little bit ahead [06:29] of me turns into full-on dragging me and [06:31] trying to grab everything off the floor [06:33] so I'm going to be strict but then when [06:35] I see that she's making good choices I'm [06:36] going to loosen the rains a little bit [06:38] but loosen the rains does not mean I'm [06:40] allowing her to pull and drag me [06:41] everywhere so as you watch me walk I [06:43] want you to see that sometimes I'm [06:45] insisting that she stays right at my [06:47] left hand side that's when I want a bit [06:48] more attention from her when I feel her [06:50] settle in and try and connect with me a [06:52] little bit more I'll allow her to move [06:54] out of position a little bit um but [06:56] we're never pulling on a leash today in [06:58] order to be set up for my training [06:59] session so that I could be successful I [07:01] have been very uh deliberate with the [07:03] type of equipment that I've come to use [07:05] today so I do have my bait bag on I got [07:07] lots of delicious treats in there that I [07:09] know she's she likes I'm also using a 6 [07:12] foot leather leash and I really like to [07:14] use a leather leash because it gives me [07:15] much more control and the width of the [07:18] leash is really important because it [07:19] depends on the weight of the dog she's a [07:22] a pretty big strong dog already even [07:24] though she's only a year old you're [07:25] being such a good girl so I don't want [07:27] to be using a skinny leash or a leash [07:29] that I can't can't get my hands on and [07:30] have good grip so a good leash is really [07:32] important and then the other thing I'm [07:34] going to try with her today is just her [07:36] regular collar now this is the collar [07:38] that just their the owners had on the [07:40] dog it has her identification on it and [07:42] it's okay thank you for the kisses it's [07:45] okay but with a lot of pulling having a [07:48] collar that has a snap on it like this [07:51] this can come undone really easily and [07:53] for her size and weight the width of [07:55] this collar is a little bit too skinny [07:57] in my opinion um it's it's not as strong [08:00] as it could be so when we go over to the [08:01] training facility I might switch it out [08:03] for something a bit bigger depending so [08:05] that would be the only thing I would [08:06] switch out for today but proper [08:08] equipment is going to set you up for a [08:10] lot more success because you're going to [08:12] have better [08:13] control whoops Missy where are you going [08:18] that's better good girl yes we're going [08:23] to go ahead and head inside the building [08:24] now know there's like big trucks in the [08:26] parking lot today lots of sounds going [08:28] on she's making pretty good choice here [08:30] I've not gone through a door with her so [08:32] I really don't know what she's going to [08:33] do so I'm just going to open the door [08:35] and see what she does if she decides to [08:37] drag me we're going to deal with it okay [08:39] I'm going to open the door here just as [08:42] I expected oh she did turn back to me [08:44] which is good that was not very good [08:46] though lady let's try that again so I'm [08:47] just going to open the door come here [08:48] Maple try that again okay Maple [08:55] yes so you can see it was a bit more Pro [08:57] proactive that time before she had a [08:59] chance to pull I could reward her and I [09:01] think what a lot of people don't realize [09:02] when you're training a dog is they just [09:03] walk in and they think oh just going to [09:05] go to my place but I'm actually going to [09:07] try it again so dogs learn through [09:09] repetition so if I try it a third time [09:11] here okay this way good girl good okay [09:15] Maple [09:17] oh she says I know the game I come in [09:20] you call me and you reward me so I'm [09:22] conditioning her when I open the door we [09:24] walk into a new place this is what I [09:25] want you to do now we are in the um [09:28] training facility right now what's cool [09:29] so there's actually no classes going on [09:31] right now this actually couldn't have [09:32] been timed better because again I've [09:34] never worked with Maple before I don't [09:36] really know her that well and if I was [09:37] to come into a facility that could [09:39] potentially have you know 70 dogs here [09:41] at one time that may be a little bit [09:44] overwhelming so I'm going to have an [09:45] opportunity to walk around the facility [09:47] there's tons of smells here um there [09:49] could be some new people and we're just [09:51] going to see how she handles things okay [09:53] I'm going to keep walking working my [09:54] walking Yes again I want her to be [09:58] mindful of her lead that she's not [10:00] pulling I don't care so much if she [10:01] walks perfectly beside me Maple yes good [10:05] girl I can maybe practice calling her [10:07] name from time to time good girl okay [10:10] this way walk into the store area see [10:13] how she does okay we got some pulling [10:15] hey Maple yes good girl nice Maple yes [10:23] good [10:24] girl [10:25] excellent H I wonder if she can just sit [10:28] here for a second Maple [10:30] sit yes move the leashes [10:34] around good so these are a little [10:36] distractions so if you have an [10:37] opportunity to take your dog do you know [10:39] to a pet store or somewhere you know [10:41] don't just let them drag you around [10:43] everywhere Miss you're going to sit for [10:44] a second work a little bit of obedience [10:47] okay so that was interesting I I made [10:49] her sit there and right after I placed [10:50] her she just got up and did her own [10:51] thing so I'm going to try that again if [10:53] I have her sit she needs to stay there [10:55] until I release her there so again I'm [10:58] teaching her about fall through that's [11:00] better good girl can you sit good sit [11:04] yes good girl oops you're not getting a [11:09] treat now you got [11:10] to oops sit good you got to keep her [11:15] butt on the floor until I say again [11:16] these are all just management tools [11:18] that's better yes now if I was to buy [11:20] something and go to the counter again I [11:22] don't want her seeing me fidget with the [11:24] debit machine and then she's you know [11:25] dragging my arm out of the socket people [11:27] talk a lot about the importance of [11:29] socializing their dog and often when we [11:31] hear the word socialize we automatically [11:32] assume it's with people or other dogs [11:36] and what I'm doing right now by bringing [11:37] her bringing her into a new location is [11:40] this is all part of socialization but we [11:42] actually use this term exposure so I'm [11:45] exposing her exposing her to different [11:47] sights and sound and and we have a [11:49] slippery floor here there's lots of dogs [11:51] that come in here for class that are [11:52] worried about this slippery floor I'm [11:54] just getting her out and about and [11:56] teaching her that even when we're in the [11:58] kitchen or the backyard or all the [12:00] places that we are together listening [12:02] still needs to happen if I take you to [12:03] the cottage if I take you to the park by [12:05] taking her to all these different places [12:07] and training her not just letting her do [12:09] whatever she wants I'm teaching her how [12:11] to be a well-b behaved dog in all of [12:12] those locations hi leave it oh this is [12:15] good hey leave it good just do your [12:18] thing just do your thing good yes okay [12:20] we have a real life distraction coming [12:22] in Maple yes good choice so as soon as a [12:27] new person comes in she automatically [12:28] starts to get to distracted but again [12:30] I'm just taking a look at this leash now [12:31] she's making some good choices Maple yes [12:35] good girl I don't have as much Focus [12:38] right now much better but again look at [12:40] my timing as soon as she's disconnected [12:43] I'm doing something that's going to get [12:44] her attention might that be a little pop [12:46] on the leash to get her to turn might be [12:48] a little touch on the side see I've lost [12:49] her here Maple yes good girl sit good [12:54] give her a job to do and then once she's [12:56] connected then I can yes and reward good [12:59] girl I'm not bribing her with treats to [13:01] come back I'm making her work a little [13:03] bit before I reward good if you do [13:06] something like this literally just [13:08] making the dog sit and have a brain If [13:10] you do this for a few minutes in front [13:12] of a a bank that people are watching [13:14] walking in and out of or if you you know [13:16] go to your kids soccer game and for 10 [13:18] minutes you bring the dog out of the car [13:19] and you know just make the dog do this [13:21] for a little bit you are going to be [13:22] shocked at how tired they are going to [13:25] be because this is all brain work you [13:27] know we can throw a ball and Tire the [13:29] dog out all we want but sometimes it's [13:31] making them use their brain making them [13:33] show some emotional control that [13:35] actually is going to get them more tired [13:37] and it's going to lead to her hopefully [13:39] being able to make better choices [13:40] independent of me in the future good [13:43] girl I hope how for watching today's [13:44] video that you're feeling inspired to go [13:46] out and train your dog and maybe focus a [13:48] little bit more on exposing them to new [13:50] situations and maybe less on the [13:52] traditional type of socialization now we [13:54] worked a lot today on walking unleash [13:56] greeting manners um recalls so if you [13:59] want to learn a little bit more about [14:00] how to enhance those exercises with your [14:02] dog you want to check out our videos [14:04] over here click here for greeting thank

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 73/468,~Ken #puppytraining #puppybiting === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] the bat is that I we I still have that [00:02] queue in there so that after the fact [00:04] only you got to experience that last few [00:06] minutes after the fact when uh YouTube [00:09] says the file is ready I'll cut the [00:11] front end off so uh you know I love that [00:13] opportunity to hang out with you here in [00:15] the live stream and um I guess I guess [00:18] actually it's now teaser now it's a [00:20] teaser for joining us live anyway the [00:22] other Ken sings and dances whole thing [00:25] if you were watching the replay you [00:26] should have seen the break dancing I [00:28] mean I even blew my own mind all my hair [00:30] flow off who would have thought uh [00:32] tonight we've put together for you those [00:35] of you that are in the live stream uh we [00:37] 24 hours only 15% off all your puppy [00:40] training tools in one bundle we're going [00:42] to talk about some powerful tools that [00:44] changed my experience puppy training we [00:46] anytime we give our students these uh [00:48] these kinds of tools these pieces of [00:50] equipment it's going to it changes their [00:52] puppy training I believe me I I didn't [00:54] believe it but when you use something [00:56] like a house line which is a little bit [00:57] of uh precursor to something we're going [00:59] to talk about it's like you become a [01:02] magic dog trainer like it just it's so [01:04] good for you and your puppy and the [01:06] relationship building anyway I wanted to [01:08] make sure that we had something special [01:09] for those of you in the live stream uh [01:11] for the next 24 hours 15% off it comes [01:13] as a bundle and it's going to help you [01:16] now let's dive [01:18] into the first topic and this is you [01:22] know at one point it was a bit of a uh [01:25] um you had to convince people more the [01:28] usefulness of these kinds of management [01:30] tools um but now it's just it's [01:33] commonplace you know that people are [01:35] using these what what's maybe the most [01:37] impactful important management tool you [01:40] can use in puppy training a puppy crate [01:43] a dog crate totally and uh like Ken said [01:45] that used to be sort of a little bit you [01:47] know frowned upon because people had [01:50] immense crate guilt and I would say that [01:51] some people still do have a lot of crate [01:53] guilt they feel like dog shouldn't be [01:54] contained in a box and that it's mean [01:57] and the dogs don't like it but really it [02:00] couldn't be further from the truth and a [02:01] lot of how dogs feel about a crate and [02:04] how um how much benefit you get from the [02:07] crate is how you feel about yourself and [02:10] how you use it um as someone who has [02:13] been training and raising dogs [02:15] independent of my parents since I was [02:17] like 14 15 years old I have trained a [02:20] lot of dogs in my time and I have never [02:23] ever had a dog that didn't like their [02:26] crate and there's one common [02:28] denominator and it's me right um and [02:30] it's because I believe in crates and I [02:32] believe that it's important to teach [02:35] puppies to love their crate and that [02:37] it's a really safe place so um by using [02:41] a crate why it's so important is that [02:43] because I cannot watch my puppy 100% of [02:46] the time I need somewhere safe that I [02:49] can leave my pup that they are not [02:51] rehearsing bad behaviors that can allow [02:54] me the time to still live you know my [02:56] normal busy life or your normal busy [02:58] life and be able to return back to puppy [03:01] training and know that while you were [03:02] gone nothing bad happened um and that's [03:06] going to lead you to be able to work [03:08] towards perhaps not using the crate as [03:10] they get a little older they get more [03:11] experienced they know the rules of the [03:13] road all of those types of things um but [03:16] it is very helpful because it quickens [03:18] the process it keeps your puppy safe it [03:21] also really helps with leadership so um [03:25] that's sort of a couple thing a hard [03:27] thing for people to really understand [03:29] but again leadership allows me to give [03:32] information clearly and effectively and [03:35] our goal our Manan method goal is we [03:38] want you to tell your puppy that they're [03:40] right that they're making good [03:42] choices 10 times more a day than you're [03:44] telling them that they're making a poor [03:46] choice and um by utilizing the crate I [03:49] am able to set my puppy up for more [03:53] success so that I'm able to praise and [03:55] reward my puppy um because I can control [03:59] where they're going I also can control [04:01] their freedom so they sort of learn that [04:03] you know I have the ability to give it [04:05] and take it away um which leads to more [04:08] freedom over time as the puppy gets a [04:10] little bit more reliable so I want to go [04:12] back just a moment because um you know [04:14] you mentioned that some people have a [04:16] tremendous amount of crate guilt and if [04:17] you're not doing enough with your puppy [04:19] then it's understandable you might feel [04:20] some crate guilt but one of the most [04:23] impactful decisions you can make is [04:25] intentional cating so what that means is [04:27] you're building out a plan before and [04:29] after your puppy needs to be in there CR [04:31] now we're not talking about just you [04:32] know having your puppy in there all the [04:33] time absolutely not but when you can't [04:36] supervise your puppy that's a great time [04:38] for them to go in your crate in their [04:40] crate and you know it it's it starts [04:43] with beginning in the morning you know [04:45] our puppies come out of their crate [04:46] because they've been uh managed well and [04:49] because we know you know how much [04:50] activity they've gotten we know we can [04:52] start the house training routine from [04:54] the moment they come out of their crate [04:55] in the morning potty training can begin [04:58] go out do your potty training thing with [04:59] we'll talk a little bit more about that [05:00] shortly but you bring your puppy back in [05:03] now you're going to do something with [05:04] them you're going to engage with them um [05:07] you know you're going to play some you [05:08] know maybe do some brain games and like [05:10] do some tricks and do some training do [05:12] some luring maybe you do some physical [05:14] exercise something like our puppy tug is [05:16] a great tool to burn off a bunch of [05:18] energy really really quickly you know [05:20] this simple little toy can I Love [05:24] interactive toys this one specifically I [05:26] mean we've put a lot of effort into [05:27] making the best puppy tug out there but [05:29] um you know I love this toy because it's [05:31] only it's only fun when I'm at the other [05:34] end of it with my puppy it's a great way [05:36] to build relationship it's also a great [05:37] way to burn off energy in just a couple [05:39] of minutes so that my puppy now has like [05:41] is kind of coming down a little bit and [05:43] now they're maybe they're ready to have [05:44] their meal they're ready to go lie down [05:46] in their crate because they need to go [05:47] in there for the next short while [05:48] whatever that is yeah but you know [05:50] having a strategy for your puppy is [05:52] important because you do want them to [05:55] you you want to make crate training [05:56] easier you know we talk a lot about [05:58] associating good things with the crate [06:00] pretty easy to do you know watch any of [06:02] our crate training videos but also like [06:04] what you're doing before is really [06:06] helpful you know your puppy's ready to [06:08] go lie down and you know just sort of [06:11] relax in there it'll speed up your crate [06:13] training it's also going to make you [06:14] feel more comfortable with the idea that [06:16] you're like building out a plan a [06:18] strategy for your puppy and for their [06:20] crate training the other sorry I just [06:22] have one more thing that I thought was [06:23] really uh important I had a uh [06:26] two-year-old uh uh Labrador Retriever [06:29] and um I didn't use a crate with her for [06:31] way too long I mean it she it was a [06:34] disaster trying to train this dog and my [06:37] vet eventually said like listen you have [06:39] to go over to maand dogs I can't even [06:40] assess her she's absolutely going crazy [06:43] I can't this is wild so I go over to [06:45] Mand dogs and I do some training I start [06:47] to get the skills and I remember your [06:49] mom said to me one time she said do you [06:50] create her and I I said no like why [06:53] would I need she's two years old why [06:55] would I need to do that she said you'd [06:56] be amazed like some of the leadership [06:57] that it's it's going to instill in her [06:59] what I realized when I started cating my [07:02] two-year-old dog because who had no [07:04] training before is what was so great [07:07] about the crate is it would take care of [07:09] her if I couldn't watch her you know she [07:10] couldn't get into trouble she'd chewed a [07:12] bunch of things and eating the [07:12] tennisball and doing all sorts of [07:14] horrible stuff but really another uh [07:17] side effect of using the crate like that [07:19] is every time she came out of the crate [07:21] she engaged with me so what is that H [07:23] what happens then all of a sudden [07:25] anytime uh she's out of her crate I'm [07:28] the best thing around you I start to it [07:30] increases my value and I know you might [07:33] think like oh you know I love my dog and [07:35] I'm sure they love me but they they [07:38] might not treat you that way sometimes [07:40] you know without strong leadership which [07:42] which doesn't mean like heavy-handed [07:44] authoritarian you know dictatorship [07:47] we're talking about relationship you'll [07:49] build that relationship more quickly by [07:51] using a crate because your puppy knows [07:52] that like I get to chill out and relax [07:55] in the crate every time come out there's [07:56] my human and I get to have fun with them [07:58] and I get to learn with them and you [07:59] know they'll feed me all these things [08:00] are really really important yeah go [08:02] ahead I just wanted to give two little [08:04] tips that that we do um with our own [08:07] dogs that I think leads to the puppies [08:09] being more comfortable and happy in a [08:11] crate number one is for um I would say [08:16] for sure the first year of their life [08:19] they are getting at least one meal a day [08:22] in their crate um and we start this the [08:25] day they come home the night they come [08:28] home the morning they come home um and [08:30] what starts to happen is the puppy [08:31] starts to learn that when I start to get [08:33] the food ready the crate is where they [08:35] eat the crate eat the food eat the crate [08:37] eat the food and often what happens with [08:39] really smart clever puppies is you go to [08:42] get the food ready and before you can [08:43] even tell them to go in they're crate [08:45] they are actually running in and and [08:47] waiting for you waiting for their food [08:48] to come so they learn this box that I go [08:51] in brings food brings really good things [08:54] the second thing that we do and this is [08:55] really important is we don't wait to [08:59] work work on puppy training so the [09:02] moment my puppies get home I am [09:05] introducing the crate immediately they [09:06] sleep in the crate that that first night [09:09] they are spending time in the crate when [09:10] I can't watch them that very first day [09:12] home um and a while I've had many dogs [09:15] that scream blue murder for a day or so [09:18] because it's just a different different [09:20] schedule than they're used to within a [09:22] few days of me you know learning about [09:26] what care they need and and exercising [09:28] them in between [09:30] mentally and physically in between their [09:32] their crate spurts um after a few days [09:35] it just it smooth M smooth sailing every [09:39] time with every puppy all breeds um but [09:41] I hear often people say you know the [09:43] puppy's four five six months old they're [09:45] like oh yeah we're still we're still [09:46] working on getting the dog comfortable [09:48] in the crate because the puppy's only in [09:50] the crate when it's sleeping or when [09:53] they go out to work and they're not in [09:54] it any other time because they're [09:56] working on it a good that's your first [10:00] um you know you want to just use it [10:02] right off the bat right from the moment [10:04] so they don't really know anything [10:05] different uh and then you know the the [10:08] battles that you have to cross over with [10:11] an older dog in crate training they're [10:14] they're taken care of in the first [10:16] couple days that your puppy is home now [10:18] not to say that you're not get going to [10:20] get into some sticky situations with um [10:23] house training or puppies chewing things [10:25] in the crate or things like that there's [10:26] you know there's a lot more scope to [10:28] what I'm talking about that we can get [10:30] into detail um in our programs and [10:33] things like that I'm sort of speaking to [10:34] you guys generally now but you don't [10:36] want to wait for it you want to just get [10:38] to it right away I see um a few people [10:41] that mentioned like my puppy's going [10:42] crazy we're going to GSD random thank [10:44] you for the Super Chat you turned the [10:45] light scen as they were flashing um [10:47] we're going to answer that in just a [10:48] second but a lot of these I see a lot of [10:50] people saying like soon as my puppy gets [10:52] a toy they get super bitey the tools [10:54] we're talking about tonight are exactly [10:56] the kind of thing you need to start [10:58] using a house line is the most powerful [11:01] piece of equipment you are ever going to [11:03] use with any puppy training it's single [11:06] it is singly singly the best tool you [11:08] can use yeah with it you need to use [11:11] some skills and like know what you're [11:12] doing but you the house line is a a a [11:16] useful tool I want to um jump in here [11:19] for a second I want to grab that Super [11:21] Chat thank you're getting ready with [11:23] that I see a lot of people saying what [11:24] if my dogs not food motivated um there's [11:26] lots of other things you can do we have [11:28] a ton of vide on our channel uh that [11:31] talk specifically about using toys and [11:34] training in fact we had a puppy that we [11:36] raised named yuker who was not food [11:39] motivated and we had to work on some [11:41] other things so just search around a [11:43] little bit more we have tons of stuff on [11:45] that um you know food is not the only [11:47] answer it certainly makes life a lot [11:48] easier but it's not the only answer okay [11:51] from gstd random thank you for the Super [11:52] Chat uh my dog gets Super Hyper outside [11:55] when nobody else is around it's very [11:57] random she'll start jumping and biting [11:59] like crazy how can I remedy this uh well [12:04] sort of a hard question to ask without [12:05] being able to see it because there is [12:08] going to be it's not it's not random [12:11] there will be some type of reason why [12:13] the dog does that of course it's hard to [12:15] say without seeing it um the cool thing [12:17] about dogs is they don't do anything [12:19] random there's always some reason why [12:22] they do anything that they do um but [12:26] first I would recommend that when you [12:27] are outside that you are um keeping the [12:31] dog on a leash so you have control and [12:33] that you long line you have situation [12:36] though a leash because if the dog is [12:38] going to be jumping up and biting you [12:39] want to be able to shorten up on the [12:41] leash to place your dog into a Sit um [12:44] into more of a controlled position and [12:46] then work towards a long line I think [12:47] that would be good but um your dog needs [12:50] less freedom in this particular moment [12:52] um and sometimes what happens is when [12:55] our dogs are really pumped up like that [12:56] and we go to take control um sometimes [12:59] it it doesn't go as smoothly as we hope [13:02] it would and and the dogs have all this [13:03] pent up energy so you go to place them [13:05] in a sit and they get a bit bitey or [13:06] they get a bit more jumpy especially if [13:08] they're not used to you um taking [13:10] control of the situation and it's really [13:12] important that you just stay calm and [13:14] collected and cool and consistent about [13:17] what you're doing you're going continue [13:19] to immobilize the dog we suggest just [13:21] going into a basic sit it's a great sort [13:23] of control position uh until the dog [13:26] settles um the other direction that you [13:29] can take is try to give the dog a job to [13:31] do as soon as you get outside so that [13:34] that pent up energy is not um so easily [13:37] directed towards you so you could go [13:40] outside with the long line for example [13:42] and you know work on getting the dog to [13:44] tug on a toy or you know search for [13:46] treats in the grass or um whatever it [13:49] might be that sort of gets the dog [13:51] thinking about doing something some type [13:54] of job um and that might take the edge [13:56] off a little bit so that as you proceed [13:58] forward with whatever the rest of your [13:59] tasks are um it will be okay for sure so [14:04] uh we the crate is a useful tool when [14:07] you can't manage or when you're not able [14:09] to supervise your dog we've talked a [14:11] little bit about how to get there we [14:12] have a ton of um videos that talk about [14:15] how to get your dog comfortable in the [14:16] crate and the things that you can do in [14:19] and around crate time that's going to [14:21] allow them to be more relaxed you teach [14:23] them to be more comfortable um kale [14:25] talked a little bit about like letting [14:27] them cry cry it out the first couple [14:29] days but at some point you're going to [14:30] put a stop to that so we also have [14:32] videos that talk about how to stop the [14:33] barking and whining in in their crate [14:35] when you know they've had an adequate [14:37] amount of time to uh learn how to relax [14:40] in there um all these videos available [14:43] here on our YouTube channel if you [14:44] search McAn thean dogs CRP barking [14:46] something like that might find you the [14:47] videos quickly we've mentioned it a [14:50] couple of times um but I think it's [14:52] maybe we need to talk about now what a [14:55] house line is cuz I love the fact that [14:58] still we see on videos like what I don't [15:00] understand what why you'd put a leash on [15:02] your dog in the house why would you put [15:04] a leash on your dog don't understand why [15:05] you wouldn't in the house so we put a [15:08] leash on the dog in the house um or or a [15:11] line it's not really a specific leash it [15:13] doesn't have a handle intentionally so [15:14] it can slip and slide through the [15:16] furniture and not get caught up as much [15:18] even though it will get caught sometimes [15:19] it's just the nature of of the situation [15:22] but the reason for it is because when we [15:24] want to get control two things are [15:26] really important number one our timing [15:28] we need to be able to stop the behavior [15:30] the moment it happens um and by having a [15:32] line on I can get to my puppy quickly [15:35] before they can run off with that thing [15:37] in their mouth or play the chase me game [15:39] and the second thing is I don't want to [15:41] be grabbing and chasing the actual dog [15:45] because that can lead to a multiple [15:48] things it can lead to to more nipping [15:49] and biting back towards me um it could [15:52] lead to the dogs thinking it's a Catch [15:54] Me If You Can game which lowers my [15:55] status as a leader because the dog sort [15:57] of says haha you can't catch and now [15:59] it's just turning into a big game and [16:01] that leads to that situation happening [16:04] again repeating itself because it [16:06] becomes a positive rather than a [16:08] negative um it also is going to stop my [16:10] dog from being able to get into places [16:12] where I can't reach them like under the [16:13] couch or behind the couch or under the [16:15] coffee table or whatever it might be [16:17] where the dog's being a little sneaky [16:19] and they sort of don't want to face the [16:20] music so they sort of say haha here I go [16:23] um uh the other thing that I can do is I [16:25] can prevent problems from happening [16:27] before they're even there so my puppy [16:31] likes to steal the tea towel off the [16:33] couch off the couch oh my God have tea [16:36] towel but hey off the stove if my dog [16:38] likes to chew you know my shoes or [16:40] whatever it might be when my puppy is [16:42] headed towards that place and I know [16:45] exactly what's happening I just step on [16:46] the line I stop it from happening and [16:48] then I goes hey wait a second and now I [16:50] can redirect them to something that they [16:52] should be doing my information is well [16:54] timed it it's clear the dog doesn't get [16:56] to rehearse weeks and weeks and weeks of [16:58] chewing on the shoes so now I have a dog [17:00] that doesn't even know Sho chew chewing [17:02] on a leash is um my brain is very [17:05] scrambled at the moment my puppy doesn't [17:07] even know that chewing shoes is even a [17:09] thing because they've never got to taste [17:12] it in the first place it's just never [17:13] happened and that is contributed to [17:16] having a line or a leash on um so that I [17:18] can control where they go in the house [17:20] in addition to this when I have a really [17:22] young dog that doesn't know any commands [17:25] yet doesn't have a recall doesn't really [17:27] know about listening is I would use this [17:29] and I would use like baby gates or [17:31] section off areas in the house so that [17:33] my dog can only be in the kitchen until [17:35] I have a little bit more skill [17:37] underneath my belt and then I could [17:38] maybe start to widen the range of the [17:40] home that the dog could be free in but [17:42] they would still have this on um and [17:45] that will sort of be changed depending [17:47] on the puppy's progression in their [17:48] training not so much relative to age [17:51] your puppy will do whatever feels good [17:53] so they learn to chew on the shoes they [17:56] learn to pee in the living corner of the [17:58] living living room they learn to uh tug [18:01] on your pant legs they learn these [18:03] things because in an absence of [18:06] information if you're not there to give [18:07] them good information or if you know you [18:09] miss the timing of it uh they're going [18:11] to do whatever feels good and if it [18:13] feels good it must be the right thing [18:15] the house line is a great way to extend [18:18] your arms four more feet you know it's a [18:20] great way to take control of your puppy [18:23] when they're nipping and biting like [18:24] crazy you know you can quickly take [18:25] control of their collar sliding your [18:27] hand down it you know it's a great way [18:29] to get them outside uh for a quick potty [18:31] run when you're like uhoh I think we're [18:34] about to have an accident you know you [18:35] take hold of the house line and out you [18:37] go so like it it is it is such a useful [18:40] tool and and it just allows you to have [18:42] better timing timing is everything in [18:44] dog training um so if you can interrupt [18:46] that your dog's uh nuisance behavior [18:49] let's say um it's going to be that that [18:52] is as much good learning as like showing [18:54] what the right thing is sometimes it's [18:55] nice for them to have accidents make the [18:57] wrong choice yeah so that you can to [18:59] show them that's not what they should do [19:00] you know counter surfing all kinds of [19:02] things do you want to tell them why we [19:03] put a white line down the middle uh no [19:05] that's a good uh thing to point out [19:07] though we do this is a bit of a secret [19:09] move on our part because we know our [19:11] students will uh take their puppy house [19:14] line home and then they come back next [19:16] week and the puppy the white line in the [19:18] middle is totally clean and we're like [19:21] we know that they haven't used it yeah [19:23] so uh it's a great way to sort of an [19:26] inside joke between us and the students [19:28] yeah I mean it it's a great way to know [19:30] whether or not you're using it enough so [19:31] we put a white line down the center of [19:33] it to just sort of gauge like is this [19:35] thing on the puppy enough you know uh uh [19:37] because it will uh get get dirty really [19:39] quickly which is really really great to [19:41] give you a sense of if it's working or [19:43] not and are the long lines part of the [19:44] bundle for tonight the house line Sorry [19:46] house line yeah house line house line uh [19:49] long line and puppy tug all the puppy [19:51] stuff you trifect that's right that's [19:53] right all the things I wish I had when I [19:56] first started uh with Degan really can't [19:59] wait to get a puppy so that we can use [20:01] the Bane line oh really I don't want a [20:03] puppy but I think we have enough dogs [20:06] right now but it will be fun because we [20:07] didn't have that product totally when we [20:09] had our last puppy and I'm looking [20:11] forward to totally that is important you [20:13] know uh we have all kinds of things on [20:15] our Mand Dog store uh for puppy for [20:18] puppy training and dog training for [20:19] training specifically but

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 74/468,[20:34] store when you check out the store you [20:36] know the amount of intent that goes into [20:38] each product um because we're pretty [20:40] excited about the long lines they are [20:42] they are very awesome and perfect roide [20:45] let's talk about the long line in fact [20:46] why is the long line important why would [20:48] a puppy owner need a long line I I don't [20:50] know how I I just I use it every single [20:53] day with a puppy and I would say the [20:55] main reason why I like it is because [20:57] when you have a puppy [20:59] they don't have any leash sense yet they [21:02] also can't be trusted off leash what [21:04] does leash sense mean leash sense means [21:06] that you know when you attach just a [21:08] regular leash to your puppy and you go [21:10] outside to take them to you know potty [21:12] or whatever it might be they haven't [21:14] learned not to pull an Le leash and when [21:16] you're trying to maneuver a puppy a wild [21:18] and crazy puppy on six feet of line [21:21] typically that line is going to be tight [21:23] and that means that week after week your [21:25] dog is living life on a tight leash [21:28] before I have a chance to train my dog [21:30] about having leash respect or being [21:32] leash wise so I really love you know [21:35] when I'm taking my puppy out for potty [21:37] breaks in the yard or whatever you know [21:38] every day that that happens I'm taking [21:41] my puppy out on our 20 foot 21 foot um [21:45] lines because it gives my puppy a bit [21:47] more freedom to move around and find a [21:49] spot to go to the bathroom um but it [21:51] also um gives me an opportunity to keep [21:54] them under control so if they decide to [21:56] pick up sticks or leaves or get a little [21:58] too far away from me or you know get a [22:00] little too close to where the road is or [22:02] whatever I can redirect my puppy so [22:04] easily with our with our lines um and [22:07] eventually I work towards perhaps not [22:09] having to hold the line in my hand but [22:10] just drag it around the yard so that I [22:12] can work on my recall I can work on my [22:15] puppy's response and name but I always [22:17] have a safety blanket that I can pick up [22:20] and and get my dog's uh connection back [22:22] to me attention back on me whenever I [22:24] need to um so with something that we use [22:27] every single day um when we're outside [22:31] with the dogs I I particularly Ken and I [22:33] have multiple dogs and so when we have a [22:35] puppy and we have our puppy outside with [22:37] our older dogs I keep my pup on a long [22:40] line so that you know he can't run and [22:42] jump all over my other dogs whenever he [22:44] wants to and you know when we had five [22:46] alive our our youngest we also had three [22:50] very elderly dogs and we didn't allow [22:53] him to go and jump on them and bother [22:55] them and the long line is something that [22:57] we could use when we started to go on [22:58] Prop walks and Hikes and things like [23:00] that we could use that to control him so [23:03] um yeah they're awesome great for recall [23:05] training just great for General verbal [23:07] control I taught teach my dog to or [23:10] fetch with the long line on so I can [23:12] throw the toy and get the dog to come [23:13] back without running all over the yard [23:15] with the toy I use the line to kind of [23:17] reel them in like a fish a little bit to [23:18] get them to focus back on me um but also [23:21] honestly could go on a on I mean it's [23:23] just you know it's just the uh I know [23:25] you said safety blanket but like it's [23:27] just the can do more with them when you [23:30] have that kind of management it just [23:31] makes such a difference you can do [23:32] longer recalls to this point I like uh [23:35] rsf alzone uh question if we should if [23:38] we should let them rest now when should [23:40] we practice and how talking about the [23:41] crate training a little bit so that's a [23:43] great question and it's really important [23:45] that everyone knows that your training [23:47] sessions are going to be short and sweet [23:50] and uh to the point you need to take [23:53] advantage of natural training [23:54] opportunities throughout the day so [23:56] let's say your puppy comes out of there [23:58] creating the in the morning the [23:59] breakfast is a great time to use food in [24:03] your training you know you're going to [24:04] make them work for their breakfast [24:06] they're going to work for that food [24:07] you're going to teach them to be more [24:08] interested in food it's not something [24:10] that just falls from the sky or just [24:11] laying on the floor they need to do [24:13] something for you to get that thing and [24:16] what's so interesting and I don't know [24:17] whether this makes sense to you but it [24:18] made a lot of sense to me when someone [24:20] said like think about your dog getting [24:21] food through you not just from you I [24:24] thought oo that's an interesting way to [24:26] put it yeah because if they put in a [24:28] little bit of effort and at the [24:29] beginning it's it's simple stuff luring [24:32] maybe it's luring a Sit maybe it's [24:33] literally luring in a little figure a in [24:35] front of you but the puppy's putting in [24:37] a little bit of effort figure eight [24:39] that's right the puppy's putting in some [24:41] effort and you're rewarding them for [24:42] that they're starting to learn that huh [24:44] if I pay attention to this human if I if [24:46] I just put in a little bit of energy [24:48] into this I get something out of it in [24:50] fact it's my [24:51] breakfast so you've let's just say [24:54] you've done your uh morning uh breakfast [24:57] have a video idea you want to keep it [24:59] secret uh I'll send it to the YouTube [25:01] team right now I we might have it [25:04] already but I was just thinking it [25:05] myself uh also because we have an [25:07] instructor who's about to pick up a [25:09] puppy tomorrow but we should make a if [25:11] we don't have a video already a list of [25:14] the the four or five or six items that [25:16] we absolutely would get before we pick [25:19] our puppy up do we have that video huh I [25:21] don't know not sure we because I was [25:23] just thinking like all of these things [25:24] we're talking about I think to myself I [25:26] look forward to like getting brand new [25:29] brand new house line brand new collar [25:31] brand whatever I get I get all the [25:33] things and I make sure I have all of [25:35] those items before I get my puppy home [25:37] and I do it with every single puppy I [25:39] get our studio man we need a list of [25:41] those things what is got it what's the [25:45] list okay got it good job Dan okay so um [25:50] so you finished your breakfast training [25:52] routine now you're going to night you [25:54] know maybe you're going to exercise your [25:56] puppy a little bit too you do some [25:57] restrained recalls in the way all of [25:59] this takes like 10 minutes and by the [26:01] end you take your puppy out for potty [26:03] bring them back in let them snooze and [26:05] you can do whatever you need to do [26:06] getting ready for work or getting ready [26:07] for your day maybe your work from home [26:09] whatever um and then before you know you [26:12] come back let's say you have to go to [26:13] work before you uh go to work you're [26:15] going to take them outside and let them [26:17] do their thing pee or poo outside maybe [26:19] you're going to do a little exercise [26:20] game or whatever with them burn off some [26:22] of that energy with your puppy tug and [26:24] your long line or your puppy tug in your [26:25] house line and then they're like ready [26:28] to snooth puppies sleep so much but [26:31] these are the kinds of training sessions [26:32] I want you to be thinking about every [26:34] time you take them out you're going to [26:36] do something for a short amount of time [26:38] and maybe in the evening let's say that [26:40] short amount of time is just a snuggle [26:42] session you know you're just sitting [26:43] there cuddling with they're little [26:45] popcorn smelling feet and they're like a [26:47] little soft ears and whatever is so [26:49] weird that you think that I don't know [26:50] why I really do though um but you know [26:53] these training sessions are happening in [26:55] small chunks throughout the day the [26:56] worst thing you can do is devote about [26:58] 35 minutes to training your dog when you [27:00] get home from work and then forget about [27:02] it for the rest of the time right [27:03] exactly yeah and then just sort of let [27:05] them do their own thing that's not a [27:06] good way for a dog to learn and uh a [27:09] terrible way to instill the idea that at [27:12] any point in the day at you know [27:14] wherever you are your dog might need to [27:16] listen to you so it's it's it's really [27:18] important to like instill throughout the [27:19] day in different locations throughout [27:21] your house or home um that it might be [27:24] time to work you know there's so much [27:26] value there can I answer this uh yeah [27:30] uh from Junior Castro for the long line [27:33] is it better to use it with a harness or [27:35] a collar um if it's for um a young dog I [27:39] would lean towards using it with a [27:41] collar um because you can turn the dog's [27:44] body more easily when the line is [27:47] attached to the middle of the back I can [27:49] pull a puppy back but they can still [27:51] like keep looking towards they're locked [27:53] on to and they just sort of back up when [27:55] I am attached to the collar I can [27:58] actually turn the dog away from the [28:00] distraction which means I can get their [28:02] attention back on me a lot more quickly [28:05] so I would recommend a CER we will use [28:08] harnesses but we typically don't use [28:10] them until our dogs are trained um [28:13] because you just can't get the same type [28:15] of redirection and control with a [28:17] harness the dogs can really lean into a [28:18] harness when they haven't had training [28:21] um but I love harnesses and you'll see [28:23] us you know hike our dogs on harnesses [28:25] and things like that but our dogs have [28:27] already been trained to look at us when [28:30] we ask and not pull and sit and do all [28:32] of the things so you know it it doesn't [28:35] really matter so anyway short answer [28:36] color yeah Casey says when you're [28:38] outside is it best to redirect a very [28:41] young puppy nine weeks straight pressure [28:42] short pops or luring with a treat well I [28:44] mean you shouldn't be too far away from [28:45] that 9we old puppy when you're outside I [28:48] mean the reality is you're definitely [28:49] not going to be popping them uh from far [28:51] away straight pressure may or may not do [28:53] the trick but I mean with a N9 we old [28:55] puppy which is very young uh you'rea not [28:58] going to put the dog don't put the dog [28:59] in that situation um so luring with a [29:02] treat might be appropriate if you're [29:03] close enough mhm yeah even at this point [29:06] like makes them like so they turn and [29:08] run away use Chase um when I have a [29:11] puppy that's that young they often have [29:13] a pretty good natural follow to begin [29:15] with and so I just sort of lean into [29:17] that so can make a funny noise to get [29:19] them to look you could lure them with a [29:21] treat and then I use tons of Chase with [29:23] puppies that age because they already [29:25] have that ingrained in them naturally um [29:28] especially if you have a dog that has a [29:29] good breeder you know they'll do lots of [29:31] Chase games with puppies um and what's [29:34] nice about that is when you turn and run [29:35] away it's such a natural instinct even [29:37] if your probably's never seen it before [29:39] they see something moving and they go [29:41] woo that looks like fun and um rather [29:43] than chasing leaves or distractions once [29:45] they turn run away clap your hands cheer [29:48] make squeaky noises lots of fun things [29:50] so your dog gets close and they think [29:51] there's like a party going on um that [29:53] would be a better way to go about it [29:55] with a puppy that's that young [29:58] um I'm just wondering if I've seen a [30:00] couple good questions I'm wondering if [30:01] we should move on to the next point or [30:04] how many of you I'd like to know if you [30:06] if you're at home right now and you feel [30:08] like your puppy follows you around [30:10] everywhere um I'd like to know if that's [30:13] you just say me and then put your [30:14] puppy's age because a couple people are [30:16] are asking things like oh well how long [30:18] you know how long does the puppy follow [30:19] you for what are the one of the it [30:21] depends one of the greatest tricks that [30:23] puppies play is thinking that making you [30:26] think that they're following you in [30:28] they'll do that forever the amount of [30:29] people who say to us like oh I mean I've [30:32] just got the smartest puppy it's the [30:33] most wonderful thing I don't think he'll [30:35] ever do anything wrong and he just [30:37] follows me around the house all the time [30:39] that is short fast forward to two months [30:41] later or or even three weeks sometimes [30:43] and you're like oh what have I done I I [30:45] I'm not paying enough attention to this [30:47] puppy so um yeah I see nine weeks 10 [30:50] weeks 12 weeks yeah I mean it's [30:52] obviously puppy dependent but um there [30:54] will come a time um there are two very [30:56] distinct um [30:58] what's word I'm looking for thresholds [31:00] like adolescent uh teenage teenage [31:03] phases that your puppy will have phas is [31:05] a good word um and you're going to see [31:08] like around 16 weeks and then like maybe [31:10] around eight months they're going to [31:12] start to change their behavior a little [31:13] bit and if you've made good choices up [31:16] until this point you're still going to [31:18] run into some struggles but boy oh boy [31:19] you're probably going to learn what you [31:20] want more quickly you know I would say [31:22] that that's one of the reasons why we've [31:24] developed the programs that we have as [31:25] well they're based on those those time [31:28] phases so for our puppy Essentials [31:30] program we work on a certain sort of [31:33] list of exercises up until a puppy is um [31:37] 16 weeks four months old around that [31:39] area um and then obviously there's some [31:42] skills that you carry on because you [31:43] want to start a foundation when they're [31:45] when they're puppies so baby puppies so [31:47] under under four months um but once they [31:50] hit that four month Mark we shift gears [31:52] a little bit because the puppy's brain [31:55] and and Curiosities and and and things [31:58] that they do it changes at that age and [32:00] that's why we have our life skills [32:02] program because it's better suited for [32:04] um that age Gap so um that's sort of why [32:08] we have the two the two different [32:09] programs and of course life skills has [32:11] different levels to it as well but our [32:14] puppy Essentials program is about [32:16] prevention it's about um bonding it's [32:19] about um by prevention I mean we show [32:22] you exercises that stop you from having [32:25] a lot of The Unwanted Behavior that come [32:28] when you don't start things early like [32:30] you know being able to handle your dog [32:32] being able to clip your dog's toenails [32:34] being able to have really stressfree vet [32:36] visits um to have a puppy that learns to [32:39] come to you really quickly to have a [32:40] puppy that calms down very quickly when [32:43] you ask them to um exposure techniques [32:46] all of those types of things we start [32:48] right from the beginning but then of [32:50] course once they turn into 4 months or [32:52] so we need to start working on leash [32:54] control we need to start working about [32:56] on longer distance recall impulse [32:58] control all of that kind of stuff so [33:00] that's sort of how we've developed the [33:03] age gaps for our different programs it's [33:05] because we know that dogs need different [33:08] things at different phases in their life [33:09] totally and uh you could train with us [33:11] starting as soon as tomorrow yeah uh [33:14] check out our programs yes online and if [33:15] you want to do in person we have a new [33:17] session starting in October not sure how [33:19] many spots are left though so you'd have [33:20] to get on that quickly call the office [33:22] for sure we have dog trainers standing [33:24] by uh ready to take your calls and also [33:26] find the right program for you [33:29] now potty training I know it's a [33:30] struggle for a lot of people if you are [33:32] a new puppy owner it uh might be like [33:34] the bane of your existence one of the [33:36] you know the the things that you where [33:38] you think like I I don't know how much [33:40] more toilet or paper towel we I can buy [33:43] like I they know me at the store because [33:46] I'm going there to buy paper towel so [33:47] often but there are some common things [33:49] that we'll do with our puppies and [33:52] things that we'll teach our students to [33:53] do that will um help you not just like [33:57] teach potty train the puppy but like [34:00] stop stop all the accidents it it's [34:03] powerful how many accidents accidents [34:05] did five alive have when we had him as a [34:10] [Music] [34:12] puppy one yeah I can't even think of it [34:16] so maybe none he probably had one but [34:18] like that's that's a possibility started [34:20] to and then I caught him while he was [34:22] doing it and stopped him Midway probably [34:24] and it's not just cuz Kale's so uh [34:26] brilliant and beautiful it's because of [34:30] good decision making and uh strategy you [34:33] know you can do you can have the same [34:34] experience with a puppy you just need to [34:37] know what the heck you're doing you need [34:38] to have a plan yeah you also need to [34:40] understand how puppies think you know [34:42] why they make some of the choices they [34:44] make and I want to dive into um five [34:47] common times your puppy will need [34:49] definitely need to go outside uh after [34:52] uh coming out of their crate uh after [34:54] their dinner after a big play session [34:57] before they go into their crate uh you [34:59] know you're setting yourself up for [35:01] failure if you think you can put your [35:03] puppy in their kennel and they're just [35:04] not going to pee in there and one of the [35:06] most important is when you're just not [35:08] sure you're like h i they might have to [35:10] pee I don't I'm not really I don't know [35:13] better to be safe than sorry 100% [35:15] because remember your puppy does what [35:17] feels good so if they learn that it's [35:19] way easier we're in Canada and we're [35:21] quickly approaching winter time so if [35:23] your puppy yeah I know if your puppy [35:25] learns that it is way nicer to go pee in [35:28] the on the living room carpet than it is [35:29] on the freezing cold driveway you know [35:32] that's what they're going to want to do [35:34] so it's really important that if you're [35:36] not sure and and you know you're like I [35:38] can't remember quite the last time that [35:39] they had a PE a poo take them outside go [35:42] out go out and you know work on that [35:44] potty [35:45] training also supervision is so [35:49] important I can't stress that enough [35:51] let's talk a little bit about [35:52] supervision when you're uh working on [35:54] house training a puppy yeah so [35:56] supervision ALS also has to do with you [35:58] know kind of what Ken just said like [36:00] getting to know what your puppy's [36:01] schedule is so that you can anticipate [36:03] things um possible errors before they [36:06] happen um and I sort of touched on this [36:08] a little bit earlier in the Stream So [36:10] I'll definitely repeat myself if you [36:11] haven't been with us the whole time but [36:14] being able to set myself up to manage [36:17] the puppy and be able to supervise the [36:18] puppy more easily is going to help so [36:22] utilizing the crate when I can't watch [36:23] them of course so that they can't have [36:25] any accidents because I'm you know [36:27] typing on computer and my puppy's like [36:28] snuck down into the bedroom or into the [36:30] bathroom and they're you know I'm not [36:32] paying attention it's like oh where's [36:33] the puppy and I'm I'm multitasking you [36:35] don't want to do that before your puppy [36:37] is is reliably understanding about potty [36:40] training um second thing is I'm going to [36:42] have that long that that house line on [36:44] my puppy and I might even utilize those [36:46] um barricades of some sort so that my [36:49] puppy again can't move away so I'm going [36:52] to be very intentional about my [36:54] supervision that um I'm ready for um you [36:59] know if they have an accident but even [37:01] the better thing to do is be ready to [37:03] start learning the signs of when your [37:05] dog needs to go outside um because [37:08] that's going to start to lend towards [37:11] teaching your puppy that it's their [37:13] responsibility to let you know that they [37:15] have to go outside rather than how it [37:17] starts off you know when we have a brand [37:19] new puppy it's our responsibility to [37:21] know when they have to go out to to to [37:23] go potty but very soon you can switch [37:27] the roles by supervising so closely that [37:30] you can actually learn their signs so [37:33] that they can notify you that they have [37:36] to go out and once the rules are [37:37] reversed that's when potty training [37:40] becomes so much easier because your [37:42] puppy's going to be able to communicate [37:44] with you when they need something and [37:45] then you can uh react appropriately but [37:48] the only way you're going to learn those [37:50] signs is by supervising your puppy and [37:53] putting them in situations where it's [37:55] very very easy to show you what they [37:57] need okay I want to uh show you a video [38:00] that we captured from uh five alive when [38:02] we had five alive all time one of them [38:05] for sure um now K oh look at my hair in [38:10] this video talked a little bit about um [38:12] about supervision and not noticing some [38:15] of the signs and it's excuse me it's [38:17] amazing how similar a lot of these signs [38:19] are between a bunch of different puppies [38:21] that we've had or puppy experiences that [38:23] I've had uh but I I you do need to [38:26] understand that it is like you you uh [38:29] you can miss it if you're distracted [38:31] cooking dinner or chatting with the kids [38:33] or like not paying attention and you put [38:35] your feet up and check your phone and [38:37] your puppy's is about to do this you can [38:39] miss it I want to show you how subtle [38:41] this is but this is why um you know five [38:44] alive had maybe one accident his entire [38:48] puppyhood so just keep an eye on this [38:50] life how short and P pudgy he is I know [38:53] he's like oh look that's a that's so we [38:55] used to make long lines look at that [38:59] even before we we were selling them or [39:01] even before we making our own uh we used [39:04] to use long lines like it's like a [39:05] little orange one orange is his [39:08] color oh going to have a little drink's [39:11] going to have a sip of juice What's [39:12] happen here so watch this that moment so [39:15] I'll pause it this moment is all it [39:17] takes and maybe because we five alive [39:20] has gone out that door at our house uh [39:23] multiple times like taken outside to do [39:25] his thing so now because kale is Right [39:28] nearby keeping an eye on what the heck [39:29] he's doing also it's probably that [39:30] moment where the puppy goes silent and [39:32] you're like uh uhoh yeah P silence [39:35] that's not a good thing what he looking [39:36] at so he stared briefly at the door and [39:40] then Kale's like oh do you need to go [39:43] outside and she she picks him up and she [39:45] takes them out now I want to go to one [39:47] that's maybe a little bit more obvious [39:49] but um this office [39:52] hours for Friday yes correct y y [39:58] uh so I know that someone had mentioned [39:59] going to our um store tomorrow and I [40:03] think Saturday is uh 8:30 a.
document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 75/468,m. 900 a.m. [40:09] to 3 3:30 yeah yeah and then tomorrow [40:12] Friday if you're in the area it's uh [40:14] 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.
document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 76/468,now uh I want to [40:17] show you a little bit more obvious [40:19] version of this uh hold on one second [40:22] so let me know do do you have a puppy [40:24] who does witching hour or like has the [40:26] Zoomies or whatever ever you know starts [40:28] to go uh Bonkers at a certain time of [40:30] night or like we'll just do a puppy burn [40:32] which I I mean it's adorable um but uh [40:36] and then all of a sudden they have an [40:38] accident not uncommon keep an eye what [40:40] happens here but again because Kale's [40:43] got a house line on she's supervising [40:44] closely she's not letting the puppy make [40:46] mistakes she's able to capture this and [40:49] after this completely changed the um uh [40:53] his his house training experience [40:57] look at him he's like I don't know how I [41:00] feel where do I go what do I do what do [41:02] I do right there he has to poo I can [41:04] tell now I know his signs yeah but you [41:07] see Kale did you see kale uh frantic he [41:11] got sort of like oh my gosh I have [41:13] bathroom where do I go what do I do it [41:15] such unusual behavior that it sort of [41:16] just caught my eye and then I was able [41:19] to um it's always so weird and how he's [41:22] indicating to the door like a couple [41:23] times you know he bounces toward it but [41:25] if you if you weren't supervising you [41:28] might have missed that in between part [41:29] and thought like oh he wants to play tug [41:31] or wants to play fetch or something uh [41:33] but that really got the ball rolling [41:34] because after that he would be so good [41:38] about either so I was in the kitchen he [41:40] would just he still does it he's almost [41:42] three years old now this was quite some [41:43] time ago but he'll go and stand at the [41:45] door look at the door look at me look at [41:47] the door like it's just so clear um or [41:50] if we're in the other room he'll kind of [41:52] come and stand in the room that we're in [41:54] and he'll sort of be still and he'll [41:55] look towards the kitchen and then he'll [41:56] look back back and like you just know [41:59] but that all started from just th those [42:02] first couple steps yeah yeah uh Jamar [42:06] with the Super Chat lightning up the [42:08] train station green green [42:11] Green send that over okay uh bordly mix [42:16] eight weeks old crate training equals [42:18] whining digging and nervous biting I [42:20] feel he's doing this cuz he's bored he [42:22] naps a lot any [42:24] tips um yeah it could be bored it could [42:26] be that he just doesn't want to be in [42:28] there um you know 8 weeks old not very [42:30] old puppy um I would just sort of [42:33] reiterate some of the things that we [42:35] said before just make sure that that [42:36] puppy is totally satisfied before you [42:39] put that before you time they really [42:42] like to do stuff so if you're doing [42:44] stuff with your puppy and then you [42:45] finish and you feel like you've done [42:46] enough and you put them in their crate [42:48] sometimes they don't Zonk out right away [42:50] because they're like hey we were having [42:51] fun what's happening here um and um and [42:57] so do we need to repeat what we said [43:00] because of that okay um so sometimes it [43:04] takes a bit for them to settle um now 8 [43:07] weeks you don't have a very old puppy [43:08] yet so you could just sort of let them [43:11] you know wind it out a little bit but [43:13] after you know a week or so home um you [43:16] could start to correct that behavior as [43:18] well so that it doesn't become a thing [43:20] um but it could be for a number of [43:22] reasons um but either way it's not [43:24] something you want to let continue while [43:26] you're super supervising you know uh we' [43:28] talked about all the ways that you can [43:30] make sure your puppy is successful what [43:31] happens if they have an [43:34] accident well the best thing to do is to [43:38] react while they go and almost startle [43:41] them in in in a way so hey hey hey what [43:43] are you doing I used to clap my hands [43:44] and sort of raise my voice a little bit [43:46] so they're like did kale startle you she [43:48] kind of startled me there uh so the [43:50] puppy sort go oh go but as soon as I do [43:52] that I I stop immediately and I scoop [43:54] the puppy up take them outside I'm like [43:56] jaine hi once I get outside and I put my [43:58] puppy down I'll switch right back to my [44:01] normal hurry up hurry up and as soon as [44:03] they start to go yay that's better good [44:05] puppy and I praise and praise and praise [44:07] and praise so puppy goes oh it's so much [44:09] better out here this makes much more [44:10] sense um I have had situations where I [44:13] sort of stopped the puppy Midstream and [44:15] I've sort of startled them I take them [44:17] outside and they're like I can't [44:18] possibly continue I don't really know [44:19] what to do and I'll just sort of quietly [44:21] wait out there for a few moments and um [44:25] if the puppy won't go and I know that [44:26] they need to finish then I'll bring them [44:28] back inside but I just won't let them be [44:30] loose to you know continue having an [44:33] accident I might put them in the crate [44:34] for 5 10 minutes and just sort of let [44:37] them settle a little bit and then I'll [44:39] just preemptively let the puppy out and [44:41] we'll just try again to make sure that [44:43] they actually like fully relieve [44:44] themselves um but I feel that that's the [44:47] best way to catch them in the act and to [44:49] redirect them to what they should be [44:50] doing if they don't stop peeing don't [44:52] pick your puppy up and create a stream [44:54] all the way to the door I know this is [44:55] some question cuz people take things so [44:57] literally they're like well yeah but you [44:59] you know that your intention is to like [45:00] stop the puppy peeing with the Clapping [45:02] or hey hey knock it off or whatever and [45:05] uh but if they don't stop peeing don't [45:07] uh don't don't create a line to your [45:09] door um if you don't see it you can't [45:13] fix it so if somehow your puppy sneaks [45:16] away after all of this coaching and [45:18] encouragement that we've given you and [45:20] your puppy goes around the corner where [45:22] you can't see and they have an accident [45:24] that's your fault it's not their fault [45:25] you know it's really important that [45:27] keeping an eye on them that's why we [45:28] kale talked a little bit about baby [45:29] gates and barricades and just ways to [45:31] manage your puppy so that they can't get [45:33] away with that kind of thing and here's [45:35] the problem is it's going to set back [45:37] your training so much if they get a [45:40] chance to rehearse it not unlike chewing [45:43] in your home before we go on can I just [45:45] see Mickey's comment I really love it [45:47] she said we were such helicopter Hoovers [45:49] at first Luna uh never had a chance to [45:52] have accidents and then puppy Central [45:54] helped us see that she needed some [45:56] accidents she knew where to go but not [46:00] uh but where not to go but not where not [46:02] to go yeah so I think that that's really [46:03] important because you don't want to get [46:05] too worried about clarify that a little [46:07] bit of accidents because sometimes what [46:08] happens and I have seen this happen is [46:10] we have um students that are trying to [46:13] be so diligent about making sure their [46:15] puppies don't have any accidents and [46:16] letting them out on a regular basis and [46:18] they're so successful with that but the [46:21] puppy actually doesn't then know what [46:23] they don't know they don't they know [46:24] going outside is good but they haven't [46:26] haven't yet experienced any type of [46:28] Correction for going inside so they [46:30] actually don't know that that [46:32] potentially is off bounds as well so [46:33] that's a really good point megie that if [46:36] they do have an accident make sure you [46:37] know the best thing is if they have an [46:39] accident inside you're there to let them [46:41] know it's not right you've had that [46:43] conversation and then you're good to go [46:45] um so that's a really good uh point to [46:47] make and then just the last thing with [46:49] Jamar um I just want to remind you if [46:51] you haven't seen a lot of our videos [46:53] already we actually have some excellent [46:55] crate training videos specifically about [46:58] um noise and barking and that whining [47:01] that type of thing on the YouTube [47:02] channel so if you haven't seen any of [47:04] those make sure you search those out [47:06] because I think that will reiterate some [47:07] of the things I said and at 8 weeks old [47:09] Jamar like you're the perfect candidate [47:11] for something like our online puppy [47:12] Essentials program where you can get [47:14] fresh meat yeah you can get like [47:16] personalized support uh you know your [47:18] puppy's ready to learn such a perfect [47:20] and to interrupt some of that stuff [47:22] quickly you know might take a little bit [47:23] more uh coaching yeah so um you can [47:26] check out check out that program it [47:28] might be just exactly right for you I [47:30] see Sam crenchaw dropping CR training [47:32] welcome Sam Sam is uh 16 months in a row [47:35] Employee of the Month uh not only does [47:37] he clean this place up but he also uh [47:41] cuts my hair so thank you Sam for all [47:43] that you do for us in the live stream oh [47:45] my God chewing in your home can be a [47:48] real nuisance for a lot of new puppy [47:49] owners uh whether it is like stuff that [47:52] you care about oh you know what actually [47:55] I wanted to get back to this made me [47:56] think about the chewing thing what are [47:57] good chew toys that you'd give to a [47:59] puppy uh I only give puppies chew toys I [48:03] only use things that they cannot destroy [48:05] and that they do not require me to be [48:08] like staring at them while they chew it [48:11] so the puppy tug for example I thought [48:12] actually think somebody asked this in [48:14] the um yeah it's not a chew toy it's not [48:16] a chew toy no um because highly [48:19] technical relationship building pieces [48:21] that's right so this is something if my [48:23] puppy was to play with us on their own [48:25] they could you know chew it apart they [48:27] could wreck it they could swallow it [48:28] they could um they could get hurt this [48:31] is something that I would bring out and [48:33] play with my puppy together but then I [48:35] would put it away but I might give my [48:37] puppies things like um you know a Kong [48:40] to chew on and I could fill it with some [48:42] goodies to help occupy them I love using [48:44] Kongs in my puppy's crates um especially [48:47] when I first put them into the crate I [48:49] fill a Kong with some goodies and that [48:50] sort of gives them something to focus on [48:52] when they get in the crate so they're [48:53] not so worried about um me you know [48:56] going to do my own thing um there's lots [48:59] of different good chew bones out on the [49:01] market as well but also there's lots of [49:02] chew bones that are not safe as well um [49:05] so you know we really like Nyla bones [49:08] Benny bones um Yak bones those things [49:11] are all pretty good um you know as your [49:15] dog's older and a stronger chewer you [49:17] could you know try something like [49:18] antlers things like that but you do want [49:20] to stay away from things like Rawhide [49:22] pigs ears cow hooves anything like that [49:25] number one they're terribly unhealthy [49:27] for your dog um but number two [49:29] especially with raw high it's it's um [49:34] you know easy to chew and the dogs [49:36] really love it but it expands with [49:39] moisture so if your dog swallows large [49:41] pieces and it gets inside their belly [49:43] and it expands with moisture we [49:45] unfortunately know of far too many dogs [49:47] have had to have surgery to get it [49:49] removed because they just can't pass it [49:51] and it gets lodged um in their [49:52] intestines so um just be aware of that [49:56] so ch bones are great you know as long [49:58] as they pass the safety test test um and [50:01] anything that your dog can play with [50:02] that they can't rip the eyes off of [50:04] steal the squeaker out of you know rip [50:07] apart tear apart swallow ingest those [50:09] types of things that's sort of going to [50:11] help separate chew toys from interactive [50:13] to honestly and we are not sponsored we [50:16] have a great relationship with the [50:18] amazing people at Kong and they actually [50:19] sent us an entire they should sponsor us [50:21] they they had a they had a mass they [50:23] sent us an entire shipping container uh [50:26] not quite a shipping container but a [50:28] pallet with a like a basket full of [50:29] Kongs to uh to do some content with and [50:32] they're just amazing that's my go-to toy [50:34] for for chew toy honestly because you [50:36] can put something in it and I noticed [50:38] someone I can't remember who it was now [50:39] but someone did mentioned earlier like [50:40] what do what do I do if my dog seems to [50:43] have a little separation anxiety when I [50:44] leave them in their crate well I'll tell [50:46] you what to do you want to make sure you [50:48] disrupt the pattern of whatever whatever [50:50] it means for you to get ready to leave [50:52] and them going in their crate so that [50:54] might be you take something like a Kong [50:56] stuff it with whatever their delicious [50:58] thing is maybe you're stuffing it for [50:59] their breakfast or dinner or something [51:00] before you leave you stuff it all in [51:02] there you put the Kong in the crate and [51:04] then you close the door with your dog [51:05] outside so they all they can think about [51:08] is trying to get that thing they can't [51:10] wait to get in and get that food or get [51:12] in get that chew toy I chose Kong and [51:15] food whatever your dog absolutely loves [51:17] that they can have safely in their crate [51:19] that's what you're going to put in there [51:20] so then you do your thing and you know [51:22] as long as you can keep an eye on your [51:23] uh puppy now that it's time to leave you [51:26] let the in and at that reward whatever [51:28] that happens to be you close the door [51:30] and Away you go don't make a fuss about [51:32] it don't make a big deal about you [51:34] leaving but it's a great way to get your [51:36] dog's mind off the fact that you're [51:37] leaving the other thing you need to [51:38] start doing is creating your dog while [51:40] you're home y uh that's going to be [51:42] really important so that they don't [51:43] associate every time they that you're [51:45] whatever they go in their crate that [51:47] you're going to be gone for uh any [51:48] period of time so um take advantage of [51:51] those two strategies chewing in your [51:53] home when we're talking about nuisance [51:54] chewing though shoes [51:57] whatever floor I mean we've heard it all [51:59] you know heard it all yeah whatever it [52:01] is C cou never underestimate what your [52:03] dog will consider swallowing it is crazy [52:06] so it is important though that um I know [52:09] a lot of people will be like oh he's [52:10] chewing on a thing I'll get a treat and [52:11] I'll lure him away well that I'll just [52:14] give him a toy instead exactly yeah like [52:16] oh yeah shove a toy in his face instead [52:17] of chewing on a shoe this is why you [52:19] have your house line on this is what's [52:20] going to give you good management of [52:22] your puppy also this is the leadership [52:26] decision that changes everything so your [52:28] puppy chewing on the thing somehow you [52:30] missed it they they got a hold of that [52:32] shoe or they got a hold of that training [52:33] bag or whatever you you use your voice [52:36] from a distance Mark the moment that [52:37] they've made the mistake hey hey hey you [52:39] get up there with your house line and [52:41] then you guide them away you just guide [52:43] your puppy ever so gently you guide them [52:44] away now is the key now you get them to [52:48] do something now it's like a sit [52:50] exercise maybe it's whatever you get [52:53] them to work just a little bit so that [52:55] you can dissociate something of value [52:57] because remember we don't we don't want [52:58] to be telling our dog no no no no no all [53:01] the time that's not really fair and [53:02] that's not good coaching we want to be [53:04] making sure that there's like lots of [53:05] support in there too showing them what [53:07] we do want so after you've interrupted [53:09] that behavior guided your dog away made [53:11] them work and then rewarded them with a [53:13] food or toy now's the opportunity to [53:16] reassess your management you're going to [53:18] you know fix make sure that can't happen [53:20] again or you you know that your puppy [53:22] needs more exercise or they need to go [53:23] in their kennel because you can't [53:25] supervise them very well you know that's [53:28] that's these are the leadership choices [53:29] we talk a lot about in our puppy [53:31] training classes as well as our dog [53:33] training classes it's that those little [53:35] things that you don't really think about [53:36] but because of like the wealth of [53:37] knowledge that comes from all the [53:38] amazing people at the training facility [53:40] these are the little wins that you need [53:42] to get the little ons we try to share [53:43] with you every two weeks here in the [53:46] train station so that you can have a [53:47] better experience with your puppy and [53:49] when you start to incorporate even half [53:51] of the things we talked about tonight [53:53] you're going to notice a big difference [53:56] because your puppy's going to have a [53:58] clearer picture of what your [53:59] expectations are absolutely we have [54:05] our 15% off puppy training tools Allin [54:08] one bundle for 24 hours so what time you [54:11] need all the

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 80/468,~Ken === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] sometimes it can feel like you just [00:01] can't get enough good information in a [00:03] short YouTube video well that's exactly [00:05] why we created a vlog series with a [00:07] brand new puppy named uker that way you [00:09] can watch from point A to point B the [00:12] entire puppy series The Good the Bad and [00:14] the Ugly so get your favorite snack grab [00:16] your favorite drink sit in get [00:18] comfortable because you're about to [00:20] watch the entire uker puppy series I'm [00:22] Dan welcome back to Mand [00:27] dogs we have some very exciting news and [00:31] the title of this video bringing home a [00:33] new puppy is exactly what we're about to [00:35] talk about but there's a couple of [00:36] things that you need to do when you're [00:38] preparing to bring that puppy home and [00:40] Kale's going to show us what she's [00:41] bringing along on the ride so we're just [00:43] about to get in the car and uh we have a [00:45] bit of a drive to go and get the puppy [00:47] so I just wanted to show you a couple [00:48] things that we've done ahead of time so [00:49] that we're ready when she comes home and [00:51] also we're ready in the car because who [00:53] knows what could happen so first of all [00:56] uh I have a towel so that I can put it [00:58] on my lap to hold the puppy on top while [01:00] she's in the car just in case she gets [01:01] car sick so she's a bit more comfortable [01:03] definitely not going to go anywhere [01:05] without paper towels because just who [01:06] knows you can never be too prepared um I [01:08] have some water um we have our little [01:11] puppy crate we'll decide whether she [01:13] we'll have her ride home in the crate or [01:14] whether we'll hold her on our lap but we [01:16] just will have it with us um and then [01:18] also too um I have some other things we [01:20] have a dog bowl I have some Che bones [01:23] puppy size of course um some tug toys [01:26] the rtier the better of course um so we [01:29] have a bunch of things with us just in [01:30] case uh and then when she comes home [01:33] she's typically going to be in a really [01:34] small crate to begin with but we also [01:36] have another crate just set up in the [01:38] central area of our house so this is our [01:40] kitchen Ken and I are in here all of the [01:43] time um now I've put this horrible [01:45] looking cardboard box on top because I [01:48] want to make sure she can't pull [01:50] anything through the crate to chew on it [01:52] because again she's a puppy and I've [01:53] done something a little bit strategic [01:55] the box is a little wider than the crate [01:57] so if we want to put a cover or a sheet [02:00] over top of it she also won't be able to [02:01] pull it through the crate because [02:02] there's a bit of width on either side [02:04] I'm ready for her food all of my train [02:07] things and uh we're excited this is uh [02:11] this is going to be a bit of Adventure [02:13] and we're excited you guys get to come [02:14] along for the ride I know we've kind of [02:16] raced through these things but we're [02:17] really excited so let's go pick up the [02:19] puppy I'm Ken steep I'm K McAn welcome [02:22] back to McAn [02:25] dogs we are just

[02:42] you guys all of the basic training we do [02:45] with the puppies when we first bring [02:46] them home are you ready I'm so excited [02:49] let's go get her okay in a moment you're [02:50] going to see a puppy [03:03] [Music] [03:15] this is your [03:22] [Music] [03:23] joy that was the cut thing oh my [03:27] God oh my okay guys we want to introduce [03:30] you to somebody a look at that there she [03:35] is Yuka Duke meet Yuka oh [03:40] sweetheart oh you are so cute all right [03:45] we are ready to head home um the breeder [03:48] was awesome she actually gave us one of [03:49] the towels that um Yuki's been sleeping [03:52] with so that she has something familiar [03:55] um sometimes we will hi bab sometimes we [03:57] will put them in a crate on the way home [03:59] um just a little bit overwhelmed right [04:01] now there's a lot going on yeah so I [04:03] just have the towel on my glp and I'm [04:05] just going to hold her for a little bit [04:06] we're going to stop and get some puppy [04:07] food oh there we go now she's coming [04:09] around we're going to stop and get some [04:11] puppy food all the way back and I have [04:13] to go because I'm getting maed by an [04:15] adorable [04:17] [Music] [04:19] puppy we just stopped to get some gas on [04:21] the way home and I thought I would tell [04:23] you about a couple other things that you [04:24] should keep in mind when you're bringing [04:26] a new puppy home um number one uh make [04:28] sure you ask about about what type of [04:30] food that the breeder is feeding the [04:32] breeder was great about telling us what [04:33] food the puppy's already been used to so [04:35] that if you did want to change Foods at [04:37] all you could do that very gradually by [04:39] mixing the old food and the new food [04:41] together the other thing that you should [04:43] think about too is whether the puppy has [04:44] been able to have a good pee and poop [04:46] before you go on your long car right [04:47] home um you know as weird dog people do [04:50] the three of us cheered before we got [04:51] into the car as she had a little poop [04:53] before we knew we had to have her [04:55] sitting here for a while so keep those [04:57] things in mind to make sure that uh the [04:58] ride home is a little bit more stress [05:00] free so we just got home and as you can [05:03] see she's looking a little sad she [05:06] actually just had a little bit of car [05:08] sickness in the car just as we were sort [05:10] of pulling down our road um luckily I [05:12] had this towel because uh we had to do a [05:15] little quick clean [05:16] up I think she just wants a nap but [05:19] before we take her inside I'm just going [05:20] to see if she has to pee and then um we [05:23] might just have a snooze to be honest [05:25] because I think you know taking her in [05:26] and doing a play right now might not be [05:28] the best thing but we'll we'll see uh [05:30] we'll see what happens once we get her [05:31] going so we're going to put her in the [05:33] crate for um just a few minutes now and [05:35] uh you may be wondering why on Earth we [05:37] have the crate on our island in the [05:40] middle of the kitchen and we're doing [05:41] that um because Ken and I have some [05:43] other dogs and I just want to keep her [05:45] away from the other dogs and away from [05:46] the busyness and it's also really [05:48] helpful just have the puppy up at your [05:50] like head level and just to keep them a [05:51] little closer just sort of a good [05:53] bonding confidence building type of [05:55] thing I'm hoping she's just going to go [05:57] in and have a little snooze cuz her [05:58] belly's upset and then when she sort of [06:00] wakes up again we'll uh we'll try to go [06:02] for a pee once again all right girly so [06:04] this is again the first time she's ever [06:05] been in a crate you'll notice I have no [06:07] bedding in there I will probably put a [06:09] bone or something in there for to her to [06:11] chew but I'm not going to put any [06:13] bedding in there I don't want her to [06:14] chew it or go to the bathroom on it [06:15] until we've had a couple days of no [06:17] accidents in the crate here you go babe [06:21] here you go in your crate and I'm going [06:23] to eventually teach her to go in the [06:25] crate on command but she doesn't really [06:27] know that right now so I'm just going to [06:28] put her in [06:30] close the door I've never used this [06:32] crate before how do I use it there we go [06:35] like that what do you think your first [06:38] little crate girl another thing to keep [06:41] in mind when you bring your new puppy [06:42] home is that they're going from one [06:44] environment that they're very [06:45] comfortable with um for this particular [06:47] puppy she came from a farm there's lots [06:49] of other dogs there's lots going on and [06:51] now she's in a new place so you know if [06:53] she starts to make a fuss or starts to [06:55] you know be a little bit uncomfortable [06:57] bark in the crate we're just going to [06:58] kind of let that go for now because just [07:00] going to give her the benefit of the [07:02] doubt we're putting her in a new [07:03] situation these are types of behaviors [07:05] that we will address in a few days but [07:06] for now we're just going to let her ease [07:09] into things get comfortable in a new [07:11] place new people New Dogs new smells um [07:14] I think she's handling it really well [07:16] already but we're just going to play it [07:18] by ear and make sure we're building on [07:19] success so we just finished dinner and [07:21] while we were eating we put the puppies [07:23] crate really close to us so that we [07:24] could hear whether she was stirring or [07:26] not she's actually been asleep for two [07:28] hours she's finally awake now we need to [07:30] take her outside uh for her first little [07:33] pece so I'm just going to see if she'll [07:35] come on of the crate here now when she [07:37] comes out hi babe oh don't go too far [07:41] young lady I going to put her little [07:43] leash on and I'm actually going to carry [07:44] her outside she's not house trained yet [07:46] so I don't want to risk her having an [07:47] accident so I'm going to carry her [07:49] outside from there now when you have a [07:51] new puppy it's a really good idea to [07:53] take advantage of them when they're [07:54] sleeping to have them you know learn [07:56] about having a bit of crate time right [07:58] from the GetGo um great place to have a [08:00] nap is in the crate start to learn about [08:02] being calm in there and keep the crate [08:03] nearby make sure it's near wherever you [08:05] are so that if they start to stir you're [08:07] able to get up and uh take them outside [08:09] right away okay what do you think lady [08:10] want to try and go outside for a pee [08:12] let's [08:15] go let's go [08:18] outside good [08:20] girl good girl um also too I just went [08:24] down a set of stairs not a good idea to [08:26] do stairs this early with puppies as [08:27] well good idea to pick them up and carry [08:29] them just cuz they're not really ready [08:31] to do that type of stuff yet all right [08:33] let's see [08:34] [Music] [08:37] girl now I'm just going to place her [08:39] down here she hasn't had a pee since [08:42] back at her uh Litter with her buddies [08:44] and stuff I'm not just going to let her [08:45] run around I'm just going to keep her on [08:47] this short leash and just see if she'll [08:50] go to the [08:53] bathroom we her out a little bit [08:57] here she hasn't really been in this part [08:59] of our property yet oh yes good girl [09:02] hurry up hurry up hurry up hurry up yay [09:08] that was good she says I want to see the [09:11] cameraman yay so already on day one I'm [09:15] starting to teach her about um going to [09:19] the bathroom and learning to eventually [09:21] go on command so as she was going I just [09:23] said hurry up hurry up you have to wait [09:25] till they're already going and uh I'll [09:27] do that for the next couple days and [09:29] then hopefully we'll have going to the [09:30] bathroom on a command that was pretty [09:33] good young lady now she hasn't really [09:35] had any dinner yet because her belly was [09:37] a bit upset earlier but she's definitely [09:39] more relaxed now so we're going to do a [09:41] little bit of training and incorporate [09:43] some of her meals maybe see if she's [09:44] interested in some toys we're going to [09:46] have a bit of a play I'm a little bit um [09:49] nervous the fact that she just had such [09:51] a long nap because it could make this [09:52] evening's sleeping time a little bit [09:54] interesting so hopefully we can tire her [09:57] out enough again that we can actually [09:59] sleep through the night now you'll [10:00] notice already when she's moving around [10:02] the house that we have this little leash [10:04] attached to her this is something that [10:05] we're going to do right away now this is [10:07] the very first time she's ever had a [10:08] collar and Leash On she scratched out a [10:10] little bit but she's actually handling [10:11] it quite well but what she really wants [10:13] to do is bite on this leash and this is [10:15] a common thing that people you know talk [10:17] to us about you know I don't want to put [10:18] the light on the puppy just bites it so [10:20] you're going to notice over the next [10:22] couple videos of our series how we're [10:23] going to work through that pretty soon [10:25] she's not going to be too worried about [10:26] it but having this line on is going to [10:28] help PR prevent uh my puppy from getting [10:30] into Mischief I can stop her from [10:32] getting behind Furniture I can stop her [10:34] from grabbing things she's not supposed [10:35] to I can get a hold of her without [10:37] trying to catch her and uh scare her in [10:39] any way so this line is going to be [10:42] attached to this little puppy every [10:43] moment that she's not in her crate so I [10:45] can have control and I can make sure she [10:47] stays safe so one of the first things [10:49] that I like to do with puppies is start [10:50] to introduce some play with toys this is [10:53] going to be the number one way I'm going [10:54] to Tire this puppy out every day until [10:56] she learns how to walk on a leash and [10:58] learns a call so playing with toys is [11:01] going to be really important she took a [11:03] little while to get into it but now [11:04] she's doing great now if I can get it [11:06] out of her mouth I'm going to try [11:07] tossing it and see if she'll bring it [11:09] back to me a little bit oh she's gotten [11:11] a great grip now so I'm actually going [11:13] to let her win for a second oh you got [11:15] it good girl now I'm going to hold this [11:17] line though where' she go because what I [11:19] don't want her to do is take the toy and [11:20] go play with it on her own this toy is [11:22] only going to be played with with me so [11:25] we can build a fun little relationship [11:27] together oh I got it now here it is oh [11:29] here it is so I keep it Lively get it [11:31] get it get it get it get it yay oh my [11:34] goodness good girl you are little [11:37] superstar you e that [11:40] thinging so she lets go I can Jiggle It [11:42] Around get it exciting [11:45] yeah oh thanks babe now this natural [11:48] retrieve that she's doing it will 100% [11:51] disappear in a few days if I don't keep [11:53] amplifying it a lot of puppies initially [11:56] will come back really easily with you [11:57] and then eventually they'll sort of [11:58] start to figure hm what if I can take [12:00] this toy and do my own thing with it so [12:02] keep your puppy on a line so you can [12:04] make sure you teach them each time they [12:06] play with the toy and need to bring it [12:08] back oh my goodness so I am just going [12:10] to savor this moment right now what's [12:12] happening because I'm sure in a little [12:14] while I'm going to have to work my butt [12:15] off to get her to come back and that's [12:17] okay we'll do it but right now she's [12:19] doing so many amazing things just [12:21] naturally we got to tire her out so we [12:23] can sleep all night right you good girl [12:27] so she was starting to lose inures a [12:28] little bit in the to was starting to get [12:30] a little bit less intense so I'm [12:32] actually going to switch to some food [12:33] she hasn't had any dinner yet she's [12:34] really sniffing around what I think is [12:36] so funny about this is she hasn't [12:38] figured out how to take food from my [12:39] hand yet there we go see she's just not [12:43] quite sure so sometimes what you can do [12:45] is just start off by putting a couple [12:46] treats on the floor first oh there we go [12:50] and by treats I'm literally just using [12:51] her kibble her dinner she hasn't had any [12:53] dinner yet uh she had an upset belly for [12:57] uh before so we're just sort of taking [12:58] it so okay now I'm going see if she'll [12:59] take it from my hand here it is yes good [13:05] girl good so when I first get my puppies [13:08] home I usually like to evaluate you know [13:11] what do they like like what what [13:13] motivates them what am I going to be [13:14] using for my training are they more toy [13:17] motivated are they even toy motivated do [13:19] they like food will she follow food [13:21] naturally so now she knows it's in my [13:23] hand I might move my hand around a [13:25] little bit yes good girl and then I can [13:28] reward her simply for following my hand [13:31] she doesn't have to do anything and this [13:33] is all the foundation yes good girl for [13:37] the methods that I'm going to use to [13:38] teach her to do all kinds of behaviors [13:40] yes this is very simple you follow my [13:43] hand you follow the food you get the [13:45] food it's really that simple when I'm [13:48] doing the training I'm just going to do [13:49] short little bits here and there a [13:51] little bit of toy a little bit of food [13:53] tire her out and then it's really [13:54] important to remember that when you do a [13:55] lot of exercise and play with your puppy [13:57] and you're going to do some feeding [13:59] they're going to have a drink they're [14:00] always going to need to go to the [14:01] bathroom after so even though she's just [14:02] been out for a pee once we do a little [14:04] bit more together I'm going to need to [14:06] take her out again so that we're not [14:07] going to get any [14:16] accidents I hate to interrupt but [14:18] there's something I need to tell you [14:19] about since filming this video our team [14:21] has been working tirelessly at building [14:23] the best dog train tools we possibly can [14:25] for you and your dog now these tools are [14:27] things that you're going to love and [14:28] they're going to make your training [14:30] easier in this video so far you've seen [14:32] kale using a couple tools one of them [14:33] was a house line since then we created [14:36] our own now this is a 5T long half in [14:39] wide cotton web line we also have a/4 in [14:42] wide for our smaller dogs as well if [14:45] you're interested in getting one of [14:46] these for you and your dog check out [14:48] maand dos.
document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 81/468,store so we've just come back [14:50] inside from uh seeing if she's H to to [14:52] the bathroom we've tried a couple times [14:54] now we haven't had any success with a PE [14:56] or a poo quite yet she's just a little [14:57] bit distracted in a new place place I [14:59] know she's got to go to the bathroom [15:01] though so instead of just letting her [15:02] wander around the house we've come in [15:04] and we've placed her in the crate now [15:06] this is the first time that she's been [15:07] making any noises in the crate so I'm [15:09] not really going to worry about it I'm [15:11] just going to see if she's going to [15:11] settle for a little bit and then we're [15:13] going to go ahead and take her outside [15:15] and try once again if the Barking in the [15:17] nonsense continues to carry on I might [15:19] take that as a sign that she needs to go [15:21] out but I also need to make sure I'm [15:23] balanced and teaching her that this [15:24] behavior isn't going to allow you to [15:26] come out so this is where your gut needs [15:28] to come into play you need to make sure [15:30] that you're reading the situation and [15:32] then making the right choices so I just [15:34] waited her out it's been like 2 minutes [15:37] since she started crying we're going to [15:39] let a sleeping puppy sleep and then when [15:42] she wakes up we're going to try it [15:45] again it's getting a little bit later in [15:47] the evening and uh we're still wondering [15:49] whether we're going to have a sleepless [15:52] night or an easy night so we actually [15:54] want to get her up one more time and do [15:56] a little bit with her she's been [15:57] sleeping in her CR crate quite soundly [16:00] for the last hour or so and she still [16:02] hasn't had a really good peer poo um in [16:05] the last couple hours so we're going to [16:07] give that another go um you're probably [16:10] looking in jealousy the fact that this [16:12] adorable little puppy has been so quiet [16:14] in her crate but one tip that's [16:15] important to remember is that you don't [16:17] want to avoid the crate for a couple [16:18] days just get the minute right away take [16:21] advantage of natural moments when you're [16:22] puppy is quiet and tired and use that as [16:26] an opportunity for them to learn right [16:28] from the beginning that it it's their [16:29] place to go and just chill out and nap [16:31] she's had a little bit of time um making [16:33] noise in the crate as you would have [16:34] seen earlier but overall she's just been [16:37] so excellent because we've used it sort [16:38] of appropriately she's been right with [16:40] us the entire night but uh let's see if [16:42] we have any luck with taking her [16:50] outside we finally had a pee and it's [16:53] getting a little bit later so now I want [16:54] to just take a little bit more time to [16:56] have one more little play session before [16:58] before she goes to bed um and hopefully [17:00] that's just going to get enough energy [17:02] out that she sleeps soundly throughout [17:04] the night now I'm specifically choosing [17:07] to have a little play session with a toy [17:09] rather than food I don't want to be [17:11] feeding her at this point because it is [17:12] quite late and I don't want her to have [17:13] to go to the bathroom throughout the [17:14] night or you know have an accident in [17:16] her crate so we're just going to play [17:18] around the toy a little bit do a few [17:19] active things hopefully she'll have one [17:21] more little drink and uh one more pee [17:24] before uh bedtime and then um we'll go [17:27] from there so I want to give you guys a [17:29] few more tips about some of the [17:30] management decisions that we've made for [17:32] this puppy this first day home now you [17:33] may have noticed that she has had very [17:35] little time just to kind of roam around [17:37] our house and do her own thing we're [17:39] controlling her Freedom by having her [17:41] spend a little bit of time in her crate [17:43] and then when she's out of her crate [17:44] we're doing things with her to sort of [17:46] keep her entertained keep her occupied [17:48] but most importantly supervise her so [17:50] that she can't learn day one that she's [17:53] allowed to you know get into Mischief [17:55] also she's a a very young inexperienced [17:58] pupp she doesn't really know what to do [18:00] yet so we need to be here to kind of [18:02] guide her every step of the way to keep [18:03] her safe um the other thing I wanted to [18:05] mention is that um Ken and I own several [18:08] other dogs and you have also not seen [18:10] them in this video so um they haven't [18:12] had the most exciting day because we've [18:14] uh put them all away so that she can [18:16] sort of get comfortable here first um [18:19] it's really important if you do have [18:20] other animals in your house that you [18:22] don't just bring your puppy home and [18:24] then just have them meet the other [18:25] animals right away there's a couple [18:27] things that need to happen number one [18:28] you need to spend a little bit of time [18:30] bonding with your puppy and then you [18:32] also just need to get everybody [18:33] comfortable with you know different [18:35] animals being in the house we um had her [18:38] spend some time in her crate this [18:39] afternoon for about you know half hour [18:41] or 45 minutes and we took our dogs on a [18:43] big run so that they were able to have [18:45] some exercise and then they're just off [18:47] in the other room right now while she's [18:49] able to have a little bit of free time [18:51] and um that's really what life's going [18:53] to look like for the next couple weeks [18:54] and even months until she has a little [18:56] bit more training underneath her belt [18:58] she's going to have very little time [19:00] spent with her other dogs until I can [19:02] trust her to listen to me and understand [19:05] that I'm more important than those other [19:07] dogs so I'm just going to be switching [19:08] back and forth between her having some [19:10] CR time them being loose and doing their [19:13] normal thing my normal routine and then [19:15] flip-flopping it to make sure that [19:16] everybody gets equal attention but that [19:19] she's learning really good things right [19:20] from the beginning as you can see by [19:23] these sleepy puppy dog eyes we are [19:26] pretty much ready for bed and I'm going [19:28] to share with you guys guys one more tip [19:30] that we like to do with our puppies when [19:31] we first bring them home and this is a [19:33] weird one so bear with me we actually [19:36] like to clean off of everything off our [19:38] bedside table for the first couple [19:39] nights and we place our crate on the [19:42] bedside table this might not be for [19:44] everyone however this is such an [19:46] excellent way just to keep your puppy [19:48] close it's great for bonding it's always [19:51] uh also great to make sure that if she [19:52] stirs in the middle of the night I'm [19:54] going to hear her and I can get up um to [19:56] make sure she you know doesn't have to [19:58] go to the wash so I'm going to place it [20:00] literally right beside the bed this is [20:02] my side of the bed I'm going to let Ken [20:04] you know have the night off and uh that [20:07] way when she's in the crate and I put [20:08] her in here I can stick my fingers in [20:10] the crate I can interact with her if I [20:12] need to I can help settle her this is [20:14] not going to be her permanent sleeping [20:16] spot of course but for the first couple [20:18] nights it's just a great way to kind of [20:19] get her a little bit more comfortable [20:21] what do you think babe want to go [20:24] in good [20:27] night good [20:29] girl oh that's so good I have raised a [20:33] lot of puppies at this point and I've [20:34] helped students train and raise a lot of [20:36] puppies as well and I have learned that [20:38] all puppies are a little bit different [20:40] so if you're looking for some [20:41] personalized coaching to help with your [20:43] specific puppy make sure you check out [20:45] our puppy Essentials online program the [20:47] link is in the description below okay [20:49] I'm going to start off with just doing a [20:50] little bit of basic luring and I [20:52] actually did this a little bit yesterday [20:54] when we first brought her home but she [20:55] hasn't even been home for 24 hours yet [20:57] and yesterday she really had a hard time [20:59] tracking the food today already this is [21:02] just literally the second time I've done [21:04] this she's like so much better so [21:06] already we're learning good girl oh and [21:08] we offered a little sit again yesterday [21:11] I just played around a little bit with a [21:13] bit of luring with her good girl yes [21:17] good girl that's it good and all of this [21:20] stuff is literally just to condition her [21:23] to prepare her for her training now the [21:25] other thing I like to do when I first [21:26] get puppies home is just work on reward [21:28] ing her for following [21:30] me yes you can use some cute little [21:33] noises to get them [21:34] moving yes good [21:37] girl she says what do you want from me [21:39] lady come on right in here good [21:43] girl [21:47] yay yay good [21:50] girl now you'll notice I'm not really [21:52] using her name yet my my food Bowl's [21:55] gone down um I know I'm not really using [21:58] her name yet because I don't really want [21:59] to chance her not responding so I'm just [22:02] going to work on getting her to perfect [22:04] thank you just going to get her working [22:06] on following me around and being [22:08] rewarded once I have a little bit more [22:10] Focus I could start to add the name back [22:12] into it what's this [22:14] Yer yes good girl one of the biggest [22:18] mistakes that new puppy owners make is [22:20] they're so excited about their new yes [22:22] good girl so um excited about their new [22:24] puppy having a name that they end up [22:26] saying the name over and over and over [22:28] again and then you're it's sort of [22:29] essentially teaching your puppy that [22:30] their name doesn't matter so I'm only [22:33] going to use her name in a scenario [22:34] where I can back it up with rewards in [22:36] the first little bit [22:37] Yer yes good [22:40] girl good girl we haven't even done the [22:44] homework yet where I taught her what Yes [22:46] means I'm just sort of associating it [22:48] yes good girl she's going to figure out [22:50] pretty quickly that yes means good [22:52] rewards are coming but I can [22:54] deliberately teach her what the word yes [22:56] is by doing a little word association [22:58] game [22:59] good girl yes and then fee yes and then [23:04] fee yes and then [23:07] fee yes and then fee you can see she's [23:10] like okay I'm into this game this is [23:11] pretty easy yes good girl and fee and [23:15] when I do this she happens to be sitting [23:17] which is great oops I'm going to get her [23:19] off me here she happens to be sitting [23:21] which was great um but she doesn't need [23:24] to be she just needs to be engaged and [23:25] that's all she's doing now yes good [23:27] girlly [23:29] yes good yes excellent so we've just [23:33] done a few little things and we going to [23:35] do something now just a little bit more [23:36] active and I'm going to make sure I [23:37] leave some stuff in the bowl oh yes good [23:40] girl I'm going to leave some stuff in [23:42] the bowl so that I can also use the food [23:45] as an opportunity to get more uh reward [23:47] and positivity associated with her [23:49] kennel so she'll eat the rest of her [23:51] meal in her crate so I'm going to give [23:54] her the rest of her breakfast I've added [23:55] a little bit of water now you'll notice [23:57] I have another crate over here she's [23:59] going to be moved into that one [24:00] eventually but she's a little bit too [24:02] small for that crate I don't want her [24:03] using one half as a you know potty area [24:06] and the other half is the sleeping area [24:07] so I'm going to see if I can get her to [24:09] go into this crate willingly and if not [24:11] I'm just going to place her in it that's [24:12] something that I will be training in the [24:13] next couple days what's this ready now [24:16] she just slept in there all night so she [24:19] may or may not want to go in oh the door [24:21] almost shut on you okay she's not too [24:23] sure so I'm just going to put her in [24:25] good girl we're going to go have your [24:26] breakfast and uh hope you're going to [24:28] see without throughout the series how [24:30] this is going to change what will start [24:32] to happen is when I get her breakfast [24:33] ready she will eventually start to just [24:35] run in on her own but this is only day [24:37] one good girl here you [24:40] go yeah no no no no you're to stay in [24:43] there stay in there and eat your [24:45] breakfast I'm just going to shut the [24:49] door [24:51] success so some of you may not be able [24:54] to hear me and others you may recognize [24:58] guys this sound and this is where a lot [25:00] of pet puppy owners new pet owners they [25:03] start to get a little bit nervous or [25:05] feel a little sad or feel a little [25:07] guilty because she's in the the crate [25:10] screaming but I know she's had a pee [25:12] she's had training she's had a play [25:14] she's had breakfast all of her needs [25:16] have been met she just doesn't want to [25:18] be in there so I'm just going to let her [25:21] cry it out for a little bit it's only [25:23] her first day home I'm not going to [25:24] discipline it at this point I'm going to [25:26] continue making my breakfast and I'm [25:28] going to to pretend that there's nothing [25:29] going on and once she settles I will let [25:32] her out and see if she has to go to the [25:33] washroom but for now this is just the [25:36] really hard part of crate training so [25:39] you may have seen this in some of our [25:40] past videos but this is probably one of [25:41] our favorite puppy exercises to do this [25:44] hallway has trained many of puppies with [25:46] us and uh one of our favorite things to [25:48] do is some little re recalls to start [25:51] teaching her her name or even a here [25:53] here here command so I've given uh Ken a [25:56] little handful of her breakfast I have a [25:58] little handful of her breakfast as well [26:01] and we're just going to sit on either [26:02] ends of the hallway and we're going to [26:03] call back and forth tire her out a [26:05] little bit and have a really fun way of [26:07] teaching her about coming to us good [26:09] girl you're going to get so much faster [26:10] at this good [26:13] girl so once she eats the food I have [26:16] food here I'm just going to hide it away [26:17] A's going to turn her around Ken's going [26:19] to try and get her attention Ready Set [26:23] Yuki yay what a good girl nice job good [26:29] good job all right okay and then we'll [26:31] turn her around here PE we'll turn her [26:34] around we'll do it again ready you ready [26:36] ready ready set you girl here here here [26:40] here here oh she's an old Pro already [26:42] you can really see the dogs pick up the [26:44] pace really get excited about hearing [26:46] their name when you do exercises like [26:48] this this is a this is just such a great [26:49] way to reinforce the value of coming to [26:51] their name girl it's also really [26:53] important when you do this see how close [26:55] we're feeding her I'm letting her come [26:57] right in okay okay ready set [27:03] youer [27:04] Yay good girl now we didn't make a big [27:07] deal when she didn't respond the first [27:09] time now this is I mean the first time [27:11] we've ever done this exercise with her [27:13] but the one thing I want I wouldn't do [27:15] is call her name over and over again uh [27:17] the next time I need to make sure that I [27:19] have a little bit more Focus before I [27:21] call her name and when kale releases her [27:23] let's try this again [27:26] ready are you girl [27:28] yes good girl we can also sneak that [27:32] little puppy sound recall in there ahead [27:34] of time since that's something that [27:35] she's kind of familiar with already [27:37] because her breeder did that when they [27:38] were feeding good girl wow Missy moo [27:42] come on can give [27:45] your up youer y good girl wow look at [27:50] that enthusiasm here bu [27:55] oh good girl oh that was fun little girl [28:01] good girl so again we're giving the [28:03] puppy some crate time she was just uh [28:06] screaming about 2 seconds ago and um [28:09] what's interesting is from the time it [28:11] took us to turn the camera on versus now [28:13] she's already starting to settle and [28:15] this is what's going to start to happen [28:16] as the days go on she's going to start [28:18] to get better now eventually we're not [28:20] going to allow her to carry on like this [28:22] but this is still such a new learning [28:25] process for her that we're just kind of [28:26] letting her figure it out again and [28:28] she's just had training she just went on [28:30] like a little walk around the outside of [28:31] our property she's you know had a little [28:34] play there's no reason for her to make [28:36] noise except for the fact that she just [28:37] doesn't want to be in the crate um but [28:40] again once she settles it's a great [28:41] opportunity for her just to go in there [28:43] and nap and learn that that's her place [28:44] to kind of chill out it's just like kids [28:47] sometimes puppies get over tired they [28:48] get over stimulated and then they're [28:50] like kind of crabby for a little bit and [28:52] then they sort of settle and she's [28:53] literally almost asleep now so you just [28:55] have to persevere and um it it gets [28:57] better much faster than you really [28:59] realize you just have to use the crate [29:01] and not worry about the [29:05] screaming hi lady come on out come on [29:09] out good good girl so I just got back [29:13] from uh I was away for about a couple [29:15] hours and I had to go get groceries and [29:18] um before I left I put her in her crate [29:20] Ken was working and he was just sort of [29:21] keeping an eye on her but because we did [29:23] so much training and stuff before [29:25] earlier in the morning she literally [29:27] slept this whole time time and I think [29:28] that's an important thing to note [29:30] because I think a lot of people think [29:31] puppies need all of this free time to [29:33] roam around but really what we want you [29:35] to do is spend more um focused time with [29:38] your puppy that actually tires them out [29:41] and also encourages them to learn the [29:43] right things and uh she was more than [29:45] you actually seem a little sleepy still [29:47] um she was more than happy just to you [29:49] know conch out for a couple hours while [29:51] I was gone um so now anyways we're going [29:53] to get her up and get her moving again [29:55] we have to feed her some lunch so I'm [29:56] going to take this as another [29:57] opportunity [29:58] to do some training with her let's go [30:00] outside babes so as I'm putting the [30:02] groceries away I decided that I was just [30:03] going to let her hang out uh here but um [30:06] I'm you know choosing some very specific [30:09] management tools here one she has a [30:11] leash or a line on here this word little [30:12] leash so she can't really go anywhere [30:14] and I've also given her a bone to chew [30:16] now one thing that I'm really impressed [30:17] about is that she's actually choosing to [30:19] chew the bone near me as I do this I [30:22] think that's a really really great thing [30:23] I also know that that's not something [30:25] that she'll naturally do forever puppies [30:27] tend to start to get a bit more [30:28] independent but I keep reaching down and [30:30] telling her she's a good girl I keep [30:32] reinforcing her if she was to get up and [30:34] like go and do her own thing I wouldn't [30:36] allow her to do that I would stop her [30:38] with the line I don't want to be in here [30:39] busy doing groceries and have her sneak [30:42] off and have an accident or chew [30:43] something so if I'm going to choose to [30:45] let her be free out of her crate and [30:47] just sort of hang out it's going to be [30:49] very supervised so I am multitasking [30:51] here groceries are coming out but you [30:54] know I'm I'm mostly looking after um [30:56] after the puppy me good choices here you [30:59] go babe yes good [31:02] girl so it's lunch time and uh I thought [31:06] I would take an opportunity I am going [31:07] to feed some of this of this food she's [31:10] very excited in her crate um but I just [31:13] want to actually work on teaching her [31:14] how to go into the crate now sometimes [31:16] I'm just going to put her in but I'm [31:18] going to take a little bit of time to [31:19] teach her now so that the door doesn't [31:21] scare her at all I've just removed it [31:23] and I'm just going to start off by [31:24] taking some food and just feeding her [31:26] with like her little head in the a crate [31:29] oh some dropped in see if I can put a [31:31] couple in the inside that she'll eat [31:33] here [31:34] look good and then I'm going to [31:37] progressively get the food further in [31:38] until she takes a little step oh good [31:41] girl yes but I'm just going to let her [31:45] come out I'm not going to push her in [31:47] good girl yes when she comes out though [31:49] I'm not going to feed I'm going to keep [31:50] the [31:51] food oh here it is use your sniffer [31:56] here there we go there we go good girl [32:00] I'm not going to feed her out of the [32:01] crate all of the ward is going to be in [32:03] the [32:05] [Music] [32:14] [Music] [32:20] crate good girl it's so tempting just to [32:24] push that last foot in there but you [32:26] don't want to do that just going to be [32:27] patient [32:29] yes there we [32:31] go now what I could also do is like [32:34] Implement a higher value reward at this [32:36] point if I wanted to like when her all [32:37] four feet go in I can throw some cheese [32:39] in there but she's pretty into the [32:41] kibble so I'm just going to roll with it [32:43] now what you'll notice that I did on the [32:45] last repetition yeah she's still in [32:46] there good girl is just as she was [32:49] coming out of the crate I said okay I [32:51] gave her release command eventually [32:53] she's going to need to learn that she's [32:54] got to stay in the crate until I give [32:56] her permission to come out um so I can [32:58] actually start showing her about that [32:59] now by saying okay before she actually [33:02] comes out of the crate herself so she's [33:04] choosing to come out of the crate but [33:05] I'm just starting to um you know [33:08] Implement that release okay yes just [33:11] means you have to have really good [33:12] timing good girl so I would only [33:14] practice this a couple more times I [33:16] might go and do some other training as [33:17] well before she gets too full and then [33:19] I'll feed her the remainder of her crate [33:21] in the crate with the crate door closed [33:23] um with a bit of water on the on the [33:25] food high babe um just to get get her [33:29] accustom there now she's going in so [33:30] much more easily um just to get her [33:32] accustomed to it and at that moment I [33:35] would just place her gently into the [33:36] crate I don't need to go through this [33:38] whole rigar roll every single time [33:40] unless she's going to start to go in a [33:41] little bit more easily but I can't [33:43] expect that to happen after one training [33:44] session good girl I would say this was [33:48] pretty successful for the first try ever [33:50] though I think it's also important to [33:51] remember that the whole day with your [33:53] puppy doesn't need to be so [33:54] action-packed it's really good to get [33:56] training in there it's good to get you [33:58] know um play Play sessions in that's [34:01] going to Tire the puppy out but you also [34:03] need like time to snuggle and time just [34:06] to teach them just to kind of hang out [34:08] she's got a little bone here one of the [34:09] adult bones and uh she thinks it's [34:12] pretty cool have her little line on she [34:14] hang out I'm sitting here checking my [34:16] phone and just sort of spending a little [34:18] time together um if she passes out then [34:21] I'm going to go pop her in the crate and [34:23] get some more work done this puppy's [34:26] been home for just about 20 24 hours at [34:28] this point and she's making some really [34:30] good choices part of the reason behind [34:32] that though is that she's getting good [34:33] information and a lot of management and [34:36] uh in this series you're going to see [34:37] her continue to develop over the next [34:39] couple months we're going to speed up [34:41] this puppy's training by managing her [34:44] well throughout the day and a good [34:45] example of that is what we did earlier [34:47] tonight for her supper rather than just [34:49] feeding her the supper I used it to [34:51] start teaching her to do things like go [34:53] and lie calmly on a bed this is going to [34:55] be really helpful for when we eat dinner [34:57] when people come over she's already on [34:59] the first day learning that going and [35:01] lying on the bed is something that can [35:02] be really rewarding now you can see [35:04] she's still got a bundle of energy right [35:07] now so the next thing that we're going [35:08] to do before we tire her out and and get [35:10] her ready for bed is we're going to [35:12] practice some recalls and some [35:13] retrieving down the hallway it's a great [35:15] way to kind of get that excess energy [35:17] out so by the time we're ready to take [35:19] her up to her crate for the night she's [35:21] got all that energy out and uh she's [35:23] much more likely to sleep through the [35:25] night for us we specifically chose to [35:27] work on exercises that we know are going [35:29] to help us to control her a little bit [35:31] more easily down the road things like [35:33] teaching her to respond to her name [35:35] which is going to be really helpful for [35:36] getting her attention teaching her the [35:38] word yes which is the foundation for [35:40] everything we're basically going to [35:41] teach her getting her comfortable with [35:43] the crate right away which is going to [35:44] be a godsend when we are trying to [35:47] navigate through the next couple weeks [35:48] of this crazy puppy time um but what's [35:51] really important is that you don't wait [35:53] to start this training with your puppy [35:54] you want to get going with it right away [35:56] all of this physical work and mental [35:58] work is really going to help um calm [36:01] your puppy to Tire them out and their [36:04] brains are fully developed by the time [36:06] they are 7 weeks old they are ready to [36:08] learn and we need to make sure that [36:10] we're Jam packing as much good [36:11] information in there now as we can uh to [36:14] ensure success in the long run now you [36:16] know what we didn't do today we didn't [36:18] have to clean up any accidents and we [36:20] didn't have to use any of this stuff oh [36:22] you'd like to bite that wouldn't you now [36:24] the reasons why we were having so much [36:26] success with our house training today is [36:28] because we managed her really well we [36:30] were able to anticipate any possible [36:32] times where she may have had to go to [36:34] the washroom such as after eating naps [36:37] and a really important one is after any [36:39] big plays all that exercise often causes [36:42] them to have to go to the bathroom so if [36:44] you can predict those things and make [36:45] sure that you're staying ahead of it [36:47] you're going to find that you can [36:48] actually get through a large part of [36:50] puppy hood without having any accidents [36:52] in the house in the initial stages of [36:54] bringing yuker home within the first [36:55] couple days we ensured that we kept the [36:58] crate in the same location that we were [36:59] at at all times whether we were in the [37:01] kitchen the living room the bedroom our [37:03] little puppy crate transported around to [37:05] us uh with us wherever we went and the [37:08] reason why we did that is we wanted to [37:09] keep an eye on her we wanted a to work [37:11] on a bit of bonding but also in the [37:13] beginning stages we needed to know [37:15] whether she actually had to go outside [37:16] for a pee or what the issue was so it's [37:18] a really good idea to make sure that you [37:20] keep the clay uh the crate very close to [37:22] you no matter where you are in the first [37:24] couple days they're home there we go [37:28] good [37:30] girl good there's [37:33] more there we go so I'm just going to [37:35] let her eat in here for a little bit [37:37] she's just had a big play though and [37:38] then she's going to have some food so [37:40] once she's sort of eaten and settled for [37:41] a little bit back outside we go feels [37:44] like we go outside a million times a [37:50] day so she's crying in there she [37:53] basically said you just went from doing [37:54] all this stuff with me to putting me in [37:56] a crate again I'm not going to worry [37:58] about this just going to let her cry it [38:00] out for a little bit when she settles [38:02] and figures out that there's food there [38:04] then I'll take her out from there but [38:05] see there she settled right away you [38:07] just have to be patient with the with [38:09] the screaming just this is such a new [38:12] thing for [38:13] her here we go although it's a really [38:15] good tactic to keep the crate near you [38:17] all the time it's not something that you [38:19] want to do forever so as your puppy [38:21] starts to settle into the crate it's a [38:22] really good idea to start teaching them [38:24] that you're not always going to be in [38:26] the same room and you can start things [38:28] like this um in simple situations like [38:30] giving them their meals rather than [38:32] staying in the same room with them as [38:34] they're busy eating away sneak down the [38:36] stairs or sneak into the other room so [38:38] that it's not such a big noticeable [38:40] thing that you're moving away you may [38:41] also choose to you know put them in the [38:43] crate in the kitchen for example and [38:45] then watch TV in the living room have [38:47] them just around the corner you can hear [38:49] them if something's up but you're not [38:50] necessarily together at all times it is [38:53] important that when your puppy goes in [38:54] the crate that they learn to kind of [38:56] just chill out it's their place um there [38:58] also needs to be some separation and [39:00] some Independence created so you don't [39:01] have a dog that gets anxious when they [39:04] can't see you or they're not with you [39:06] when we start to get the dog more [39:07] comfortable being crated in the room [39:09] when we're not there we choose to do [39:11] this at very specific times where we [39:13] know there's a higher rate of success [39:14] bound to happen so for example when we [39:17] first started to Crate her in the room [39:19] uh when we weren't there I would make [39:20] sure that before that I knew she had had [39:23] you know any food that she needed to [39:24] have we did a bit of play we did some [39:26] training so by the time she was going to [39:28] be put in the crate she was tired she's [39:31] worn out from all that stuff and I knew [39:32] she was more likely to nap it's not a [39:34] good idea to put them in the crate when [39:36] they still have a lot of energy because [39:38] they're going to be wondering where you [39:39] are and they're going to be a bit more [39:40] noticeable so take advantage of sleepy [39:43] times or eating times times when you [39:45] know they're going to go in and be a bit [39:46] more calm that's a great time to slip [39:48] into the other room and just spend a [39:50] little bit of time apart for her first [39:51] week home Ken and I tried to make sure [39:53] that we weren't both gone out of the [39:54] house at the same time that way if she [39:56] made any noise we could take her out we [39:58] were here to do so but that's not life [40:00] pretty soon you know we both need to do [40:02] things so the very first time that we [40:04] left her alone we had a bit of a plan uh [40:07] in place before I left her for the first [40:09] time I first put on some music just to [40:11] have a little B background noise and I [40:13] also filled Kong full of delicious [40:15] treats and I gave it to her in the crate [40:17] and before I actually left the house I [40:20] just slipped into our little uh sunro [40:22] area that's just near the door and I [40:24] just waited quietly where she couldn't [40:25] see me and I sat there sort of fiddling [40:28] around on my phone for 5 or 10 minutes [40:30] just to make sure she was settled and I [40:31] would peek at her through the window [40:32] just to make sure she was calm she was [40:34] just so engaged in her toy and her Kong [40:37] that I was able to slip out the door and [40:39] when I came home I also didn't make a [40:41] big deal about coming home I didn't want [40:42] to make her anxious or over excited so I [40:45] came in the door again I peeked at her a [40:47] little bit she's just sort of laying [40:48] there calmly I walked in the house just [40:50] sort of said hello didn't make a big [40:52] deal out of her and then after being [40:53] home for a few moments I went and let [40:55] her out you do want to be careful of [40:57] about when you go and leave that you [40:59] don't make a big deal out of it because [41:00] that actually can sometimes cause [41:02] puppies to get a little bit more [41:03] stressed or anxious you want to be very [41:05] neutral about that and in the early [41:07] stages distract them before you go make [41:10] it you know something that 10 minutes [41:12] before you leave you're sort of starting [41:13] a plan about about leaving to make [41:15] things just a little easier for your [41:17] puppy to handle in UK's first video we [41:19] shared with you a pretty unusual tip [41:20] that we do with our puppies in terms of [41:22] the crate location and that is elevating [41:25] the crate either up on the countertop or [41:27] on our bedside table we do this for a [41:29] couple reasons number one when we first [41:32] brought her home we have other pets and [41:33] animals in the house and we didn't want [41:35] her first experience in the crate to be [41:37] you know swarmed by the other dogs [41:39] wondering who this new puppy was in the [41:40] home so by propping her up on the island [41:42] it allowed her to have a bit of [41:44] Separation she could still see our face [41:46] very easily and the other dogs couldn't [41:48] bother her now in the bedroom we do the [41:50] same thing clearing everything off the [41:52] bedside table and having her up there [41:54] nice and close to us just allows her to [41:56] feel like she's a little close cler it's [41:57] the next best thing to sleeping in the [41:59] bed which she's not going to be doing [42:01] anytime soon being a baby puppy but it [42:03] also allowed me to stick my fingers in [42:05] the crate door to settle her if needed [42:07] and then when she whed I was able to [42:08] hear very easily and then take her [42:10] outside for a pee and we actually let [42:12] them sleep up there for a couple days [42:14] until they're like getting more [42:15] comfortable sleeping throughout the [42:17] night and then we can transfer the crate [42:18] back to the floor but this tactic of [42:20] elevating them can really help settle [42:22] the puppies more quickly and keep some [42:24] of the natural distractions in your [42:26] house away from them making sure that [42:28] they stay a little calmer after the [42:29] first week or so as your puppy starts to [42:31] get more comfortable in the crate you're [42:33] going to want to choose a location in [42:34] your house that's really Central um dogs [42:37] really want to be around you and the [42:39] family but they don't necessarily need [42:40] to be on top of you all day long so pick [42:43] a a general place in your house that [42:45] your family and you are going to be [42:46] passing by on a regular basis for us we [42:49] have an open house and our kitchen is [42:51] sort of the main place we all hang out [42:52] so our puppy's crate is usually in the [42:54] kitchen on the main floor and that way [42:56] we're in and out and walk by her all day [42:58] long we can acknowledge her we can [43:00] ignore her and she just sort of learns [43:01] to chill out as the family goes about [43:04] their day because we move the crates [43:06] around so much in our house we end up [43:08] actually buying more than one crate this [43:10] might be something that makes life a [43:12] little easier for you we typically have [43:13] a crate in the central area of our home [43:16] we have a crate in our bedroom we have a [43:17] crate in our car we have a crate at work [43:19] and this just allows us to Mo move the [43:22] puppy around and always have a place for [43:23] them to go and then it's easy to either [43:25] keep them with you or sep separate them [43:27] depending on what you're doing this is [43:29] actually one of the reasons why we [43:30] really love plastic sided crates they're [43:32] a little cleaner they're easier to move [43:34] around um and I find a lot of dogs are [43:36] actually quite comfortable in them [43:38] because they feel a lot like a den in [43:40] some cases as well if you find your [43:42] puppy isn't settling as much as they [43:43] should you could also cover the crate [43:46] with a blanket or something that sort of [43:48] breaks off of the the vision of your [43:50] puppy sometimes if they can't see all [43:52] that busy stuff and get excited by it [43:54] they're much more likely just to calm [43:56] down and chill out and lie down so [43:58] there's a couple tips that might help [43:59] you with that one of the best ways to [44:01] crate train your puppy is to use the [44:02] crate all day long and I don't mean [44:05] consecutively I just mean in and out the [44:07] crate whenever you need to you know when [44:09] we have a young puppy and they're not [44:10] quite ready to make decisions on their [44:12] own in terms of you know maybe house [44:13] training or chewing um and we have a [44:16] busy day that we have to to tend to [44:18] being able to put them in the crate is [44:20] really important so with the location of [44:21] the crate you want to make sure it's [44:23] somewhere really convenient so if you [44:24] need to run to the bathroom or if you [44:26] want to have a shower you're cooking [44:27] lunch or helping your kids with homework [44:29] these are all really perfect times that [44:31] you can pop your puppy in the crate now [44:33] we don't want the crate to be optional [44:35] for your puppy so we don't recommend [44:37] having the crate door open and just let [44:39] your puppy roam in and out all day long [44:41] when they're young you want to actually [44:43] put them in the crate close the door let [44:45] them chill out for you know a half hour [44:47] a couple minutes an hour couple hours [44:49] whatever happens take them out do [44:51] something with them and then when you're [44:53] finished put them back away and as they [44:55] get older they're obviously going to be [44:57] able to have more um loose time in your [44:59] house but you need to make sure you go [45:00] through the process of training and and [45:02] teaching them how to make good choices [45:04] and one of the best ways to do that is [45:06] to supervise them when they're out of [45:08] the crate so keeping that crate in a [45:10] handy spot where you can just pop them [45:11] in and out all day long is really going [45:13] to make life so much easier for you and [45:15] it's going to be uh making the crate a [45:17] less stressful process for your puppy as [45:19] well many of you mentioned how impressed [45:21] you were that uker was able to sleep [45:23] throughout the night in her crate within [45:25] the first couple days home and I'm going [45:26] to tell you why that went so [45:28] successfully it's not really about the [45:30] nighttime crate training it's about all [45:32] of the time she was spending in her [45:34] crate throughout the day one of the [45:36] biggest mistakes people make in their [45:37] crate training is they only put their [45:39] puppy in the crate at night or when [45:41] they're going to to leave the house and [45:43] some puppies will start to associate you [45:45] put me in that crate you disappear and I [45:47] don't really like going in there so it's [45:50] really important that you're using that [45:51] crate throughout the day to make sure [45:53] that your puppy doesn't see it as you [45:55] leaving them they see it as a place [45:57] where they can go and and chill out if [45:59] you've seen the first couple episodes of [46:00] this series you'll know that uker is [46:02] already doing a pretty great job with [46:03] her training but over the next couple [46:05] weeks we're going to have to overcome a [46:06] lot of these common puppy challenges and [46:08] we're going to show you exactly what we [46:10] do to deal with them so if you're here [46:11] for puppy content make sure you hit that [46:13] like button and let us know typically [46:15] when you take your puppy to a vet you're [46:16] going to start off by doing a little bit [46:18] of a recap or give them some history on [46:20] how things have been going so a couple [46:22] things that you might want to take note [46:23] of in the weeks prior to the vet visit V [46:26] that fun to you gu um would be things [46:30] like how are they eating um how are is [46:32] their energy level um you know anything [46:35] to do physically with their coat type or [46:37] anything like that or their ears or uh [46:40] We've noticed something a bit funky with [46:41] one of her eyes that nothing big but [46:43] that I'm going to mention um how they go [46:46] to the bathroom we brought a stool [46:47] sample as I mentioned before so things [46:49] like that are a good good thing to sort [46:50] of um uh take note of the other thing [46:53] that's important about this is that you [46:54] want to be able to know any changes that [46:56] could happen and you know after this you [46:58] know it's good to sort of get a Baseline [47:00] and then that way as something comes up [47:01] it's a little bit more noticeable to you [47:03] this vet visit is a little different [47:05] than ones that I've done with puppies in [47:06] the past and the fact that I actually [47:07] can't go in with her and uh I will admit [47:11] uh it's a little bit stressful for me [47:13] because I really want to go in but I [47:14] don't want this to be a stressful [47:16] experience for her so take a look at [47:18] some of the things that we've done with [47:19] her all throughout the week to help [47:20] prepare her for today's visit so [47:22] hopefully she's happy she's confident [47:24] and everything goes well at the start of [47:27] every vet appointment that your puppy [47:28] goes to they're going to need to get [47:30] weighed and one of the things that we [47:31] like to do with our puppies in the [47:32] beginning is actually teach them how to [47:34] get on top of the waist scale and sit [47:36] almost like a bit of a trick so you can [47:38] use any item in your house to train this [47:40] it just needs to be a bit of a different [47:42] texture I actually have the lid of a big [47:44] tubberware container that I'm going to [47:46] use today and what you're going to do is [47:48] just start out by taking some treats [47:49] good girl she's already heading in that [47:51] direction and I'm just going to lure her [47:53] on top of it and then into a sitting [47:55] position yes good girl and I'm going to [47:58] reward her several times for holding a [48:01] sit on a loose leash on this little lid [48:04] okay and then I'm going to encourage her [48:05] off and we're going to repeat this [48:06] process a few times okay up up sit yes [48:12] good girl good sit yes good okay good [48:17] girl we try it again okay [48:20] up yes good girl so she's already [48:24] starting to figure out that adding a sit [48:26] on this lid is something that's really [48:28] good hey bab [48:29] whates up yeah there we go okay one more [48:35] time okay ready set [48:39] okay yes good girl you got to get all [48:42] your paws on there there we go yes good [48:44] girl this just makes this experience a [48:46] little bit more user friendly and [48:48] something to give your puppy to look [48:50] forward to you can see she really likes [48:51] to do this that's going to make that [48:53] experience a little bit more interesting [48:55] and fun at the vet visit now I'm hoping [48:57] that when I take her there I can pass [48:59] the vettech a couple treats and have the [49:01] vettech actually do this with her so [49:03] that the experience is going to be a [49:04] little bit more enjoyable for everybody [49:06] involved some puppies are quite nervous [49:09] for their exams and a little skeptical [49:11] of us other puppies are very exuberant [49:15] and jumping all over us this puppy seems [49:17] to be very good so I'm going to check [49:19] her bite we want to make sure that her [49:21] teeth line up well good girl good girl [49:23] good girl when your puppy goes to the [49:25] vet the vet is going to check check [49:27] inside their mouth they're going to look [49:28] at their teeth they're going to look all [49:30] over this can be a pretty difficult [49:31] thing for a young puppy to stay still [49:33] for so I'm going to show you a couple [49:35] exercises that we do to condition the [49:37] puppies to accept this type of thing now [49:39] the first thing that I'm going to do is [49:41] I'm just going to start off with just [49:42] placing my hand underneath her chin to [49:45] stabilize her head a little bit you can [49:46] even take your fingers and tuck them [49:48] underneath the collar as well and I'm [49:50] just going to brace her chin and with my [49:51] other hand if she would stop kissing me [49:54] I'm simply going to place my hand over [49:56] her um snout I'm just going to lift her [49:58] lips for a moment I'm not going to open [50:00] the mouth and go right in there to begin [50:01] with I'm going to start off easy so I'm [50:03] going to brace her chin I'm going to [50:05] lift yes good [50:08] girl and if she is still and comfortable [50:11] I'm going to say yes and then I'm going [50:13] to reward good girl that was excellent [50:15] now remember when we're dog training we [50:17] have to have great timing I need to say [50:19] yes as I'm doing the particular exercise [50:22] and then I can reach for food from there [50:23] it would be really difficult for me to [50:25] be holding food in my hand at this point [50:27] so I have my cookie bin off to the side [50:30] she's going to work for it a little bit [50:31] so I'm going to try that [50:33] again yes good girl so I held a little [50:37] bit longer that time good girl now the [50:40] significance of me holding her in the [50:42] way that I'm doing is I want her to be [50:44] uh secure I want her to feel like I kind [50:46] of have control but I also want to make [50:48] sure that um she's comfortable being [50:50] held in that way because when the vet or [50:52] the vet tech holds your dog they need to [50:54] kind of get their job done and they're [50:56] not going to sort of you know foot [50:58] around it they're going to actually get [50:59] in there and I don't want that [51:01] experience to be something that [51:02] surprises her the very first time all [51:04] right I'm going to move to opening her [51:05] mouth a little bit okay I'm going to [51:07] brace her mouth I'm just going to put my [51:09] fingers in her mouth there to open yes [51:12] good girl so I lift it up with some [51:15] fingers I pushed her her bottom down [51:17] with my [51:19] other yes good girly excellent again I'm [51:23] not going for a long time I'm keeping it [51:25] very short and sweet and as I practice [51:26] rce this for a few more sessions I can [51:28] build on it but I don't want to push it [51:30] past the point where she's going to make [51:31] an error I want to keep it short and [51:32] sweet I mentioned that the fact that the [51:35] vet or Vette Tech is going to have to [51:36] restrain your dog in some way and right [51:38] now we can't necessarily go in with our [51:40] puppies we need to make sure that [51:42] they've uh experienced that type of [51:44] thing before so it's really having [51:46] someone like Sherry who's really good [51:49] withholding to give the puppies a sense [51:51] of security but gentleness [51:54] also these first exams are so important [51:58] now I would venture to say that you [52:00] probably held and hugged your puppy a [52:02] million times at this point um but the [52:05] type of hole that I'm talking about is [52:06] more of the of a restraint it's uh less [52:08] sort of snuggly and more of a type of um [52:11] you know secure hold so I'm going to [52:13] practice that with her right now and I'm [52:15] only going to do it for a moment and if [52:17] she is calm and relaxed I'm going to yes [52:19] and reward where did your bone go we're [52:21] not going to do the bone thing right now [52:22] though so this is actually really good [52:24] I'm actually going to take the fact that [52:25] she wants this bone bone as a bit of a [52:27] an example because there could you know [52:29] when you take her into the Vet she might [52:31] not be wanting to deal with that at this [52:32] point she wants to chew on this bone [52:34] right now so I'm going to work a little [52:35] bit on the restraint so I'm just going [52:37] to pick her up my one hand's going to go [52:38] over top of her um side here my other [52:41] hand I'm going to secure underneath her [52:43] collar underneath her chin here and I'm [52:45] just going to hold her against my body [52:47] good girl well done I'm holding her [52:50] pretty securely now she is being a rock [52:53] star so I need to quit while I'm ahead [52:55] oops I waited too long so I'm just going [52:58] to wait till she [52:59] settles yes excellent good girl and then [53:03] I'm going to reward her excellent now if [53:05] you ever had a second person to help you [53:07] with this they could actually reward as [53:08] you were holding but if you're on your [53:10] own you're just going to do exactly what [53:12] I did I said yes as I was holding and [53:14] then I could place her down gently to [53:16] reward so I'm going to try it again I'm [53:17] going to lift her up again I'm going to [53:18] hold her nice and tight against my [53:21] body yes good [53:24] girl wow Miss mood that was so good and [53:28] as you're practicing you can just hold [53:30] for a little bit longer at a time but [53:32] again watch your Technique you're [53:33] holding in a specific way so they can't [53:35] turn and nip at you and they feel secure [53:37] and comfortable in your arms oh what a [53:40] good girl I want her to sort of be like [53:42] a limp noodle yes we can call this the [53:45] limp noodle test yes good girl she was [53:49] so great with that so I can keep [53:50] building on it and hopefully that will [53:52] be more of a comfortable situation for [53:54] her when the vet does it what exercise [53:55] that we like to teach all of our puppies [53:57] is how to take the food gently and this [53:59] is going to be especially helpful for [54:01] your vet visits because it's likely that [54:03] your puppy could be a little bit [54:04] stressed for their first time and [54:06] sometimes when they're stressed they [54:07] will take the food a little bit more [54:09] rough so you know I want her very [54:11] comfortable taking the food from me so [54:12] that I can work on the training for her [54:14] um for her vet visits but it's likely [54:16] that the vet or the vet tech could be [54:18] giving her some treats as well and I [54:19] want would want her to be gentle with [54:21] them too so here's how we're going to [54:22] work on that you're going to take some [54:24] food and you can see she is super keen [54:25] on it right now I have some pretty high [54:27] value treats I'm going to put a piece of [54:29] food in my hand and I'm going to cover [54:30] it whoops before I give it to here I'm [54:32] going to cover it with my thumb and I'm [54:34] just going to offer my hand to her and [54:36] if she sniffs and licks uh she was not [54:39] very gentle there she tried to bite it [54:41] from my hand I just gave a light verbal [54:42] and took my hand away and I'm going to [54:44] try it again hey Bub yes good girl she [54:48] was a little bit more gentle that time [54:50] yes good I'm getting licking [54:53] now [54:55] oops Yeah yes good [54:58] girl [55:00] oops yes good girl so you can use [55:03] whatever verbal that you want you could [55:05] use something light like oops and you're [55:06] going to take your hand away and then [55:07] you're going to try it again and I want [55:09] you just to make sure that you're only [55:11] rewarding behaviors that you like [55:12] sniffing licking if they try to take it [55:15] from you gently all of that is [55:16] acceptable but if they start to jump at [55:18] you or use their teeth a little bit too [55:20] rough maybe they start to pot you you [55:22] can remove the food it does not take the [55:24] puppies very long to figure out what typ [55:26] types of behavior you ask a girl earns [55:28] the rewards and what types of behaviors [55:30] cause the rewards to disappear and [55:32] having your dog be able to take the food [55:34] gently is going to really allow you to [55:35] practice the different exercises and [55:37] it's going to help you with all of your [55:38] training in general next I'm going to [55:40] work a little bit on conditioning you [55:42] could to be comfortable with her ears [55:43] being examined and one of the tricks [55:45] that I like to do when I'm first [55:46] starting this to keep both of my hands [55:48] free is get her chewing on some type of [55:50] bone now she normally likes to chew on [55:52] this bone but I'm going to make it extra [55:53] appealing by just rubbing a little piece [55:55] of chicken and hot dog wiener here on [55:57] this so that it keeps her even more [55:59] engaged hey babe what's this oh check [56:02] that out this is going to give me both [56:04] my hands free and while she's sort of [56:06] investigating and she's distracted I can [56:08] practice just flipping her ears back and [56:10] taking a good look inside now we pet our [56:13] puppy ears all of the time that's normal [56:15] but what the vet's going to do is [56:16] they're going to really examine it so [56:18] I'm touching gently but I'm also being [56:19] quite deliberate so I'm going to flip it [56:21] back we want to get the dog very [56:23] comfortable with somebody leaning over [56:25] top of them when they practice this you [56:26] know the vet's going to look right [56:28] inside and make sure it's nice and clean [56:30] um the other thing they're going to do [56:32] is use a tool to look inside your dog's [56:34] ear as well and a really good uh item to [56:36] practice this is just like a metal spoon [56:39] it's not going to hurt your dog in any [56:40] way but it just sort of feels a little [56:41] bit funny so I can flip her ear back and [56:44] I could just literally touch her ear [56:45] with that metal spoon again she's so [56:48] focused on this bone that she could [56:50] really care less about what's happening [56:52] now as your dog starts to get more [56:54] comfortable you could make more [56:55] progression so you know you could ask [56:58] your vet to use some type of distraction [57:00] during that time but sometimes they just [57:01] want to get things done so I'm going to [57:03] remove this bone from her here and I'm [57:06] going to see if she'll allow me to do [57:07] this without a bit of a distraction I'm [57:09] going to go back to that brace that I [57:11] talked about by just holding her head [57:12] nice and comfortable and still I'm just [57:14] going to take her ear and flip it back [57:17] yes excellent wow that was so good [57:20] sweetheart I want to just get a dog [57:22] that's comfortable and still you can see [57:24] as I flip it back not not only is she [57:26] being comfortable and and okay with me [57:28] doing it she's also being still and this [57:31] is really important good [57:33] girl yes excellent good girl now I'm [57:37] going to try holding the spoon up to it [57:39] good [57:40] girl yes excellent and I'm just pausing [57:44] for a second cuz I'm looking for her to [57:46] be calm if at any time she starts to get [57:48] uncomfortable or she starts to get a [57:50] little bit silly I could calm her by [57:52] holding her once again or I could go [57:54] back to a step that she is more [57:56] confident with and then work my way up [57:58] from there think out here somebody else [58:01] walk here she [58:03] says [58:09] [Applause] [58:11] think [58:13] good so good I think overall uker did [58:17] very well at her very first vet visit [58:19] but as I was watching the footage back I [58:21] started to realize that she's still [58:22] struggling a little bit with other [58:24] people holding her I noticed that she [58:26] was still a little bit Wiggly she wasn't [58:27] afraid she was just being a bit of a [58:29] wild child so I know I'm going to need [58:31] to put in some extra effort in getting [58:33] her comfortable being calm and still [58:35] when somebody else is holding her so [58:37] that's definitely going to be part of [58:38] our homework let's start first with [58:40] talking about puppy potty training now [58:42] at this point after a month of your [58:44] puppy being home you should be at the [58:45] point where your puppy is no longer [58:47] having accidents in your house and they [58:49] also should be well on their way to [58:50] asking you when they have to go outside [58:52] as well now we've had pretty good [58:54] success with uker in this department she [58:56] has had a few accidents along the way [58:58] but uh both times that she had her [59:00] accidents it was because I wasn't quick [59:02] enough to let her outside and um one of [59:05] the things that we've been really [59:06] focusing on with her is understanding [59:08] her daily potty schedule so that we can [59:10] anticipate when she might have to go out [59:13] um there's also been a few times where [59:15] we have purposely not let her out to [59:17] kind of put her in a situation where she [59:19] had to indicate to go outside and her [59:21] response was to go to the door get a [59:24] little bit disconnected it gave us an [59:25] opportunity to say do you have to go [59:27] outside and then go through the process [59:29] of taking her once we showed her that a [59:31] few times she was able to indicate on [59:33] her own to us when she needed to go out [59:35] but knowing your puppy schedule and [59:37] having a better idea of you know when [59:39] they normally have to go throughout the [59:41] day and with that also making sure that [59:43] you're being really good at supervising [59:45] them is really going to allow you to [59:46] have success with this we actually have [59:48] a video specifically on how to teach [59:50] your puppy how to let you know that they [59:52] have to go outside you can find that in [59:54] the description below we are having a [59:55] lot lot of success so far with her even [59:57] just after one month of having her home [59:59] but that doesn't mean that we trust her [60:01] completely when we're not able to [60:03] supervise her we're still going to use [60:04] all the tools that we have to ensure [60:06] that she's not sliding backwards in her [60:08] progress things like utilizing the crate [60:10] when we can't pay attention or we have [60:12] baby gates that we put out so that she [60:14] can't sneak into the other room and have [60:15] an accident she's also always on her [60:17] house line to ensure that we can get [60:19] control and get her outside when we need [60:21] to so it's really important that even [60:23] when things start to go successfully [60:25] that you don't just let your guard down [60:26] and get to relax too quickly because [60:28] it's very easy for puppies to slide [60:30] backwards in their progress so make sure [60:32] you're maintaining good criteria you [60:34] keep that supervision up and then you're [60:36] still really working towards teaching [60:38] them to ask you to go outside now in [60:40] terms of the crate it's something that [60:41] she's learned to be comfortable in right [60:42] from the beginning because it's [60:44] something that we use right from the [60:45] first day that she's come home now a [60:47] couple of the things okay a couple of [60:48] the things that we've done to encourage [60:50] her to be comfortable in her crate is [60:52] keep it in a place that's really Central [60:53] in her home so she never feels [60:55] segregated she's always sort of sees us [60:57] walking around we've also used it a lot [60:59] throughout the day you know we try to [61:01] spend as much time training with her and [61:03] spending you know um time out of the [61:05] crate as we can but we both live really [61:06] busy lives so she has to get used to [61:09] spending time in her crate for a long [61:11] period so it's important that from the [61:12] beginning we don't make that a big deal [61:14] we just put her in after she's had ample [61:16] exercise after she's had a lot of [61:18] training and then just let her learn to [61:20] just chill out and be calm sometimes she [61:22] can be a wild woman in there and she'll [61:24] play with her toys and entertain herself [61:26] which is fine but she knows that it's [61:27] her place to kind of go and chill out [61:29] and it's something that we're going to [61:30] utilize for months and months and months [61:32] now in the first couple days of having [61:34] her home in terms of her crate training [61:35] we did let her out when she would make [61:37] some noise in her crate we were still [61:38] trying to work out her potty schedule [61:40] and figure out what exactly she wanted [61:42] but as time went on and we got a better [61:43] sense of her schedule um we did have to [61:46] work through a little bit of barking she [61:47] did go through a bit of a defiant uh [61:49] stage where if she just wanted to be out [61:51] playing or if she would see one of us [61:52] leave the house she would want to bark [61:54] and we would just work through that [61:56] individually until she understood that [61:58] you know when you go in your crate you [61:59] just need to learn to chill out one of [62:01] the things that can be helpful though is [62:03] making sure that before we would put her [62:04] into the crate for an extended period of [62:06] time she was tired she'd had lots of [62:08] exercise she'd had some training and um [62:11] sometimes she'd go in she'd fuss for a [62:12] couple minutes because she didn't want [62:14] the fund to end and then she would [62:16] finally realize that she was tired and [62:17] then she'd be out for a nap giving us a [62:19] few more hours to get some work done and [62:21] the second question we get asked a lot [62:23] is how much time should my puppy be [62:24] spending in their crate and we really [62:26] want you to think about you know quality [62:29] time together over quantity she spends [62:31] far more time in her crate than she does [62:33] spend out of her crate unfortunately but [62:35] one of the reasons why that happens is [62:37] she doesn't have all of her training [62:38] done yet and she can't be trusted you [62:41] know being loose in my house she still [62:43] wants to chew on things um she still [62:45] wants to jump up on the counter [62:47] sometimes she's a puppy and she's going [62:48] to make poor choices so I look at it [62:50] this way when she's out of her crate I [62:52] make sure that she has quality attention [62:54] from me we're training you know she's [62:56] playing around in the kitchen I'm paying [62:58] attention to her I'm making sure she's [63:00] getting lots of exercise throughout the [63:01] day so that when it is time to go on her [63:03] crate I don't feel guilty about putting [63:05] her in there and as her training starts [63:07] to come along and she can learn things [63:09] like go and lie down on your bed or oh [63:12] hi or you know not to jump up or she [63:14] starts to make better choices around the [63:16] house her crate time will slowly become [63:18] less and less and less but you don't [63:19] want to be giving that freedom to your [63:21] puppy too early before their training is [63:23] done so just make sure that the time [63:24] that they're out of their crate you're [63:26] giving quality attention you're really [63:28] doing as much as you can so that when [63:29] they're in the crpe you don't feel so [63:31] bad now where should your expectations [63:32] be in terms of training at that one [63:35] month Mark now when we're doing our [63:37] training especially in the first month [63:39] and the initial training of all of the [63:40] the exercises that we do we build on [63:43] motivation we motivate the dog to do [63:45] things they learn to do things you know [63:47] fun and and properly when they're doing [63:50] things from the beginning but I will [63:52] tell you something that we've struggled [63:53] with this puppy is that she's not super [63:56] motivated here but to work for food and [63:58] this is something that has been a major [64:00] challenge um so we've had to be pretty [64:03] strategic with uh with our food rewards [64:05] we've had to take uh and learn certain [64:07] times of the day that she's been you [64:08] know a little bit more eager to work for [64:10] food and they haven't always been uh [64:12] times that I would have anticipated um [64:15] and then we've also had to try a whole [64:16] bunch of different types of food in the [64:18] past I've been able to feed um you know [64:20] just kibble at home with my puppies to [64:22] get them to work but for her she's not [64:24] interested in kibble she's will eat it [64:26] for her breakfast but after that she's [64:28] just not interested now one of the [64:30] things that we've really learned uh with [64:31] this puppy is that she loves to play [64:33] with toys so I've utilized a toy as a [64:36] reward for a lot of our training so I'll [64:38] show you a couple of things that I've [64:39] been doing with our toy oh I have a [64:41] little frisbee here so once I've trained [64:43] her to sit I can actually use it as the [64:45] reward sit yes get it good girl so if [64:48] she sits that means the game is going to [64:50] start once again good girl sit yes okay [64:53] get it yay good girl girl now what I've [64:57] had a lot of fun with with this puppy [64:58] being a border col she's super energetic [65:00] I've also started to use it to teach her [65:02] little of impulse control so now sit [65:06] good o that was a good one sit sit good [65:10] girl good sit okay yay good girl so I [65:14] teach her even though I'm waving that [65:15] frisbee around in front of you you have [65:17] to maintain good um um control good girl [65:22] out yes excellent so you can see the [65:26] engagement and the intensity I'm getting [65:28] through listening because I'm using [65:29] something that oops that she yes that's [65:32] a good girl that she truly wants so you [65:35] have to figure out what makes your dog [65:36] tick now I can't oh that's very nice [65:38] good girl I can't use a a toy for every [65:41] single thing that I want to teach but I [65:43] can at least start working on the [65:45] process of her learning to listen and [65:46] stay focused especially around [65:48] distractions now what should you expect [65:50] from your puppy within that first month [65:52] of having them home well I would [65:53] recommend that you start on all of the [65:55] Bas Basics you know things like teaching [65:57] them to sit and down and maybe at the [65:59] one month point you could work towards [66:01] having them hold that position for a [66:02] longer period of time until being [66:04] released like you saw uker do I would [66:06] also be working a lot on teaching them [66:08] how to respond to their name around [66:09] distractions you don't necessarily need [66:11] to put them in a distracting environment [66:13] but create distractions around you you [66:15] know sometimes when I'm practicing I'll [66:16] grab some of her toys off of the uh [66:18] crate and I'll spread them around the [66:20] floor and I'll work with more [66:21] distractions around even though I'm not [66:23] changing the location I'm making the [66:25] environment around her a little bit more [66:27] challenging you might work on some [66:29] calming exercises like teaching them a [66:31] weit or an on your bed exercise so that [66:34] you can utilize that when they're out of [66:35] their crate instead of you know having [66:37] to put them away all the time um things [66:39] that are going to allow you to control [66:41] the puppy a little bit more easily is [66:43] where your focus should be and then [66:45] don't forget about the fun stuff as well [66:46] you know something that we work every [66:48] single day would be you know stationary [66:50] exercises like sit down uh wait on your [66:54] bed um we work on motion exercises like [66:57] teaching her her recall to come to me to [67:00] come close so that I can gain control we [67:02] work weekly sometimes daily on our [67:04] handling exercises so that I can more [67:06] easily clip her toenails um and then [67:08] last but not least the fun stuff is [67:10] tricks you know we try to work on tricks [67:12] you know a little bit every day if we [67:13] can it helps keep her both mentally and [67:16] physically stimulated which means more [67:19] resting for me in between our training [67:21] sessions it also teaches her that [67:23] listening and learning um with me and [67:25] and doing things for me is a lot of fun [67:27] it's motivating and the more I can teach [67:29] her about that the easier it is going to [67:31] be to teach her more serious things like [67:33] how to walk on a loose leash you know [67:35] when we're out in the public so make [67:37] sure that you're taking little time [67:38] every day to work on lots of different [67:40] aspects of your training because it [67:41] makes a big difference when it all comes [67:43] together at the end next let's talk a [67:45] little bit about chewing nipping and [67:46] biting now I will tell you that of a lot [67:49] of the puppies that I've had in the past [67:51] this puppy loves to chew and it's been [67:54] something that we've really had to have [67:56] close supervision on she's chewing her [67:58] house line right now um we've had to [68:00] make sure that we're really paying close [68:02] attention to her because she loves to [68:04] put things in her mouth so it's very [68:06] important that she has access to toys at [68:09] all times and toys that are going to be [68:11] safe for her to chew if she was to have [68:13] things like stuffed animals or Rope toys [68:15] she would have those ripped apart in [68:17] about 2 seconds flat the squeakies would [68:19] be out so when we're giving her toys to [68:20] play with she does have toys access to [68:22] toys all the times but she'll have [68:24] things like Che bones or things like [68:26] Kong with cheese inside or um anything [68:28] that if she was to lie down and chew on [68:30] it she wouldn't be able to rip apart or [68:32] wreck and um this is really important [68:34] because it's allowed us to redirect her [68:35] to those items instead of the things [68:37] that she's curious about chewing things [68:39] like Amazon boxes or the toilet paper [68:41] roll or the tea towel hanging from the [68:44] uh from the stove these are all things [68:46] that she's really investigated in just [68:48] like any other puppy um but having a [68:50] house line on has been instrumental in [68:52] our ability to redirect her and teach [68:54] her that those those choices are just [68:56] not on the table and then of course if [68:58] we're multitasking and we need a little [69:00] bit of time to focus on what we're doing [69:03] we would just happily put her in the [69:04] crate and in the crate she has those [69:06] things to chew as well so whenever she [69:08] feels like playing she has something to [69:10] do that with now in terms of nipping and [69:12] biting thankfully that's something that [69:14] we haven't really had to deal a lot with [69:16] and um there's a specific reason why [69:18] from the get-go we have been very strict [69:20] about whether she's allowed to put her [69:22] mouth on our clothes or on her skin and [69:24] that's always been a major no no that [69:26] was something that we implemented with [69:28] the rules right from the beginning but [69:30] you know because we've done so much [69:32] training and control we manage her well [69:35] she really views us as strong leaders [69:37] and because she understands where the [69:38] relationship lies she's just not that [69:41] interested in using her mouth now has [69:42] she tried it in the past yep she's tried [69:44] to choose oh did you like that sound [69:46] she's likeed to chew um you know on my [69:48] on my shirt sleeve or my fuzzy boots and [69:52] uh again redirection using the line and [69:54] uh stopping her from doing that has been [69:56] really helpful but utilizing her [69:58] training utilizing her response to name [70:00] leave it sit you know really controlling [70:02] her and teaching her what to do rather [70:04] than having to correct her for things [70:06] that she shouldn't be doing what a lot [70:08] of people don't realize is that [70:09] overnight potty training actually starts [70:11] earlier in the night there's certain [70:12] things that you can do in the evening in [70:14] the late evening that's going to set [70:16] yourself up for Success overnight that [70:18] first one is going to be sort of your [70:20] evening prep now one of the most [70:21] important things is to make sure that [70:23] your puppy goes to sleep with an empty [70:25] deep bladder and there's a couple things [70:26] that you can do to ensure this happens [70:28] number one is think about limiting their [70:30] access to water after a certain time now [70:32] everybody's going to be different [70:34] depending on what the uh time they go to [70:35] bed but for us we stopped letting her [70:38] have access to water about after 8:00 [70:40] p.

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 83/468,or so and that way we knew that she [70:42] didn't have any uh water left in her [70:43] bladder when she went to the bathroom [70:45] she'd be pretty empty along with water [70:47] we're also going to change or limit the [70:49] access to food and when we feed her now [70:52] it's pretty common for me to train [70:54] pretty late into the evening so when I [70:56] do that I'll only give her a limited [70:58] amount of food and then I try to choose [71:01] to use maybe a toy reward in the late [71:02] evening instead of food so that I'm not [71:04] giving her a bunch of extra stuff and [71:06] then we try to make sure that um she has [71:08] a poop before we take her to her crate [71:10] for the night let's talk a little bit [71:12] about poop dog poo specifically and it's [71:15] actually a subject I know quite a bit [71:16] about because I've gotten pretty good at [71:18] getting my dogs to go to the bathroom [71:20] before bedtime which means I get a nice [71:22] long sleep now there's a trick to [71:24] getting your dog to go to the bathroom [71:26] and one of the most helpful things that [71:27] you can do is get your puppy to be [71:30] active one of the things that I like to [71:32] do um later in the night with my [71:34] training and using that toy is she's [71:36] more energetic I'll either play a little [71:38] fetch a little tug OFW or sometimes I'll [71:40] just take her for a little romp around [71:42] the outside of the uh property just to [71:44] loosen things up and she's far more [71:46] likely to go to the bathroom and often [71:48] if I take her outside and she doesn't go [71:50] I find if I just walk her around for a [71:52] little while before I know it she's uh [71:54] she's gone to the bathroom and that way [71:55] I know that throughout the night she's [71:57] empty and it's very unlikely she's going [71:59] to ask to uh to go out again I have a [72:02] really important question and it could [72:03] change everything in terms of your [72:05] overnight potty training do you know [72:07] your puppy's potty schedule at this [72:09] point now this is something that took us [72:11] a few weeks to figure out with uker one [72:13] of the things that we discovered is that [72:15] I'm going to talk about poop again but [72:17] she's a double pooper in the morning I [72:19] found that I would take her outside [72:20] she'd have her normal pee her normal [72:22] poop and I would think woohoo we're [72:24] ready to start the day and within an [72:26] hour or so she would be looking for a [72:28] place to go to the washroom once again [72:30] and so I actually learned over time that [72:32] there was certain times of day that she [72:34] is much more likely to go to go to the [72:36] washroom um and that allowed me to [72:38] ensure that those um times those points [72:40] had been met before we went to bed at [72:43] night it's very common for her to have [72:45] to go one more time before we go to bed [72:47] so if it's getting close to bedtime and [72:49] I know she still hasn't had her her [72:51] evening poop I'll go through some of [72:53] those things on the list I mentioned [72:55] earlier about you know doing a bit of [72:57] training with her maybe doing a bit of [72:59] exercise taking her for a walk get those [73:01] things moving so that she actually does [73:03] follow her schedule which makes [73:05] overnight much easier for both of us [73:07] we've talked a lot in our previous potty [73:09] training videos about common times where [73:10] they do have to go things like coming [73:13] out of their crate or after they had a [73:14] big nap or after they had a lot of play [73:16] we want to take advantage of those [73:18] opportunities and use it to help us make [73:20] an overnight potty training plan a lot [73:22] of people think they have to set an [73:24] alarm overnight and get up several times [73:26] to let your puppy outside but I'm very [73:28] happy to say that you don't actually [73:29] have to do that you have an alarm system [73:31] built in right here and um we would [73:34] recommend that you keep your puppy's [73:36] crate nearby where you're sleeping so [73:38] that if they do stir you can hear them [73:41] and then get up and take them out now [73:43] with a lot of the other tips that we're [73:44] going to be mentioning in this video [73:45] hopefully you're going to be able to [73:46] find that even within the first couple [73:48] nights your puppy will sleep for a long [73:50] time um she did whimper a little bit the [73:53] first couple nights that she was home [73:54] but it wasn't until early in the morning [73:57] that we had to get up and I heard her [73:59] stir got up let her out and and dealt [74:01] with it at that point um but they going [74:03] there's going to be a time when you [74:05] don't want that to become the routine [74:07] now eventually we pushed our 6-hour time [74:10] frame to she sleeps about 8 hours a [74:12] night which is pretty great so the way [74:14] that we did that is you know after a few [74:16] days of getting up at 6:00 a.

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 85/468,"to let [74:18] her go to the washroom we would then [74:20] push it 5 or 10 minutes I might let her [74:22] whimper a little bit I might just bang [74:25] her crate a little bit and tell her [74:26] quiet settle wait a few minutes for her [74:28] to settle and then I would let her up [74:30] and and take her outside to go potty um [74:32] and each day I start of push it a bit [74:34] more and I think after the second day [74:35] she fell right back asleep for another [74:37] hour or so so it was a pretty easy [74:39] transition but it's much easier for me [74:41] to feel less guilty about letting her [74:43] outside if I know that before she went [74:45] to bed she fully went to the bathroom [74:48] she had good exercise you know I I know [74:50] that I've set her up for Success so I [74:52] feel less guilty about letting her out [74:54] all througho the night she learns to [74:56] have a a long good night sleep and so do [74:58] I now if you do have to get up in the [75:00] middle of the night to have your dog go [75:02] potty it's really important that when [75:04] you take them out that you make sure [75:05] it's all business and no pleasure so if [75:08] you come out and your puppies are [75:09] running around and being you know having [75:11] a bit of a party just keep the leash a [75:13] little bit shorter just encourage them [75:15] to hurry up we often suggest teaching [75:17] our puppies to go to the bathroom on [75:19] command I'll often tell her hurry up [75:21] hurry up hurry up and then encourage her [75:23] to go from there if she's not going [75:25] within a minute or so I'm just going to [75:26] take her back inside and put her back in [75:28] her crate before we try it again but if [75:30] we come out and then we do a little play [75:32] we make it a bit of a game I don't want [75:33] her waking me up in the middle of the [75:35] night so that we can go outside and have [75:36] a little party together so make sure [75:38] it's all business no pleasure get the [75:40] job done back inside back to bed I'm [75:43] talking a lot about structure with our [75:45] puppies but looking down the road a [75:47] little bit there's certain things that [75:49] um you might not need to worry about as [75:51] your puppy gets a little bit older [75:52] things like restricting water throughout [75:54] the night night or um you know not [75:56] feeding or playing with them at a [75:57] certain time of the evening as your [75:59] puppy gets a little bit older they are [76:01] going to learn how to self-regulate and [76:02] one of the ways that you're going to [76:04] know that you're ready to kind of loosen [76:06] the rules a little bit is you know is [76:08] your puppy successfully making it [76:10] overnight every single night without [76:12] asking to go outside or without having [76:13] any issues um you know are they [76:15] typically doing well with their house [76:17] training during the day as well do they [76:19] understand to hold it or to ask you to [76:21] go outside um do they understand not to [76:23] have accidents in their crate um can [76:26] they spend a long time in their crate [76:28] without needing to go outside these [76:29] things are all going to slowly start to [76:32] come together for you and at that point [76:34] you can start to decide whether you want [76:36] to be a little bit more relaxed with [76:37] some of those rules and structure here [76:39] in our training facility we've help more [76:41] than a 100,000 dog owners to overcome [76:42] the same dog training challenges that [76:44] you have so if this is your first time [76:46] on the channel make sure you hit that [76:47] subscribe button so that we can help you [76:49] to have a well- behaved four-legged [76:50] family member kale and I were just going [76:52] for a walk around the property with some [76:54] of our dogs and we talking about the [76:55] series that we're currently doing here [76:57] on YouTube with our puppy uker and it [76:59] reminded me of my first puppy and all of [77:02] the mistakes that I'd made and when I [77:04] learned these four rules that we're [77:05] about to talk about how uh I could apply [77:08] them to every single skill I was working [77:09] on and you're going to see in each one [77:11] of our videos that we're applying these [77:13] four rules to our puppy training so [77:15] let's get to the first rule now the [77:17] first rule we need to talk about is [77:19] don't overwhelm your dog with challenges [77:21] it's something that so many people do [77:23] it's definitely something that I did and [77:26] you won't see you don't see little uker [77:28] out here with us on our walks with our [77:29] other dogs because she is so interested [77:32] in these dogs that there's no chance [77:34] that she could be successful if we were [77:36] going to try to work with on something [77:37] like response to name not pulling on [77:40] leash these things just wouldn't happen [77:42] let's talk a little bit about what [77:43] you've done instead of taking uker on [77:45] these walks uh to to make sure that she [77:47] can be successful and so that she'll [77:49] still listen yeah so I you know before [77:50] we put her in this scenario we want to [77:52] sort of teach her first what she's [77:53] supposed to do so so independently on [77:56] her own I have been working you know [77:58] bringing her out here um on a long line [78:00] with her favorite toys her favorite [78:02] treats and working on teaching her to [78:04] respond to her name and making it very [78:05] valuable to listen to me um and I've [78:08] actually progressed to being able to [78:09] take her for a walk with one other dog a [78:12] boring old dog like funky monkey who [78:14] doesn't really care too much about the [78:15] puppy so um it's less distracting for [78:17] her which means it's you know a little [78:19] bit more distracting for the pup for [78:20] uker but she still has an opportunity to [78:23] be successful and if she's not I can [78:25] control the environment and help her to [78:28] be right and as she starts to show me [78:30] that she knows what to do and that she [78:32] can be a good listener then we're going [78:34] to give her more and more opportunity [78:35] and we would love for her to be able to [78:37] walk with her other dogs and have [78:38] everybody come all together but we what [78:40] we don't want to do is sacrifice our [78:42] training and do all of this hard work to [78:44] teach her to have a a Rel reliable [78:46] recall and to listen to us and then put [78:48] her in a scenario where she thinks okay [78:50] well I have to I can listen in the [78:51] kitchen but when I go for a walk on the [78:53] property I just get to be hel in and do [78:55] my own thing so we're uh taking the [78:57] necessary steps by controlling it to [78:59] help her to be successful and learn to [79:01] do it the right way in the last clip you [79:02] may have seen kale using a long line and [79:04] that's exactly why we've created our own [79:06] 21 ft outdoor biothane long line now [79:11] this long line comes in both 1/ in and [79:13] 3/8 for your larger and smaller breed [79:15] dogs these things are waterproof and [79:17] absolutely amazing if you want one of [79:19] these for you and your four-legged [79:20] family member check out Mand do."

to have to [79:27] figure out on your own but you're [79:29] definitely going to want to start at the [79:30] easiest level so for example uh kale has [79:33] spent some time in the kitchen working [79:35] with uker and Funky Monkey in a very [79:37] controlled situation remember your dog [79:39] is going to do whatever they find [79:41] rewarding so if we were to bring uker [79:43] out here with all these dogs running [79:44] around she would find it very rewarding [79:46] to chase after those dogs to not pay [79:48] attention to us because you know what [79:50] can we what's what can we possibly offer [79:52] her that's better than chasing the dog [79:53] so going to show roll a clip right now [79:56] of kale training uker around funky [79:58] monkey and really insisting on getting [80:00] some some attention really showing uker [80:02] that Kale's quite valuable there's value [80:04] in paying attention to her when there's [80:07] another dog around and that's a really [80:08] important starting point for any puppy [80:11] so how does this apply to you now kale [80:13] mentioned uh we've talked a little bit [80:14] in the past about finding finding [80:16] friends there's a dirty or family [80:18] members nice jump buddy who might have a [80:20] dog and let's talk a little bit about [80:21] maybe choosing the right dog for you to [80:23] work on with your puppy yeah know having [80:25] your your young dog around other dogs is [80:26] really great for socialization as long [80:28] as it's in a controlled manner so if you [80:30] do have friends or family that have a [80:32] pretty chill dog or a dog that has had [80:33] some training that's definitely going to [80:35] make your life with your untrained puppy [80:37] a little easier but if you don't have [80:39] access to that because lots of people [80:40] don't and you know you do you just keep [80:43] going to keep making interance um and [80:45] you do have uh if you don't have access [80:47] to that the other thing you could do is [80:49] you know go to a local place that has [80:52] you know maybe some dogs or kids at a [80:54] park whatever and um utilize the 3DS so [80:57] distance duration distraction those [80:59] three things typically you can always [81:02] control so maybe you go to the park and [81:04] instead of going right up to where all [81:05] the other dogs are you try to get some [81:08] control at a distance so your dog can [81:10] see all that other action but at a [81:12] distance where your dog is at a [81:14] threshold where they can be successful [81:16] and then slowly go forward or maybe the [81:19] level of distraction maybe you go when [81:21] there's like only a few kids playing [81:22] versus like in the afternoon on a [81:24] Saturday when like everybody and their [81:26] brother is at is at the park um and then [81:28] duration don't overwhelm yourself you [81:30] always want to start small short short [81:33] little increments of success and then [81:35] pull the plug while it's going great [81:37] sometimes people just do things too long [81:39] and it starts off well and then it [81:41] starts to fizzle out because we worked [81:42] the the puppies um a little bit too long [81:45] so short and sweet so distance duration [81:47] and distraction distraction the three [81:49] big on rule number two don't overuse [81:52] your commands this is definitely [81:54] something I did with my first puppy I'd [81:56] be calling her and calling her and she [81:58] wouldn't be coming in or you know she'd [82:00] be in some other room in the house and [82:01] I'm asking her to come with me and it [82:04] just wasn't happening but it can really [82:06] have a a damaging effect on your dog's [82:08] training as well as your relationship [82:10] let's talk a little bit about what [82:11] follow through means following through [82:13] means yeah I think um people often over [82:16] overuse commands before they've actually [82:18] really taken the time to teach the dog [82:20] how to respond to the command and I [82:21] think some people are really surprised [82:23] at how many repetitions you you actually [82:24] need to take it before a command can [82:27] really be just used in everyday life [82:29] without any teaching involved with it [82:31] things like recall or um their name is a [82:34] big one a lot of people overuse dogs [82:36] names and then it just sort of gets [82:38] watered down over time because the dog [82:40] hears it so much that they don't really [82:42] think they have to react to it all of [82:44] the time so you want to try to make sure [82:46] that especially when you have a young [82:47] dog in training regardless of whether [82:49] they're a puppy or or even an older dog [82:52] that um that you don't use [82:55] commands unless you're ready to sort of [82:56] follow through and and make sure they [82:58] happen and that follow through could be [83:00] in the teaching phase maybe associating [83:02] their name with using some treats to get [83:04] your dog's attention or um with uker one [83:07] thing that we talk about a lot in our [83:08] puppy series is that she's not super uh [83:11] food motivated but thank goodness she [83:13] loves a toy so we would often say her [83:15] name and then I'd run away dangling a [83:17] toy to get her a little bit more um [83:19] motivated to hear that word and then [83:21] want to respond um and then from there [83:24] know when they get a little bit more [83:25] trained and a little bit more reliable [83:27] you need to be prepared for when you [83:29] call their name or ask them to do [83:30] something and they decide that sniffing [83:33] the floor or barking at the neighbor's [83:34] dog is more important than listening to [83:36] you that you have a way of actually [83:38] following through because that's where [83:39] people start to repeat themselves or get [83:42] more angry or start like the point and [83:45] then by by that point you know it's [83:47] going in one one of your dog's ears and [83:49] out the other like they don't they don't [83:50] really care so the follow through is so [83:51] important for sure having something like [83:53] a leash or a line on your dog and a [83:54] getting them away from that distraction [83:56] and then maybe you can set them up in a [83:58] situation where they can be successful [84:00] if you know that this tree over here [84:02] that your puppy really wants to sniff it [84:04] and they're not responding then you need [84:06] to the 3DS you need to get some distance [84:08] from that tree and you can practice it [84:10] again if the dog doesn't respond then [84:12] you figure out how you're going to get [84:14] them redirected away from that and [84:15] you're going to go farther away and [84:17] practice it again but make sure that [84:19] you're not calling over and and asking [84:21] over and over again because it really [84:23] Waters down what that word means and it [84:26] really teaches your dog that not [84:27] listening to you is an option mhm now [84:30] the next puppy training rule is going to [84:31] change your life is practicing great [84:34] management with your puppy now we talked [84:36] a little bit just a moment ago about [84:38] redirecting the dog away from a tree for [84:40] example well how are you going to do [84:42] that it's pretty exciting for your puppy [84:44] if every time you need to get them away [84:46] from something that you need to run up [84:47] to them and chase them around and [84:49] somehow take hold of them the best puppy [84:50] game of all time catch them if you can [84:53] not one that you ever want them to learn [84:55] exist especially in the house but what [84:57] does management mean when it comes to [84:59] our series with uker what are some of [85:00] the things that we've been doing [85:01] consistently so that if she does make [85:03] the wrong choice we're able to redirect [85:05] her yeah we've really had to do a lot of [85:07] management with her because she is she's [85:09] can be pretty wild and crazy sometimes [85:11] fun loving for sure but pretty wild and [85:13] crazy so when she's out of her crate and [85:16] we're giving her some free time in our [85:19] home it's not actually entirely free as [85:22] of yet being a four-month-old puppy so [85:24] when she's out of her crate we will you [85:26] know do management um decisions like [85:29] keep a a leash or line on her when she's [85:30] out of her crate so that you know if she [85:32] tries to jump up on the counter as I'm [85:34] trying to make dinner and see what's [85:35] there we can use the line to redirect [85:37] her off and then maybe get her to sit [85:39] instead and teach her that that's what [85:41] she should do um you know if she's [85:43] trying to get at the shoes at the front [85:45] door again the line on allows me to stop [85:48] her and get the shoe out of her mouth [85:49] and and redirect her to a different [85:51] location and show her what she should be [85:53] doing differently so that line is such a [85:55] lifesaver um the other management tool [85:58] that we utilize a lot in our house is we [86:00] restrict what room she's allowed to go [86:01] into so if we're in the kitchen we have [86:04] her be in the kitchen with us so we have [86:06] baby gates up so she can't just wander [86:08] into the living room and get into mischi [86:10] while we're not paying attention now [86:11] eventually you know we will give her [86:13] access to maybe two rooms and then three [86:15] rooms and then we'll progress from there [86:17] once we see that you know she has a [86:19] little bit more training and can kind of [86:21] chill out a bit more independently but [86:23] we're a ways off from that because she's [86:24] a puppy so those are two of the things [86:26] that we do now what do you do if you [86:28] can't supervise 100% of the time now we [86:30] all have lives we all you know have [86:32] things that we need to do so you it's [86:33] impossible to be able to keep our eyes [86:35] on our puppy 100% of the time so what do [86:37] you do in the times when you can't [86:39] supervise well I know what we do yeah [86:41] and that is we happily utilize our crate [86:44] and uh we have a crate in the central [86:46] location of our house uh we actually [86:47] have a really great a YouTube video on [86:49] crate locations and where you can move [86:52] the crate to help things go along a [86:53] little bit more smoothly but you know we [86:55] can't watch her all of the time you know [86:57] we we have very busy lives as I'm sure [86:59] you guys do and uh knowing that when [87:01] she's in the crate she can't be [87:03] rehearsing bad things she can't be [87:04] eating something that could hurt her she [87:06] can't have accidents in the house it [87:08] allows us to make sure that when she is [87:10] out of the crate that she's just being [87:13] you know drilled with good information [87:15] this is what you need to do this is how [87:17] you do this instead of just she saying [87:20] well I have to go have a meeting now I [87:21] sure hope she's okay in the kitchen on [87:22] her own and then come down and you know [87:24] she's renovated the the cupboards for us [87:27] so you know the crate is such a great [87:29] way to keep your dog out of Mischief [87:31] until you have more training and they [87:33] have the ability just to hang out you [87:35] know we don't use uh crates very much [87:37] with our older dogs because they've [87:39] learned how to be a well- behaved dog in [87:42] the house but when you have a puppy [87:44] being able to manage them is so [87:46] important but if you need the time help [87:49] because you can't manage them every 2 [87:51] seconds of the day the crate is just the [87:54] most amazing thing that you can do for [87:56] the dogs and if you teach it right a lot [87:58] of dogs just they actually seek their [88:00] crate they they want to to go and chill [88:03] out um funky actually the dog on this [88:05] table she's uh 13 years old and um how [88:08] many times do we find her curled up in [88:10] the back of a crate she usually has a [88:11] crate and her door is just open she can [88:14] freely go in it but even 13 years she [88:16] still wants to go in there and have a [88:18] nap and just have some time to herself [88:20] so I think some people view it as you [88:23] know a bad thing or something that is [88:25] not going to be restrictive or something [88:27] well it is restrictive and that's quite [88:29] intentional the point pupp you can only [88:31] make good choices and that was a that [88:32] was even at two when I introduced the [88:34] crate to Degan it changed everything [88:36] here's the other thing here's the little [88:38] secret that those of you who are um uh [88:40] watching this video are going to get [88:42] what's the great thing about the crate [88:44] is every time that puppy or dog comes [88:45] out of the crate you're there you're [88:47] there to do something with them so that [88:49] they think every time that they they're [88:50] out that you're the most engaging thing [88:53] in the room that you you you bring all [88:55] that's good and that's such a powerful [88:57] thing immensely with relationship for [88:58] motivation and relationship and it's [89:00] really something that you can take [89:02] advantage of so that you get a dog who [89:03] listens and isn't distracted by the [89:05] slightest thing when you go out and you [89:07] start in the real world training yeah [89:09] the next puppy training rule that [89:11] changed my life entirely was to remember [89:14] to be consistent this is one of the most [89:17] crucial parts of your puppy training and [89:19] probably one of the most challenging [89:20] ones for people because unfortunately [89:22] humans are not cons yeah and that [89:25] includes some patience let's talk about [89:26] some of the things that we've been [89:27] working on with uker that have required [89:29] us to be really consistent about it [89:31] especially you need to be consistent [89:33] about um you know managing there's that [89:35] management word again um behaviors that [89:38] dogs find very self-rewarding so um I I [89:41] think one of the big ones with uker is [89:43] that she is really interested in jumping [89:45] on top of her crate to where she knows [89:47] we have a little toy bin up there with [89:49] some of the toys that we'll use from [89:50] time to time and she's very curious [89:53] about getting up there so so we have to [89:54] be very consistent on making sure that [89:57] when she goes over towards the crate and [89:59] starts air sting that's our cue that [90:01] means she's probably going to try to [90:03] jump up and then we can stop her but if [90:05] we're not paying attention to her and [90:07] she gets up and she gets to steal that [90:09] toy you know every couple of days that [90:11] behavior is going to keep going because [90:13] we're not being consistent yeah and and [90:16] you know consistency means throughout [90:18] your household too so if I family MERS [90:20] for sure if I allowed uh uker to jump up [90:23] on me or if I allowed to jump up on her [90:24] crate but kale insisted that she didn't [90:27] that wouldn't be fair to uker and dogs [90:28] need really black and white information [90:30] you're allowed to do this you're not [90:31] allow to do this for sure so you know [90:34] consistency throughout your household is [90:36] just as important that also applies to [90:38] things for example we were talking about [90:39] not taking uker out on this walk with [90:41] other dog she'll get her own walk but [90:43] you know we don't want her to have the [90:45] first few months of her life allowed to [90:47] pull on leash until she chokes dragging [90:50] herself uh around the property we want [90:52] to make sure that she's getting great [90:53] information so we're going to be [90:55] consistent about her expectations for [90:57] her pulling on her leash we're going to [90:59] set her up so that she's not in a [91:01] situation that's too distracting and [91:02] we're going to work on skills in a [91:04] smaller area where she's rewarded for [91:06] not pulling on her leash where she finds [91:08] she's motivated to make sure that leash [91:10] is loose and you know this consistency [91:12] when you start at you know through [91:14] puppyhood with that kind of consistency [91:16] your uh adult dog trains faster they [91:18] know that you're someone who's going to [91:20] be consistent when you have one [91:22] expectation it stays throughout time and [91:24] and that is so important and it's really [91:26] where I see a lot of students that come [91:28] in for classes they'll really Excel and [91:30] you know they're the kinds of people you [91:32] can usually tell in the first couple [91:33] classes that are really consistent they [91:35] set high expectations of their dog and [91:37] they maintain those yeah and I think [91:39] another thing with consistency is [91:40] repetition I think I I mentioned this [91:42] earlier dogs learn through repetition [91:45] and they learn even better if you do [91:47] consistent repetition um so for example [91:49] I'm trying to teach uker currently how [91:51] to um be focused when there are cars [91:54] driving past the end of our driveway [91:56] she's a border a young border collie and [91:58] she's very interested in cars going past [92:01] so I've that's my goal for this week and [92:03] the last two weeks actually I've every [92:05] day gone out even if it's just been for [92:07] two minutes if that's all the time I [92:09] have to work on it I just go out for a [92:11] couple minutes and we just stand at the [92:12] end of the driveway or we go down to the [92:14] corner of uh our road and I work a sit [92:17] or a down and I just reward her for [92:19] being calm as the cars go by and um I've [92:22] probably had I don't know five or six [92:24] sessions you know really good sessions [92:27] now and I cannot believe the difference [92:29] between now and the very first time that [92:31] I did it because I've consistently [92:33] practiced and get gotten given her good [92:36] information so you see the progress go [92:38] but if you only do things sometimes and [92:40] then other times you just sort of let [92:42] them do their own thing you're not going [92:43] to see the same type of results so [92:46] consistency is massive in dog training [92:49] but it needs to be consistency of the [92:51] right things if you're consistently [92:53] letting things happened the wrong way [92:55] then that's going to work you're [92:56] consistently teaching your puppy that [92:57] they can get the toilet paper roll [93:00] that's a bad thing they'll they'll [93:01] quickly learn that the toilet paper R [93:03] he's not looking in any particular [93:04] direction we're all looking for a dog [93:06] that can walk really nicely at our side [93:08] around any distractions or in any [93:10] environment but one of the most [93:12] difficult things to deal with is the [93:13] distraction of other people and dogs and [93:15] this can be particularly difficult if [93:17] your dog really likes other people in [93:19] dogs and it gets them very excited this [93:21] is actually something that we've been [93:22] dealing a lot with with uker she's not [93:25] terribly food motivated but she loves [93:27] people she would be happy for people [93:29] just to come up and touch her and pet [93:30] her all day long so if I'm walking her [93:33] along and she sees someone the [93:34] distraction of that person can often be [93:36] really overwhelming and that's exactly [93:38] what we're going to talk about how to [93:39] deal with today we can talk a lot about [93:41] what to do with our dogs in those [93:42] moments but one thing that can often be [93:44] challenging is what to say to the people [93:46] who are approaching our dog because [93:48] often they see a cute little puppy they [93:50] see that you're training and a lot of [93:52] people come in with those High squeak [93:54] voices and they're really excited and [93:55] that can sometimes Drive dogs a little [93:57] bit over the edge so one thing that we [94:00] recommend that you do is don't be afraid [94:02] to tell people that your dogs in [94:04] training and even you know ask them to [94:06] uh to give you some help often if [94:08] somebody wants to come up and say hello [94:09] to my dog I will often say no problem [94:12] but do you mind helping me out my dog's [94:13] in training I'm working on teaching her [94:15] not to jump up and I will just very [94:17] happily but confidently uh tell that [94:20] person what I want them to do so that I [94:22] can set my puppy up to be SU successful [94:24] I want to introduce to you the concept [94:26] of a training Target so you know what a [94:28] Target looks like I want you to think [94:29] about those different areas as different [94:31] thresholds that you can use with your [94:33] dog to make things either easier or more [94:36] challenging as your dog's training [94:37] progresses so if you look at the biggest [94:39] um circle on a Target the usually the [94:42] easiest one to achieve it's going to be [94:44] the same thing with your dog training if [94:46] you're working with your dog around [94:48] other people think about having those [94:50] people stay in the biggest area of the [94:52] target the furthest away from your dog [94:55] um in order for your puppy to be [94:56] successful now if they're at a distance [94:58] and your dog is able to sit on a loose [95:00] leash they're able to check in with you [95:02] they're able to be attentive you can [95:04] then have that person close into the [95:06] middle part of that Target they can come [95:08] in a little bit closer and this is where [95:10] really where you're going to need to [95:11] work your butt off now it doesn't all [95:13] need to be perfect it's okay if somebody [95:15] starts to get close and your dog makes [95:17] an error but what you do about that [95:19] error is going to make all of the [95:21] difference let's talk first step so [95:23] you're out for a walk with your dog your [95:24] dog happens to see somebody at at a [95:26] distance you can kind of tell they're [95:27] going to come in to want to say hello to [95:29] your dog what's the first thing that you [95:30] should do well the first thing you need [95:32] to do is get your dog's attention before [95:34] they get locked on to that distraction [95:36] so I might interrupt her I might use a [95:38] bit of food hey pup what's this hey hi [95:41] what's this and I might lure her into my [95:43] side and go to a control exercise that [95:46] she's been working on so she understands [95:48] that when she's sitting at my side yes [95:50] that she needs to remain in that [95:52] position even though there's [95:53] distractions around and this is an [95:54] obedience skill that we drill into them [95:57] and when they're young to help teach [95:58] emotional control so my dog's in the [96:00] control position and as that person [96:02] approaches I'm just going to say hey [96:03] how's it going just hold on wait there [96:05] one second I'm just going to instruct [96:06] them to just sort of stop at a distance [96:09] good girl okay come a little closer yes [96:11] good girl good sit yes and my focus is [96:15] going to be more on the dog and less on [96:17] the person now if I see that she's oops [96:20] if she's overd distracted and she can't [96:22] hold that sit I I'm just going to ditch [96:24] the food and I'm just her you're like [96:27] melting sit good girly I'm going to [96:30] place her back into that sitting [96:31] position and once she's on a loose leash [96:33] there's my papa Rooney I'm going to yes [96:36] and reward once again okay come in and [96:37] try again sit yes now if she's able to [96:41] hold the sit as that person gets close I [96:44] can then say all right you can pet her [96:45] good girl oops oopsie so I want her to [96:49] maintain that sit even though she's [96:51] being paded so she gets up the [96:54] opportunity to be padded sort of is is [96:56] non not on the table anymore try again [96:59] yes good girl yes good girl yes now the [97:04] next thing that I can do is I also could [97:06] give her permission to go and say hello [97:08] but when I do that I'm going to keep my [97:09] leash handy and I'm going to instruct [97:11] that person just to be calm now another [97:13] issue that we've had with yuker is that [97:15] if she's starting to feel um a little [97:18] bit over excited sometimes she'll [97:20] actually submissively pee and it's even [97:22] worse if people are squeaking and [97:23] squawking and bending over top of her so [97:25] I'll often just encourage people to [97:27] either stand up tall or bend down and [97:29] and sort of keep their body upright and [97:31] then I'll let her go and say hello good [97:33] okay good go say hi okay go say hi hi [97:36] buddy off good girl good off yes so good [97:42] girl yes now you don't necessarily have [97:44] to food reward your dog in this moment [97:46] yes she took the food there but she [97:48] could really care less what she really [97:49] wants is love and affection and as long [97:52] as she's remaining in this sit position [97:55] I'm going to allow her to get that [97:56] affection but I also want to make sure [97:58] that I have good control so I also want [98:00] to train her uker Yay good girl I want [98:04] the ability to get her back uh to me and [98:07] when I want her to but because she's a [98:08] puppy I'm going to train her to do that [98:10] shall we try that again okay go say hi [98:12] yuke hi there papon go say hi hi there [98:14] paparo what's going go say hi offie good [98:18] off good off yes good off yes uker Yay [98:25] good girl so I let her go visit for just [98:27] a moment and then I call her away let [98:29] her go visit for a moment then I call [98:31] away keeping it nice and short and sweet [98:33] the longer I let her hang out there the [98:35] more opportunity there is for her to [98:36] make an error so I can get lots of [98:38] little reps in without her making a lot [98:40] of mistakes now she was really good she [98:42] didn't jump on Ken but I did have my [98:44] leash ready and if she did what I would [98:46] have done is instructed Ken to stop [98:48] petting and this is where a lot of um [98:51] you know maybe less experienced people [98:53] around dogs have trouble because often [98:55] you can oh you're the cutest thing in [98:58] the world good so Ken's behavior is [99:02] actually causing uker to jump up on him [99:05] right now so it's very difficult see [99:08] it's very difficult to teach her what to [99:10] do if I'm just allowing this to happen [99:12] look now she's starting to nip and bite [99:14] at his uh hand she think this is a game [99:17] so basically he's provoking her to to [99:19] make a poor choice oh she says I'm just [99:21] going to be a wild animal now so if I'm [99:23] not giving her good information you can [99:25] see how she's just making poor choices [99:28] but if I set the situation up so I'm in [99:30] control it goes entirely different it's [99:33] not always going to be a person that's [99:35] going to be the challenge you might find [99:36] that your dog is awesome when there's [99:38] people but it's maybe a little bit more [99:39] Challen challenging when there's an [99:41] adult and a kid or maybe somebody [99:42] walking another dog you might have to [99:45] pick and choose what that threshold is [99:46] going to be for your dog depending on [99:48] the different distraction level and it's [99:50] okay if they're different you just need [99:52] to be able to make good choices based on [99:53] what's happening in front of you we [99:55] talked about the importance of distance [99:57] from that distraction but the other [99:58] thing that we need to talk about is how [100:00] distracting the actual person is [100:02] sometimes when people are excited to [100:03] come and see your dog they can't help [100:05] themselves when did you get a puppy they [100:07] want to react in a really exciting way [100:09] so it's really important that you coach [100:11] them on how to portray their energy you [100:13] know it's good idea for them to come in [100:15] and just stand and be still and be calm [100:18] uh be careful about the um voice tones [100:20] that they use that they aren't using a [100:22] high squeaky pitched sound that they're [100:24] just sort of speaking in normal tone eye [100:26] contact as important you may have them [100:28] look away from the puppy if they start [100:29] to get too excited and if you have a [100:31] real wiggle buom you might even have [100:33] them just turn your their back to your [100:35] puppy for a moment until your puppy [100:37] starts to settle and then they can [100:38] certainly turn back around but you might [100:40] have to give that person that come in [100:42] that's coming in to say hello to your [100:43] dog a little bit more coaching so that [100:45] they can help make uh the right choices [100:48] and then you're going to start to see [100:49] what works for your puppy and then [100:50] you're going to have a few go-to moves [100:52] that you're going to be able to uh tell [100:54] people when they come in to say hello [100:56] now there could be times where you're [100:57] walking across a sidewalk or an area [101:00] where that distraction is sort of forced [101:02] to be close to you so one of the tactics [101:04] that you can do is just actually move [101:06] off to the side so I'm going to get her [101:07] attention uker here babe good girl and [101:10] as I walk forward if that distraction [101:11] starts to come by here girl I'm just [101:14] going to actually pull her off to the [101:15] side to work my sit sit good girl yes [101:19] excellent and as that distraction walks [101:21] by I can then be rewarding her this is a [101:24] lot easier opportunity for her to make [101:25] good choices than it would be if I was [101:27] sort of stuck on that skinny Bridge or [101:29] on the side of the you know on the the [101:31] sidewalk I want to change my location so [101:33] that it's easier for her to maintain [101:35] some self-control and keep in mind not [101:37] everybody's going to want to see your [101:38] dog as well so it's important that she [101:41] understands that every single person [101:42] that goes by doesn't necessarily need to [101:44] stop and and say hello to her she needs [101:47] to stay under control with me and I'll [101:49] either say yes you can go or no you got [101:51] to stay here and um and be under under [101:53] control our ultimate goal here is that [101:55] people can come in and say hello to our [101:57] dogs they can pet our dogs and our dogs [101:59] can accept that and be really happy [102:00] about it but their for Paws stay on the [102:02] floor and they maintain some type of [102:04] mindfulness now keep in mind when people [102:07] come in to say hello to your dog if your [102:08] dog is a little bit too over excited and [102:11] they're rehearsing being able to jump up [102:13] and they're not really being trained not [102:15] to do so it's a very self-rewarding [102:17] behavior and it's not something that [102:19] will go away very easily so it's in your [102:21] best interest right now while you're [102:22] young to set the tone and show them what [102:24] they should be doing differently in [102:26] order to seek affection from other [102:28] people first things first you don't need [102:30] to be doing any real Walking on leash [102:31] training with your puppy until they're [102:33] about 16 weeks old before that 4month [102:36] Mark you should be really focusing on [102:38] some foundational exercises with your [102:40] puppy the skills that are going to teach [102:42] them how to learn some of these skills [102:45] might be following food uh teaching your [102:46] puppy what Yes means as a conditioned [102:48] reinforcer doing some trick training [102:51] response to name these are the building [102:53] block exercises that are going to help [102:55] your puppy to be successful when you do [102:57] get out and start working on that leash [102:59] walking training now the first mistake [103:01] that people make when it comes to [103:02] teaching their puppy to walk on a loose [103:03] leash is they rush out and try to start [103:05] walking on leash training as I mentioned [103:07] earlier foundational skills come first [103:10] with all the interesting and exciting [103:12] things out in the real world if you [103:13] haven't shown your puppy that you can [103:14] bring value into their life or that you [103:17] are worth listening to then the sights [103:19] and the smells and the sounds all around [103:21] you in your environment are going to [103:22] make it pretty challenging for your [103:24] puppy to make good choices so I really [103:26] want you to focus on those exercises [103:28] that teach your puppy that if they put [103:30] in a little bit of effort give you some [103:31] attention that they get rewarded that's [103:33] going to make you're starting to walk on [103:34] leash training much much easier the next [103:37] mistake that people commonly make when [103:39] it comes to walking on leash training [103:40] with their puppies is that they're [103:42] making it far too challenging for their [103:44] puppy to be successful this is a brand [103:46] new skill for your puppy so I want you [103:48] to keep in mind that all of our training [103:50] especially at the beginning is about [103:51] motivation and focus and we want to turn [103:53] these training sessions into short sweet [103:56] successful bits of training think about [103:58] the sit day for example we would never [104:00] ask our puppy to sit in position for 5 [104:02] minutes at the beginning of the training [104:04] so we want to make sure that we're not [104:05] doing the same thing with our leash [104:07] walking training and a good way to be [104:09] aware of the uh level of challenge in [104:12] your dog's training is by using the 3DS [104:14] this is something we often talk about [104:17] the 3DS are distance distraction [104:20] duration reducing or increasing any one [104:23] of these can make things more [104:24] challenging for your puppy so let's take [104:26] a look at how this might apply to your [104:28] leash walking training distance pick a [104:30] short distance maybe it's just 10 or 15 [104:33] ft when you start but we want to make [104:34] sure that our puppy starts and ends [104:36] successfully so don't drag it out too [104:39] long distractions make sure you're as [104:41] far away from any distractions as you [104:43] can be and this might mean that you go [104:44] to some special training spot without [104:47] anyone around or with very limited [104:49] amount of distractions so that your [104:50] puppy can be successful maybe it's maybe [104:52] it's even your driveway or a room or [104:54] hallway in your house or a parking lot [104:57] after hours doesn't really matter what [104:58] that location is but I want you to be [105:00] very mindful of the distractions in the [105:03] environment so that you can help your [105:04] puppy to make good choices and duration [105:07] now I want you to plan for training [105:09] sessions that are just a few minutes [105:11] long the last thing we want to do is [105:12] demotivate our puppy by training them [105:15] when they're too full or not interested [105:17] in the treats or reward anymore or [105:20] they're just generally too distracted [105:21] because you've worked on something for [105:23] too long remember our puppies have short [105:25] attention spans and Tiny bellies so we [105:27] want to take advantage of every [105:28] opportunity we can to end on a high note [105:31] so when you plan your training session [105:33] set a timer for 3 or 4 minutes and then [105:35] break it off once that timer's gone the [105:37] next common mistake people make is they [105:39] don't start with enough control or [105:40] attention you're going to have a lot [105:42] more success if you start with your [105:43] puppy giving you some attention already [105:46] focused on you it's also the best way [105:48] for you to be prepared for the next 15 [105:50] feet of training if you start with your [105:52] dog in the right place at your side [105:54] maybe you've got some treats pre-loaded [105:57] in your hand you've got your leash set [105:59] up and loose so there's just a gentle J [106:01] shape so that the clip is hanging down [106:03] but by preparing for the next 15 or 20 [106:06] ft you're more likely to make good [106:08] choices if your puppy struggles a little [106:10] bit another really common challenge that [106:12] people have and it makes it more [106:14] difficult for their puppy is they don't [106:15] know what the right pace of walking is [106:18] it's pretty easy for you as a Handler to [106:20] get focused on all of the technique when [106:22] you're teaching this skill you're you're [106:24] trying to keep the leash loose you're [106:25] trying to reward in a in a specific [106:27] position you're trying to keep an eye [106:28] out for all of the distractions in the [106:31] real world so it's not uncommon for [106:33] people to really slow down their pace [106:36] and the problem is that this actually [106:37] makes it a lot harder for your puppy [106:40] what you need to do is find the right [106:42] pace and it's not too fast and it's not [106:44] walking too slow but it's a pace where [106:46] your dog's paying a little bit more [106:48] attention to you I want you to walk like [106:50] you're late for something the great part [106:52] about this is that your dog finds it [106:54] motivating and and entertaining if [106:56] you're walking at a very specific pace [106:58] and you're way more likely for the next [106:59] 10 or 15 ft to get that great attention [107:02] the other thing it does is it doesn't [107:04] allow your puppy to uh discover those [107:07] things on the ground or be so focused on [107:10] a leaf that blows by or a car that [107:11] drives by off in the distance and it [107:14] allows you to really maintain some of [107:16] that attention for these short walking [107:18] sessions so make sure you pick a good [107:20] Pace while we're talking about attention [107:22] and focus don't be afraid to use turns [107:24] in your walking on leash training this [107:26] is a really nice way to for those dogs [107:28] that love to charge out if so your puppy [107:30] charges ahead all the time you can just [107:32] do a 180 degree turn and head back in [107:34] the other direction now at the beginning [107:36] of this training you can reward your [107:38] puppy as they get back in at your side [107:40] as they get you know into that nice [107:41] walking position but what it does is it [107:43] keeps it fun for your puppy it allows [107:45] them to they're not really sure where [107:47] you're going so they're checking in with [107:49] you more often you wouldn't want to turn [107:50] into a spinning top if your puppy [107:52] constantly charging ahead but for those [107:54] puppies who walk in at your side some of [107:56] the time and then they start to lead [107:58] ahead just a little bit 180° turn is a [108:00] great way to get more Focus back on you [108:03] I want you to start planning your ending [108:05] before you begin walking since we're [108:07] trying to teach our puppy to work a [108:09] little bit to put in a little bit of [108:10] effort we also need to let them know [108:12] when the job is done with your puppy [108:14] there's a couple different ways to end [108:16] your walking the first is a lot more [108:18] controlled and it's a really great way [108:20] to start teaching your puppy an [108:21] automatic sit so that anytime you stop [108:23] walking they sit in at your side so what [108:26] I want you to do is when you have your [108:28] last treat in your hand I want you to [108:30] put it on your puppy's nose as you're [108:31] coming to a stop you're going to lure [108:33] them up and into a sit and after you've [108:35] been able to reward them in position you [108:38] can release them with an okay another [108:41] really fun way to to reward a puppy [108:43] who's uh you know maybe more interested [108:45] in toys if your puppy really loves to [108:46] play with toys and loves to tug a great [108:49] way to reward them for great walking is [108:51] get 10 or 15 Steps of you know nice in [108:53] position walking and then release them [108:55] with an okay and have a game of tug now [108:58] if you've been struggling to maintain [108:59] your puppy's attention or if they've [109:01] been really distracted by the [109:03] environment around you this uh this [109:05] random toy play ending might not be [109:08] right for your dog but if you have a dog [109:10] who's you know relatively motivated by [109:12] toys and has been doing a really nice [109:14] job with attention this is an awesome [109:16] way to break up the monotony of walking [109:19] back and forth so have some fun with [109:21] that ending ditch the harness if you [109:23] have a dog in training who's just [109:24] learning to walk on leash without [109:26] pulling then you need to be giving them [109:28] better information harnesses are great [109:31] and all of our dogs have them but our [109:32] dogs didn't get to use them until they [109:34] learned that pulling on the leash wasn't [109:36] acceptable we often talk in these videos [109:38] about wanting to give our dogs the best [109:41] information possible and uh the way to [109:43] do that is to give our dogs clear [109:45] information in the case of walking on [109:47] leash training clear information means [109:49] having a little bit more control of [109:51] their neck or their head so that we can [109:53] quickly turn them away from distractions [109:55] and get back to rewarding them for being [109:56] in a great position for the things that [109:58] we like with a harness it can become a [110:00] battle of wills where the dog's getting [110:02] really bad information about what we [110:03] want them to do you don't need to [110:06] struggle for their attention if you can [110:07] quickly turn them away so a simple flat [110:10] collar is a much better choice for your [110:12] puppy now one thing I occasionally hear [110:15] about uh using a flat collar for walking [110:17] training is that my dog chokes and if [110:19] that is the case you are definitely [110:21] doing it wrong I want you to rewind this [110:23] video and check out the points that I've [110:25] mentioned because it's really important [110:26] that your puppy isn't walking on a tight [110:29] leash all of the exercises that we talk [110:31] about control all of the reward [110:33] positioning that that sitting in control [110:36] position is focused on teaching your dog [110:38] to walk on a loose leash so if your dog [110:40] is choking because they're pulling on [110:42] their collar you need to fix that [110:44] situation first now if you loved that [110:46] series you're definitely going to love [110:47] the five alive Series where Ken and kale [110:49] bring home their newest puppy five alive [110:51] to watch that check out that video right [110:53] there and on that note I'm Dan happy [110:56]

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 96/468,~Ken === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:02] you're using entirely too much paper [00:03] towel in your puppy potty trading but [00:05] not only that having a puppy is not an [00:08] easy thing teaching them all the things [00:09] that they need to learn especially in [00:11] those first few weeks can be very [00:12] challenging and sometimes even through [00:14] our best efforts we think we're doing [00:16] all the right things but we're still [00:17] making some mistakes or our puppy is [00:19] still having mistakes specifically [00:21] mistakes in the house house training is [00:23] a really really important stage in puppy [00:25] training and often times the things that [00:27] we think we're doing most should be [00:29] making gains but they're not and I'm [00:31] here today with little scooter to talk [00:33] about some of those mistakes that you're [00:34] making and how you can fix them and set [00:35] your puppy house training right I'm [00:38] Steve this is little scooter welcome [00:40] back to Mand [00:41] [Music] [00:44] dogs one of the most common questions I [00:46] get from my students is how to prevent [00:48] those accidents from happening in the [00:49] house so one of the first questions I'll [00:51] ask those people is well when they were [00:52] outside did they actually go to the [00:54] bathroom and if they answer back well [00:56] they don't really know well that's the [00:57] biggest thing that's going to tell us we [00:59] need to change something something now [01:00] were you out there watching were you [01:02] paying attention were you texting on [01:03] your phone or updating your Instagram [01:05] you need to be paying attention to that [01:06] puppy to see if they're actually going [01:08] to the bathroom puppies are famously [01:10] distractable you know the wind blows and [01:12] the grass leaves and grass and leaves [01:14] moves by that's going to catch their [01:15] attention and can actually distract them [01:17] from the fact that they went to the [01:18] bathroom so the first thing you're going [01:20] to fix is making sure that you outside [01:22] with your puppies you're going to make [01:23] sure that those puppies have a leash or [01:24] a line on and you're going to go out and [01:27] try and be as boring as you can I'm not [01:29] going to let that puppy wander around [01:31] and chase ants or chase leaves we're [01:33] kind of on a business trip at that point [01:34] and need to take that little bit of [01:36] mindset we want to get the job done and [01:38] then we can have all the fun but let's [01:40] say they are doing all those things they [01:42] are outside they do have a leash or a [01:44] line on and they still aren't sure if [01:46] that puppy's going to the bathroom well [01:47] here's where the next mistake comes back [01:49] people tend to think okay I guess my [01:51] puppy doesn't need to go to the bathroom [01:53] so we come back inside and that puppy's [01:55] allowed to wander free that is one of [01:56] the biggest things that uh will make a [01:58] difference in your puppy training is [02:00] taking away that freedom just at that [02:02] particular moment with puppies getting [02:03] distracted they often go outside they [02:05] think they want to go to the bathroom [02:06] get distracted simply forget but when [02:08] they come back inside and those [02:09] distractions are gone then they all of a [02:11] sudden say oh wait I remember I was [02:13] supposed to go to the bathroom and those [02:14] little accidents happen so preventing [02:16] that by using your crate can be a big [02:18] game Cher take them outside as we talked [02:20] about have that line on have try and get [02:23] their focus you can see this is not a [02:25] very focused puppy most puppies aren't [02:27] give them an opportunity to go to the [02:28] bathroom if they don't don't and you're [02:30] pretty sure they do just come on back [02:32] inside pop them in that crate again for [02:33] maybe two 3 four minutes pretty soon you [02:36] will see them start to get a little [02:37] restless and realize they have to go to [02:39] the bathroom you can take them right [02:40] back outside again repeat that process [02:42] for better success so how is putting [02:44] them in the crate going to help well [02:45] puppies are pretty honest creatures in [02:47] their responses um puppies generally [02:49] will not go to the bathroom where they [02:51] sleep that's proper puppy etiquette um [02:54] if you ever see a litter of puppies who [02:55] are with their mom in the welping Box as [02:57] soon as they're up and mobile the first [02:59] thing that they do naturally is move [03:01] away from where they sleep to go to the [03:03] bathroom that's why often times in your [03:05] house you find those little accidents in [03:07] places that are around the corner or out [03:08] of the way people often think oh my [03:10] puppy sneaking away intentionally [03:12] because they don't want to get caught no [03:13] they're actually being polite they are [03:16] going to places that are maybe less [03:17] frequented by them and using that as [03:19] their bathroom so the crate becomes that [03:22] little trigger that it's going to help [03:23] them hold that bathroom or that need to [03:25] go for a little bit longer and it gives [03:27] you the opportunity to take them outside [03:29] on a house line and try again and you [03:31] will find as they learn that that going [03:34] outside and going to the bathroom [03:36] outside is the thing that you want that [03:37] transition will become much easier but [03:39] what if they are having accidents in [03:41] their crate because it's great to say [03:42] that puppies generally won't go to the [03:43] bathroom in their crate but it's all [03:45] going to come down to size uh puppy [03:47] crates should be big enough for the pups [03:49] to lay comfortably flat out on their [03:51] side stand up turn around and lie down [03:53] again now when you have a young puppy [03:55] that's growing we don't want to go out [03:56] and buy crate after crate after crate [03:58] that's not reasonable for a lot of [03:59] people you can get a lot of crates that [04:01] have a divider that will allow you to [04:02] sort of limit the space that the puppy [04:04] has and as they grow that space [04:06] increases with too much space uh puppies [04:08] will often use one side of their [04:10] enclosure as a bathroom and the other [04:12] side as the place that they sleep so [04:14] making sure that your crate is [04:15] appropriate size appropriately size will [04:17] really make a big difference in their [04:18] understanding so what should you do if [04:20] you're finding accidents around the [04:21] house well I hate to tell you this but [04:23] if your dog has the time and the [04:25] opportunity to sneak away and go to the [04:27] bathroom and you don't see them that's [04:29] on you you having direct supervision of [04:31] your puppy means you actually have eyes [04:33] on them you have uh a space that's maybe [04:35] a little bit more controlled so instead [04:37] of having range of the whole house get [04:38] yourself a couple of baby gates where [04:40] the puppy only has the room that you're [04:42] going to be in um having puppies in the [04:44] house and realizing that things are [04:46] quiet is a very bad sign I always want [04:48] to know where my puppy is so that I can [04:50] prevent those mistakes from happening if [04:52] you've rounded the corner and found [04:53] they've made that mistake that means you [04:55] took your eyes off them and they had the [04:57] opportunity to do so the other really [04:59] important thing to consider is the [05:00] amount of water puppies are taking in I [05:02] mean think about it what goes in must [05:04] come out so if your puppy has free [05:06] access to water all the time yes I'm [05:07] sure they are drinking because they are [05:09] thirsty but guess what playing in water [05:11] is super fun splashing all over the [05:13] place makes a mess they have a great [05:14] time with it and if they're drinking [05:15] more than they really really need that [05:17] is going to require them to go to the [05:19] bathroom more often so maybe supervise [05:21] your water a little bit more put some [05:22] water with their food put the bowl down [05:24] let them have a drink and take it up so [05:26] that they're not drinking unnecessarily [05:28] we want to make sure puppies are [05:29] hydrated but we don't want them [05:31] overhydrated now that also goes for [05:33] nighttime often times you we let our [05:35] puppies have a big drink and at the late [05:37] at night that means they're going to [05:39] need to go to the bathroom in the middle [05:40] of the night think about taking up that [05:42] water a little bit earlier so that as [05:44] they go through the night there's less [05:45] urge to go to the bathroom it will help [05:47] you get better sleep these mistakes in [05:48] house training are pretty common and if [05:50] you're a new dog owner and want to avoid [05:52] some of the other common mistakes that [05:54] people make check out that video right

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 106/468,~Ken === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] there's a good chance you are setting [00:01] yourself back in your dog training by [00:03] allowing your children to be involved in [00:05] the wrong way in this week's episode we [00:07] are going to be talking about how to [00:08] involve your children in such a way that [00:10] it betters their relationship with your [00:12] young puppy I'm instructor Meg welcome [00:14] back to Mand [00:17] dogs one of the most common mistakes we [00:19] see with young kids training is that [00:21] they don't always have the best timing [00:23] we need to coach them to have good [00:25] timing so that we make sure that they [00:26] are capturing or identifying when the [00:28] dog makes the right choices and helping [00:31] them to make sure that they're not [00:32] repeating commands so that the dog [00:33] learns they can just ignore the child [00:35] when we're working with kids we want to [00:37] teach them that when the dog does the [00:39] thing correctly whatever Behavior it is [00:41] that they're looking for they Mark that [00:43] with a yes that tells the dog [00:46] immediately that they've done something [00:48] correct the problem with kids is that [00:50] sometimes they don't know what behaviors [00:52] they're looking for this is where we [00:54] come in we want to help them so we want [00:56] to teach the child here's where the dog [00:58] is correct now is when you want to say [01:00] yes now is when you want a reward [01:02] without meaning to sometimes kids also [01:04] repeat commands over and over and over [01:06] again they're not actually the only ones [01:08] who do this adults do this as well but [01:10] kids are so easily coached I want to [01:13] teach my children that when I say a word [01:16] I'm going to only say it once and then [01:18] I'm going to reward the dog if the dog [01:20] doesn't respond here's how we're going [01:22] to help them here is how we're going to [01:24] follow through if we repeat commands [01:26] over and over and over again it teaches [01:29] the dog they don't actually have to [01:30] respond the first time we say anything [01:32] and then the puppy realizes the child's [01:34] voice doesn't really matter so instead [01:37] if they ask the puppy to do something [01:39] mark it with that word yes if the puppy [01:42] doesn't do it instead of just repeating [01:44] the command have a way to back up your [01:47] voice repeat the command but then show [01:49] the puppy what you like or repeat the [01:51] command and then have the adult redirect [01:53] the puppy to where you want them to go [01:55] all of this is going to strengthen the [01:57] relationship and the bond between your [02:00] child and dog because the dog realizes [02:02] that when the child says things they [02:04] need to respond and good things happen [02:07] when they do so was he biting your [02:09] fingers a little bit on that one perfect [02:11] let's work through that next so the next [02:12] thing we're going to do to teach him to [02:14] take food gently you're going to take [02:15] the treat oops it easy and you're going [02:17] to cover the treat with your thumb like [02:19] this okay so he can't get it if he [02:23] sniffs or licks my finger yes I'm going [02:26] to say yes and I'm going to take my [02:27] thumb off if you go and try to give a [02:30] cookie and he's a little bit rough [02:31] you're going to do this ouch or hey or [02:34] oops or something like that to let him [02:35] know that it doesn't feel nice okay so [02:37] put the food on your fingers cover it [02:39] with your thumb good and now present it [02:42] to the HM if he sniffs or licks yes so [02:45] just make sure you always say yes first [02:46] then food okay unfortunately all too [02:49] often we see children handling dogs [02:52] improperly sometimes this even results [02:54] in the dog being unsure about the child [02:56] touching them at all we want the dogs to [02:59] learn from a very early start that when [03:01] a child takes control in a very [03:03] non-confrontational way that it is a [03:06] positive thing so I want to teach my [03:08] puppies that if my child comes in to [03:11] take their collar maybe even just to [03:12] clip a leash on them that it is a good [03:14] thing I'm not going to have my dog do a [03:17] lot of excessive handling with the child [03:19] and I certainly won't do that without my [03:21] presence and supervision but I do want [03:23] to teach a puppy from the very beginning [03:26] that if a child takes your collar let [03:28] that happen because good things things [03:30] happen when children take control I also [03:33] want to teach my child from the [03:34] beginning how to handle a puppy [03:36] appropriately it's not okay to grab dogs [03:39] pull them towards you lay on them [03:41] certainly not anything like that so we [03:43] want to teach the child this is an [03:46] acceptable way to take control of a dog [03:48] and to ask them to do things so often we [03:51] start with simply using food to lure [03:53] them in to take the co control using the [03:56] collar we want these children to learn [03:58] that when you use food and gently bring [04:01] the dog in the dog is going to be more [04:03] accepting of this we want the dog to [04:05] learn that when the child uses food to [04:08] go with it to not fight back to not [04:10] resist them taking control so a very [04:13] simple exercise is luring with food [04:15] taking the collar and rewarding over and [04:18] over and over again eventually this can [04:21] again result in the child then coming in [04:23] and putting a leash on the dog this [04:24] would allow them to have even more [04:26] control all Little Steps along the way [04:28] that the puppy accepts [04:30] any handling that the child asks of them [04:32] good oh do you have multiple do you have [04:34] food in that hand too ah good so keep [04:36] all the food in one hand okay perfect [04:40] because it's hard to grab his collar if [04:42] you have cookies in your hand [04:44] right good so lure them and close first [04:46] let go of the collar lure them nice and [04:48] close good take the [04:51] collar good yes and feed him and feed [04:54] him again yes yes so what I really want [04:57] you to be careful about Buddy is taking [05:00] the food luring him in clothes and then [05:03] taking his collar as you're feeding him [05:05] I don't want you to ever take his collar [05:06] and pull him towards you does that make [05:08] sense because then what do you think [05:10] he'll do if you pull him towards you [05:12] bite I don't think he would bite um but [05:15] a lot of the time he could bite [05:16] especially a young puppy might bite but [05:17] a lot of dogs don't like that if you [05:19] pull one way they'll actually pull back [05:21] the opposite way okay it's very [05:24] important that children learn what is an [05:25] appropriate touch we do not want dogs to [05:28] ever feel compromised or worried with [05:31] children so I want to teach children [05:34] that they may touch ears touch Paws [05:36] touch Tails touch the entire body all [05:40] with my presence and a positive [05:42] Association for every single one of [05:44] these body parts we refer to this as [05:46] handling it's a little bit more than [05:48] just giving a pat we are specifically [05:50] touching different body parts and these [05:52] are going to be body parts that might [05:54] eventually need to be examined if they [05:56] have to get their nails clipped if we [05:58] have to look inside their ears to see [05:59] see if there's a tick inside or if [06:00] there's a little bit of a dirt now the [06:03] child is not likely going to be doing [06:05] all of this serious handling as the dog [06:07] grows up but we do want to teach the dog [06:10] that any touch is going to be a positive [06:12] experience and something that they [06:14] should allow to happen because it's not [06:16] going to be harmful or hurtful to them [06:17] at all now we also want to teach the [06:20] child what are inappropriate touches you [06:23] are not to hug the dog you are not to [06:24] squeeze the dog you are not to grab [06:26] their tail or grab their paws and [06:28] certainly not lie on them these are all [06:31] lessons that the child needs to be [06:32] taught by you because without that [06:35] information lots of kids aren't aware of [06:38] what's inappropriate with a dog so we [06:40] want to teach them step by step here's [06:42] how you touch here's how you reward and [06:45] here is what we expect from the dog we [06:47] want calm we want quiet we want relaxed [06:51] if at any time the dog resists this [06:53] we're going to make it a little bit [06:54] easier and teach them that this is what [06:56] we like from you to do and this is what [06:58] results in a reward no matter what [07:00] exercise or skill we're working on we [07:02] are going to follow a process to help [07:04] teach the dogs what we're looking for [07:05] them to do we will often use the formula [07:08] of Q stimulus reward now to a [07:11] seven-year-old they don't understand [07:13] what any of that means so we need to [07:15] break that down for them the Q might be [07:17] something like response to name the [07:19] stimulus might be putting food on their [07:21] nose to help lure them back towards us [07:23] as we back away we use our body language [07:25] to encourage the puppy towards us then [07:27] the reward of course is going to be our [07:29] praise and our touch and the food when [07:31] they reach us so we need to help break [07:33] that down for a child so that they have [07:35] the right timing and the right process [07:37] for the dog to learn on his nose honey [07:40] walk right up and now you're gonna say [07:41] his name five good and back away now do [07:44] you see how he was starting to jump at [07:46] you again it's because of where you're [07:47] holding the food so if you hold the food [07:50] up high do you think that's going to [07:52] make him jump more or less more exactly [07:55] so where do you think you need to hold [07:56] that [07:57] food down here exactly perfect so you're [08:00] going to try it again you're going to [08:01] say five you're going to put food right [08:03] on his nose and lure nice and close to [08:06] your legs sound good okay all [08:09] distract good food on his [08:11] nose five Yay good job that was perfect [08:16] good let's try it again good right on [08:18] his nose five yes good job he likes this [08:23] one want to try one more time good [08:26] job Popp it UPS okay oh that's that's [08:30] okay come put it on his nose good boy [08:32] good jobab five good job now you did [08:36] what a lot of people do you actually [08:38] were starting to run away before you [08:40] actually had his attention so this time [08:43] don't start moving until you have like [08:46] his eyes on you do you know what I mean [08:48] so you're G to say you're going to get [08:49] his attention five yes and then back [08:53] away so I think you just need to slow [08:55] down a little bit because sometimes when [08:57] we go too fast it makes things um a [08:59] little little too crazy okay okay come [09:01] on over here again right on his nose [09:03] five yes good job he liked that one okay [09:08] now I think five uh likes you and likes [09:13] your motion so I think he's getting a [09:15] little bit more excitable kids will be [09:17] kids and dogs will be dogs that often [09:19] means that the energy in your household [09:22] might be a little bit more than what [09:23] you're looking for it's important that [09:25] kids understand how to be calm around [09:28] dogs we've already established that [09:30] but it's also important that dogs learn [09:32] that you don't get to be reactionary and [09:34] be wild anytime the child moves in the [09:37] house I like to teach my dogs what they [09:40] can do instead of chasing instead of [09:42] biting so we need to coach them through [09:45] this all too often we see that kids and [09:48] dogs are left alone and are given no [09:51] rules this then results in dogs chasing [09:54] the children biting the children [09:56] intimidating the children and sometimes [09:58] the children trying to take control of [10:00] that situation which does not always end [10:02] well I do not want to leave this up to [10:04] chance and I certainly do not want [10:06] anyone to get harmed in the process so I [10:08] want to teach my puppy how to learn to [10:11] ignore all the excitement around them at [10:14] times because there will be times in my [10:15] house where the kids are going to be a [10:17] little bit wild instead of letting them [10:19] chase the child I love to establish a [10:21] bit of control by using a dog bed a [10:24] space a matap somewhere that they can go [10:27] that they know the child is not going to [10:28] bother them in that space and their only [10:31] job is to remain in that spot while all [10:34] the excitement is happening around them [10:36] so I often use my kids as a distraction [10:39] to teach self-control this allows the [10:42] children to be involved and it allows [10:43] the dog to learn do not react to every [10:46] single movement that the child has in [10:47] the house I make it really easy to start [10:50] so the dog will be relying on a dog bed [10:52] and I simply ask the child to walk by [10:55] maybe even at a distance maybe it's too [10:57] difficult if the child is really close [10:58] to the dog bet gradually I have the [11:01] child move closer and closer then I [11:03] might even have them act Wilder and [11:05] Wilder all the while rewarding my puppy [11:08] for making excellent choices the puppy [11:11] learns kids can be silly kids can be [11:13] wild my only job is to remain on this [11:16] bed and I will get lots and lots and [11:18] lots of reinforcement eventually I give [11:21] them a break I let them get up and have [11:23] some fun as well and then it might be [11:25] that I make the child be calm they can [11:26] take turns back and forth what I don't [11:29] want is for the child to get wild the [11:31] dog gets Wilder the child gets wild the [11:34] dog gets Wilder until all of a all of a [11:36] sudden I don't have control of my own [11:38] household so both parties need to learn [11:42] how to act appropriately around each [11:43] other if the puppy is loose in the house [11:46] I ask the kids don't run right now if [11:48] the kids are being a little bit silly [11:50] this is the time where I put a leash on [11:51] the dog and I teach them here is what I [11:54] expect of you running after the child is [11:56] not an option this is a much better [11:59] behavior and this is going to earn you [12:01] lots of rewards instead so one of the [12:03] reasons I do things like this is to make [12:05] it fun and silly for the kids they [12:07] really need to be involved in the dog [12:09] training but sometimes it's hard for [12:10] them to be involved in the really [12:11] serious stuff more of the control [12:14] positions like simply learning how to [12:15] lie on your bed but kids are fabulous at [12:19] distracting so make it fun give it the [12:22] uh give them a little bit of freedom to [12:23] come up with their own fun things to do [12:25] so that they go uh I'm involved in this [12:28] dog training and having fun distracting [12:30] this puppy until eventually the puppy [12:32] learns you're being a bit pushy that [12:34] they need to remain on the dog bed no [12:36] matter what that kid is doing around [12:37] them even if they're running around with [12:39] capes on their backs we love using [12:40] crates in our training and the crate is [12:42] a very valuable tool that we can [12:44] actually use to increase the value of [12:47] the child as well I like to teach the [12:49] puppies that when they're in their crate [12:52] they're going to be left alone by the [12:53] child however the kid can also be [12:55] involved in teaching the puppy that the [12:57] crate is a great place they can hold the [12:59] puppy back throw some treats in reward [13:01] them for going in they can be the one [13:03] who provides their meals for going into [13:04] the crate they can be the one who has [13:06] the puppy go in and out of the crate all [13:09] with supervision which increases their [13:11] role as a leader in the household at a [13:14] very low risk all with me letting them [13:16] know how to do so properly to keep [13:18] everyone safe now I want to reiterate [13:21] again when a puppy is in their crate [13:24] this is not an appropriate time for the [13:26] child to be bugging at them sticking [13:28] their fingers in in the crate even lying [13:30] in front of the crate and putting their [13:31] face up against it when a puppy is in [13:33] their crate this is their downtime this [13:36] is their place that they can be safe and [13:37] they can go to relax this is not a space [13:40] where you want your child to be [13:42] bothering the dog so when the dog's in [13:43] the crate children should be told to [13:45] walk away they can come play with them [13:47] again when I choose for the puppy to [13:49] come back out children should not be [13:50] letting dogs in and out of crates [13:52] without my uh okay without my say so so [13:55] my children know the puppy remains in [13:57] the crate until mom says okay go get a [14:00] cookie you can let the puppy out of [14:01] their crate we can have a nice training [14:03] session together but at no time is the [14:05] child going to go up onto the crate and [14:07] let them out uh on their own the crate [14:09] can also be a really valuable tool to [14:11] teach the dog some self-control once [14:12] again with the children being the one in [14:14] charge having your dog learn that when [14:17] the crate door comes open not to dash [14:19] out in front of the kids is an excellent [14:21] exercise I will often have my children [14:23] practice opening the crate door tossing [14:25] some cookies into the crate closing it [14:27] again doing this several times times [14:29] until when they're ready they can open [14:31] that crate and tell the puppy Okay [14:33] release them out of the crate in order [14:35] to get fed again for coming to them this [14:38] teaches the puppy how to have that [14:39] self-control it teaches the child that [14:42] they can have the puppy do things for [14:43] them and both parties learn that the [14:46] crate once again is a great place to be [14:48] and a great place to come out of when [14:50] asked all of this though is under [14:52] control and it's going to be a [14:54] structured exercise in today's video [14:56] I've been talking about how to make sure [14:57] that your child is a good leader for [14:59] your dog but ultimately this depends on [15:01] you being a good leader for your dog [15:03] because you're the one who's giving your [15:05] child all of this information if you're [15:07] not sure if you're a good leader for [15:08] your dog check out this

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 118/468,~Ken === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] today I've been given the challenge of [00:01] coming up with the top four things that [00:02] you need for your puppy guess what I [00:04] can't do it there are so many things you [00:06] need for a new puppy coming home but I'm [00:08] going to try to make your life easier [00:09] today giving you that list and walking [00:11] you through exactly what you need for [00:13] your puppy before they come home I'm [00:16] instructor mag let's [00:20] go the first thing you need with a new [00:22] puppy is a Wellfit collar so when I get [00:25] a new puppy I'm going to make sure that [00:27] I have a collar that's small enough [00:30] there is no chance they're going to be [00:31] slipping out of that collar I want to [00:33] find something that you can adjust and [00:36] personally I like to have a collar [00:37] that's going to have a buckle on it [00:39] ideally because that's going to be the [00:41] safest what you don't need for a collar [00:44] is anything that has any other functions [00:46] cuz realistically you're just looking [00:48] for something that's a well fit so we [00:50] don't need any of these fancy Martingale [00:52] type collars you really don't even need [00:53] to have a collar with fancy patterns [00:55] because they're going to be outgoing it [00:57] so quickly of course if you find [00:58] something that fits them and suits your [01:00] uh your needs in terms of what it looks [01:02] like go for [01:04] it the next thing you need is of course [01:07] a leash to attach to that collar so you [01:08] can take your puppy outside we're going [01:10] to start with what you don't [01:13] need you don't need one of these flexi [01:15] leads you want something that is going [01:17] to help you control your puppy and keep [01:19] them nice and close to you and keep them [01:21] safe so we are going to recommend that [01:23] you're always starting with a 6ot leash [01:25] we prefer leather leashes we find [01:27] they've got great grip you're not going [01:29] to have your hands sliding through that [01:30] and that's going to be the absolute [01:32] safest leash for you and your puppy [01:34] another thing I want to mention is that [01:36] many new families are interested in [01:38] getting their puppies onto a harness [01:39] right away we really don't want to use a [01:41] harness with a baby puppy because that [01:43] teaches them how to pull from a very [01:45] young age so we start all of their [01:47] learning and all of their training on [01:49] that regular collar this is something [01:51] that you might revisit as they get a [01:52] little bit older and have really good [01:54] leash man manners but not something you [01:56] need to worry about right [01:58] away the next thing I want to get for my [02:00] young puppy when they come home is [02:01] something to keep them occupied I love [02:04] to give my dogs something to chew [02:06] something that's going to be safe for [02:07] them even when they're unsupervised in [02:10] their crate is something like these Nyla [02:12] bones you don't want to go with a hard [02:14] nylon bone that you would give to an [02:16] adult dog you want to give something [02:18] softer they specifically make uh puppy [02:20] nylon bones in various shapes and sizes [02:24] that's going to be your best option some [02:25] of them even have some nice flavors [02:27] which are really great for encouraging [02:29] new puppies that aren't sure about [02:30] chewing to get really into chewing this [02:32] is a fabulous way to keep your puppy [02:34] occupied at times where you can't be [02:36] interacting with them this is something [02:38] that I would feel safe giving to my [02:39] puppy and leaving them alone in their [02:41] crate there's only one other product [02:43] that I personally give my puppies in the [02:44] crate and it's right over [02:47] here I really love Kong products they [02:50] make some really great products that are [02:51] great for giving to your puppy um the [02:53] great thing about a Kong is that you can [02:55] stuff it with really healthy items uh [02:57] you can even freeze those Kongs and it [02:59] keeps your puppy occupied again when you [03:01] can't be there to supervise or maybe [03:03] when you are just relaxing and chilling [03:04] out with them at home you know what need [03:06] to make sure that you buy a Kong that is [03:08] an appropriate size for your dog so this [03:11] might be appropriate for a very small [03:13] dog you want to make sure that if you [03:15] have a large breed puppy I would be [03:18] getting a bigger Kong uh unfortunately [03:20] Kongs can be dangerous if you buy one [03:22] that's too small uh because a dog could [03:24] swallow that so you do want to make sure [03:25] you get one that is large enough for the [03:27] breed of dog that you have chosen Kong [03:30] has lots of other products that are [03:32] really fun and interactive I don't [03:35] personally think any of these are [03:36] necessary right off the bat with a baby [03:38] puppy I would stick to the basics right [03:40] now uh the Kong that I showed you [03:42] already I also love to have toys that my [03:45] puppy can play with with me we call [03:48] these interactive toys in fact we sell a [03:50] really fabulous puppy tug that I use [03:52] with all of my puppies from the moment [03:54] they get home these are not toys though [03:56] that I would leave with my puppy [03:58] unsupervised but toys that you can tug [04:01] on interact with have fun if they make [04:04] noise that's a bonus I think for a lot [04:06] of puppies this is something that I do [04:08] uh get for my puppies so that I have [04:10] this ready to go when they come home [04:12] being able to play and tug and interact [04:15] with your puppies are it's such a fun [04:17] way to engage with them and that's [04:19] something that I want to do with them [04:20] from the moment they come home at 8 [04:22] weeks of age having all of these puppy [04:24] Essentials only gets you so far you also [04:27] need to know how to use all of these [04:29] things effectively in your dog training [04:30] this is why we have created a puppy prep [04:32] guide and our puppy Essentials program [04:35] information for both of those programs [04:37] is in the link below this is going to [04:39] guide you through the process of [04:40] training your puppy from the moment they [04:42] come home of course every puppy needs to [04:44] have a safe place to eat so we are going [04:46] to be feeding the puppies out of a very [04:48] basic Bowl you don't really need all the [04:50] bells and whistles when it comes to [04:52] bowls especially um when they're little [04:54] I often just go with a metal dish I [04:56] really like the ones with rubber on the [04:57] bottom I find that they tend to not slip [04:59] as much in the crate uh and that's where [05:01] I personally feed my puppies all of [05:03] their meals so regular metal Bowl uh as [05:06] you find the grow you might go for a [05:08] bigger one I find that these um really [05:11] last for a long time and they don't wear [05:12] very much so this is a fabulous product [05:15] as I mentioned my puppies eat all of [05:17] their meals in their crate so I love to [05:19] have a crate um ready to go from the [05:21] moment my puppy comes home I like to use [05:24] uh two different crates actually I love [05:27] to have a plastic uh crate I usually put [05:31] that uh in my bedroom that's going to be [05:33] where my puppy sleeps at night very [05:35] important that you buy a crate that's [05:37] small enough that uh they learn not to [05:39] pee or poop in their crate most crates [05:42] these days especially the wire ones come [05:44] with a divider you can get that divider [05:47] uh and put that in so that the crate can [05:49] grow as your puppy grows uh [05:51] unfortunately a lot of these plastic [05:53] crates don't have that function so you [05:55] may find that you have to buy more than [05:57] one of these as your puppy grows so that [05:59] eventually they have one that is the [06:01] correct size the wire crates as I [06:03] mentioned though have that divider so [06:05] you may uh decide to buy the crate [06:07] that's going to fit them as an adult dog [06:09] put that divider in and it's going to [06:11] grow as your puppy does a lot of the [06:13] times students ask us about getting beds [06:15] for their puppies you want to be really [06:17] careful about putting a bed in their [06:18] crate when they're little because often [06:20] that encourages them to go to the [06:21] bathroom in their crate on that bedding [06:23] I often do find it helpful to have a [06:26] very simple bed uh sometimes even just [06:29] something like a bath mat uh this is [06:31] going to help a lot with training this [06:32] is something that I will work with my [06:34] puppy when they're out of the crate when [06:36] I can supervise them but I'm not going [06:38] to be putting this in the crate and I'm [06:39] certainly not going to leave my puppy [06:41] unsupervised with a big plushy dog bed [06:43] that they could potentially get bored [06:45] and then start chewing so something like [06:47] this keep it simple when they're little [06:49] you can always buy a bigger bed when [06:51] they are reliable not chewing and you [06:53] know exactly how big they're going to be [06:55] the last thing I think you need to get [06:56] before you have your puppy come home is [06:58] a couple really high quality treats now [07:00] you want to be very careful with treats [07:02] because when you are feeding your young [07:04] puppy you don't know if they're going to [07:06] get an upset stomach from a lot of [07:07] things in fact I [07:10] try the other thing that you're really [07:12] going to want to get ahead of time is [07:13] some great treats for your puppy so come [07:15] on with me I'm going to show you some of [07:16] my [07:19] [Music] [07:20] favorites often when you have a young [07:22] puppy it's important that you start [07:24] their training with just whatever food [07:26] they have been given by the breeder this [07:28] is going to ensure that they have less [07:29] stomach upset you don't want to start [07:32] introducing a whole lot of new [07:33] ingredients uh that the puppy's not used [07:35] to that can cause a really upset stomach [07:37] I also really prefer to have single [07:39] ingredient treats whenever I can things [07:42] like dried chicken dried liver um [07:44] anything like that where I'm not adding [07:46] a whole lot of things to the puppy's [07:47] diet I also really like to have soft [07:50] treats so once you have figured out what [07:52] your puppy can tolerate having a treat [07:54] that you can break up into tiny pieces [07:56] is a really great idea you're not going [07:58] to want to use big hard biscuits because [08:02] that's impossible to break up you want [08:03] to have something that you can break up [08:05] to the size of almost like uh the Eraser [08:08] on the end of a pencil again depending [08:10] on your puppy's breed those treats might [08:11] be bigger or smaller but we really want [08:14] a soft treat something that's easy for [08:15] them to chew easy for them to swallow [08:17] you don't want to slow down your [08:19] training by having them crunching um for [08:20] a long period of time on those treats [08:22] because we're late in the video and I [08:23] know some people have left already I [08:25] want to give those of you that are still [08:26] here information on two products that we [08:29] have purpose-built because we couldn't [08:31] find them anywhere else and they're that [08:32] important the first item is a puppy [08:34] house line This is the absolute first [08:37] thing I put on my puppy every single [08:39] time they come out of their crate [08:40] whenever they are loose in my home and [08:42] I'm watching them they are going to be [08:44] dragging around this line this makes it [08:46] so easy for me to take control stop them [08:49] from doing anything that I don't want [08:50] them to and redirect them easily the [08:53] second item I want to talk about is a [08:55] long line I'm going to put this on the [08:56] puppy every single time they go outside [08:58] even in my fenc in yard I put on this [09:01] long line and they can drag it around [09:03] again allowing me to have fantastic [09:05] control but with a little bit more [09:06] length than the house line if there's [09:08] something that I haven't me mentioned [09:10] today I would love to hear about it if [09:12] there's something you think your puppy [09:13] really does truly need put it in the [09:15] comments section I'd love to hear what [09:16] you think your puppy needs uh coming [09:18] home at 8 weeks of age now that you know [09:20] everything that your puppy needs before [09:22] they come home it's also important that [09:23] you have a game plan for how to handle [09:25] that first night that they come home for [09:27] that information check out this video [09:29] right here on that note I'm instructor [09:32] Meg happy training

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 133/468,~Ken #mccanndogs #leashtraining === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] I'm going to try a bit of a different [00:01] tactic with her right now I actually [00:02] just want to get her out of her head and [00:04] um this is going to seem like I'm [00:06] breaking the rules a little bit but this [00:07] is actually part of being a dog trainer [00:10] so I'm just going to get walking a [00:11] little bit right now I'm going to stop [00:13] sort of ning at her and I'm just going [00:15] to use a little bit of leash pressure [00:16] I'm going to change directions a little [00:17] bit and I'm just going to see if I can [00:18] get her to relax by just getting her to [00:20] move a little bit I think she just needs [00:22] to get out of her head sometimes what [00:24] happens is when we're working with a dog [00:26] that's a little bit unsure if I am too [00:29] picky about my expectation and she [00:31] doesn't really have any opportunity to [00:33] be successful sometimes you can actually [00:35] cause dogs to be a little bit more [00:37] stressed so you're going to see you're [00:39] going to in a moment you're going to see [00:40] I'm going to actually let her walk a [00:41] little further ahead I might actually [00:43] let her walk out um and pull on the [00:45] leash a little bit more than maybe I [00:46] should but I'm making this decision just [00:48] to kind of let her relax a little bit [00:50] when I see I have a little bit more dog [00:52] back I'm going to add my my expectations [00:55] back in now keep in mind this is very [00:57] different than what I would do if I had [00:58] a dog it was like pinging off off the [01:00] leash and trying to jump on everybody's [01:02] going by because they were really um [01:04] rambunctious and overconfident she's a [01:07] little bit overwhelmed so I'm just going [01:09] to um you know soften my Approach a [01:12] little bit with her and see what happens [01:13] okay my love okay let's go had a good [01:16] girl yay I don't want to let her pull [01:20] and drag me but good [01:22] girl but what she's doing right now is [01:25] totally fine good excellent good girl [01:30] nice oops that's it so she gets too far [01:34] ahead I'm just going to give her a [01:35] little bit of adjustment that's too much [01:37] that's it good [01:39] girl good now there's some people going [01:42] across the street over there she just [01:44] gave them a little bit of a look good [01:46] girl just to make sure that I'm still in [01:48] control I'm going to do a little loopd [01:49] here Stevie yay there we go good that's [01:55] it so sometimes doing a little turnar [01:57] around is a great way to reset and to do [01:59] another one here Stevie yes good let's [02:02] go [02:04] yay good for you Steve hey sit [02:10] oh that was good anytime you get to a [02:14] stop walk or a crosswalk here stop sign [02:17] I would always encourage you to stop and [02:19] work a sit with your dog because the [02:21] last thing we want is me to get to the [02:23] edge of the street cars are going by [02:24] people are passing by and I have a dog [02:26] that walks right out into the street in [02:28] fact one of the things that we teach [02:29] teach our dogs is that when we stop [02:31] walking to automatically sit at our side [02:34] even without asking once we get into our [02:35] higher levels for now though I'm just [02:37] can use a little bit of a placement or [02:39] ask her to sit good girl there's a dog [02:42] walking by over there she doesn't seem [02:44] to care too much about that this bush [02:47] seems like it's pretty cool just leave [02:49] that yes good [02:52] girl excellent [02:55] good very nice [02:58] go yeah yes good girl good okay which [03:04] way straight let's give it a go so one [03:08] thing to keep in mind when you're trying [03:09] to work on your sidewalk walking or [03:11] neighborhood walking is that it's not [03:14] really about completing your walk or [03:16] getting all the way around the block or [03:18] whatever your your distance goal is it's [03:21] about what's happening on that walk so I [03:23] could very well spend 20 30 minutes 40 [03:26] minutes out here and I might make it you [03:28] know a block with her um because also [03:31] keep in mind the further you get away if [03:33] things starts to go south and you're too [03:35] far away from home and you don't have [03:37] your treats on you or you don't have [03:38] your things on you it could be a little [03:40] bit messy so I want to make sure that [03:41] I'm really prepared now something that I [03:43] didn't mention before my walk again I'm [03:45] just dog training and talking at the [03:47] same time here there's a car coming by [03:49] and a person crossing the street she's [03:51] making a good choice to check it out but [03:52] she's just sitting which is awesome good [03:54] girl you can see her little nose going [03:56] investigating again good girl yes that's [04:01] excellent here you [04:03] go yes good girl one thing I fa to [04:06] mention before we uh started walking is [04:08] again um Stevie is not my dog now I um [04:12] have a bunch of training equipment with [04:14] me I have her regular collar I have my [04:17] my six foot leather leash I have good [04:18] control but I also have a gedle leader [04:20] in my pocket I also have a two bags of [04:22] extra treats I have a tug toy I have a [04:24] bunch of different things because I [04:25] wasn't quite sure what I would need and [04:27] that's a good idea to to have with you [04:29] as well well have lots of different [04:30] options um with you now you'll notice [04:33] I'm not really stopping to let her sniff [04:36] um there's a lot of people out there [04:37] that talk about sniff walks and sniff [04:40] walks are more something that's actually [04:42] not something that I do with my dogs to [04:43] be perfectly honest if I'm Street [04:46] walking like this sidewalk walking um [04:50] I'm walking we're like out for a bit of [04:52] exercise I would typically have her go [04:54] to the bathroom first or maybe towards [04:56] the end of the Walk um or potty as our [04:59] American friends like to say um and then [05:04] um Missy moo thank you um and then I [05:08] would be out just walking you know if I [05:10] wanted to let her have a bit more [05:11] downtime that might be where I would [05:13] throw my long line on and you know go to [05:15] the park or um baseball diamond or [05:18] something like that and give her a [05:20] little bit more freedom okay another [05:22] little stop walk oh look at that I gave [05:24] her a tiny bit of leash pressure and she [05:26] sat actually all by herself that time [05:28] oopsie oops oops see so there's little [05:32] rules that you can imply here once she's [05:34] sitting I don't want her just to get up [05:36] and do her own thing she got up on her [05:37] own so I just placed her back good girl [05:41] okay we got some clipping or something [05:44] happened over there good [05:46] girl yes okay let's actually move off to [05:49] the side we have a little visitor going [05:51] by come here sit wow there we go yes [05:58] good girl [06:00] okay I'm going to try petting her a [06:01] little bit [06:02] first [06:04] yes good girl it's always such a [06:08] interesting trick when you pet them see [06:10] how how it relaxes them a little bit [06:13] okay let's go okay good [06:17] girl watch your good [06:21] girl very [06:24] nice good so there's a lot more noises a [06:28] lot more things that you're going to [06:29] find when you're out walking like this [06:31] than if you're you know in your backyard [06:34] or um going around the dining room [06:36] whatever it might be just going to fix [06:38] her position here there we go good girl [06:42] so again I don't really expect that she [06:43] heels beside me and stares at my face [06:45] when we're just going for like a walk [06:47] around the neighborhood but I do expect [06:48] that she's Mindful and that she's a bit [06:51] aware so as she gets a little bit too [06:52] far out ahead of me I'm just going to [06:54] reset her a little bit there we go good [06:56] girl I can reset her by physically [06:59] turning all the way around like this [07:02] which usually makes that's better a bit [07:04] more of an impact or I can just pull [07:07] back on the leash and readjust her [07:09] position good so I don't want her [07:11] cutting me off good [07:13] girl good if I find I'm doing it a lot [07:16] like right now it's because she's on a [07:18] little bit more of a high alert we're [07:20] just entering a parking lot here so I'm [07:22] just going to bring her off to the side [07:23] here you can see she's getting a little [07:25] bit overwhelmed sit and I'm just going [07:28] to stop oops and work a [07:30] sit so that controlled sit is just a way [07:33] to kind of get the brain down again get [07:35] a little bit more control good girl just [07:38] leave that just sit that's all you have [07:40] to do is sit good doing something [07:43] stationary is actually a lot easier for [07:46] dogs than actually moving so sometimes [07:48] just finding a quiet spot just off to [07:50] the side just having the dog sit for a [07:51] second there we go good girl there so I [07:56] would actually say the walk is going [07:57] fairly well but um I noticing that she [08:00] is feeling a lot of over overwhelm and [08:02] what I actually think that this [08:03] particular dog would really benefit from [08:06] is finding a spot somewhere where it's [08:08] fairly busy um but somewhere where I can [08:10] be safe and just sort of sit and have [08:12] her watch the world go by and get to the [08:15] point where we actually can get her [08:16] taking food again and get her a little [08:17] bit more relaxed so I'm just going to [08:19] keep going until I can find a spot that [08:21] sort of matches that description and [08:23] then we're just going to hang out for a [08:24] little bit and I'm going to talk to you [08:25] a little bit about um you know why I'm [08:27] going to reward some things how I'm [08:28] going to reward some things sometimes [08:30] people get hung up on the word reward [08:32] being is that it has to be with Treats [08:34] but there's lots of other ways that we [08:35] can reinforce our dogs that doesn't [08:37] necessarily have to be with food like [08:39] she's in a spot right now where she [08:40] doesn't really want the food because she [08:41] doesn't really feel safe and comfortable [08:43] I'm not going to force the food down her [08:45] throat um so there's going to be other [08:47] ways that I can let her know that she's [08:48] doing a great job and that she's okay [08:50] all right my love let's go so sometimes [08:52] walks can consist of finding spots and [08:54] just sort of hanging out with your dog [08:56] especially if they're a dog that needs [08:58] to uh um get a bit more worldly [09:00] experience you know people talk a lot [09:02] about socialization and um sometimes [09:06] people think that that sort of starts [09:07] and ends with like going to dog parks [09:09] and dogs playing with other dogs but [09:11] right now I'm socializing her she is [09:13] seeing all kinds of people and bikes and [09:15] cars and noises and there's construction [09:18] going on um we also call this exposure [09:21] so we have dogs that are learning to [09:23] just be around all of these things and [09:25] learn how to um just be now I don't know [09:30] if she's at the point where she's going [09:31] to take food quite yet and again that's [09:34] a good sign to sort of [09:36] oh oh maybe not get it get it get it get [09:40] it [09:42] here okay that's a good sign good [09:47] girl so again sometimes when they aren't [09:49] taking food it usually means that [09:51] they're a little bit stressed yes good [09:54] girl so I think she's starting to feel a [09:56] little bit more comfortable this is a [09:58] good opportunity to just have them chill [10:00] out while people walk by without [10:02] actually having to see every single [10:04] person that they uh that walks by [10:07] sometimes just learning to chill out as [10:09] people walk by is a great lesson as well [10:11] and then maybe the occasional person can [10:13] stop by and um you know practice saying [10:15] hello or just stand near them while you [10:17] work on the dog training part but we [10:19] want to be careful we just don't let all [10:20] of our expectations fly out the window [10:22] because we happen to be in a different [10:24] situation can you actually walk between [10:28] if you don't mind that would be amazing [10:30] thank [10:32] you [10:33] yes good girl [10:38] hey [10:39] yes uh something that I want to try with [10:41] Stevie is actually tried doing a bit of [10:43] walking with her GLE leader on uh this [10:45] is a tool that her um her family uses [10:48] with her to help with pulling um being a [10:51] GLE leader lover myself and having a dog [10:53] that is um of my own we have a bord [10:55] colia that can sometimes be really [10:57] overwhelmed by loud sounds and things [10:59] that the gator is something that I use [11:01] with her and it really helped build her [11:03] confidence she felt just more [11:04] comfortable on it it also allowed me to [11:06] do far less leash adjustments which for [11:09] you know a dog that's a bit more softer [11:11] mind minded like my own dog and like [11:12] Stevie I think it might be helpful so um [11:15] I'm just going to put it back on and do [11:16] a little bit more of the walk with the [11:19] Gentle Leader on and just sort of see if [11:21] there's um any difference now she is [11:23] used to The Gentle Leader so um [11:26] obviously if you've never used one [11:27] before you're not just going to slap it [11:28] on your face and then go walking in a [11:30] city she's been trained with it she [11:33] understands you know that it's a good [11:34] thing and not a bad thing and um you [11:36] know she's comfortable with it already [11:38] Okay left so my goal right now is you [11:41] know we've been out here working for a [11:42] bit yes good girl I would actually [11:45] really love to just end on a win I would [11:47] like to find maybe somewhere that's a [11:49] bit more less chaotic than this downtown [11:52] that seems to be fire trucks and [11:54] ambulances everywhere currently um and [11:57] just see if I can um you know just get a [12:00] little bit of uh a little bit more [12:01] walking in with less distractions hey [12:03] Miss um and then just see if we can end [12:06] on more more success so we just got back [12:09] to the training facility and I was [12:10] thinking a little bit about the training [12:12] session that we just had with Stevie and [12:14] for those of you watch a lot of our [12:16] videos you'll notice that there's [12:17] usually a clear struggle and then we end [12:20] with a big win with the dog and today's [12:22] video didn't really possess that in a [12:25] very obvious way you might actually look [12:27] at the video and think like gosh the dog [12:28] didn't really you know walk confidently [12:31] by the end of the video but that in [12:33] itself is actually what I consider to be [12:36] a win part of dog training is learning [12:38] about the actual dog and what your plan [12:40] needs to be for them and part of being a [12:42] good leader is making good choices for [12:44] your dog in their dogs training and [12:47] sometimes after you 15 minutes of [12:49] walking your dog in a downtown busy [12:51] place it doesn't necessarily mean that [12:53] you're going to be able to conquer every [12:54] distraction and they're going to walk [12:56] perfectly on a loose leash in fact [12:58] that's probably not going to happen but [13:00] what you are going to learn about is [13:02] what reinforcements you're going to need [13:03] to use what type of environment you need [13:05] to be in how to push your dogs [13:07] distractions um how long to work all of [13:10] those types of things are going to give [13:12] you good information so that you can go [13:14] towards your next training session and [13:15] make a lot better choices which is going [13:17] to give your dog a lot more confidence [13:19] in you so remember wins don't always [13:21] have to be very big very obvious [13:23] sometimes it's about learning the [13:24] situation and learning to do a better [13:26] training job with your dog I would say [13:28] one of our biggest challenges from [13:29] today's walk was uh basically her lack [13:31] of focus sometimes we had a bit of it [13:34] sometimes we didn't have any of it and [13:36] if you find that you're in the same boat [13:37] with your dog you're going to want to [13:38] check out this video right there all [13:40] about how to get more focused with your [13:42] dog on that note I'm kale happy

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 144/468,~Ken #mccanndogs #treattraining === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] so you want to know what the greatest [00:01] treat out on the market is for training [00:03] dogs before I get to that I have a [00:05] little confession to make it's more of a [00:06] frustration actually so we've been [00:08] making YouTube videos for a really long [00:10] time and one of the most common [00:12] questions that we get asked at the end [00:13] of the video after all the things that [00:15] we say is what treat is she using in the [00:19] video and I have to say it's very [00:21] frustrating because that's almost quite [00:24] possibly the least important part of the [00:26] video people are very stuck on getting a [00:29] treat a m treat something that's going [00:31] to make the dog listen and they don't [00:33] realize that the actual biggest thing is [00:36] you now that you found out that I'm not [00:38] going to tell you what that best treat [00:40] is where to buy it how to make it all of [00:42] that stuff I recognize that half of you [00:43] are probably just going to leave the [00:45] video and go somewhere else but for the [00:47] half that's going to stick around you're [00:49] about to find out one of dog training's [00:51] best kept secrets and once you know this [00:53] secret it's going to make every training [00:54] session that you have from here on out [00:56] that much more successful I'm kale [00:58] welcome back to mandon [01:00] [Music] [01:03] I think people really think that when [01:05] they get a treat it's going to have some [01:07] you know magic capability and the dog's [01:09] going to listen to them and treats are [01:11] important and it's important that you [01:12] learn what you know treats motivate your [01:14] dog this video is not about you know the [01:17] fact that you shouldn't use treats if [01:19] you get anything from this video it [01:21] needs to be this treats are tools they [01:24] are not Solutions people think that one [01:26] of the main reasons why I can be [01:27] successful training these dogs that I've [01:29] just met you know two moments before the [01:31] camera is rolling is because of the [01:33] treats that I'm using but there really [01:35] is so much more to it um you know I love [01:38] using treats I think it's really [01:39] important but really what it comes down [01:41] to is my timing my engagement you'll see [01:44] I have a lot of fun with the dogs and [01:46] this um carries on to my own dog [01:47] training as well with my my own personal [01:49] dogs um I love to use treat training in [01:52] the early stages but I know that it's [01:54] not a long-term goal in terms of how [01:56] they listen to me I want them to learn [01:57] to listen to me whether I have food [01:59] whether I I have a toy whether I have [02:00] none of those things whether I have a [02:02] leash whether I don't have a leash I [02:03] want it all to come down to me not the [02:06] actual item or the tool that I'm using [02:09] and so in order to accomplish that I [02:11] need to figure out how to build enough [02:13] of a relationship with a dog that it [02:14] doesn't become about the thing it [02:16] actually becomes solely about me we need [02:19] to talk a little bit about bribery [02:21] because I think a lot of times when [02:22] people use treats uh in training they [02:25] assume that we're bribing the dog to [02:27] listen to us by using the food there is [02:29] some validity to that because in the [02:30] early stages in the m method we do use [02:33] you know a form of bribery but what that [02:35] does not look like is um you know [02:38] bribing our dog to listen to us with [02:40] treats while we're trying to go for a [02:41] half hour walk around the block and our [02:43] dogs have not had any foundational [02:45] training or distraction training or any [02:46] of those things or you know if my dog's [02:48] at the you know leash free park and my [02:50] dog won't come back when it's called [02:52] you're never going to see me taking out [02:54] the cookie bag and shaking it bribing my [02:56] dog to come back that is bribery but [02:58] that is not in the way that you provides [03:00] good effective dog training in our case [03:03] when we use bribery it's only in the [03:06] early early stages of training and it [03:08] would be in a situation where there is [03:10] really nothing else for my dog to look [03:12] at or um compete against it might be in [03:15] a very you know controlled environment a [03:18] room with the RO the doors closed [03:20] there's no other dogs or distractions or [03:22] people around so there's really only one [03:24] place to look and that's me and that [03:26] gives me the opportunity to get lots of [03:28] success but as I start to go further [03:30] along in the training that bribery is [03:33] going to turn more into a reward so it's [03:35] not here's this treat please listen to [03:37] me it's listen to me hey that was a [03:39] great job I happen to have this treat [03:41] for you and then those rewards can [03:43] become more infrequent as the dog's [03:45] reliability gets better and that the um [03:48] message is more about pleasing me and [03:50] not necessarily working for the [03:52] particular thing I have so briber is [03:55] bribery is good but there's a time and [03:57] place for it um in order for it to [03:59] actually [04:00] help you with your journey also I just [04:02] gave myself the ick by saying leash Tre [04:04] Park so please note we do not condone [04:06] leash Parks do not take your dog there [04:08] let's face it there's going to be [04:09] situations that you're going to be in [04:10] with your dog where you're trying to [04:12] motivate them with food you're trying to [04:13] use the treats to get them to listen and [04:15] it is just not working there could be a [04:17] whole whack load of reasons why this is [04:19] happening it could be that they're just [04:20] way too distracted it could be that [04:22] they're stressed or anxious or maybe [04:24] they just don't care to listen to you in [04:26] that situation and unfortunately we [04:28] can't just like you throw in the towel [04:30] and say oh well my dog doesn't not [04:31] listening to the treat so it's just not [04:33] working you know we get a lot of [04:34] comments on our videos that say well my [04:35] dog doesn't like treats so what do I do [04:37] or my dog won't take food in this [04:39] situation so what do I do so this sort [04:41] of reiterates my point is that the food [04:43] is only one aspect it's a tool it's one [04:46] aspect of the training there are all [04:48] kinds of things that you can do to work [04:49] through distractions or Focus or um [04:52] relationship with your dog that doesn't [04:54] begin and end with the food um it could [04:57] be things like um how you're U [05:00] manipulating the dog whether you're you [05:02] know maybe placing them into a Sit um [05:05] maybe it's how you're holding a leash [05:07] maybe it's the tone of voice that you're [05:08] using maybe it's how you physically [05:10] touch the dog pet the dog how you play [05:13] with the dog how you move your body how [05:14] fast you move how slow you move the [05:17] different tones of voice that you use um [05:19] where are you training you know are you [05:21] trying to struggle with your dog in the [05:23] middle of a a busy road where there's [05:26] distractions or are you in your backyard [05:28] or in your kitchen where there's not [05:30] much going on there's so much more to [05:32] using the food and in situations where [05:35] we're working with a dog if we try using [05:37] food maybe a couple different types of [05:38] treats and it's not working we have to [05:41] think about how we're going to go about [05:42] it the other way and sometimes at the [05:44] end of the day um The food doesn't [05:47] really make a difference at all it's you [05:48] get success by giving the dog good clear [05:51] information so all of a sudden the dog [05:53] goes hm you seem like you know what's [05:54] happening you seem like a pretty good [05:56] leader and now the food doesn't become [05:58] important anymore because the dogs more [05:59] interested in doing things in pleasing [06:02] you than they are about actually getting [06:04] that that physical treat something [06:06] really interesting that happens [06:08] sometimes with us as trainers especially [06:10] when we're working you know with our [06:11] students in class is a student will be [06:13] trying to get their dog to do something [06:14] they'll have treat on the dog's nose [06:16] they'll be trying to lure them into a [06:18] sit or walk at their side and the dog [06:19] just will not pay attention and I will [06:22] take the same dog I will take the treat [06:24] from their hand so same treat and I will [06:26] attempt the skill with the dog and the [06:28] dog does it no problem and um I'm sure [06:31] it's quite disheartening for the student [06:32] and it doesn't really make sense how [06:34] could we be doing the exact same thing [06:36] and the dog give us completely different [06:38] types of responses and really what it [06:40] comes down to is the type of [06:42] relationship you have with the dog when [06:44] a dog does something with me for the [06:45] first time um or any of our trainers [06:47] it's not me specifically um I know how [06:50] to move my body I know how to use my [06:51] voice I exude leadership I know how to [06:55] communicate with the dog in other ways [06:57] that doesn't have to do with that treat [06:59] with the student that dog and student [07:01] have had a long history together that [07:03] dog probably knows that that person [07:05] doesn't have follow through that they [07:07] aren't a strong leader um maybe they're [07:09] confusing in the way that they deliver [07:11] information so the dog says well you [07:13] confuse me I'm not too sure I don't [07:15] think I want to work for you and then [07:16] you know in steps a person that maybe [07:18] has a bit more confidence a little bit [07:20] more clarity and the dog says H finally [07:22] somebody that can show me the way [07:24] somebody that can teach me what to do so [07:26] again it's not about that treat what you [07:28] want to do is learn about how to be a [07:30] good leader how to communicate with your [07:32] dog effectively so that you can get your [07:34] dog to listen to you no matter what the [07:36] situation may be it is really important [07:38] that you stop using treats as a crutch I [07:41] want to share with you one of the [07:42] exercises that we do in our classes that [07:44] I find so fascinating we'll be working [07:47] on you know let's go walking walking a [07:49] lead everybody in the classroom's got [07:50] their bait bag on full of treats and [07:52] they're all moving around focusing on [07:54] giving the dogs treats and there's not [07:56] much energy to the room and people are [07:58] sort of moving it's sort of a boring way [08:00] dogs are distracted and you would think [08:01] because the food's there that they would [08:03] be getting more attention one of the [08:04] exercises that we'll sometimes do is [08:06] stop everybody make them take their B [08:08] bag off leave it off to the side and [08:10] then head out onto the floor training [08:12] their dogs without any food and you have [08:15] never seen so many people use their [08:17] voice use their touch bring out all of [08:19] this extra animation because we've taken [08:21] their little crutch away we've removed [08:23] the food and now that they don't have [08:25] the food they have to focus on other [08:27] things that they can do to get their [08:28] dog's attention and you know what [08:30] happens to the dogs walking in attention [08:33] it gets better now at first people sweat [08:36] they're a little panicky because we're [08:37] taking that exciting thing away from [08:38] them but as soon as they start engaging [08:40] the dog they start changing their Pace [08:42] they start interacting with the dogs all [08:44] of a sudden the dog goes holy there's [08:46] like a party happening up there and all [08:48] of their attention comes up and then you [08:50] know I often say why can't you guys do [08:52] this when the treats are there because I [08:53] think sometimes it's easy to fall into [08:56] just using the food as a reward and you [08:58] know you know being silent or not [09:00] thinking about some of the other [09:01] motivators that we have on our body all [09:04] of the time um that actually can work [09:06] just as well as food sometimes we're [09:08] talking about some pretty deep Dog [09:10] Training Concepts today it's not really [09:11] our our normal how-to uh dog training [09:15] video that we typically put out but it's [09:17] really important that if you're going to [09:18] understand the what you've got to know [09:20] the why that's why we've developed an [09:22] amazing online program because we know [09:24] not every dog and person uh needs the [09:27] same information so we have a flexible [09:29] program that allows a professional dog [09:31] trainer to be there to answer your [09:33] questions and to help you understand [09:34] these deep Concepts so that you can [09:35] actually get great results today's video [09:37] was inspired by a YouTube video we shot [09:39] not that long ago where I worked with a [09:41] dog in a busy City and it was a dog that [09:44] didn't really like food so I had to [09:46] sweat but I also got some success so if [09:49] you want to check that out click right [09:50] there on that note I'm kale happy [09:53] training

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 156/468,#mccanndogs #dogtraining === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] I've been checking out the comment [00:01] section on some of our videos and you [00:03] guys ask great questions but there's one [00:06] common thing that I noticed does not [00:07] come up in the comment section and that [00:09] is about using your voice now this is a [00:12] really common thing that people [00:15] completely underestimate they're either [00:16] using their voice too much or they're [00:18] not using it enough and sometimes it can [00:21] completely change what kind of response [00:22] you get from your dog one of the common [00:24] mistakes that people make is using their [00:26] voice too much in their training and [00:29] this can actually go in a couple [00:30] directions the first is sometimes people [00:32] are making a special effort to use so [00:34] much voice that they end up sounding [00:36] like the Charlie Brown character from [00:38] the [00:39] speaker so they end up saying good boy [00:42] that's the way here this way sit [00:44] down until the dog s of doesn't they [00:46] can't even pick out what commands that [00:48] you're um that you're giving your dog it [00:50] all just sounds like one straight thing [00:52] so you want to make sure that you are [00:53] very selective in what you're telling [00:55] your dog give your dog a clear cue make [00:57] it clear concise easy to follow and then [01:00] for a second to see what your dog's [01:01] reaction is and then from there you can [01:03] follow through with your voice and your [01:04] praise the second thing would be [01:06] repetition and I think this is probably [01:08] the more common problem a lot of us like [01:09] to repeat our commands over and over [01:12] again in hopes that the dog will [01:13] eventually listen Marley Marley No [01:17] marleyyy now what we strive for here at [01:20] McAn dogs is that our dog learns to [01:21] listen to The First Command so we don't [01:24] have to call our dogs five or six or 10 [01:26] or 50 times you know from the backyard [01:28] to come in we want to make sure that we [01:30] can give one command and get a response [01:32] so this is where follow-through comes in [01:34] if you give a command one time and you [01:36] don't get a response you're going to go [01:37] through the necessary steps to teach [01:39] them they need to listen that first time [01:41] you [01:43] call now you're probably reaching for [01:45] that volume button because you couldn't [01:47] hear that could you and that's exactly [01:48] how your dog feels when you're out [01:50] trining them and you are giving them no [01:52] feedback with your voice it is time to [01:54] stop worrying about what others think [01:56] about you and that you might sound a [01:57] little silly when you're out there [01:58] training because it's going be more [02:00] effective for your dog now would you [02:02] rather you know look silly in front of a [02:04] stranger walking the street for 3 [02:06] seconds or use your voice to engage your [02:08] dog and motivate them and get actually [02:10] great training done with a dog that [02:12] you're going to have for the next 12 [02:13] years people don't realize how effective [02:16] using your voice in your dog training [02:17] can be especially if you're in a place [02:20] around lots of distractions you we often [02:22] talk about using treats and in your body [02:24] language but you know we don't emphasize [02:27] enough how important the voice is in [02:28] fact your voice is something have on you [02:30] all of the time so if you can learn to [02:32] use it in an animated way you're not [02:34] going to be so dependent on some of [02:36] those other training tools because you [02:37] can use your voice to excite them and to [02:39] motivate them um anytime that you need [02:42] to I want you to think about your tone [02:43] and inflection when you're training your [02:45] dog another common mistake that people [02:47] make is they end up teaching their their [02:49] dogs to only listen when they're [02:50] speaking in an angry tone and this [02:52] usually comes from people repeating [02:54] their commands over and over again and [02:55] getting more frustrated each time so [02:58] they end up saying sit sit sit and then [03:01] the dog learns oh I better listen to you [03:02] you actually sound pretty mad to me we [03:04] really would prefer our dogs to be able [03:05] to listen the first time and we want to [03:07] be able to speak in a really clear and [03:09] concise tone and not have any anger to [03:11] it the second thing you want to think [03:12] about is making sure that your voice [03:14] doesn't sound like the command as a [03:16] question or that you're singing the [03:18] command to the dog you know it's [03:19] important that when we give a command it [03:21] sounds very clear and concise not [03:23] optional so if I'm saying sit sit um a [03:27] lot of dogs learn over time not to take [03:29] that that very seriously so make sure [03:30] that you're very clear and concise with [03:32] your delivery and that your expectation [03:34] is super clear to truly understand how [03:36] to effectively use your voice and [03:38] training I'm going to break it into [03:39] three categories for you the first one [03:41] is going to be your Q or your command [03:43] and we typically want to use our voice [03:45] in a really happy but yet you know clear [03:47] and concise type of tone of voice ready [03:50] I'm going to say the verbal first on [03:51] your bed good boy lie down yes good boy [03:56] now I'm going to reward a couple times [03:58] before he has a chance to get up [04:00] and then I want it to be my idea that he [04:02] comes off the bed okay good boy the [04:05] second one is going to be um our [04:07] negative reprimand so that could be when [04:09] we need to you know interrupt our dog [04:11] for something perhaps you know scold [04:13] them for peeing on the carpet or [04:15] whatever it might be and when we use [04:16] this tone of voice we want to be um [04:19] assertive with how we deliver it t [04:21] typically using lower tones um being [04:23] quick and sharp with how we say it so [04:25] our puppies learn within 1 second and [04:27] the way we're going to let them know [04:28] that having an accident in the house is [04:30] wrong by is by being right there when [04:33] they do it really you want to scold them [04:36] or interrupt them when they're in the [04:37] act of going to the washroom and um one [04:40] of the things that I would suggest that [04:41] you do is just go for a startle effect [04:43] you don't need to do anything too crazy [04:45] but I will usually um you know raise my [04:47] voice or give a verbal reprimand I might [04:50] clap my hands hey hey hey what are you [04:51] doing something that sort of surprises [04:53] them doesn't scare them but surprises [04:55] them to the point where they sort of go [04:56] oh gosh what's happening and then the [04:57] last one probably the most important is [04:59] going to be our positive reinforcement [05:01] and it's really important that if I ever [05:03] use any type of negative reinforcement I [05:06] immediately follow it by changing my [05:08] voice into a more upbeat and happy tone [05:10] and this is what we refer to as praise [05:12] and for some dogs this can actually end [05:14] up being reward for your dog um and [05:17] you're going to use happy tones uh [05:19] upbeat you can clap you can play you can [05:21] do all kinds of things to make it a bit [05:22] more cheery and this is to ensure that [05:24] the dog gets the clear information you [05:26] listen to the queue if you make a [05:28] mistake I'm going to let you know no but [05:30] we're going to pay off with sunshine and [05:31] Roses when things go great and you're [05:33] going to change your voice so it's never [05:35] confusing as to what your intention is [05:38] with what you're asking Maple Yay good [05:41] girl yes good Maple hey hey yay oops [05:45] right here yes good girl there we go yes [05:50] good excellent so she's disconnected I'm [05:53] going to use Alicia corrector may pull [05:56] this way yeah good choice good this way [06:01] oops she she a bit distracted yeah there [06:03] she is good this way yeah wow good can [06:09] you sit wow you're a little bit crooked [06:11] but that's okay we've never done that [06:12] before in dog training words have power [06:15] you know if I was to say to you if you [06:16] were my dog and I was to say to you [06:17] fluffy come here sit down that is you [06:21] know a pretty easy thing for a human to [06:22] understand you'd probably come over and [06:24] sit down beside me if you were a dog [06:26] though it would sound like fluffy come [06:28] here sit down fluffy response is a [06:31] response to name and in our world it [06:33] simply means just look at me come means [06:36] get here as fast as you possibly can [06:37] stop everything that you're doing here [06:40] means come to me but you don't have to [06:42] be in an emergency about it sit means [06:44] sit and down means down so that's five [06:47] different commands that I would have [06:49] said to the dog and if I'm using them [06:51] interchangeably like that it's really [06:52] hard for the dog to know what to do a [06:55] lot of people end up giving their dogs [06:56] wrong or very confusing commands um you [06:59] and that's why with us we like to have [07:02] two different expectations for Words um [07:05] even though they sort of seem like the [07:06] same exercise so for example I just said [07:08] come and here um or we could use stay [07:11] and wait or in some situations off and [07:14] down for the average person they all [07:16] sort of sound like it's the same [07:17] exercise but we know that as a person we [07:20] aren't consistent and people typically [07:22] aren't consistent and what happens is if [07:24] I have an expectation of the word like [07:26] come for example I expect my dog to race [07:28] to me as fast as with as fast as they [07:30] can stop everything that they're doing [07:32] every single time that I say come now if [07:34] I'm also using come when my dog's you [07:36] know napping on the couch I want them [07:38] just to come into the kitchen with me or [07:41] um I you know I want them to just move [07:43] towards me there's no emergency um or [07:45] perhaps you have a family member that [07:47] says come come come come now what [07:49] happens if your dog's in the forest [07:51] chasing after a deer and you say come [07:53] come come and the dog says well you know [07:55] I don't have to do it you know quickly [07:57] in this context why would I have to do [07:59] it quickly in that context so we know [08:01] just to help humans be consistent it's [08:03] really helpful to have words that have [08:05] specific weight behind them so we teach [08:08] if we say come there is no if ands butts [08:11] about it you get your butt here as [08:12] quickly as possibly can whereas here we [08:14] might allow the dog to be a bit more [08:16] relaxed um the same thing goes for stay [08:18] and wait you know if we say the word [08:20] stay to the dog it means do not move no [08:23] matter what I personally would use it in [08:25] a more of an emergency situation whereas [08:28] weight can sort of be used in a more [08:30] flexible situation where I want the dog [08:32] just to hold on for a second before they [08:34] are allowed to you know get out of the [08:36] car or run down the stairs or whatever [08:37] it might be now we're going to get into [08:39] some pretty deep dog training stuff here [08:41] and this is one of the things that I [08:42] love most about our inperson and online [08:44] training classes because we can actually [08:46] take the time to really teach you about [08:49] how all of this stuff works this also [08:51] means that all of the family members [08:53] learn more about how to be consistent [08:54] with their words how to use their voice [08:56] and how to have good expectations when [08:59] it com comes to the certain cues that [09:00] you use now if you're still here [09:02] listening to this video it means that [09:03] you actually care about affecting change [09:05] in your dog training now I want you to [09:07] let me know in the comments below which [09:09] of the concepts that we spoke about [09:10] today you a are frustrated the most with [09:13] or B you're going to get outside and [09:15] start working on right away now before [09:17] you go outside you're going to want to [09:18] watch this video right here it's all [09:20] about how to get better attention from [09:21] your dog and that only comes when you're [09:23] using your voice correctly on that note [09:25]

thinking [00:09] how do you get your puppies to come to [00:10] you when you call them then now today [00:12] we're going to be breaking down some [00:13] really important foundation steps that [00:15] make sure that later on your puppy [00:17] learns to come the first time every time [00:19] I'm kale this is roie welcome back to [00:22] Mand [00:24] dogs so before I show you how we're [00:27] going to do this puppy recall training I [00:28] need to talk about my setup today [00:30] because everything is very intentional [00:32] I'm in the living room there are no [00:34] other distractions around uh puppies in [00:36] the crate ready to go I have some of her [00:38] kibble I have some extra goodies in my [00:40] bait bag as well so that uh I can use [00:43] that to motivate her she's hungry she [00:44] hasn't had all of her breakfast uh and I [00:47] also have my long line or my house line [00:49] and the reason why this is important is [00:51] that I do not want to give her an [00:53] opportunity to run away and do her own [00:55] thing during this training I need [00:57] something that's going to help me keep [00:58] her engaged and this is something that I [01:00] use all of the time when she's in the [01:02] house hi puppet good girl okay hi so the [01:07] second my puppy comes out of the crate [01:10] I'm going to put here we go I'm going to [01:12] put the house line on her collar now [01:14] again this is not my puppy I'm just [01:16] borrowing her for today although I don't [01:18] I'm not sure I will give her back [01:19] because she's so cute um so just going [01:22] to work a little bit of Engagement hi [01:23] lovea good girl now we're getting a lot [01:26] of jumping we're getting a lot of [01:28] excitement I'm not going to get her in [01:29] trouble for that right right now because [01:30] I want to keep her sort of attitude up [01:32] and I'm just going to practice getting [01:34] her engaged there we go good girl now in [01:37] terms of teaching her to respond to a [01:39] recall and again our expectation is [01:41] eventually when I call her to come or [01:43] here or use her name I need her respond [01:46] on the very first try so my goal here is [01:48] to make sure that before I give any [01:50] words that I have engagement and she's [01:53] pretty hungry so this is working well [01:55] for me okay so I'm going to start with [01:57] some food on her nose I'm going to give [01:59] my a little room to back up good girl [02:02] here here here yes good girl now you may [02:07] have noticed in that repetition that I [02:09] us the word here and specifically did [02:11] not say the word come and the reason for [02:14] that is that we want to make sure that [02:15] as our dogs get older they have a 100% [02:19] reliability to a come command and we [02:21] have certain methods that we are going [02:22] to be using in order to teach that in [02:25] order to get there though we need to [02:26] build a really solid foundation of the [02:28] Puppy learning to come reliably to us [02:31] and in this case we like to use phrases [02:33] like here here here or even oh look at [02:35] you stiner or even the puppy's name [02:38] because I can get a lot of great [02:39] valuable repetitions in uh building [02:41] success getting her motivated and that's [02:43] going to sort of prime the pump get her [02:45] excited for the new steps that'll add in [02:48] teaching the actual come command so [02:50] typically we're not going to do that [02:51] until the puppy's a little bit older [02:53] right now though we need a lot of [02:55] rehearsal of the idea of the process now [02:58] when she gets close I'm going to yes and [02:59] reward her now you'll notice I've taken [03:02] my freehand the one that does not have [03:03] any treats in it and I'm just slipping [03:05] it in her collar and there's a few [03:07] reasons why we do this number one she [03:09] can't jump up on me and bought me in the [03:11] nose but number two there okay good girl [03:14] we dropped a couple there are going to [03:15] be many times in her life [03:18] where yay there's going to be many times [03:22] in her life where I need to hook a Le on [03:24] or I need to pick her up and a lot of [03:26] puppies who haven't had a lot of [03:27] conditioning when we reached on to pick [03:29] up uh to hold their collar that's a [03:31] really common time where they're going [03:32] to jump up nip and bite um run away [03:35] avoid you taking a hold of them but if [03:37] she's had hundreds and hundreds of [03:39] repetition of me taking her collar while [03:41] she's getting cookies and treats she's [03:43] not going to be too worried about it so [03:44] if I was in a situation where my puppy [03:46] was you know hanging out trying to get [03:48] things out of the Toy Bin there at this [03:50] age at 13 weeks old I would not call her [03:53] and expect that she turned I would love [03:55] that that would happen but I do not want [03:56] to put her in a situation where she's [03:58] going to ignore me so if this was the [03:59] scenario I would approach her I would [04:01] step on the long line so she couldn't [04:02] grab something and take off with it I [04:04] would get some treats ready and I would [04:06] get her attention hey good here here [04:10] here yay good [04:13] girl so again I knew with full [04:16] confidence that when I was going to call [04:17] her she was going to respond and this is [04:19] the stuff that a lot of people miss or [04:21] skip because it requires a lot of work [04:24] in a lot of consistency most people [04:26] would call their puppy a few times um [04:28] They Might Get Loud powder they might [04:30] you know shake the cookie bin whatever [04:32] it might be but then the puppy doesn't [04:33] learn to really listen so she's [04:34] distracted again so I can do this here [04:38] here here yay good girl again notice I [04:42] didn't say anything until I got my [04:44] puppy's attention good girl I'm [04:47] basically associating the word here [04:50] means you need to do this behavior that [04:52] way she's not hearing the word and not [04:54] not actually doing the behavior for me [04:56] here here yay good girl [05:00] I don't love that you just put your paws [05:02] up on the counter but that was good here [05:05] here yes good [05:08] girl good okay so I'm going to give her [05:10] a little jackpot so jackpot means you're [05:12] going to reward multiple times because I [05:15] called her I didn't have to show her any [05:17] cookies and she turned all on her own [05:19] good girl I'm going to just move towards [05:21] those distractions again [05:25] okay here here here yes good girl I [05:30] would rate that like a six out of 10 I [05:31] said it once she didn't really give me a [05:33] great response and then she did turn so [05:35] I'm not going to make as big of a deal [05:36] out of it and what I'm going to do cuz I [05:38] I want her to turn fast I'm going to [05:40] help her this time okay go check that [05:43] out here here here that's how fast I [05:47] want so you can use the repetition of [05:49] command followed by some type of lure in [05:52] which we C we call stimulus so command [05:54] stimulus reward um to get the dog to [05:57] turn faster good girl what I do not want [05:59] to do is get to a scenario where I'm [06:01] calling her name over and over and over [06:03] again or saying here here here whatever [06:04] words you're using and not get a [06:06] response okay I'm going test you one [06:07] more [06:10] time here yay good here that's what I [06:15] want yes good girl now take note of how [06:20] I'm rewarding her you'll notice I'm [06:22] rewarding her in a way that the [06:23] attention is on me so I'm not feeding [06:25] her with her butt towards me looking at [06:27] the distraction I'm intention making [06:30] sure she's facing me her attention is up [06:32] towards me again I can reach down and [06:35] take her collar while I'm continuing to [06:37] reward what a good puppet do I don't [06:40] want her to think that treats fly [06:42] magically out of the sky and into her [06:44] mouth I want her to understand that the [06:45] rewards are for coming into me [06:47] specifically wow good girl so while [06:50] you're practicing this you could use um [06:52] you know intentional distractions you [06:54] know I know that there's some treats and [06:56] toys and all kinds of goodies in that [06:57] bin pretty likely that a puppy would be [06:59] distracted by it you could use a family [07:01] member or you could just wait till your [07:02] puppy's naturally distracted but again [07:05] the goal is to try to make sure that [07:06] you're not getting to the habit of [07:08] repeating yourself over and over and [07:09] over again as your puppy ignores you [07:11] again they are a puppy they don't know [07:13] any different our goal right now is to [07:15] ensure that the early stages of the of [07:18] training whatever recall command that [07:20] you're going to use is mainly built on [07:22] the puppy doing it successfully which [07:24] means we need to put a little extra work [07:27] into the situation I can already see it [07:29] in the comments people are saying you [07:30] guys just work with trained puppies now [07:32] remember this puppy is 13 weeks old she [07:35] has not had much training she also [07:36] doesn't belong to me and this is the [07:38] first time that we're training together [07:40] and I want to talk about some of the [07:41] reasons why your training sessions could [07:44] feel a little bit more frustrating than [07:46] the one that you just saw me do which [07:48] hopefully looked really easy the first [07:50] thing that I did to set myself up for [07:51] success is I asked uh Ro's owner to not [07:54] give her her full breakfast so I have [07:56] some of her breakfast in my hand right [07:58] now we've added a couple extra little [07:59] goodies but Ro's hungry it's midm [08:02] morning she's only had a tiny bit of her [08:04] her breakfast which means she was a [08:06] little bit more eager to work for the [08:07] food in my hand a big mistake people [08:09] make is they give their puppy breakfast [08:11] and then they set out to do training and [08:12] wonder why their puppies aren't [08:14] interested anymore so a hungry puppy is [08:16] often a a more willing participant in [08:19] the training session second thing is [08:21] that I have a house line on roie which [08:24] means if she decided at any time that [08:27] she was just going to go off and do her [08:28] own thing she wouldn't have been able to [08:30] I could step on this line and redirect [08:32] her attention back to me again this is a [08:35] common mistake that people make they go [08:36] to train their puppies or just let their [08:38] puppies be in the house and they don't [08:40] have a leash or line on the puppy which [08:42] means they have a lot more opportunity [08:44] to go and go anywhere they want or make [08:47] any decision that they want without us [08:48] having a quick ability to get our puppy [08:52] attention back that brings me to my next [08:54] point which could be one of the more [08:55] important ones and that is timing having [08:58] a house line on allows me to ensure that [09:01] I'm not repeating myself over and over [09:03] again or that she's not hearing a [09:05] command and then you know getting [09:07] information several seconds later it's [09:10] really important that when we're [09:11] teaching our puppy to do anything new or [09:13] we're giving them feedback giving them [09:15] information we do it with good timing [09:17] remember puppies learn within one second [09:20] so if she's in a distraction and she's [09:22] having a ball ripping something apart or [09:24] eating something for several minutes [09:26] before I come in and do anything about [09:28] it it's bad information the same thing [09:30] goes with a puppy recall if I call her [09:33] to come to me I need to make sure that [09:35] within one second of her hearing that [09:37] here here here command she's immediately [09:40] shown what to do so that she can pair [09:42] that expectation along with the word [09:44] that I'm trying to train her to do [09:46] excellent girl another thing is the [09:49] environment too often we're putting our [09:51] puppies into a situation where we're [09:52] trying to teach them or we have a [09:54] certain expectation but their [09:56] surroundings are actually lending the [09:58] puppy to make choices because there's [10:00] just too many distractions around so [10:02] today I had baby gates up I had uh we [10:05] were enclosed in the living room we have [10:07] no other distractions around I have my [10:09] crate nearby if I need it she doesn't [10:11] really have a lot of opportunity to look [10:13] anywhere else but me you're not going to [10:15] see us do these initial foundation [10:17] training you know outside or at a park [10:20] or on the sidewalk we're going to try [10:22] and control the environment until the [10:24] puppy has more rehearsal of doing it [10:26] successfully by sort of you know [10:28] adopting that white room process of [10:30] making sure that the only thing that's [10:31] exciting that's happening is me and what [10:34] I'm asking of the puppy and that again [10:36] gets more reliability and has a has a [10:38] puppy that's more focused and that's how [10:40] they appear to be trained it's because [10:42] I'm not battling any other distractions [10:44] again we want to work towards that but [10:46] when I'm teaching the foundation steps [10:49] this is how I need to begin having a [10:51] reliable recall leads your dog to being [10:53] able to be off leash and you not having [10:55] a worry in the world as to whether [10:57] they're going to come back or not but in [10:58] order to get that type of reliability it [11:00] does take a lot of hard work and [11:02] practice that's why the recall is one of [11:04] the main exercises that we work on in [11:06] our life skills program because we know [11:07] it is just that important now a lot of [11:09] people call us dog trainers but we are [11:11] actually people trainers and we take a [11:13] lot of pride in that so if you want to [11:14] learn more about our programs check out [11:16] Mand do.

You are paying your dog for focusing their attention on you. So during this exercise, you are teaching your dog a few things. You are teaching them the communication channels, and you are teaching them that it's a good thing to look at you. The exercise goes as follows: you get the dog’s attention, and once the dog is looking at you, you use your continuation-marker, and then you deliver the reward. Once your dog eats the reward and looks back at you, you are going to use your terminal-marker and move away from your dog, encouraging your dog to come and get the reward. You will continue to do sessions of this exercise until your dog is conditioned to these two markers."

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 196/468,com/nateschoemer/ === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] [Music] [00:07] alright perfect thank you so much [00:09] everybody for joining us this is the [00:11] first episode of the nate shomer show so [00:13] I'm very excited about this and I'm here [00:15] with Bethany Prudhomme I said that [00:18] correctly so Bethany and I have we [00:20] trained together she's a dog trainer [00:21] that I've worked with in the past she is [00:23] phenomenal so we're gonna be talking [00:24] about dog training different things that [00:26] people might run into when they're [00:28] working with their dog maybe some [00:30] misconceptions that people have and [00:32] we're just gonna have fun we're gonna [00:32] talk about dogs so thank you so much [00:35] honestly for taking the time to come out [00:36] or allowing us to come out to do the [00:39] episode of course thanks for having me [00:40] thank you so what I want to do I want to [00:42] start right off with just hearing a [00:43] little bit about your dog training [00:45] philosophies and principles I want [00:46] people to be able to learn from this [00:48] podcast and take something away from it [00:50] okay so I've been training dogs [00:52] professionally since 2010 I used to flip [00:58] up in San Cisco I have an old well now [01:01] she's almost 13 but she was a lab [01:04] Shepherd mix and I kind of got thrown [01:06] into dog training because my dog [01:09] actually attacked my friend's dog she [01:11] lived with the another small dog so I [01:13] thought she was fine she went to the dog [01:15] park I didn't know any better and she [01:17] just picked up the dog like towel and [01:20] just shook it and punctures and drains [01:21] and everything and I was kind of like oh [01:23] my gosh what happened and I was looking [01:25] for a trainer I couldn't really find [01:27] anybody that I liked everybody there [01:28] just wanted to shove treats in her face [01:30] or you know be really hard on her so I [01:32] started studying and I went to a couple [01:34] different schools I had an internship [01:36] with the gentleman named Kenneth Brown [01:39] up in San Luis Obispo who worked at the [01:40] woods Humane Society worked him for a [01:43] couple years moved back down to Orange [01:45] County worked at a place called [01:46] crossroads pet resort then started my [01:49] own business a few years back and I've [01:51] been working with peach dogs ever since [01:53] what were the dog training schools that [01:56] you went to I went through a program [01:57] called animal behavior college which [01:59] save your money I chose that program [02:02] because I had an internship attached but [02:05] you really if you know what you're [02:06] looking for just find a good dog trainer [02:08] to study under because a lot of it just [02:10] you need the hand [02:12] on and I thought the program had a lot [02:14] the internship is a lot longer than it [02:16] was so I don't really recommend that [02:19] program anymore but I did go through [02:22] that and that's how I got the internship [02:24] which I was very thankful for and I [02:26] learned a lot working under Ken Brown up [02:28] in Santa's bow and then working with the [02:31] shelter up there Woods Humane Society [02:33] you have a few other certifications [02:35] though yeah so I have the crossroads [02:38] they had us get the like the [02:40] certification council professional dog [02:42] trainers and you have to go and take [02:43] like a 300 or 400 question test and it's [02:47] from a third party so it's not like [02:48] their program certifies you it's a third [02:51] party so they have no interest in [02:52] whatever program and it tests you on [02:54] pathology and learning theory and you [02:57] know different sicknesses and things [02:59] like that and then if you pass then you [03:01] get certified [03:02] but unfortunately the bad thing about [03:03] dog training is an art no certification [03:05] so you don't have to be certified to be [03:08] a dog trainer so Joe Schmo can go out [03:10] tomorrow and print out business cards [03:11] and also and he's a dog trainer so it [03:13] makes it hard if you are looking for a [03:15] dog trainer to find somebody who [03:18] actually knows what they're doing [03:19] because you have to kind of shift [03:21] through all kinds of bad trainers we'll [03:24] take your money and leave your dog off [03:25] worse than you brought them in so cheap [03:28] necessarily not it's not necessarily [03:30] better if you're gonna have a good dog [03:33] trainer you're gonna spend a little bit [03:34] of money for it and it's not that there [03:37] are no certifications there are [03:38] certifications but it's not a regular or [03:40] not industry exactly you don't have to [03:41] have it's not licensed it's not [03:43] regulated you can get certifications but [03:46] they're not required so somebody who [03:49] just like you said may have had pet dogs [03:51] their entire life and they believe [03:53] they're an expert because they've had [03:54] their pet dogs that they've had a couple [03:55] even German Shepherds for some reason [03:58] people assumed that they had a German [03:59] Shepherd they have more of an expertise [04:01] level than somebody who had a golden now [04:03] they're dishing out advice and they're [04:05] offering up services to people and [04:06] that's the problem with the doctoring [04:07] industry you could go get your hair cut [04:09] and ask your barber what you should do [04:10] about your dog that jumps up they're [04:12] gonna give you advice the problem is [04:14] they have you know the expertise of [04:16] working with maybe they're five dogs [04:18] that they grew up with in their whole [04:19] life I have you know more than 500 dogs [04:22] that I've trained so dog training is [04:24] really [04:24] it's based in science but there's also a [04:27] big art portion of you know it's all [04:29] opera and classical conditioning but [04:31] know when to use what with which dog to [04:34] get the results and this person can [04:36] follow through and that's the art of it [04:37] just because I can walk with a clicker [04:39] and food and use a remote collar or a [04:42] pinch collar or a flexi or a harness or [04:44] you know whatever it doesn't mean that [04:46] you can you know for some puppies they [04:49] jump up I say turn your back ignore it [04:50] well guess what if the owner is you know [04:53] 80 years old and her puppy is a nine [04:55] month old Great Dane that lady's gonna [04:56] go flying when she turns her back so you [04:58] can't use that same method for each dog [05:01] so you have to again you have to know [05:03] the science behind the wise but you also [05:05] have to have that art portion to know to [05:09] know what to use with each person with [05:11] each dog to help them reach their goals [05:12] and this is actually a really important [05:14] conversation to have I'm glad you [05:16] brought it up too because a lot of [05:17] people do run into those issues where [05:19] they have a problem and this is [05:21] something that scares me with a lot of [05:22] situations that somebody might have they [05:24] might have a dog that has issues and [05:26] they contact a professional dog trainer [05:29] at least according to the person's [05:30] website exactly right and then they go [05:32] to this professional dog trainer and [05:34] this dog trainer is not able to help [05:36] them with the dog and as a consequence [05:38] of that this dog ends up in a shelter [05:40] because the person says well I hired a [05:42] trainer it didn't work out so obviously [05:45] the time to fix a dog it's the dogs fall [05:47] and they take the dog to the shelter so [05:48] what could people do in order to [05:51] effectively find the right dog trainer [05:53] what certain things that you would [05:55] recommend based on your experience [05:56] because you know we want this to reach [05:58] everybody within the country so there's [06:00] gonna be people in different locations [06:01] what's a good way for them to find [06:03] somebody that can help them with their [06:05] issue don't be selfish that's I don't [06:08] remember who posted it but somebody was [06:11] saying the biggest problem with and it [06:12] was on Facebook so I can't remember who [06:13] it was but I'd love to give them credit [06:15] if I could think of it they said you [06:16] know what's the biggest mistake or [06:18] what's the biggest problem that people [06:19] have with their dogs and so they're [06:20] selfish people are selfish they want to [06:22] feel good training their dog well the [06:24] world's not full of rainbows and [06:25] butterflies and unicorns you know [06:27] sometimes it's not you can't always use [06:29] just positive reinforcement with every [06:31] single dog some dogs you can if you [06:34] start that puppy at eight weeks old I [06:35] can do almost everything and get that [06:37] dog totally [06:37] leash if I have that dog motivated I can [06:41] use food I can use you know just a flat [06:43] collar or a harness in food and I can [06:44] get that dog to be phenomenal you give [06:46] me that dog that's eight months old [06:48] that's been in the shelter who hasn't [06:49] been bonded who's been bounced from [06:51] house to house to house who has learned [06:53] to just drag through their leash who has [06:54] learned to jump all over people who have [06:56] learned to self reinforced in the self [06:58] reward you can't do the same thing [07:00] that's a totally different a clean slate [07:01] puppy versus a dog that has had so many [07:05] inconsistencies so don't get trapped in [07:07] the method just because you know purely [07:09] positive doesn't work for you and your [07:11] dog does not mean you're a bad person [07:12] for going outside that box there's also [07:15] difference between being firm but fair [07:18] and being abusive you know B there's [07:20] definitely trainers who are abusive but [07:23] you're not going to get results being [07:24] abusive it's you know there's there's a [07:27] difference there's a fine line again [07:28] that goes back to the art of the dog [07:30] training it's knowing what does this dog [07:32] want you know and a lot of times where [07:35] people fail is when you don't have [07:37] something that's as rewarding as the [07:39] environment so I always used squirrels [07:41] for an example you could a dog that [07:43] loves chasing squirrels you can use [07:45] chicken you can use hot dogs you can use [07:47] whatever food you want you're never [07:48] gonna have something as exciting as [07:50] chasing that squirrel you're not but [07:52] guess what you're not allowed to get by [07:53] car right it's for me that's the [07:56] non-negotiable you're not allowed to run [07:58] out in the street you know a lot of [07:59] chase that cat you're not allowed to [08:00] attack that dog I'm sorry I'm really [08:02] mean but those things you're not allowed [08:04] to do so even if I can't get you to do [08:06] it using positive reinforcement I go [08:08] well yeah you have to heal but it's also [08:09] worth your while so the first time I'm [08:12] doing come one called for example I'm [08:14] not gonna go where there's 50 hundred [08:15] squirrels running around right that's [08:17] setting the dog up to fail we're gonna [08:19] do in the backyard we go to the park [08:20] where there's no squirrels we're gonna [08:21] do it when the dog is hungry then I'm [08:23] gonna teach the dog you know with the [08:25] leash and teach them you know even when [08:27] you don't want to come I'm gonna help [08:28] you I'm gonna help you I'm gonna help [08:29] you and then you get to go back out and [08:31] sniff then I'm gonna go where there's [08:33] you know squirrels and I'm gonna go will [08:35] you stop to come under your call but if [08:37] you do now you get to go chase the [08:38] squirrels again if the dog is able to so [08:41] it's kind of like you you have to check [08:43] in with me and then you can have what [08:44] you want but you can't do it on your own [08:46] you have to [08:46] for me so it's good to have the full [08:49] balance of course depending on which dog [08:50] we talked a little bit about science and [08:52] then the artist being able to use the [08:53] science correctly in order to get the [08:55] results based on that individual dog so [08:57] if we have somebody who's calling us or [09:00] calling you and they're in let's say [09:02] Missouri right or Chicago or whatever [09:05] they're on the their Midwest and they're [09:06] asking you it's a friend of yours and [09:08] they say you know I'm looking at [09:09] different dog trainers I have four that [09:11] are in the area they all seem pretty [09:13] good [09:14] what could I look at to try to determine [09:16] which one's better what would you [09:17] recommend your friend would you say talk [09:19] to each one or I know it's a tough [09:22] question usually I'd look for them doing [09:26] some kind of outside competition so do [09:28] they have the passion that outside of [09:30] their normal pet dogs do they do this [09:32] for fun also like I do a sport called [09:35] French ring French ring is obedience [09:36] protection and agility [09:37] so the pet dogs is kind of my bread and [09:40] butter I don't make any money off the [09:41] ring sport stuff but that's my passion [09:43] so at the end of the day when I'm done [09:45] training the pet dogs I go train my own [09:46] dogs that's what I want to look for in a [09:48] dog trainer I want to look at the [09:50] trainer's dogs a lot of you'll notice [09:53] the trainers have poorly behaved dogs [09:56] does their dog know sit or the older dog [09:59] come one called if their dog won't come [10:01] one called how do I expect them to train [10:03] my dog to come one called [10:04] also a lot of people have Malinois zazz [10:07] a demo dog well if you know what you're [10:09] doing they're super easy to train [10:10] they're very motivated and they're very [10:12] easy show me a beagle show me a husky [10:15] show me a dog that's not easy to work [10:17] with let me see that the eight month old [10:19] rescue dog let me see that dog working [10:21] because that's going to show you that [10:23] that trainer knows how to modify their [10:25] methods to to help every dog not just [10:29] the dog that fits their training methods [10:31] so look for a trainer who is you know [10:34] goes above and beyond who trains outside [10:36] of the normal pet dog training you can [10:40] look for certifications for me that's [10:41] not the end of the world [10:42] I want experience you know doing it for [10:45] at least a couple years if they work [10:47] with a rescue group great referrals are [10:49] always great so I do know advertising [10:51] all of my advertising is Yelp I don't [10:53] pay for it but Yelp and word-of-mouth so [10:56] ask your friends if you have a friend [10:57] who has a very well behaved dog hey did [10:59] you train [11:00] or did you you know have somebody train [11:02] your dog [11:03] you can you know call your a KC club and [11:07] see if they have you know competition [11:08] obedience club you can go on Yelp if you [11:10] want but look look to see if they've [11:13] worked with a dog like yours before and [11:16] just because they have isn't mean [11:18] they're a good trainer too so there's [11:19] all kinds of it depends but I really [11:22] want to see them going above and beyond [11:23] I want to see the passion I want to see [11:25] the results a lot of people get stuck on [11:27] methods but methods don't train dogs [11:30] results do so I want to see can they [11:32] actually get the results can they get a [11:34] dog that's awfully strained if that's [11:36] your goal asked for a video of them [11:38] training other dogs if they have a [11:39] Facebook page go on their Facebook look [11:41] up to see if they've got pictures or [11:43] videos of other dogs and they like what [11:45] you see and then kind of go from there [11:48] it's also a lot of it just on feeling do [11:49] you have do you have a good relationship [11:50] with them if you aren't real comfortable [11:53] with them or if you have a bad vibe [11:54] you're less likely to go to the training [11:58] so just there's a lot of it depends but [12:01] would you say you're crazy dog person [12:03] would you say there's any red flags that [12:07] you say okay if I see this that's [12:08] something I would suggest avoiding yeah [12:11] I mean look look at the tools that they [12:13] have you know if if you see for me look [12:17] at the body language of the dog that's [12:19] number one so if they give you a demo [12:21] dog what does that dog look like are [12:23] they doing everything really flat is [12:25] their tail tuck is their ears pinned [12:27] back do they look like they have a great [12:29] relationship with their handler are they [12:30] you know tail wagging are they excited [12:32] are they motivated to work that's what I [12:34] want to see I don't necessarily care [12:36] about what methods they use I want to [12:38] see results and I want to see that the [12:39] dog is happy but reliable that's what I [12:42] want I really like that you said that [12:44] too about the results because I think [12:45] results really matters and what I've [12:47] come across with people and you probably [12:49] had the same situation somebody might [12:50] call you up and they have a certain [12:52] problem they want you to fix so for [12:54] example let's do the come one called [12:56] somebody calls you up and they say you [12:57] know I had this dog I've done obedience [12:59] with it for a long time it'll sit a [13:01] little down they'll do things like that [13:02] but we cannot get it to come when called [13:03] when it is off leash it does whatever [13:06] the dog wants to do it takes off and at [13:09] that point they tried treats they tried [13:11] whatever it is that they can [13:13] what would you recommend for something [13:15] like that the first thing I tell people [13:17] stop punishing your dog for coming [13:19] mm-hmm a lot of people don't realize [13:21] that they do it but they punish their [13:23] dog all the time throughout the dog park [13:25] where they do fight oh come the dog [13:27] comes they put on the leash they leave [13:28] the park [13:29] you just punished your dog you just [13:31] ended play to him and that dog finally [13:32] came to you do you think he's gonna come [13:33] next time mm-hmm maybe come one or two [13:35] times third time he's not gonna want to [13:37] come when you call him at the dog park [13:39] because you just end playtime second [13:42] thing they do is the dog is outside [13:43] going potty barking in the neighbor dog [13:45] Fido come the dog comes they put them [13:47] inside the closed the door again [13:49] you took away playtime the dog won its [13:52] gonna is the dog is the dog going to [13:53] want to come next time nope [13:55] same thing the dog is you know you tell [13:58] the dog to come you stick him in their [13:59] crate stop punishing the dog for coming [14:02] when called so I do a lot of catching or [14:04] lease catch the dog give him a couple [14:05] treats given the toy scratches but [14:07] setting out to play again let them go [14:09] chase that squirrel again let them know [14:11] it's just a check-in work on collar [14:13] grabs - a lot of people only grab the [14:14] dog's collar again when they're gonna [14:16] hook a leash on it so then you get that [14:17] key boy because they know that when you [14:20] grab their collar it's either gonna take [14:21] something out of their mouth you're [14:23] gonna hook them up into an end play time [14:24] so number one it stop punishing your dog [14:26] for coming one called [14:27] if you stop doing that and you start [14:29] rewarding them you're gonna see a huge [14:30] difference and for me that's the number [14:32] one second is don't give commands that [14:35] you're not willing and able to follow [14:36] through with if you know that your dog [14:39] is barking the neighbor dog you know in [14:40] fence fighting or is digging a hole and [14:42] you call him and he's not gonna come [14:44] don't call him all he learns just blow [14:46] you off mm-hmm so there's there's no [14:49] point all he learns is that it come [14:51] doesn't mean come so if you're not [14:52] willing able to follow through don't [14:55] tell um cop you can go poppy poppy poppy [14:56] clap your hands whatever but keep that [14:58] special recall word for when you can [15:01] actually follow through so more of an [15:02] informal you're saying if you're not [15:04] wanting to follow through like okay come [15:05] on puppy so they don't listen it's not [15:06] like it was a command right and then [15:09] that actually makes it we were talking [15:10] about it on the drive out here a lot of [15:12] times people will communicate with their [15:14] dog in a negative way accidentally like [15:17] unaware of it you know for example based [15:19] on what you're saying the dog will be [15:20] running around [15:21] blowing the owner off and the dogs or [15:23] the human is getting frustrated that the [15:24] dogs not coming and then when they [15:26] finally get the dog what do they do they [15:27] correct them they literally get mad so [15:29] I'm not even just putting them in the [15:30] crate they yell at them they correct [15:32] them whatever and now the dog goes whoa [15:33] coming to use a bad thing I see that all [15:36] the time for dogs that run out the front [15:37] door the people get so upset first they [15:39] chase the dogs they turn into a game [15:41] right it's really fun when owners chase [15:43] you and you get to play catch me if you [15:45] can then they finally do get caught and [15:47] what do they do they yell ID on the [15:48] ground my dick already you're such a bad [15:49] dog and then they like okay you better [15:51] not get caught next time and now you [15:53] have this u-turn is this game this game [15:55] is right out the front door as fast as [15:57] you can then mom comes flailing arms and [15:59] yelling at you you hope the dog doesn't [16:01] get hit by a car and then you correct it [16:03] all when you finally catch them so it's [16:04] pretty much everything is wrong in that [16:06] situation miscommunication is probably [16:09] the biggest thing and we can probably [16:10] name hundreds of incidences where this [16:12] happened even for example a dog not [16:14] outing something the person gets [16:16] frustrated when they finally get the [16:17] item from the dog they smack the dog so [16:20] now the dog literally learns hold on to [16:22] this things I can can I let go so that [16:25] timing now how important let's talk [16:30] about time and how important it is for [16:31] people to understand how timing works [16:33] with dog training and how they need to [16:35] understand and implement it when they [16:36] are working with their dogs so it's [16:37] actually a double-edged sword [16:39] so people timing is very important but [16:44] you also have time if you use markers so [16:46] a lot of people go yes and they're [16:49] moving at the same time as a marker so [16:51] markers it's a bridge so you're you're [16:54] making a conditioned reinforcer so a [16:58] click or a yes or potato it doesn't [17:00] matter what it is followed by something [17:03] good if you're gonna use it as a [17:05] positive reinforcement marker so it'd be [17:08] click you reach in your pocket you give [17:10] the food click you reach in your pocket [17:12] you give the food now the click is [17:14] predicting something good happening so [17:16] if the dog sits yes or click I reach in [17:19] my pocket I give the reward the same [17:21] thing goes for a negative reinforcement [17:24] marker right so the dog jumps up I go no [17:26] I walk over I grab the dog's leash I [17:28] give him a tug off that person so you [17:31] don't have to go down let me running [17:32] towards the person [17:33] or yes innovating at the same time [17:35] because now yes does that mean yes this [17:38] means yes and sudden the dogs get [17:40] excited when they hear their rap or [17:41] opening not your voice you always have [17:43] your voice [17:43] nice I'm just going to be listening to [17:45] this so you have to explain what you [17:47] were doing I was reaching into my bag [17:49] for that you at the same time yes you [17:52] don't want to do that and that's [17:53] important the markers always come first [17:55] followed by the movement for either a [17:57] punishment or a reward but you have time [18:00] a lot of people are hurry yep you've [18:02] only got two seconds no you don't take a [18:04] young puppy put them in the car drive [18:06] the vet give them shots you'll want to [18:08] do that two or three times before the [18:09] puppy does not want to get in that car [18:10] and guess what you've got 15 20 minutes [18:12] between there but because nothing [18:14] happens between they can make that [18:16] Association so you have time relax mark [18:19] it click it say no whatever then move [18:23] and give your punishment or reward when [18:26] should somebody be marking how does [18:28] somebody teach a marker to their dog if [18:30] somebody is listening this and they want [18:31] to implement some these techniques so [18:33] you want to charge the markers so [18:34] charging the marker means making that [18:36] association or repairing it so it's [18:38] really simple click reach in your pocket [18:40] give the treat [18:41] click reach in your pocket give the [18:43] treat click reward click reward wait a [18:46] couple seconds click reward so you want [18:50] to make sure it's not just click reward [18:52] click reward click reward click reward [18:54] or else the dog just is like oh cool [18:55] this is awesome [18:56] you want those kind of delays so that [18:59] way the dog is like how come I'm not [19:00] getting anything click oh that's what [19:02] predicts a reward and you want to do [19:05] that before you even start the behaviors [19:06] so generally count out 50 treats that's [19:10] enough for most dogs to make these oshi [19:11] association between the click and [19:15] something good happening and that's [19:17] classical conditioning so that's the [19:18] Pavlov that's ringing the bell that's [19:20] the dog salivating anticipating the food [19:22] is gonna happen the dinner bell theory [19:24] is familiar with that and it is [19:27] important to note the whole thing is [19:28] that's something I run into often I know [19:30] you run into it as well is and we all do [19:32] it because it's so hard not to pair your [19:34] physical with your verbal because it's [19:36] natural as we talk we move with our our [19:38] mouths essentially and so to be able to [19:40] separate it so everyone just really [19:42] needs to be aware of that making sure [19:43] the sound comes first and it's so [19:45] important because if you are pairing it [19:46] together if they're saying if they're [19:48] clicking as they give the dog the food [19:49] according yeah and again you've got time [19:53] so click one Mississippi reach in your [19:56] pocket reward you have time you don't [19:58] have to hurry up and in between the [20:00] click and the reward to give the dog [20:02] food you have time so click one [20:04] Mississippi rate reward you have the [20:07] time there's no reason to be moving and [20:09] clicking at the same time and you [20:10] trained all kinds of different dogs so [20:12] you train pet dogs I you train search [20:14] and rescue as well right service dogs [20:16] protection dogs now if each one of these [20:19] dogs is there any dog that you skip the [20:22] step of teaching them markers or is that [20:23] hands down across the board you did on [20:25] mobile I start pretty much all my [20:26] puppies the same way it's and that's [20:28] just learning to learn so if you have if [20:31] you have those markers the dog [20:32] understands I use the my verbal markers [20:36] I use a clicker or yes for good you know [20:38] as a positive reinforcement I use good [20:42] for duration and then I use know as my [20:44] my pairing with a correction and as long [20:48] as the dogs understand yes good and know [20:50] you can teach them anything and once the [20:53] dogs learn how to learn training is [20:57] super easy so a lot of times my first [20:59] behaviors I'll do is I'll start you know [21:01] a little bit of healing just following a [21:03] foods or [21:04] so that's just taking the food sticking [21:06] it straight on the puppy's nose and [21:07] having them follow it they don't they do [21:09] anything but just keep their their nose [21:11] on the food the problem that a lot of [21:13] people make with that beginning step is [21:14] they go too fast so you want to keep [21:16] that puppy's nose right on the on the [21:19] food they move their hand too fast yep [21:21] yeah they lose the dog so I see that a [21:24] lot like for the down they go down and [21:26] they lose the dog's nose and they want [21:27] to ride the dog didn't down so you want [21:29] to keep the treat on the dog's nose and [21:31] lure them into the down the second those [21:33] elbows touch I'll mark it yes or click [21:35] I'll open my hand I'll give the food [21:37] it's the same thing for a sit food is to [21:39] the nose when the nose goes up the butt [21:41] tends to go down the second up but hit [21:43] stick around I mark it I open my hand I [21:45] feed the dog you can do spins you can do [21:48] healing if you have a dog that I'll [21:50] follow a food or you can do roll over [21:52] you can teach bow you can teach pretty [21:54] much anything it's all just follow the [21:56] food or and [21:58] for that I also one of my beginning [22:00] things I teach the dog is free shaping [22:04] or learning through successive [22:06] approximation and that's I'll use a [22:08] target for that and I do nothing I just [22:10] stand there with my clicker they look at [22:12] the target I click and I reward they go [22:14] to sniff it I click and I reward I do [22:16] absolutely nothing [22:18] except for telling the dog ear warmer [22:19] you're warmer you're warmer and my goal [22:22] is for the dog to offer the behavior of [22:24] putting their feet on something so [22:26] that's the dog learning to manipulate me [22:29] again that's operant conditioning is the [22:30] dog's behavior drives my behavior they [22:33] offer a look they offer a touch they [22:35] offer movement that's what gives me to [22:37] click and to reward them so I'm not [22:40] doing anything I have no help at all [22:41] they have to learn to train me pretty [22:44] much and that's operant conditioning and [22:46] that actually does more than just [22:47] getting the dog to in a sense get you to [22:50] do certain behavior so their behavior [22:51] controls the environment in a sense [22:53] which builds their confidence but it's [22:55] something that I've ran into with many [22:57] different clients that I work with and I [22:59] always end up explaining to them of [23:00] course but everybody wants to be able to [23:02] have the dog that just listens just to [23:04] listen right they don't they're like [23:06] well the dog should listen to me because [23:07] I'm its master and it's supposed to [23:09] listen right it's like well do you work [23:12] for free right because they often ask do [23:13] I always have to pay my dog now how do [23:16] you teach somebody to start bridging or [23:19] not bridging but rather spacing out the [23:21] rewards or minimizing the amount of [23:23] rewards that they'd give the dog while [23:24] still getting the dog to perform and [23:26] what's going on in the dog's mind that [23:28] gets them to willingly perform these [23:30] behaviors even though they're not always [23:32] getting a tree and you used a great [23:33] analogy when we were talking about this [23:35] before and I use it with everybody now [23:36] let's see if you can I for me my rule is [23:43] if it's a piece of cake [23:44] so then the first thing is get the [23:45] behavior if you don't have the behavior [23:47] reliable one you can't name it yet so I [23:49] tell people don't name until you love it [23:51] so like I was saying for the sit and [23:53] luring the dog into that position unless [23:54] I can get my dog and again I do [23:56] competition obedience so I want them [23:58] square I don't want them flopping on one [24:00] hip I want them you know their butt [24:01] tucked in sitting straight until I can [24:04] get them to sit how I want to I don't [24:06] name it so I might do 30 40 reps [24:08] or Michael a whole week with getting a [24:10] behavior that I don't name yet because I [24:12] don't want to add the Q until I like the [24:14] behavior because if I start naming sit [24:16] and I start clicking for it but I've got [24:18] a sloppy sit now I just started [24:21] rewarding something that I don't want so [24:23] I don't add the Q until I'm I'm sure [24:25] that I have the behavior that I want and [24:26] a lot of people start doing sit you know [24:28] and adding the water right away exactly [24:31] and the problem with that is if the dog [24:33] doesn't do it [24:33] now you just said sit sit sit sit and [24:35] the dog hasn't done it now you're you [24:38] know the word means nothing to the dog [24:39] anymore so it's a lot easier to get the [24:41] behavior then throw the Q on it once you [24:44] have it exactly how you like it and I [24:47] lost track of the original question the [24:48] question was still getting the dog to [24:51] perform the behavior but not having to [24:53] reward the dog for every okay so my my [24:56] kind of general rule is if it's a piece [24:58] of cake you don't need to reward it you [25:01] have a great analogy though you told me [25:03] before and I use it all the time so when [25:05] you start off when you and analogies are [25:08] born in dog training cuz it really helps [25:09] people understand it and it's a [25:11] beautiful analogy everybody I've told it [25:12] to is like that makes a lot of sense so [25:14] you said when you first start off [25:16] working with the dog you want to be a [25:19] vending machine and then as the dog [25:22] progresses you want to turn it into yeah [25:25] that was you a slot machine okay so the [25:32] difference between the vending machine [25:33] and the slot machine is when you're [25:35] playing slots you expect to put a lot of [25:37] money in and only when every once in a [25:40] while right or sometimes you don't gonna [25:41] win you just like playing the game with [25:43] the vending machine if you put money in [25:45] and you push that button and it doesn't [25:46] come out you're gonna get pissed you're [25:48] expecting to get a reward so you have a [25:50] different reaction you put the same [25:51] thing you put in fifty cents in the [25:53] vending machine you don't get that [25:54] reward you have a bad association so [25:57] you're they're gonna try kicking it you [25:58] might shake it you might push a couple [26:00] times because you're upset because [26:02] you're expecting to get something out of [26:03] that with the event or the slot machine [26:05] you're expecting not to win every one so [26:07] I you hit that jackpot and so because [26:09] you have the expectation of not getting [26:11] something and then you do get it and [26:13] you're like that's fantastic versus [26:14] expecting to get something and not [26:16] getting it so and that's just again [26:19] that's [26:20] you have to switch a variable rate of [26:21] reinforcement pretty quickly and a lot [26:23] of people get stuck on that continuous [26:24] and what's a good way to switch what [26:27] have you seen that's an effective way [26:28] and I know there's it's it's really an [26:31] art so each dog is gonna vary but would [26:33] be a good way to generalize it for a [26:35] large group of people to where they're [26:36] gonna have the matrix s once you have [26:38] 80% success rate you can start changing [26:40] it up and in again you want to you want [26:44] to vary it so like if I'm fading I'm [26:47] doing my set and I have my hand signal [26:49] or I'm still using my food lure I'm not [26:51] gonna to switch to a hand signal away [26:53] from the food lure until I have an 80% [26:55] success rate I'm not gonna switch away [26:57] from a hand signal to just a verbal [26:58] until I have an 80% I'm not gonna start [27:01] asking switching over to life forwards [27:03] until I have that 80% and life rewards [27:06] are okay you want to go for a walk you [27:07] need to sit before I put your leash on [27:09] you know your leash is your award since [27:12] they have that association between leash [27:13] and walk you want to go outside the [27:14] potty do it down first okay going [27:17] outside is reward you want to come out [27:19] of the car you need to stay first so [27:21] you're switching them over away from [27:23] food and on to life rewards things that [27:25] you always have things that the dog [27:26] wants so and that's just kind of again I [27:29] use the 80% roll and for food I used the [27:31] you know piece of cake if it's really [27:33] easy you don't need to reward the dog if [27:35] it was you called the dog to come and it [27:37] was chasing a squirrel and he came and [27:39] you're like wow that was really nice [27:41] paying for it you know make him know [27:43] that Danko that's his Christmas bonus [27:45] make sure that he knows that you're [27:46] really happy with his work I like that [27:48] you use the term life reward I actually [27:49] never heard that before but that's a [27:51] good way to put it in that also I would [27:53] imagine it makes or it adds value to [27:56] those commands because now that's what [27:57] the commands are predicting and [27:59] something I often say when I'm working [28:00] with somebody I say always think about [28:02] what the dog is predicting what does [28:04] each behavior what is it that happens [28:06] within your routine with your dog that [28:08] predicts certain things and whatever [28:09] these things predict will end up adding [28:11] value to those things so if the sit [28:13] predicts going out on a walk the dog [28:15] ends up enjoying a sit right now they're [28:18] gonna start offering that up to try to [28:19] get a walk oh here's a good one what is [28:20] your thought so this is something people [28:22] often saying for me I always have to [28:24] explain to them really what's going on [28:27] because how often is somebody say and [28:29] I'm sure you've heard it hundreds of [28:29] times [28:30] my dog begs [28:32] right so at least the way I look at it [28:36] is if a dog sits and looks up at you [28:39] while you're eating dinner the dog is [28:41] offering up a behavior if you've done [28:42] any sort of obedience using doggie [28:44] treats to sit in order to get that [28:46] reward and now they come up to you and [28:47] they offer a behavior and they go you [28:49] have food the last time you had food I [28:51] sat you gave me a piece of now I'm gonna [28:53] sit now and now you're gonna give me a [28:56] piece right isn't that the deal we [28:57] worked out with with my dogs yes but not [29:01] everybody wants a dog you'll be sitting [29:02] and staring at them while they're eating [29:03] so again give them something else to do [29:05] so I use you can't see my dogs but I [29:07] have two old dogs that are asleep on [29:09] their beds right now so my dogs no [29:11] because I like to spoil my dog so when [29:12] we're done eating you get to either lick [29:14] the plate or I'll give you something I [29:15] always save them a little tidbit of [29:16] whatever but they have to stay on their [29:18] beds if they're on their beds they can't [29:21] be drooling on my leg they can't be [29:22] trying to steal things from me they [29:24] can't be you know going on to the table [29:26] and bugging guess I don't have to worry [29:27] about guests feeding my dog while we're [29:29] eating so I give them something else to [29:31] do where yes I can still reward them at [29:34] the end for the behavior but I don't [29:35] have to worry about the dog now drooling [29:37] and anticipation that they're gonna get [29:39] fed at the table so yes they are [29:41] offering a nice behavior but not [29:42] everybody likes to be stared at while [29:44] they're eating so I prefer to use the [29:46] place command or climb or whatever you [29:48] want to call of go to your bed lay down [29:49] and stay while we're eating because I [29:51] also only guess to feed my dogs and a [29:53] lot of people will see them at the table [29:55] and so if they're away from the table I [29:57] don't have to worry about the dog eating [29:58] something if somebody dropped something [30:00] or you know the drunk uncle feeding the [30:03] dog something they shouldn't have [30:04] because they're away from the table [30:06] well can't there be a negative [30:07] consequence that could come about with [30:09] somebody who's trying to teach their dog [30:11] how to behave and they don't understand [30:13] necessarily how dogs think or how they [30:15] process information and the dog comes [30:17] over and does the begging as people call [30:19] it and that person corrects the dog for [30:21] begging and then wonders why later the [30:22] dog doesn't want to do a sit so so the [30:25] first thing you have to do is what [30:28] figure out what you want if you don't [30:29] know what you want how the heck is the [30:31] dog supposed to know they're not mind [30:33] reader's all they know is what work has [30:35] worked in the past so like you said they [30:37] offer that sit why this works in the [30:39] past if they think about jumping up on [30:41] somebody and they sit they get rewarded [30:42] why wouldn't they reward for offering a [30:44] sit here so if you don't [30:46] I'm sure I don't want to crack my dog [30:48] for offering a nice calm behavior but I [30:50] also don't them doing it so what do I do [30:52] give them something else to do again if [30:54] you don't know how you want your dog to [30:55] greet guests how's your dog supposed to [30:57] know if you don't know how your dog how [31:00] you want your dog to acts during dinner [31:02] time how is your dog supposed to know so [31:04] that's something especially when you've [31:05] got multiple people in the family [31:06] everybody has to be on the same page [31:08] everybody has to decide okay we're gonna [31:10] let the dog on the couch or not because [31:12] if one person does and the other person [31:13] doesn't it's not fair to the dog [31:15] sometimes they get up and they get [31:16] cuddles and kisses and sometimes they [31:18] get kicked off the couch not fair so [31:20] make up your mind what do you want your [31:22] dog to do and then reward them [31:23] accordingly or correct them accordingly [31:25] but if you don't know what you want [31:27] you're talking it's not a mind-reader [31:28] unless it's Lassie tell them what you [31:30] want and then reward it and it's going [31:32] off of that is it bad for somebody to [31:36] let their dog go on their bed or let [31:38] their dog because people here you know [31:40] oh well the dog is gonna believe their [31:42] alpha so I can't do this or I can't do [31:44] that it's or so for me it's not a [31:46] problem les it's a problem I have an old [31:49] dog who sleeps in bed with me she's 13 [31:50] years old she's been sleeping with me [31:51] isn't she was a puppy it's not a problem [31:53] why because if I tell her we get off [31:55] should I get off if she's sleeping and I [31:57] bumper she's not gonna growl at me so a [31:59] lot of people let the dog dogs that [32:01] shouldn't be on the couch dogs that [32:03] don't wait for permission so for me [32:05] everything has to have rules with it so [32:07] I don't my dog just launching on the [32:08] couch because they want on the couch so [32:10] unless I do two taps that my dog doesn't [32:12] come up that's her cue or imitation as I [32:14] - two taps the dog comes up because not [32:17] everybody wants a dog on the couch if [32:19] you have a party and there's people [32:20] sitting on the couch or somebody's [32:21] eating an appetizer on the counter [32:22] Nelson the dog is right there and they [32:24] don't like dogs [32:25] well one get out of my house because my [32:27] dogs rule but number two I have to have [32:30] manners because if that person doesn't [32:32] want and I'd like that person would like [32:33] them to stay I need to be able to say [32:35] okay go to your bed and stay but if that [32:37] dog just jumps on the couch and then I [32:39] tried to get the dog off and it growls [32:41] at me okay will you lose that privilege [32:42] because you're not behaving yourself so [32:44] if I have a dog that growls if I try to [32:46] get them off the couch who if I bump [32:48] them they growl at me or won't get off [32:50] when I tell them to they haven't earned [32:51] that privilege that's a good way to put [32:54] it - it's as long as it's not a problem [32:56] that it's fine but once it becomes a [32:58] problem so yeah I mean because I [32:59] I do this might I have three dogs they [33:01] all sleep on the bed with me [33:03] none of them walk around thinking [33:04] they're the Alpha you know or any of [33:06] that stuff and something I constantly [33:08] tried to push on people that have dogs [33:10] and have questions about dogs not push [33:12] on them but you know what I mean is [33:13] understand the science right understand [33:16] how dogs think and how they process [33:17] information then you can perfect the art [33:19] and that's kind of what we were talking [33:20] about before using the right motivation [33:22] factors for the dogs are using the right [33:25] correction level for the dog so if [33:27] somebody is working with their dog [33:28] they're new they're just starting how [33:30] did they decide what is going to be the [33:32] best motivation factors how can they [33:34] decide what would be the best boundaries [33:36] and how to set them up appropriate for [33:38] that dog and they're easy ways for them [33:39] to tell so going back to the whole that [33:42] thing we're all quite close wanted to [33:43] insert this the whole being dominant or [33:46] being alpha being dominant or being [33:51] alpha over your dog and you know alpha [33:53] rolling and things like that a real [33:55] alpha dog just gives a look and the [33:57] other dog offers the submissive behavior [33:59] a real apple a dog is not standing over [34:02] and pinning other dogs they're too [34:03] confident for that they don't do that if [34:07] they walk up the other dog will offer [34:08] that submissive position they don't [34:10] instill it second thing is is so [34:13] dominance is priority access to limited [34:16] or valuable resources that's what it [34:19] don't that's what that's what that is [34:21] like how you put that it's so being [34:24] dominant is priority access to limited [34:26] or valuable resources so if you have [34:29] three dogs and there's one bone and the [34:32] dogs got into a fight that would be a [34:34] fight over dominance hmm because if you [34:37] also watch some dogs one dog can just [34:39] walk up and take that bone if they know [34:41] their place in the hierarchy yes [34:42] hierarchies do exist in dogs when you [34:46] have an issue is when dogs think to the [34:47] same place on the hierarchy single [34:50] people and they and they both want that [34:52] same thing at the same time so for some [34:55] dogs it's sleeping places some dogs [34:59] sometimes it's food sometimes it's [35:00] people affection can be a resource so [35:03] like if I'm petting one dog and one dog [35:05] comes up and they get into a fight [35:06] that's the fight over dominance she [35:08] wanted whatever dog that was guarding [35:11] wanted that resource to themselves [35:13] now so that's what that is so if a dog [35:16] is pulling you on your walk it's not big [35:18] dominant if they're rushing through the [35:19] front door before you it's not being [35:21] dominant your dog doesn't have manners [35:22] dominance is prior to activity limited [35:24] resources or valuable resources so same [35:27] thing the dogs sleeping on the couch you [35:28] go to move them in the dog growl see you [35:30] that's dominance that's saying I want to [35:32] keep what's mine you need to back off so [35:35] that's you know same thing if your dog [35:36] is guarding food and as long as you [35:41] haven't created the problem by harassing [35:42] your dog while they're eating and you [35:44] know you go to take something away and [35:45] the dog you know goes after you again [35:47] that can be dominance as well because [35:49] they're saying I should be the one I'm [35:51] the Alpha this is mine I'm gonna keep it [35:53] let's cover that a little bit with the [35:56] food and that's something that a lot of [35:58] people run into and I believe that [36:00] sometimes it can be genetic sometimes it [36:02] can be genetics for the dog to have that [36:04] food aggression or that resource [36:07] guarding but how is it that a lot of [36:09] people actually cause food aggression on [36:12] their dogs so dogs do it works so a lot [36:17] of pet people are fantastic at making [36:19] personal protection dogs in [36:21] inadvertently okay so again dogs do [36:24] whatever works so staying on the topic [36:25] of the resource guarding it's normal for [36:28] puppies a lot of people think you make [36:30] aggression no all dogs have aggression [36:32] in them it's a natural fight-or-flight [36:33] you don't create something it's already [36:36] there so when people say that punishing [36:38] your dog creates aggression no it does [36:40] not the dog is not used to being told no [36:43] or and then not getting their own way so [36:45] you're not gonna make your dog aggress [36:47] you're not gonna bring out it you're not [36:49] gonna cause aggression you might just [36:50] bring it out so it's always there and [36:53] I've got two little puppies here right [36:54] now and I'm sure if I put a raw bone [36:56] between them they're gonna fight over it [36:57] but most the time when they're very [37:00] young and they're with their mother [37:01] they're learning [37:03] boundaries or learning no they're [37:05] learning to take correction they learn [37:06] all of that from their mom and their [37:08] litter mates so that's why it's super [37:10] important if you can do not take a puppy [37:12] that's younger than eight weeks so most [37:15] the time and I have dogs that have [37:17] issues with like guarding or aggression [37:19] or you know really serious problems it's [37:22] usually a dog that's poorly bred and has [37:24] been taken away from mom too [37:25] and hasn't been socialized so keep the [37:28] puppies with their mom until at least [37:29] eight weeks or at least with the pup [37:31] littermates until at least eight weeks [37:33] and then in terms of guarding so with [37:36] puppies when they're super young five to [37:38] six week old puppies right now I'm [37:40] starting gardening now so I'll give them [37:42] a very high-value bone I'm gonna reach [37:44] my hand and take it away why cuz if they [37:46] buy me they're six weeks old nothing is [37:48] gonna happen what am I gonna do even if [37:49] they buy me I'm gonna give them a piece [37:51] of raw hamburger meat [37:52] then I'm gonna give it back to them I'm [37:54] gonna do it again so that way they learn [37:56] number one aggression doesn't work and [37:57] again you can only do this really small [37:58] puppies or else you're gonna get bit [37:59] pretty bad yeah so I take that bone away [38:02] I don't care if they throw fit I'm gonna [38:03] give them something that's even better [38:05] then I'm gonna give it back to them I'm [38:06] gonna do that again and again and what's [38:08] gonna happen is that dog is gonna see me [38:09] reaching and he's gonna anticipate I'm [38:11] gonna give him something good so there's [38:13] no reason to guard because I'm not [38:15] taking it away I'm just trading for a [38:16] second and then he gets it back so I'm [38:18] not getting into that fight so I'm not [38:20] fighting with the dog I'm just all [38:21] business I take it away I give you [38:23] something fantastic and I give it back [38:24] to you why wouldn't that dog like me [38:26] taking it away now at the same time if [38:29] every time the dogs ate I mess with them [38:32] it's gonna get old real quick so if [38:34] you're eating steak and every time I'm [38:36] sticking my fork on your plate stick you [38:38] my fork on your plate eventually but [38:39] just leave me alone let me eat in peace [38:40] right I overdid it if everyone Swan said [38:44] hey let me try some that oh do you want [38:45] to try my chicken too you're more likely [38:47] to trade but at the same time if I keep [38:50] poking the bear while they're eating [38:52] eventually you can you can piss them off [38:55] enough where they're gonna react so [38:57] number one if it's an adult dog a little [38:59] beat alone feed him in the crate yes [39:01] leave leave him alone you know if I'm [39:03] eating dinner [39:04] don't start bugging me I want to just [39:06] eat my food in peace same thing with [39:07] your dog and by feeding them in the [39:10] crate to that teaches the dog you eat in [39:12] your crate you don't eat off the table [39:13] or things like that and they like their [39:15] crate because that's where they get fed [39:16] all the time so you're making a nice [39:18] positive association with the crate [39:19] don't let your kids bug dogs you know [39:22] when they have a bone it's you know [39:24] don't do it you know in the olden days [39:27] that used to be at the dog grab the kid [39:28] hey leave the dog alone they have a bone [39:30] now so there's something wrong with the [39:31] dog mm-hmm what changed you know our [39:34] expectations [39:35] don't don't think that your dog is going [39:37] to be more tall [39:38] than you are right it's it's not fair [39:41] for the dog we have this all these [39:42] unrealistic expectations with you know [39:45] with guarding if you have a million [39:46] dollars and every time I took your [39:48] wallet I took money out you're not gonna [39:50] want to give me your wallet anymore cuz [39:51] every time I took your wallet add 100 [39:53] bucks you're not gonna mind if I take [39:54] your wallet every once in a while right [39:56] so some things that people can do at [39:59] home is you have a thing of food with [40:01] the puppy [40:01] take it away out of doll up a wet food [40:03] give it back do it once a week don't do [40:05] it every day don't mess with the dog [40:07] don't pull them by the tail don't mess [40:09] with them you know you can do two pets [40:11] and again throw them somewhere wet food [40:12] leave it alone don't push it or else [40:15] you're gonna make problems and that [40:16] could create the aggression because [40:18] people have this it's been pushed on [40:20] society so much at least in the United [40:22] States that you have to be the Alpha you [40:23] have to be the pack leader and people [40:25] think that it's a good thing to take the [40:27] food away to show the dog that they are [40:29] the dominant one then they create that [40:32] creates a resource guarding then it go [40:33] back what you said about and this is [40:35] important to note because some people [40:38] may not fully get what you're saying as [40:40] far as you take you put your hand on the [40:42] bone that the puppy has a puppy may act [40:43] aggressive and when you take it away the [40:46] moment that the puppy is no longer [40:48] actively being aggressive towards your [40:49] hand literally the second the dog stops [40:51] that's when you give them the food so [40:52] it's important that you're not giving [40:54] the food when they're acting aggressive [40:56] because then you can reward them but a [40:57] lot of times people think yeah but I [40:59] mean what I say is a lot of people they [41:00] think that it has to be like this a long [41:02] time frame you know from when one thing [41:04] is it's like literally if you for [41:06] example if you correct a dog after I [41:08] finished the correction I'm immediately [41:10] rewarding the dog for doing the right [41:11] thing it's not a dragged-out thing a [41:13] correction is boom that quick and then [41:15] I'm immediately rewarding the dog for [41:17] the right behavior and that's part of [41:18] that clear communication you know [41:22] whenever you're with your dog you have [41:23] to kind of bipolar one minutes and no [41:25] and that's it yeah you have to make that [41:27] flip you have to be crazy like that [41:29] because that's a good way to put it dog [41:31] is making the wrong choice one second [41:32] and they're right the next let them know [41:34] when they're bad and when they're good [41:35] because if you're not telling them [41:37] they're not mind reader's they don't [41:38] know and our society has a totally [41:40] different view of what is good and [41:41] what's bad than dogs do so if you're not [41:43] telling them what's good and bad how are [41:45] they supposed to know that's a brilliant [41:47] way of putting it I never heard that one [41:48] too being bipolar with the dog that [41:50] a good way to do it because you can't [41:51] dogs don't hold grudges right so [41:54] Corrections that quick and then just [41:56] like you said it should instantly be [41:57] once they're doing it right immediately [41:59] I mean it's even down to if you walk in [42:01] and your dog is tuned up your favorite [42:03] pair of Nikes and your first reactions [42:06] to go out and the dog drops it you have [42:07] to go you can't pay them for exactly or [42:15] set them up to teach them correctly so [42:18] this is something important too is how [42:20] often to do you when you're working with [42:23] your client you're working with your own [42:24] dogs do you set your dogs up for a [42:26] certain situation so you can teach them [42:28] the correct way so I tell people when [42:30] you're not paying attention set the dog [42:32] up to succeed so when you you're not [42:34] home you're not training the dog don't [42:36] leave a turkey sandwich on your table [42:37] right don't leave your shoes out don't [42:39] set the dog up where they can self [42:40] reward when you are paying attention set [42:42] the dog up to fail leave a sandwich on [42:44] the table where the dog is gonna be [42:46] tempted leave even throw some treats in [42:48] the dog shoe you know make it tempting [42:50] for the dog to go stick their nose in [42:52] that shoe when you're ready [42:54] and again willing and able to add a [42:55] correction to it if you don't set the [42:57] dog up to fail [42:58] then the dog is gonna sell for [42:59] reinforced because in life you're gonna [43:01] leave a sandwich out you're gonna do [43:02] something the dog is gonna get it every [43:04] time the dog jumps up on the table eats [43:06] a sandwich guess what they're gonna try [43:07] that again [43:08] every once in a while it worked again [43:10] now we're back to that slot machine you [43:12] can try and try and try but everyone [43:13] swap that pays off [43:15] you're gonna keep that hope alive so [43:16] again set the dog up to succeed when you [43:19] are not paying attention don't leave [43:20] things out that way the dog does jump on [43:22] the counter there's nothing for the dog [43:23] to get and then set the dog up to fail [43:24] when you aren't ready the more failures [43:27] that the dog makes the more the faster [43:29] we're gonna learn and the more they're [43:30] gonna be successful mm-hmm yeah and it's [43:33] kind of interesting how someone will [43:36] have you know a brand new toddler in the [43:39] house and when they have a brand-new [43:40] toddler that just starts walking they'll [43:42] follow that toddler everywhere don't [43:44] touch this don't do that that's sharp [43:46] don't fall here don't fall here and then [43:47] what is 90 percent of the population do [43:49] when they get a brand new pump they let [43:50] them free in the house and I wonder why [43:52] they'd shoot up stuff and pooped on the [43:53] carpet it's yeah it's insane so if you [43:57] do treat your puppy because even when [43:59] dogs are mature adults they still only [44:02] had the brain capacity [44:03] to three-year-old and that's like a [44:04] Border Collie not you know no not every [44:08] dog yeah you said it not me I love hugs [44:10] I love them to their sweethearts but [44:12] there's some dog center a little bit [44:13] slower so you can't expect more out of a [44:16] dog than you would out of a kid right [44:18] but we do we expect them to make good [44:21] choices to know that you're not supposed [44:22] to chew up electrical cords that they're [44:24] supposed to know where they're supposed [44:25] to go to the bathroom we expect way too [44:26] much out of them without showing them [44:28] what we want so again set your dog up to [44:31] succeed if you know your dog isn't potty [44:34] trained don't leave them free in your [44:35] house and then wonder why if you're [44:37] watching them they don't make mistakes [44:38] but as soon as they're free they do [44:39] you've given them that option so if you [44:42] use the umbilical cord method where you [44:44] keep your dog on leash all the time and [44:45] if you're not on leash with them because [44:47] that way at least your should be [44:48] watching them they're only six feet away [44:50] from you at all times that does a couple [44:52] things one it sets them up to succeed [44:54] because they can't sneak into the other [44:56] room and chew up a pair of shoes they [44:58] can't you know jump on people or things [45:02] or two things or go sneak into the other [45:04] room and go potty you can do two things [45:06] you can reward them because you're right [45:08] there supervising them if they go to the [45:09] bathroom you can catch them in the act [45:11] and then you can correct and redirect [45:12] them outside so you're setting that dog [45:15] up to not make mistakes or if they do [45:17] make mistakes you're there to give them [45:18] the information that was bad [45:19] the problem for example the potty [45:22] training is it's a self-reinforcing [45:23] behavior if you have to go and you go it [45:25] feels good to relieve yourself it's a [45:27] reward you would never give your puppy a [45:29] treat for going potty in the house but [45:31] you pretty much do if you don't if they [45:33] get to go when there's no consequences [45:35] what about what people say because this [45:37] is something that people often say when [45:39] they say well you know take the dog's [45:41] nose and rub it in it if again if you [45:44] don't catch them in the act there's [45:46] nothing you can do about it slap [45:47] yourself in the wrist it's not the dog's [45:49] fault now if you do catch the dog and [45:51] you see them going the bathroom yeah [45:52] yell clap your hands do whatever because [45:54] you caught them doing it at again market [45:56] with the know first and then apply your [45:59] punishment clap your hands [46:00] a don't stick the dog's nose in it or [46:01] else you're gonna have a face puppy and [46:03] who wants that but then take him outside [46:05] so you want to interrupt [46:06] don't let them finish going to the [46:08] bathroom because then you can't reward [46:09] them when they finish outside so if you [46:11] can catch them when they first start [46:12] going hey they learned that was bad you [46:15] go outside you have your [46:16] it's already on you you don't wait till [46:17] you get back on the house the dog [46:19] finishes going you yeah puppy party and [46:21] they get a treat black and white it's [46:23] bad when you go inside it's good when [46:24] you go outside and you're setting the [46:26] dog up to succeed you really with a [46:28] young puppy if you're taking them out I [46:29] tell people every two hours [46:31] give the dog plenty of opportunities to [46:33] be right now you're creating a pattern [46:35] in the habit of if you need to go you go [46:37] outside and if the dog does go when he's [46:39] inside again they're on a leash and [46:41] you're able to correct them right away [46:43] and that does a couple things it build [46:44] your relationship to the dog because [46:45] they learn to follow you around makes [46:47] you watch your dog because they're only [46:49] you know four six feet away from you and [46:51] then you can reward them so if they're [46:53] on lease with you and they lay down give [46:54] them a treat now you're teaching the dog [46:56] to settle if the dog somebody comes to [46:58] the front door guess what they're [46:59] already on leash you don't have to worry [47:00] about finding the leash and collar to [47:02] put on them so that if they jump on the [47:03] guest or they run out the front door [47:05] you're controlling the dogs everything [47:07] and if you do do that too you don't have [47:09] to worry about the dog being dominant [47:11] later because you're controlling all the [47:13] resources you're in control of them and [47:15] the dog is you know so it's just if [47:17] nothing else one crate train your puppy [47:19] and to watch them like a hawk because if [47:23] you do those two things you're gonna [47:24] have a great relationship it's so great [47:26] you said that because literally my next [47:28] question was gonna be for somebody who [47:29] says well I can't watch my dog all the [47:31] time what do I do [47:32] crates so exercise pen you know a small [47:35] area where they've got their toys that [47:37] they can chew on different bones you [47:40] know just a small you know four by four [47:42] no bigger than that the reason that you [47:44] want a small space is because dogs [47:46] naturally are clean there's always dogs [47:48] that aren't cleaned but it naturally [47:49] dogs are clean so if you give them just [47:51] enough space to sleep and play or like [47:54] in a crate just enough room to relax [47:57] they're not gonna go potty there so now [47:59] you're teaching them to hold it but the [48:01] big thing especially lately is natural [48:03] disasters right if you could evacuate it [48:07] and your dogs not crate trained you know [48:08] how much stress you're gonna add on to [48:09] your dog being in a strange place with [48:11] with you know in a new place [48:13] strange people loud noises and being in [48:16] a container they're not you still for [48:18] the dogs are de crédit trained it's like [48:19] okay we're gonna go relax here no [48:20] problem it becomes a routine exactly [48:23] that's yeah it's something that's the [48:25] same in a myth [48:27] chaos which is nice for the dog and [48:28] people a lot of people will think that [48:30] creating them is a form of punishment [48:32] but I mean dogs are den animals right [48:35] and then after they're potty-trained if [48:37] somebody really wanted to they could put [48:38] the dog in a larger crate or that's when [48:40] they can start giving the dog the [48:41] opportunity to be in the house and I'm [48:43] curious of things I don't know if I ever [48:45] told you this analogy it's a new analogy [48:46] that I came up with recently for the [48:48] whole potty training day because I kept [48:49] running into more and more people and I [48:51] thought this was a technique that had [48:53] died out a while back the whole rubbing [48:54] the dogs facing and what I start telling [48:56] people I said I look at it this way [48:58] imagine you're a prisoner in a different [49:00] country where they speak a different [49:01] language that you don't understand and [49:03] you're in your cell and every day you [49:04] have you're afforded the opportunity to [49:06] use the toilet and you use it every day [49:07] no problem and one day you're bored and [49:09] you start to carve on the wall and the [49:11] guards see you carving on the wall and [49:13] they run in yelling in some language you [49:15] don't understand they take your face and [49:16] I shove it into the toilet and I say now [49:18] do you think that they're shoving your [49:19] face in the toilet because you use the [49:21] toilet or because you're drawing on the [49:23] wall they're like has drawn on the wall [49:24] your dog is not stupid they know that [49:26] they went to the bathroom but they don't [49:28] understand that's why you're punishing [49:29] them it's whatever they were doing when [49:31] you caught them is what they're [49:32] associating the punishment to so it's [49:34] not like we have dogs that are goldfish [49:36] and they don't have a memory so it's [49:37] just it goes back to we're talking about [49:39] for that clear communication and that's [49:42] people have to the dog looks guilty I [49:45] hear that all the time the dog on the [49:47] trash they know what they did well they [49:49] actually did a research and they did a [49:50] study where a person would go into the [49:52] house not where the trash can the dog [49:54] didn't even do it [49:55] the person would come home the dog would [49:56] act guilty the dog didn't do it what [50:00] what are dogs fantastic at body language [50:02] so they can tell you're pissed and they [50:06] know then you make that face they're in [50:07] trouble [50:08] so they act guilty that's their [50:10] appeasement that's how dogs get out of [50:11] trouble in awhile - they they offer [50:13] appeasement behaviors and so unless you [50:16] caught the dog in the act and again set [50:18] the dog up to succeed set the dog up to [50:19] fail there they don't put the two and [50:22] two together so even if your dog acts [50:23] guilty it's not acting guilty because of [50:26] the behavior they just see that you're [50:28] pissed and they're offering appeasement [50:29] behaviors or trying to make you happy [50:30] nothing no association and that I think [50:34] that's spot-on - so it is important for [50:37] people to know that and again going to [50:40] what we were saying [50:40] when you are working with your dog back [50:42] when I lived up in LA the analogy I [50:44] would use since it's in the Hollywood [50:46] area I'm like just pretend it's theater [50:47] right and before you would go out and do [50:51] a show for an audience you practice and [50:53] you rehearse everything and I say [50:55] practice and rehearse with your dog if [50:56] you have where you want your dog to act [50:58] a certain weight like you said people [50:59] coming over rehearse it right if you [51:01] want your dog to act a certain way [51:03] during dinnertime rehearse what you want [51:04] them to do and going back they're not [51:06] psychic right what are some other common [51:09] things that you've come across that [51:10] seems to be reoccurring that would be [51:12] helpful for people to know so crates are [51:15] super helpful and I think every dog [51:17] should be crate trained but some people [51:20] they use it without training so they [51:23] think that just by creating their dog [51:24] the dog is learning and it's not it's a [51:27] management tool so if you create your [51:29] dog for eight hours a day because you're [51:31] at work you know them to get in trouble [51:32] okay that's eight hours and then the dog [51:33] sleeps in the crate at night and there's [51:34] another eight hours that's sixteen hours [51:36] out of a 24 hour a day that your dog is [51:38] living in a box not fair for me it's not [51:42] fair so you need to be training the dog [51:45] so that way they can have more freedom [51:47] so that way you can get to the point [51:48] where you can leave your dog free [51:50] without them tearing into things and [51:52] that's again going back to setting the [51:53] dog up to succeed in setting the dog up [51:55] to fail so you're not gonna the first [51:56] time you try your dog out of the crate [51:58] you're gonna give them free run of the [51:59] house no start with a small room your [52:01] kitchen we have everything put away [52:03] where the dogs not gonna get in anything [52:05] if they can't behave in the kitchen [52:07] they're not ready for the next room so [52:09] start in small spaces then as your dog [52:11] gets better they earn more privileges [52:14] and freedom on that success yes [52:17] how can a lot of people know how to use [52:18] toys when turn at toys I'm sorry a lot [52:20] of people know how to use food when [52:21] they're working with their dog and any [52:23] we can go into more depth about that as [52:25] far as because you said something [52:26] earlier if your dog lays down you can [52:27] reward them for that right and that's [52:29] part of that operant conditioning [52:30] getting the dog to understand that their [52:32] behavior has an effect on their [52:33] environment which is highly recommended [52:35] you know always keeping treats on [52:36] yourself when you get a brand-new dog [52:37] but how can a lot of people really don't [52:39] know how to use toys effectively and [52:41] toys can be incredibly effective and [52:44] even without toys just play play with [52:47] your dog and a lot of people think you [52:49] know playing tug is gonna make the dog [52:50] aggressive [52:51] it's not all it does get the dog excited [52:53] so if you have no control of the dogs [52:56] around get yourself into trouble but [52:59] having the dog bite a toy is not gonna [53:01] make them aggressive it's just not true [53:04] but it's a great way to practice control [53:07] when the dog is highly aroused so again [53:10] same thing with going back to the couch [53:11] everything has to have rules to us [53:13] you're allowed on the couch as long as [53:14] you don't jump up on your own you wait [53:15] till be invited up and you get off when [53:17] I tell you to so the same rules are with [53:19] Tugg so if I have a toy I don't think [53:21] I'm just grabbing it because I have it [53:22] they need to wait until I tell them get [53:24] it yes whatever I invite them to play [53:26] and when I had to tell them to let it go [53:28] they need to also respect the rules and [53:29] let it go if you don't have that control [53:32] that should be your first of all because [53:34] nobody likes to play fetch with the dog [53:35] let's you're gonna throw it once and [53:36] then the dog runs around the yard and [53:38] you don't get to throw it again so to [53:41] get the dog to let it go you can try [53:42] trading make sure you know if your toy [53:45] is five make sure that you're rewarding [53:49] with seven or an eight make sure that [53:51] you always have something better so if [53:53] you throw a tennis ball make sure that [53:55] your ball has a squeaker in it again you [53:58] always have something better get the dog [54:00] to let it go hi George [54:02] we have a cat that's joining us this is [54:05] George he's very good at training dogs I [54:07] like George so yeah I mean play play is [54:14] great because it does two things one it [54:17] teaches the dog control when the dog is [54:19] highly aroused it gets rid of some of [54:21] that energy and it builds a relationship [54:24] and you don't have to you know keep food [54:26] on you you can have a good job let's go [54:28] get your toy and it's good like I said [54:31] even with no toys just play with your [54:33] dog run around you know pet them get [54:35] them all excited run around have them do [54:36] a sit good dog and then run away it [54:38] doesn't always have to be about the food [54:40] or about the toys it needs to be about [54:41] you and your dog you always have [54:43] yourself you always have your body you [54:44] always have your voice you always have [54:45] your hands a lot of people get stuck on [54:47] not petting your dog they don't you know [54:50] they want to either give the treat or [54:52] yell at them know but they never sit [54:53] there and just massage their dog or they [54:56] do when the dog is doing nothing the [54:57] dogs sleeping on the couch all serene [54:58] let me give you a massage well what did [55:00] the dog do to earn that you know [55:02] everybody if I [55:03] we're to just pay for doing nothing and [55:05] then I wanted you to work for it you'd [55:06] be like why would I work for if I get it [55:08] for free so if you want to use praise [55:10] and petting as your rewards if you don't [55:12] want to have food on you then don't give [55:14] it away for free don't like oh you're so [55:16] cute today no tell the dog that's it [55:18] then tell them they're so cute and pet [55:20] them you know but if you're just giving [55:22] it away for free why would the dog never [55:23] work for it [55:24] how important is imprinting so I want to [55:27] talk a little bit more about the [55:28] positive training because that's kind of [55:30] what everybody pushes is positive and [55:32] then I actually if you don't mind I want [55:33] to talk a little bit about the [55:34] correction side and get a little bit [55:36] more detail with that but with [55:37] imprinting and what let's go over what [55:40] imprinting is because I'm sure people [55:41] hear it within the pet world but they [55:43] really don't know what imprinting is or [55:45] how to effectively use it and get the [55:47] most out of those crucial weeks so we [55:50] talked about very young puppies correct [55:51] yeah okay so there's a program called [55:56] puppy culture and that's what I use to [55:58] raise my puppies now along with a couple [56:00] other things but you start obstacles [56:04] when they're four or five weeks so [56:07] teaching them to climb over things [56:08] different environmental things so a lot [56:10] of people don't realize how much a good [56:12] breeder will already teach the puppies [56:14] when you get them in eight weeks it's [56:15] not just mom feet you know the mom dog [56:18] feeds them and then they go home so we [56:21] teach the dogs marker they know the [56:23] clicker before they go home they are [56:25] exposed to sounds I'll you know clean [56:28] things together I'll drop pans [56:29] I'll teach your dog to be relaxed around [56:31] a vacuum I start teaching them to play I [56:34] start little tug games with the puppies [56:35] I teach them problem-solving so I'll set [56:38] up an exercise pin with the food on the [56:40] other side and teach the dog to [56:42] problem-solve you can't just get [56:43] frustrated try going right or try going [56:45] left in order to get your reward they [56:48] get exposed to tons of people they get [56:49] exposed to other animals they come in [56:51] the house and they play with the cat [56:52] they learn that a histamines [56:55] you know it's with puppies it's not all [56:56] rainbows and butterflies they need to [56:58] learn boundaries from a very young age [56:59] and if they do they are more adjusted as [57:03] I get older and there's even you know [57:05] the superstar puppy program and neonatal [57:07] things that you can do when they're very [57:09] young you know holding them upright and [57:10] upside down and warm things and cold [57:12] things and touching the pads of their [57:14] feet and things like that to help [57:15] stimulate [57:16] adding small amounts of stress that the [57:18] dogs are willing area are able to [57:20] overpass and that way the puppy has [57:23] already dealt with how to learn how to [57:25] deal with stress how to problem-solve [57:27] and and to be socialized before they [57:29] even go home because a lot of people [57:30] don't understand and this is one of the [57:33] biggest problems with vets in the u.

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 198/468,"[57:36] is people tell tell you know people [57:38] don't socialize your dog and tell their [57:39] dog their vaccinations well guess what [57:41] you're missing the key socialization [57:43] period from 6 to around 13 weeks that's [57:46] when they're little sponges so you want [57:47] them to see bikes skateboards big dogs [57:50] small dogs you know people with beards [57:52] men with hats you know strollers canes [57:56] people carrying bags people wearing hats [57:58] anything that they can possibly see [58:00] later in life you want to show them [58:02] because after that period they go [58:04] through different periods and every dog [58:06] is different in terms of exacts not [58:07] exactly at 13 weeks or exactly at 14 [58:09] weeks they go through fair periods some [58:11] fair periods for dogs is very mild and [58:13] some is more extreme but if your dog has [58:15] seen a man carrying a bag wearing with a [58:18] beard with a hat on when they were eight [58:20] weeks and now they see it during that [58:22] fear appeared like okay it's kind of [58:23] scary but I've seen it before and it's a [58:25] lot easier for them to overpass if [58:27] they've never seen it before they're [58:28] like oh my god what's that on his face [58:30] and he's got something on his head and [58:31] it's harder for them to get over it [58:33] because now they're first being exposed [58:34] to it during that fear period and a lot [58:38] of the vets will tell you don't take the [58:39] dog out tore down their back stations [58:40] but you missed that whole period and now [58:42] let's do that for a reason though [58:44] because of course yeah I mean there's [58:46] part of those there's lots of distemper [58:47] there's lots of bad things that the dogs [58:49] can be exposed to and this is important [58:51] to know when you're taking them on your [58:53] socialized them you're not taking that [58:54] dog to a dog dog you're not taking that [58:56] dog to Pet Smart where there's a lot of [58:58] dogs you're take out to places where the [59:00] likelihood of parvo is very unlikely and [59:04] the reason why the vet saying I want it [59:06] just in defense of like veterinarians [59:08] they're do it because if the dog does [59:09] get sick [59:13] they're on the medicine side I'm on the [59:15] behavior in the brains exactly so bad no [59:20] dog parks ever if you take anything from [59:24] this podcast is don't take your dog to a [59:26] dog park why because number one not all [59:28] the dogs are friendly nobody has control [59:30] and nobody's paying attention so I can [59:33] teach bad behaviors you have the risk of [59:34] your dog getting into a dog fight so if [59:38] you heard there were stories that I get [59:40] of people of my dogs attacked at the dog [59:42] park [59:42] or my dog is aggressive so I took him to [59:44] the dog park to socialize him or just [59:47] it's a great idea in theory horrible in [59:49] actuality do not take your dog to a dog [59:51] park and a lot of people with pets they [59:53] do it because before I learned about dog [59:54] training I took my dog to the park and [59:56] in fact it taught my Golden Retriever [59:59] who's really really friendly sweet dog [60:02] to other dogs until he was attacked by [60:04] three dogs and then he became very [60:06] defensive or on dog so literally his [60:08] aggression was taught at the dog park [60:10] before it was brought out he's brought [60:13] out yeah yeah but I mean he didn't he [60:14] wouldn't have presented that or wouldn't [60:16] came out most of the time obviously [60:19] there's some parks where it's the same [60:20] five people every single time and and if [60:23] all if you know the people and you know [60:24] the dogs you know [60:25] yes socialize your dog but dog parks are [60:29] a great place for dogs you know learn [60:30] how to be a bully or get bullied and [60:31] meanwhile if I call look how cute they [60:33] are they're playing they're not playing [60:34] this dogs being a total jerk and this [60:36] dog is being harassed and the problem [60:38] with the digression is that it works so [60:40] the dog that's getting bullied [60:41] finally growls our stamps back and along [60:43] goes okay I'll leave you alone [60:44] well now the dog goes aha if you ever [60:46] get nervous mom's not protect you but if [60:48] you growl and snap you can protect [60:50] yourself [60:50] well now anytime a dog even goes near [60:52] them they're growling and reacting [60:54] because a good you know the best defense [60:56] is a good offense and now you have a dog [60:58] that barks and lunges anytime they see a [60:59] dog because they're anticipating getting [61:00] bullied and that all started the dog [61:02] barked and again people don't know what [61:03] to look for so it's yeah no no dog parks [61:06] most good places socialize your dog sit [61:09] outside a grocery store how many dogs do [61:11] you see there you don't see very many [61:12] right so you're it's not a high-traffic [61:14] place for dogs poop because that's a lot [61:16] of times where you're gonna pass things [61:17] down and meanwhile they hear the noise [61:20] of the shopping carts people carrying [61:21] things you get all kinds of people there [61:23] and most of time people are just going [61:25] in and out so you don't have a lot of [61:27] sure of everybody puppy you know wanting [61:29] to come up to your dog they're going [61:31] from A to B they have something to do [61:32] they have things that are gonna fall so [61:34] they don't have time to come and harass [61:35] your puppy meanwhile you can expose your [61:37] dog to that environment same thing sit [61:39] outside of a Starbucks you know go to [61:42] Home Depot there's plenty of dog [61:43] friendly places that there's not too [61:45] many dogs or at least dogs aren't going [61:46] to the bathroom but if your dogs gonna [61:48] catch something they're gonna catch [61:49] something I mean part of a lifts in the [61:51] ground for a very long time [61:53] so does coccidia you can I mean you step [61:56] on grass you walk into your house your [61:57] dog picks up your shoe they just got [61:59] parvo they can have the vaccine that's [62:01] supposed to defend against it and still [62:03] get it you know so I've had that happen [62:05] to a good friend of mine and I remember [62:07] we did a fundraiser in order to raise [62:09] the money to help take care of the dog [62:11] because he had the money to cover it and [62:12] people in the comments were criticizing [62:15] him for not giving the vaccination he's [62:16] like no the dog got the vaccine it just [62:18] it could still happen so there's still [62:20] always the risk so in a sense what I'm [62:22] trying to say there is don't live your [62:23] life necessarily as if something's [62:25] always bad gonna have yeah yeah you [62:27] might protect your puppy when they're [62:29] small but if now they're fearful and [62:32] aggressive because they weren't [62:33] socialized when they were younger and [62:35] they live to be 14 but you can't have [62:37] guests over it's a long 14 years of your [62:39] life or what some people will do to is [62:41] they'll end up giving the dog up to the [62:43] shelter because it has these issues that [62:44] they didn't focus on in the very [62:46] beginning yeah [62:46] and often it's not by their it's by no [62:48] fault of their own because they don't [62:49] have the information yeah they just [62:51] don't know any better and you know [62:52] people listen to their vet because it's [62:54] their vet of course they're gonna listen [62:55] to them but again you have to think of [62:58] it from the medical standpoint yeah you [63:00] know you want your dog to be protected [63:02] before you take them out but from a [63:03] mental standpoint are you not gonna take [63:06] your kid to school until they're 18 [63:08] right right if the first time you [63:10] socialize your kid when they're 18 years [63:12] old they're gonna be either fighting [63:13] everybody because now they've got their [63:14] testosterone or their ways scared out of [63:16] their pants because they have it super [63:18] awkward they're having no social skills [63:20] and and because you like analogies I [63:22] also use the dog park is like prison [63:25] yeah they're gonna meet all kinds of [63:27] people they're also gonna pick up all [63:28] kinds of bad habits yes so it's it's not [63:30] a good place to socialize your puppy and [63:32] you said something that made me think of [63:36] oh just talking about the veterinarian [63:39] or the vet [63:40] again I believe that everything that [63:42] they do say is it's good intent right [63:45] and the socializing side again if [63:47] something does happen and a vet says [63:49] yeah socialize your dog then you go back [63:51] to the vet so I just want to make that [63:52] clear but then also what I do want to [63:54] talk about is canine nutrition and I [63:57] know you know a lot about this subject I [63:59] know what you feed your dogs and how you [64:01] take care of them and I want to kind of [64:03] go over if you don't mind some of the [64:06] common misunderstanding some of the [64:12] common misunderstandings that people [64:14] have when it comes to canine nutrition [64:16] what to feed them what they should [64:18] probably avoid and then of course [64:20] depending on what some people's budget [64:22] are it's really restricts what they can [64:24] and can't do but what is your general [64:26] guidance that you give people like [64:27] someone who's gonna brand-new dog what [64:30] do i do how do I feed them how do I take [64:31] care of them so I usually tell people [64:34] start with there's a website called dog [64:36] food advisor comm and it'll rate all the [64:38] different dog foods so if nothing else [64:40] you can go in there and see you know [64:42] what did the breeder what was the [64:44] shelter feeding them because whatever [64:45] the puppy was already being fed you [64:47] don't want to switch him over to new [64:48] food cold turkey especially if you're [64:50] already dealing with the new environment [64:51] the animal may already be stressed so [64:53] find out what your pet was eating before [64:55] either at the breeder or at the rescue [64:57] and then you're gonna have to change [64:59] their food from there not every dog does [65:02] well on every food so even some of the [65:05] George that's okay we're not not every [65:14] dog is gonna do well in every food some [65:16] foods are very rich and the dogs don't [65:18] even if it's a fantastic food they don't [65:20] do well on it I've tried to feed my dogs [65:21] a Cana in origin multiple times because [65:24] it's a fantastic food my dogs don't do [65:26] well on it they can't they get diarrhea [65:28] they just don't it's too rich for their [65:29] systems so genetics plays a huge role [65:33] German Shepherds tend have very [65:35] sensitive systems so you need to be [65:37] careful and if you have a German [65:38] Shepherd again just in general you're [65:40] gonna have to go slower you know and [65:42] your as you switch them over to a [65:44] different food are there any certain [65:46] type of foods that you would avoid or [65:48] recommend avoiding like certain things [65:50] all of them not we can do people food [65:53] like for example something I always say [65:55] if the if you look in the ingredients [65:57] and it has red five yellow six if [65:59] they're adding different colors it's [66:01] probably not a good food yeah if the [66:04] list is this long and I'm making big [66:07] hand gesture and you can't pronounce [66:09] half the things that are on your you [66:11] know the label just like with people who [66:13] would probably stay away what's a good [66:15] way to read the ingredients so you may [66:16] not know all the crazy things that are [66:19] in there that you can't can't pronounce [66:20] so so just like people food the higher [66:22] up on the list that is on on the [66:25] ingredients list the higher percentage [66:26] it is so if chicken or beef is number [66:29] one that means that the most of the food [66:31] is that if you see corn as the number [66:33] one that means that most of the food is [66:35] corn dogs are carnivores but they also [66:39] would eat whatever is in the in the [66:41] stomach or the intestines of whatever [66:43] they're eating so they do they can and [66:46] again they're scavengers too so they [66:47] can't have fruits and vegetables that's [66:49] okay for them to eat do they need it no [66:50] what can they have it of course you know [66:54] there's different vitamins and things [66:55] that you can give them you know ground [66:57] up the carrots or green beans if you [67:00] have a dog that I have a cattle dog he [67:02] looks at food and gets fat so I can give [67:04] them some green beans which is high in [67:05] fiber so I can make them feel full [67:07] without the extra calories helping to [67:08] lose weight exactly so there's there's [67:10] lots of foods like that that you can [67:11] give them you know carrots are a great [67:13] snack for dogs bananas they don't need [67:17] it yeah but they can have a little [67:19] little snack if you have a dog that [67:21] needs to watch their weight yeah it's so [67:24] someone has a dog who's fat right [67:25] because a lot of people have yeah how [67:28] would you recommend for somebody to get [67:30] their dog to lower their weight in a [67:31] healthy way so look at the calories just [67:33] because and look at the bag so if the if [67:36] the bag recommends that you feed three [67:38] cups doesn't mean that your dog needs [67:40] three cups just because you know every [67:43] just like people's metabolism is [67:44] different the dog's metabolism is [67:46] different to some dogs burned through [67:48] calories really fast and it's hard to [67:50] keep weight on them like I said my [67:52] Australian Cattle Dog he gets fat just [67:53] looking at food even though he's super [67:55] active he just you just holds on to it [67:57] so there's some breeds labs my Cattle [68:01] Dog beagles there's some breeds that [68:03] just kind of retain weight and [68:06] unfortunate [68:07] the labs people think they're supposed [68:08] to look like that and they're not and a [68:11] lot of people go you know it's I feed it [68:14] what's on the back it's on the bag well [68:15] that doesn't mean just because just like [68:18] it people say just have 2,000 calories [68:20] does not mean that you would survive on [68:21] 2,000 calories or that I need 2,000 [68:23] calories that's just the general [68:24] guideline so yes so I always tell people [68:26] start with what sells in the bag and [68:28] then feed them less if they look fat and [68:31] feed them more if they look skinny and [68:32] go from there if you're feeding your dog [68:34] seven cups a day there's crap in your [68:37] food and you need to change it if you [68:40] were having seven poops a day [68:42] again there's crap in your food and you [68:43] need to change it the best bang for your [68:46] buck is Costco the purple Costco bag not [68:49] even the grain free the grain free I [68:51] think is the same as taste of the wild I [68:52] don't know yeah it's it's pretty much [68:54] the same so if you want green for you [68:56] can go that route some good about it [68:58] yeah is the best bang for your buck [69:01] they've got a puppy kind and they've got [69:02] the adult purple bag and that's the best [69:05] bang for your buck you can go on the dog [69:08] for an adviser website and you can look [69:10] at the different foods and write them [69:11] I've been feeding Victor for a while now [69:13] too and that's a really good bang for [69:16] your buck you don't need a Costco card [69:17] for them and something I want to point [69:18] out to what you often do is you will [69:21] often feed your dogs raw I do yeah so I [69:24] stopped because I had a baby and my [69:26] husband doesn't do it right so if you're [69:29] gonna feed raw you have to do it right [69:30] you have to do research do your research [69:32] your portions have to be right so the [69:35] way that I feed it is 80% meat and then [69:38] it's 10% bone five percent so you did [69:43] you did the hard work so you went and [69:45] that's actually you can get it pre-made [69:47] the best way I mean in my opinion the [69:49] best food you could feed your dog [69:51] hands-down is raw when you prepare [69:52] yourself [69:53] but the worst you could feed your dog is [69:55] raw when you prepare yourself [69:56] incorrectly correct so that I cannot [69:59] live off of chicken breast alone yes [70:00] yeah that's no yes it's rami that you [70:04] cannot live off of that just may be said [70:06] you could buy premium raw for dollars [70:08] yes yeah and I used to use [70:11] happy happy dog is a local place and [70:14] they've got good prices and it comes in [70:17] just a tube and it's you open it you put [70:20] it on the airplane you're done yes if [70:22] you have a budget it's definitely [70:24] recommended to feed raw but there are [70:26] people who just I mean right yeah if [70:29] you're gonna you know but feeding raw [70:31] could cost what 300 a month if you're [70:33] buying pre-made so can you do your [70:36] research I can get around a dollar a [70:38] pound if I make it myself [70:40] yes yeah if you're buying it you're [70:44] gonna be around 350 a pound but the dogs [70:47] eat less because they're using [70:48] everything and the size of the poop pays [70:51] for itself it's it's very noticeable a [70:54] raw fed dog because they have very very [70:57] little waste and it's very easy if your [71:00] bone ratio is correct you have very easy [71:02] to pick up poop so if it is within your [71:04] budget I mean it's highly recommended to [71:06] d-n-r all if it's not within your budget [71:08] Kirkland is is a good kibble if you need [71:11] to you know you know like dehydrated is [71:18] also really nice but again mm-hmm it's [71:22] like anything though the the higher the [71:24] quality you are gonna spend a little bit [71:26] more but it will your higher quality and [71:30] you're also gonna spend less on vet [71:32] bills and that's why I really I love the [71:34] fact one so when we were training and [71:38] working together watching you get all [71:40] this raw dog food and prepping it for [71:42] all the dogs I'm like that's so cool [71:43] because it's so good for the dog yeah [71:45] it's good for the dogs it also gives [71:48] them something to do I mean and I fast [71:50] my dogs when they were on the raw I fast [71:52] them once a week too and they just put [71:53] their me t-bone a lot of people don't [71:55] realize that giving the dogs system a [71:57] break is actually very good for them and [71:59] a lot of people overlook fasting so I [72:01] used to fast once a week because it [72:03] gives the dog's digestive system a [72:05] little bit of a break and of course I [72:06] give them like a big raw me t-bone for [72:09] them to chew on so they're getting [72:10] something and they're starving them but [72:12] also your dog is not gonna starve in one [72:15] day yeah so a lot of people and they go [72:17] my dogs not food motivated I would say [72:19] well one do free feed yeah your thoughts [72:21] I'm free feeding don't [72:24] it's why why would you work for it you [72:27] get it for free hmm that's that's the [72:30] biggest thing and if the dogs not food [72:32] motivated they're overweight they have [72:34] everything want for free why would they [72:36] work for you though if you're a [72:37] millionaire you're not gonna work for [72:38] minimum wage you have no motivation for [72:40] that so either you need to find [72:41] something that does motivate the dog or [72:43] cut back all that free food and have [72:45] them work for it what about the dog [72:47] doesn't need people say that I put the [72:49] dog the food down the dog doesn't eat it [72:50] right away if your dog is healthy they [72:52] will eat when they're hungry so you put [72:54] it down they don't eat what do you [72:55] suggest an offer if you feel bad offer [73:00] it again in the evening and give them 20 [73:03] minutes so they don't eat pick it up a [73:04] healthy dog can easily go three to four [73:06] days without meeting a lot of people go [73:08] oh they're gonna starve no they're not [73:10] especially the dogs who aren't eating [73:11] I'm sure they have a nice fat reservoir [73:13] and they're not gonna waste it again [73:15] this is a healthy dog if the dog is not [73:17] healthy if they have other underlying [73:18] issues do not you know talk to your vet [73:22] first I'm not telling not every dog can [73:24] go that long without eating obviously [73:26] play it by ear but a healthy dog can go [73:29] a long time without eating yeah two [73:31] bounces like people yep you're gonna be [73:33] hungry but guess what you're not gonna [73:34] die and there's been dogs that I've [73:36] worked with in the past were I'm working [73:38] with the owner and they don't want any [73:40] sort of Corrections and I always respect [73:42] what the owner wants if they don't want [73:43] me to correct the dog fine and I always [73:45] let them know that could take a little [73:46] bit longer if we're not an infant longer [73:48] yeah a lot longer what did I say it [73:53] could take longer often it's not as [73:55] clear but you know in any case I'll [73:59] still do it that way and there's been [74:00] dogs where they are not really food [74:03] motivated because they're free fed [74:04] they're not interested in toys they [74:05] don't care if I pet them and I've gone [74:08] for days with the dog not eating because [74:10] I offered the food to the dog and the [74:12] dog doesn't take him I go great we'll [74:13] try again at dinner dinner comes around [74:15] I'm like you ready to train the dog says [74:16] no I said great we'll try again at [74:18] breakfast the next day and then [74:19] eventually the dog eats and I let them [74:21] know there is a possibility we may go a [74:23] few days yeah they're just not deciding [74:29] to eat you're not starving the dog for [74:31] four days and then trying to feed him [74:33] you're offering food twice [74:34] the dog just isn't hungry enough to take [74:36] it so that's its I think there's a [74:38] difference between not feeding a dog for [74:40] four days and the dog not eating for [74:41] four days yeah so we're definitely not [74:44] advocating saying don't feed the dog [74:46] food but the dogs not hungry it's okay [74:49] the fasting the fasting though is great [74:51] I mean there is a really great nonprofit [74:55] that I'm a fan of it's called keto pet [74:57] sanctuary I know you're familiar with [74:59] them and kido pet sanctuary they help [75:01] dogs that have cancer and the founder so [75:05] she has a couple dogs herself and she'll [75:07] often post videos and different things [75:09] like that and I remember one of the [75:11] videos she posted where she's talking [75:12] about the nutrition because often people [75:14] over feed their dogs and she even said [75:16] in the video she goes I fast my dogs [75:18] once a week and it's been proven I mean [75:20] if you look at the dog who has lived the [75:21] longest I believe it was in Australian [75:23] Cattle Dog and it lived 30 years or [75:25] maybe even 31 it exercised around 5 [75:28] miles a day [75:28] it ate raw food and drink raw goat's [75:31] milk and it fasted it actually so fast [75:35] is what the owner said you just go days [75:36] where he just wouldn't eat and it helps [75:39] with that longevity and I don't know the [75:40] details as well as u-dor as well as the [75:43] founder of keto pet sanctuary but it [75:47] makes a big difference sure [75:48] in genetics also play a huge role some [75:50] Sun dogs you know the farmers role I [75:52] said you know X food which I would [75:55] normally say is crap food and the dog [75:57] reformed to be 16 yes some dogs do well [76:00] on it some dogs you feed them a [76:01] fantastic diet and they get cancer when [76:03] they're 6 that's kind of life but if you [76:06] were gonna try get your dog to live [76:08] longer just like with people if you put [76:11] in good stuff you're gonna get out good [76:13] stuff if you you know you can't expect [76:15] professional athlete to do well just [76:17] eating popcorn all day yeah they need [76:19] the sooner cert nutrients in order to [76:21] perform and dogs are the same way that's [76:23] like those people who've you know smoked [76:25] a pack of cigarettes every day and drink [76:27] beer every day and live to 100 that's [76:31] exception not the rule [76:32] people underestimate genetics and now I [76:34] want to mention something too so a lot [76:36] of people are familiar with my show [76:39] rescue dog - super dog on Animal Planet [76:41] but a lot of people don't know that you [76:43] were one of the behind-the-scenes [76:45] trainers [76:46] that make it happen that made a lot of [76:48] the pieces come together and made me [76:50] look better on camera because we have [76:52] these dogs performing and the reason why [76:54] I'm saying that is so you're a huge [76:56] advocate of helping dogs and shelters [76:58] you've rescued dogs rehome dogs you help [77:00] people with it but you also breed dogs [77:02] and a lot of times people kind of give [77:06] the cold shoulder or they you know have [77:09] a negative comment about breeders and [77:11] what I always tell people it's I'm a [77:12] huge advocate of good breeders and [77:15] something that I truly truly believe in [77:17] that if only good breeders existed [77:20] shelters and rescues would not exist [77:22] it's true it's so yeah so so a good [77:26] breeder socializes the puppies before [77:29] they even go home and most the time [77:31] you're not gonna make any money so a lot [77:34] of people go they just you know they do [77:35] it for the money or whatever no I don't [77:38] I do it because I they're they're [77:41] purposely bred so I'm not just oh my dog [77:44] is cute this dog is cute let's throw [77:46] them together and have some puppies so [77:47] all of my dogs that I braid are Health [77:50] tested so their hips and their elbows [77:51] are done their eyes are done I want to [77:54] make sure that any genetic issues are [77:56] addressed they're titled so I want to [77:59] make sure that the dog does that mean [78:00] title so I do ass dog sport called [78:02] French ring which is obedience [78:04] protection and agility so the dogs at [78:06] least need to have their CSA U which is [78:08] like the beginning temperament test that [78:10] just shows that the dog is social and [78:11] has basic obedience but ideally the dogs [78:15] are titled higher especially the male's [78:17] the females [78:18] I don't expect as much because when they [78:21] go into heat and things like that you [78:22] can't compete with them or you have to [78:25] go last so it's a little bit harder [78:26] playing you know competing with a female [78:28] the dogs the more testosterone tend to [78:31] do better in my sport so the male's [78:32] doesn't mean that you can't do well the [78:34] female but the males in general are [78:37] better than the females for this sport [78:39] and and I I don't litter so all of the [78:43] puppies on my contracts when they go [78:45] home to the people so I don't let people [78:46] pick their puppies I assign the puppies [78:48] so you want a dog for search and rescue [78:50] you have kids you want to do this you [78:52] want to do that I go kid this puppy [78:54] would best for you I've had them for the [78:56] last eight weeks I know their [78:57] temperament you're going [78:58] oh this one's cute I want him know this [79:01] dog is a better fit for you [79:02] so I assign the puppies to their owners [79:04] based on the dog's temperament the [79:06] owners temperament and what their goal [79:07] is so so I'm making sure they're getting [79:10] a good match the second thing that I do [79:12] is I microchip all the puppies in my [79:14] name so if at any point the owner I sell [79:17] to is irresponsible I get called I go [79:20] pick up my puppy [79:20] so my puppy will never end up and rescue [79:22] or if they are I'm getting them [79:24] immediately because I get notified so [79:25] the owners can definitely register in [79:27] their name as well so they can get their [79:29] own dog if it ended up in the shelter [79:30] but I get notified the second thing is I [79:33] have a breeding contract so people are [79:35] not allowed to breed their dogs unless [79:36] same thing they title the dog the dog is [79:39] health tested and they're breeding for a [79:41] purpose so if they do they're you know [79:44] they're messing with my contract and I [79:46] can sue them for you know X amount of [79:48] whatever is on my contract so it's not [79:50] just oh my dog has her first heat cycle [79:53] I'm gonna breathe em you're not allowed [79:54] to do that so I have control not only on [79:56] my puppies but on the next generation as [79:58] well to make sure that only healthy dogs [80:00] with a good miner being bred and you [80:02] keep in contact with everybody yes quite [80:05] often you're friends with these people [80:06] and you train with them and they give [80:09] you constant updates to it's something [80:11] else that people are blown away at the [80:12] fact cuz I often get asked like so where [80:15] do you rescue your dogs from and I said [80:16] oh my dogs are from breeders and people [80:18] are blown away and I go over everything [80:20] basically we just said it's like every [80:22] single one of my dogs where I got them [80:25] from I still keep in contact with the [80:26] breeders I still talk to them I still [80:28] train with them if I have the [80:29] opportunity and if you're if you find a [80:32] good breeder that's exactly what they do [80:34] they make sure the dogs are just like [80:38] what you said which I love is you said [80:40] there these are my dogs it's like the [80:43] the in discriminative breeding or the [80:44] breeding just for profit they don't care [80:46] where the dogs go and that's how they [80:47] end up in the shelters and they end up [80:48] in the rescues and they don't care about [80:50] the dog's temperament disposition [80:52] trainability and that's where we get all [80:54] the issues in fact my dog Ari [80:57] so I got her from a good friend of mine [81:00] and I trained with him multiple times [81:02] and I found out he delayed her and I was [81:05] ready for a puppy and we talked on the [81:07] phone for an hour before he even [81:09] considered letting me have one of the [81:11] dogs and then I went out to his training [81:14] location and we trained together for a [81:16] week before finally at the end he said [81:18] okay I think you can have one of my [81:19] puppies and on my contract too I don't [81:22] care if you decide that you don't your [81:24] dog a one-year or at seven years or if [81:25] it's ten years if you don't know your [81:27] dog it's coming back to me it's never [81:29] gonna end up in the shelter I don't care [81:31] what age you decide I'm moving I can't [81:33] have the dog my dogs will never be in [81:35] the shelter I will always take them back [81:36] at the same time good breeders will know [81:38] okay I had ten puppies this year or [81:40] whatever I can't be responsible for more [81:43] than that so I can't breed more than [81:45] that so if I'm having five litters a [81:48] year and putting out 20 dogs and all a [81:49] sudden 20 people don't want their dogs I [81:51] have to be in a situation where I can [81:53] take all those dogs back so don't put [81:55] out more than you can take back I think [81:56] is also a big deal to and out and good [82:00] breeders to also important not only [82:03] maintaining integrity of a breed and [82:05] when we say a breed it means a dog [82:07] that's bred for a specific job or [82:09] specific task right and dogs that are [82:11] bred for certain jobs those jobs are not [82:14] only I mean yeah they're pretty much a [82:17] necessity for what a lot of these dogs [82:19] do but also what some people don't [82:21] understand so if we're using Mallen laws [82:23] as an example and we're talking about [82:25] French ring French ring was in a sense [82:28] designed to be a breed standard for the [82:30] mountain yes and then same thing if you [82:33] look at shits in' known as IPO this was [82:36] a german shepherd breed standard test [82:38] and it's so people could say my dog is [82:41] at the level of what a german shepherd [82:42] should be because i have an IPO one IPO [82:45] two you know etc a title on the dog and [82:48] these dogs love this type of work that's [82:51] what some people don't understand i saw [82:52] this image once where I showed a dog [82:53] jumping up but I think it was a German [82:55] Shepherd doing IPO which is a protection [82:57] dog sportings jumping up to bite the the [82:59] decoy sleeve that's the guy in the and [83:03] I'm telling this to the audience [83:03] obviously I'm not you because you know [83:05] more about protection sport than I do [83:06] but jumping up to bite the sleeve and [83:08] somebody goes it's so cruel with the [83:11] they make these animals do that dog is [83:14] that is that dogs happiest most [83:17] fulfilled moment is when it is doing [83:19] that work I mean your dog's your [83:22] personal dogs I've seen them out in the [83:23] field [83:24] they come out in the field to train with [83:25] you they are on cloud nine they're so [83:28] happy and excited I'm asked them seeing [83:30] some dogs when they know they're getting [83:32] ready I mean that's a challenge for some [83:33] of the handlers where when the dog knows [83:35] are gonna go on the field and they're [83:37] gonna do the bite work sometimes it's [83:39] difficult to keep them in a stay until [83:41] you allow them because they're so stoked [83:43] and so excited to go so I just wanted to [83:45] kind of break that myth write difference [83:48] between you know purpose bred dogs and [83:51] pets so in I always tell people if you [83:54] want a rescue dog great if you want to [83:56] buy from a reputable breeder great you [83:58] should have the choice I work with a [84:00] couple different rescue groups the main [84:02] rescue network with is a seal Beach [84:04] Animal Care Center and I've got four of [84:07] their rescue dogs that I'm training and [84:08] fostering you helped us yeah fast was [84:11] from there so I'm all about rescue dogs [84:14] and there's nothing wrong with them just [84:16] like there's nothing wrong with you know [84:18] buying a dog from a breeder it should be [84:19] your choice that the problem comes when [84:21] there are certain groups Mills certain [84:27] groups like PETA that are trying to push [84:29] that you shouldn't have a choice if I've [84:31] got five kids and I want to make sure [84:33] and in chickens in a horse and three [84:36] other dogs and I want a puppy that I [84:38] know at least from the parents and the [84:40] parents behind that and the grandparents [84:42] and everybody is friendly with other [84:44] animals and people and I want a dog that [84:47] will retrieve where has absolutely no [84:49] prey Drive it's okay to get a dog from [84:51] you know from a breeder if I know [84:53] exactly what I want in one of my kids is [84:55] allergies that's okay to do that you [84:57] shouldn't feel bad about getting a dog [84:58] from a breeder if you want a rescue dog [85:00] you shouldn't feel bad about adopting [85:02] it's your choice you should have the [85:04] right a lot of people the problem is [85:06] when people they rescue at their heart [85:09] versus their brain they go oh this one [85:11] has three legs or this one's been abused [85:13] I want this one well this dog has [85:15] separation anxiety are you equipped to [85:17] deal with that some rescue dogs do come [85:19] with baggage not all of them but some of [85:20] them do just like some puppies if they [85:22] weren't so trusts right or depending on [85:24] their breed and they have certain traits [85:25] they're gonna come with some baggage [85:27] they have to take care of is the rescue [85:29] honest with you that's what i like about [85:31] Seal Beach is they'll tell you this this [85:34] dog has this issue can you do [85:35] and if you can't well we have this dog [85:37] instead they know all of their dogs they [85:39] know all of their temperaments and [85:40] they're not gonna lie to you about what [85:42] they have you get some regular just you [85:45] know shelters that don't know their dogs [85:47] cuz the dogs just come in and out and [85:49] they go this one's cute and they don't [85:50] know that this dog was surrendered [85:52] because he was an escape artist and he [85:54] was constantly getting out and that he's [85:55] been in the shelter five times owners [85:57] finally said enough well they have a [85:59] 4-foot fence and now the dog is again [86:01] out again so there's there certain [86:03] things where if the rescue is up front [86:05] they tell you about the dog's [86:06] personality then you should be able to [86:08] pick based on personality but you [86:09] shouldn't pick based on this one has a [86:12] blue why I want him because it's cute [86:13] really don't bring your kids because I [86:16] know I go oh we want this one and [86:18] meanwhile this one you know guards or [86:20] whatever but the kids have already fall [86:21] in love with it so now you have to get [86:23] it so to go with and open you know don't [86:26] go and talk to the people and say I want [86:29] a dog that's great with kids [86:30] I want a dog that's good with other dogs [86:32] I live in apartment so I want something [86:33] that's low energy what do you have then [86:36] have the volunteers show you and say you [86:38] know Fido and Buffy would be great for [86:40] you so don't even go and look first [86:42] tell them I'm looking for x y&z what do [86:44] you have that would fit my needs don't [86:46] go and fall in love with a dog that [86:48] would not be a good match for you though [86:50] because now you're wrestling with your [86:52] heart versus your brain yeah research [86:54] have a trainer come with you I don't [86:56] know why more people don't do that say [86:58] tell the trainer I'm looking for X Y & Z [87:00] have the trainer go there beforehand [87:03] evaluate the dog say okay if you're [87:05] looking for x y&z this dog this dog and [87:07] this dog then you go meet with those [87:08] three dogs they're still gonna need [87:10] obedience training but at least the [87:11] Tempur minutes there that matches your [87:13] your temperament just because I want a [87:14] high drive dog that will go hiking 20 [87:17] miles a day for six months does not mean [87:19] that would be a good pet for you in your [87:20] apartment mm-hmm so pick pick based on [87:23] what you want what your goals are if [87:25] you're hoping to get into shape and so [87:28] you want a high energy dog that's gonna [87:29] make you go running no no go running [87:31] first once you have that pattern and [87:33] that habit then you can add that high [87:36] energy dog but if you if your diet fails [87:39] or you don't keep up with it now you [87:40] have this high energy dog that's gonna [87:41] drive you crazy because you're not good [87:43] man [87:44] mmm-hmm doing that and that's gonna [87:46] prevent you from having heartbreak later [87:48] I mean making sure we did and so some [87:51] people also they they may want to and I [87:53] just want to share a quick little story [87:54] one of my buddies he want to rescue a [87:57] dog he reached out to me he said you [87:58] know my birth my daughter's birthday is [88:00] coming up and she really wants a Corgi [88:02] so I want to get her a Corgi and I [88:04] essentially looking for I mean the [88:06] likelihood of me finding a dog in the [88:09] shelter that's a Corgi it within it I'm [88:11] like how long do we have and it goes uh [88:13] her birthday is in a month so the [88:16] likelihood of me finding one is slim to [88:17] none I said if you really want to get [88:19] her a Corgi and that's what she wants [88:20] get it from a breeder he was kind of [88:22] posed to that at first he says well I [88:23] really want to rescue a dog there's a [88:25] lot of dogs out there and I said you [88:26] know if you're getting something [88:27] specifically for what you need there's [88:29] nothing wrong with getting it from a [88:30] good breeder and I said and if you [88:32] really want to help out and you want to [88:34] do something then just support a few [88:36] dogs being rescued yeah and he helped [88:39] fund the rescue of multiple dogs after [88:42] that he paid from he has good money and [88:43] he paid for that and then he rescued the [88:45] dog and I remember I picked up the dog [88:47] for him and I'm getting ready to bring [88:49] the dog back and somebody sees it and [88:50] they go oh that dogs from a breeder and [88:53] they gave this look it's like yeah then [88:56] the guy who's given this dog a forever [88:57] home [88:57] also funded the rescue of like five [89:00] other dogs you know I think everybody [89:07] should have the choice if you want a [89:08] rescue dog go rescue dog you want to get [89:10] it from breeder get it from a breeder [89:11] people should not feel bad about their [89:13] decisions because people see you know [89:16] and I've got two puppies that I bred and [89:18] that's in my litter but they don't know [89:19] that I have four foster dogs that are [89:21] all from rescue you know or they see my [89:23] foster dogs they go yeah well breeders [89:24] are bad well you didn't know that I had [89:26] a litter in did you yeah so it's not [89:28] every breeder is bad and as long as the [89:32] breeders are responsible of course yours [89:34] bad breeders just like theirs third [89:35] rescued of course you know there's bad [89:36] owners that doesn't mean that they [89:38] should all be you know that doesn't mean [89:40] oh they're all bad mm-hmm and even you [89:44] know just like you helping because you [89:45] do help Seal Beach [89:47] Animal Rescue and then my buddy who bred [89:50] re my Malinois I remember I was at his [89:53] place and he's like you know it's [89:55] he's like my heart's always broken cuz I [89:57] have all these dogs that were unable to [89:59] find these homes for because they have [90:01] issues and and he never want us to give [90:03] up on any dogs you know so somebody who [90:05] is a breeder it doesn't make them [90:07] because again I hate when people did [90:09] like all breeders like such a huge [90:11] advocate of good breeders my big thing [90:13] too is everybody also you know they [90:16] pushes spay and neuter at a young age [90:18] and there's been shown sign there [90:22] there's been studies that have shown [90:23] that they can have issues with their [90:25] developmental and their skeletal growth [90:26] in tendons and ACL or in some dogs that [90:28] see see all tears and things like that [90:30] if you can't be responsible and keep [90:32] your dog on your property of course spam [90:34] and neuter them early if you can I [90:37] usually tell people wait till they stay [90:38] here now and again that's up to you and [90:40] your vet but if again if you can't be [90:43] responsible and keep your dog from [90:44] jumping the fence and knocking up your [90:46] neighbor's dog then do it as soon as [90:48] possible but if you be responsible and [90:50] again talk to your vet I tell people [90:51] wait at least a year now that's a good [90:53] way to so they mature and they get all [90:55] the you know like for the male the [90:57] testosterone that they need to develop [90:58] properly and what are your thoughts on [91:00] different sort of training collars and [91:02] corrections and like I know what your [91:04] thoughts are that I want and again that [91:09] goes back to the art of dog training so [91:11] I know how to use gentle leaders and [91:14] Hall T's and clickers and pinch collars [91:17] and harnesses and remote collars and [91:21] pinch collars and choke chains and flat [91:25] colors and martingales and the front [91:27] clip harnesses everything has its place [91:29] but the problem is when people use the [91:32] tools incorrectly so even just a flat [91:35] collar if you're letting your dog drag [91:37] you around you're gonna do damage to the [91:38] trachea so that's not good if the collar [91:41] just for their ID tags sure if if you're [91:44] using a harness and you're complaining [91:45] that you know the kinds that clip on the [91:47] back of the dog and you're complaining [91:48] that the dog pulls well of course those [91:50] harnesses are designed to make it the [91:52] most comfortable for the dogs to pull [91:53] that's why we use them in the protection [91:55] to build drive and that's why they use [91:57] them in sledding too so that way the dog [91:59] has the most power or weight pool so [92:00] that way the dog has the most power to [92:02] pull if you're complaining that your [92:03] husky is pulling you and you're walking [92:05] in a harness I go well of course that's [92:07] what it was [92:07] nine for everything has you know I said [92:12] its purpose everything has its use it's [92:13] the incorrect use so I've seen people [92:15] with pincher prawn collars on the dog [92:17] and the dog is just dragging through it [92:19] well that dog has those prongs on its [92:21] neck and it's doing absolutely nothing [92:22] so it's not being useful I've seen some [92:26] people or it's too large and that's the [92:30] biggest they don't use the tools [92:33] correctly so it wouldn't matter what [92:35] tool you're gonna use use it correctly [92:37] that's and we live in time and age now [92:40] go on YouTube look it up you know look [92:42] up a couple different to make sure [92:43] you're not just looking at a bad trainer [92:44] there's plenty of bad training videos on [92:47] YouTube but see how you're supposed to [92:49] be using or actually read the directions [92:51] but everything has a use and everything [92:53] has its downside so most of the time [92:55] I'll use a martingale so that way the [92:57] dog can't slip out of it I use the the [92:59] British flip leads again the dogs can't [93:01] slip out or just removing dogs from A to [93:03] B I use pinch collars a lot I will use [93:06] harnesses on puppies because I just let [93:07] them drag me around I don't worry about [93:09] obedience I just let them explore a lot [93:11] of the times with the young puppies I [93:12] use remote training collars what are [93:15] some of the misconceptions with remote [93:16] training collars because that is a big [93:18] one sometimes people here and they go oh [93:19] yeah shock collars so in the olden days [93:24] it was shock the dogs jumping out of its [93:27] skin and the dog yelping and jumping [93:29] even higher though there was the only [93:31] level so before yes they were shock [93:32] collars the dog would be shocked they [93:34] didn't know where it was coming from and [93:35] there were very high Corrections the [93:37] collars that we use nowadays most of [93:39] them have either 100 or 127 different [93:41] levels so you can find exactly where the [93:43] dog feels it and most of them are the [93:46] same like a TENS unit that you can use [93:47] for physical therapy again every tool [93:50] has its place if I just put the collar [93:52] on and start pushing buttons it's not [93:53] going to teach the dog anything what [93:55] teaches the dog is after I've done my [93:57] foundation I've already taught the dog [93:58] using food I've already taught the dog [94:00] what the leash means and then I just [94:02] layer that over so go and that kind of [94:03] feels funny but everything else is the [94:05] same and they understand that it's [94:06] exactly the same thing as a leash and if [94:09] you do it right the dogs don't have a [94:10] bad association with it my dogs when [94:12] they see their remote collars they know [94:14] that we're going hiking we're going to [94:15] the beach we're going to the park they [94:16] know they're going to go do something [94:17] fun they get excited they get excited [94:19] yeah with the remote collar to what it [94:24] predicts so if it gets that point like [94:25] you said it starts to predict something [94:27] fun it could be seen as something fun [94:28] but what causes a lot of the bad or [94:32] negative side effects that people have [94:34] there there for example there is this [94:35] article that I read a while back and it [94:38] was titled the shocking truth to shock [94:40] collars right the the person who wrote [94:43] the article is saying that you know a [94:44] dog on a remote collar will hunker to [94:46] the ground their ears will be back they [94:49] will be more nervous when the person [94:50] with the remote comes in the room right [94:52] and there is a reason that causes this [94:56] so can you go into detail like how that [94:59] actually happens so if I just put the [95:03] collar on the dog and say I was gonna [95:05] try to stop a behavior so the remote [95:07] collars can be used for two things so [95:08] you can use them for positive punishment [95:09] or you can use them for negative [95:11] reinforcement and this is operant [95:13] conditioning terms for negative [95:16] reinforcement that's usually a low level [95:18] so that's where the dog is like huh that [95:19] kind of feels funny positive punishment [95:21] is that you need to stop that behavior [95:22] so a lot of people will use the remote [95:24] collars as positive punishment for [95:27] jumping on the counters stealing food [95:29] getting in the trash bag rattlesnake [95:32] avoidance that's where people would use [95:34] it at a higher level to stop behaviors [95:36] so what exactly are they doing so like [95:39] for rattlesnake avoidance that's [95:40] something that is initiative for Nia [95:42] yeah snakes can definitely do a lot of [95:45] damage and can kill your dog so the pain [95:47] that you pretty much want to associate [95:49] the rattlesnake with pain that's that's [95:51] what it is but people say that the [95:53] remote collars don't cause pain oh sure [95:55] put on one twenty seven and put on your [95:56] arm it's gonna hurt it's not gonna do [95:58] any damage but it's definitely gonna get [96:00] your attention and you're not gonna like [96:01] that and that would be an application to [96:03] use it at the high level is for that [96:05] rattlesnake evidence it's such a so they [96:09] see a rattlesnake and they have that [96:10] neuro association that rattlesnake means [96:13] ouch avoided oh yeah and instead of [96:15] having them actually be bit by the [96:17] rattlesnake and either die or nearly die [96:19] and get really sick we set them up for [96:21] that in order to help save their life [96:23] exactly and [96:25] of the same as vaccinations they hurt [96:28] right getting poked to the needle I hate [96:31] it it it hurts you're causing pain to [96:34] your dog but why do you do it because [96:36] you're gonna save their life so that's [96:37] the same thing with the rattlesnake [96:38] avoidance training is yeah it's gonna [96:40] hurt but you're also gonna potentially [96:42] save their life so it's a moment where [96:44] when young puppies you give them a shot [96:46] they're big Yelp they make a big deal [96:48] they don't like it but you're doing it [96:49] because it's good for them because [96:50] you're trying to save their life so [96:52] that's the same application that you [96:54] would be using for the rattlesnake yeah [96:55] it's gonna hurt for a second but it's [96:57] gonna potentially save their life later [96:59] and I like that you said the operant [97:01] conditioning too because we defined it [97:03] later as earlier rather as far as a dog [97:06] who understands that their behavior has [97:08] an effect on their environment so if [97:09] you're doing that on the correction side [97:11] as well and you do it correctly as you [97:13] said basically what ends up happening is [97:15] a dog learns what behaviors create the [97:19] corrections and by using the negative [97:20] reinforcement as you said it also also [97:23] teaches them how to prevent it and turn [97:25] it off by compliant so then therefore [97:27] the fear that is associated with the bad [97:31] use of correction that was in that [97:33] article the shocking truth of shock [97:34] collars goes away because the dog knows [97:37] what to do notice how to prevent the [97:38] correction and knows how to stop it [97:40] exactly so the the big thing is the dog [97:42] is in control if the dog is not in [97:44] control that's where you get the shock [97:45] because they don't know where it's [97:46] coming from and that's again where you [97:48] get bad training that's when you get the [97:49] dogs that hate wearing their collar so [97:51] they see it and they start to sulk it's [97:53] because of bad training so I almost [97:55] every single dog that comes in and lets [97:58] the owners specify or the dogs not doing [97:59] off leash stuff I use a remote training [98:01] collar for come it's a distance thing I [98:04] can you know I can carry around a 50 [98:06] foot leash but what happens when it's [98:07] 100 feet weapons when the dog is 200 [98:09] feet away and at the dog beach where [98:11] there's other dogs I go be careful I [98:13] mean while this dog flips over the line [98:14] it hurts themself I want to make sure [98:16] that I have a way to communicate with [98:18] the dogs hey I'm over here and just [98:20] enough to get their attention and to [98:21] teach them the same thing that as soon [98:23] as you turn in my direction you turn off [98:24] that pressure you're in control of it [98:26] and even if you look back at the old gun [98:29] dog training you know when they did the [98:31] forest retrieve with the remote collar [98:33] they're pretty hard on those dogs but by [98:36] the end those dogs are happily grabbing [98:37] that bird [98:38] why because they're in control it's a [98:41] little bit of stress whether learning [98:42] and again now we know that we can do it [98:44] a lot a lot softer and still get the [98:46] same results but as long as you're [98:48] consistent as long as the dog [98:49] understands that they control the [98:51] consequences and this is for everything [98:52] you're gonna get a happy confident dog [98:54] because they know what to expect next [98:56] confident right yep contrary to what [98:59] everybody thinks is having the [99:00] submissive you try to get a confident [99:03] dog I want a happy reliable dog out of [99:07] all the dogs that come through my [99:08] training or that I work with the owners [99:10] I want the dog to be happy and reliable [99:12] if the dog is happy but unreliable [99:14] that's a dog that's dead in the middle [99:15] of the road because they didn't listen [99:16] to you and then I hit by that car chase [99:17] in the cat or whatever and I've seen you [99:21] work with dozens of pet dogs that you've [99:24] had come in when we were training [99:25] together and all the dogs that you used [99:28] a remote collar on across the board [99:30] we're really happy except if the dog [99:32] already had fear issues or issues like [99:35] that and then you would work with it a [99:37] different manner but all the dogs super [99:38] happy super stoked excited to work with [99:40] you and incredibly responsive one of the [99:44] one of the ways that I use them here is [99:47] in my social groups so when you've got [99:49] two and a quarter acres of property and [99:51] I'm turning the dogs loose into a large [99:53] area I can't be chasing everybody with a [99:54] squirt bottle what my timing is horrible [99:57] and I would look ridiculous and I have a [99:59] horrible aim so when I'm dealing with [100:01] large groups of dogs together and I see [100:03] that this dog is starting to to be a [100:05] punk and this dog is guarding a tennis [100:07] ball I need to be able to reinforce my [100:10] commands at a distance in order for that [100:12] group to be safe so a lot of times I [100:14] don't use them but if I know that I have [100:15] a dog that has a tendency to maybe [100:17] provoke other dogs or sometimes a little [100:19] bit pushy or has any kind of issues it [100:23] gives that dog the freedom to be in that [100:25] group but it gives me the control to [100:27] know that the other dogs are gonna be [100:29] safe and often you correct me if I'm [100:31] wrong but with a lot of dogs that you [100:33] would teach with the remote collar you [100:35] would often have them even wearing the [100:36] collar for days or even ever using it [100:40] and what value does that add it just [100:42] teaches the dog of the collar doesn't [100:43] mean anything so if I slap the collar on [100:45] the dog and start correcting things yeah [100:48] you can make a bad Association if I put [100:50] the collar on the dog and we go for a [100:51] walk [100:52] take it off I put the collar on and we [100:54] go out for a play time I take it off I [100:56] put on them I scratch their butt [100:57] I take it off the collar is no big deal [100:59] just another piece of equipment if the [101:00] first time I put it on it's for a [101:02] rattlesnake avoidance training yeah I [101:04] can make a bad association with the dog [101:05] not wanting to have that put on the [101:08] other important thing that a lot of [101:10] people have the misconception that [101:11] happens is the dogs get burn marks on [101:13] their skin so if you leave the collar on [101:16] the same spot for too long you can cause [101:18] pressure necrosis some dogs have very [101:20] sensitive skin and they get it very [101:21] quickly some dogs you can leave it on [101:24] them for a few hours and they have no [101:25] marks and that's just like if your shoes [101:27] are too tight you can cause a blister if [101:29] they're too loose you can cause a [101:31] blister so usually every two or three [101:32] hours I'll switch it for either from the [101:34] right or the left on the dog's neck to [101:36] make sure that it's not rubbing for too [101:37] long because some dogs that have very [101:40] sensitive skin you can cause irritation [101:41] just from the dogs wearing it in collars [101:44] get a bad bad a bad name that way as [101:47] well because they think that the [101:49] electrics the electricity cause out on [101:51] the dog's neck and it's not it's just [101:53] like it's a muscle stimulator yeah it's [101:55] not gonna cause any physical damage to [101:58] them and if somebody was interested in [101:59] using one of those training collars and [102:01] they weren't local where they can work [102:03] with you directly what would you [102:04] recommend for that um I do I mean we can [102:06] do video facebook chats things like that [102:08] I can do video where I can send it to [102:10] them they can send it to me or I can [102:12] usually refer either some different [102:14] YouTube videos or a trainer in their [102:16] area and that's a good point to make is [102:19] a lot of trainers so a lot of dog [102:21] trainers no other dog trainers and going [102:23] to the back toe sport French ring and [102:25] French ring in my opinion is arguably [102:28] one of the most challenging dog sports [102:31] out there and and there are dog sports [102:33] for example that may be easy you notice [102:36] I don't want to say that other ones for [102:38] example [102:39] yeah like agility for example I always [102:41] tell people if you have a dog that [102:42] enjoys agility teaching agility is easy [102:44] but if you want to be at the top level [102:46] is I mean I can't think of the name of [102:49] the dog trainers name but she's one [102:50] world in agility like three different [102:52] times and watching her videos it's [102:55] mind-blowing how good this woman is a [102:57] training and to try to beat her is damn [102:59] near impossible yeah right but just [103:01] French ring in general just getting to [103:03] the point of having a dog [103:04] that can do an entire room one routine [103:06] is incredibly hard and I think it takes [103:08] some of the top skilled dog trainers [103:11] French ring especially the higher levels [103:13] is it's 45 minutes with no rewards and [103:16] no Corrections and no training collar on [103:18] the dog the dog has nothing on them and [103:20] you have nothing I mean you can have a [103:22] vest but no toys no balls no collars [103:25] there's nothing it's you and the dog so [103:27] that's a very long time and the dogs [103:29] usually learn pretty quickly if your [103:31] training is bad or if they're really [103:32] smart when a trial is and that you have [103:35] no control over them and if you don't [103:37] have a good relationship with the dog [103:38] they can blow you off pretty easily with [103:40] agility it's very fast there's lots of [103:42] behaviors very quickly but you're done [103:44] you know it's even the longest courses [103:47] less than you know a few minutes so but [103:50] it's fast fast fast fast and the dog is [103:52] their reward very quickly 45 minutes is [103:54] long time and all the sports at the top [103:56] level can present different challenges [103:58] and the reason why I was saying that was [104:01] because of you being so active within [104:04] the French ring community has put you in [104:06] a position to know dog trainers across [104:09] the entire country that compete in the [104:11] sport [104:12] I mean you've traveled for the sport [104:13] you've been to France for the sport [104:15] right I mean literally have gone to the [104:18] country where it started so that gives [104:20] you the ability to know trainers in [104:22] different areas so if you were to have [104:24] somebody reach out to you and maybe you [104:25] weren't able to help them from here you [104:27] could direct them towards a trainer that [104:29] you've worked with before that you know [104:30] has credibility and has experience to [104:33] deal with their situation but yeah [104:35] definitely if somebody wanted to reach [104:37] out you to do Skype video or something [104:39] like that yes so if you're not [104:40] comfortable using a training tool don't [104:43] use it until you are so if you would [104:45] like to get into remote collar training [104:46] because you go hiking with your dog and [104:48] you want them to be off leash and you [104:50] want to make sure that you maintain that [104:51] control don't just slap on a collar and [104:53] start pushing buttons make sure that you [104:55] have done your research and you know how [104:57] to introduce it and you know you know [104:59] that that ins and outs of how to use it [105:00] before you ever use it with your dog so [105:02] the dogs that come through here that do [105:04] go home on remote collars I trained I [105:06] put the collar on the person I have them [105:08] hold it in their hand and I trained them [105:10] first so they see what it feels like [105:13] don't I would never do anything to your [105:14] animal they're not willing to do for [105:15] to yourself so I make I make them put it [105:17] in their hand I make them I show them [105:19] when I turn it on when to turn it off [105:21] then I have them train me I can tell [105:23] them if their timing is bad I can tell [105:25] them you didn't do it right you didn't [105:26] do this you didn't do that the dogs [105:27] can't tell them that so until they are [105:30] comfortable and they're confident and [105:32] they're using it correctly they're not [105:34] allowed to use it on their dog because [105:35] again that's where you can make problems [105:36] because timing is important yeah I have [105:38] couples trained on each other and they [105:40] actually love it yeah it's actually I [105:43] got some more questions they came to my [105:45] mind people who want to be I know we [105:48] briefly hit it a little bit on the [105:50] beginning but people who maybe want to [105:52] be dog trainers and different avenues [105:55] that they can take to get to that maybe [105:56] avenues for those that have money to [105:58] attend schools or different routes that [106:00] people could take if maybe they don't [106:01] have the financial backing to go to [106:03] school what different recommendations [106:05] would you give them and you can [106:06] recommend anything you can recommend [106:07] other companies whatever you want find [106:11] somebody that you you know that's [106:13] obviously close because the more that [106:15] you work with them the more that you're [106:16] gonna learn so you're taught a couple [106:17] people to yourself like you've had a [106:19] printer's program so yeah people live [106:21] with you for an extended period of time [106:22] yeah so if you're driving for hours to [106:24] work with somebody every day you're not [106:25] gonna go five times a week or you're not [106:27] able to go after work so find somebody [106:29] who's local to you or is drivable [106:32] because the more that you go the better [106:33] off you're gonna be [106:34] so if you only go once a week to learn [106:37] it's the same thing with doing private [106:38] sessions if I come out your house once a [106:40] week and that's the only time the dog is [106:41] trained we're not gonna make very much [106:43] progress [106:43] you have to be practicing every day with [106:45] your dog even if it's only 10-15 minutes [106:47] as long as you're getting those [106:48] repetitions in we're able to make [106:50] progress so make sure that you're [106:51] working with somebody that's close [106:53] enough that you can go frequently that's [106:55] the biggest thing make sure that again [106:59] you see results if they're if they're [107:01] not some people can be a great dog [107:03] trainers but they're horrible at [107:04] explaining things unless you're really [107:06] good at just washing and picking up [107:08] things you're not gonna learn as well so [107:10] make sure that the person you know if [107:12] you can ask to sit in on one of their [107:13] private sessions and watch them coach [107:15] somebody and say okay I can learn this [107:16] way or whatever and find out what your [107:20] passion is so if you love agility find [107:22] somebody who does agility if you like [107:23] the protection stuff find somebody chose [107:25] the protection stuff how would somebody [107:26] that's that's I'm glad you said that how [107:28] would somebody [107:29] find a way to get involved with agility [107:32] or a way to get involved where maybe [107:33] they're not gonna break the bank of some [107:35] of these places that will offer agility [107:37] for normal clientele because their [107:39] business it's gonna be too expensive to [107:41] learn the actual skill set to be most [107:45] like the people that come to me [107:47] I either charge them very little or they [107:50] work for it so they help clean the [107:52] kennels they help me feed dogs they help [107:53] you know exercise the dogs that take [107:55] them on walks [107:56] I like having an extra hand it's good [107:58] for the dogs too you know once they're [108:00] at a certain point and they're training [108:02] to have another person who doesn't know [108:04] what they're doing [108:04] handle them because that's gonna be [108:06] their owner and if they're not used to [108:08] handling you know working under [108:10] different people they're gonna be bad [108:12] when they go to their owners because the [108:13] owners gonna make mistakes so by the [108:16] time the dog is done with me they've [108:17] already practiced with two or three [108:18] other people it's not easier for the dog [108:21] to transition back home so yeah I could [108:24] experience for the human who's learning [108:26] how to be so my big thing is be willing [108:29] to scoop poop be willing to clean be [108:31] willing to wake up so yeah everybody's [108:33] be willing to clean out dirty crates be [108:35] willing to do the the nitty-gritty stuff [108:38] that needs to be done for your education [108:40] because a lot of times you can depending [108:43] on the person you can get free [108:44] internships a lot of people will do that [108:46] in order to have that extra help because [108:49] either they're paying somebody else or [108:50] that's taking time away from them or if [108:52] there's two people cleaning up after the [108:53] dogs it goes a lot faster and people can [108:55] learn a lot that's all I was actually [108:57] trying to get you to say as far as cuz [108:58] you mentioned different training clubs [109:00] how can somebody get involved maybe with [109:03] an actual agility Club or a French green [109:06] Club because we bring to here protection [109:08] right but yeah it's a lot of obedience [109:11] you can go to ring sport org and those [109:14] there's a club listed on there that you [109:16] can find something in your area the same [109:18] thing with the different agility groups [109:19] you can google agility in your area or [109:22] protection training or anything that [109:25] you're interested go on Google you can [109:27] read reviews if you want find something [109:29] that's nearby and then just call people [109:30] and and my big thing is I would rather [109:33] have somebody who didn't have any money [109:36] to pay me but was super motivated if you [109:39] want to show up every day or when you [109:40] can [109:41] come and learn I want to help you learn [109:43] if I have somebody who wants to pay me [109:46] but they only want to come once a week [109:47] and they aren't really motivated don't [109:49] waste my time so I would rather have [109:51] somebody who has no money but has the [109:54] same passion I would rather work with [109:55] them and somebody who wants to pay me [109:57] but they don't really care or they say [109:59] they care but they're not practicing at [110:00] home because I can tell that hard work [110:02] and you your you guys have your own [110:04] Columbia right yeah that's right so what [110:07] a lot of clubs will do and again I'm [110:08] telling this for the audience [110:10] they'll have club fees but if you look [110:12] at a club fee those prices are way less [110:15] than if you were to go to a place to [110:17] learn how to train your dog and the club [110:18] fees are usually there to help cover the [110:20] cost of the field and the training [110:21] equipment all these different things [110:23] that are needed do you guys have a club [110:25] fee you don't want to say what it is [110:26] yeah we have a club fee depends if you [110:29] come once twice or three times a week [110:31] usually our club days on Sunday mornings [110:33] and we live in Southern California so [110:35] most of that money goes to trying to [110:37] keep it green grass on our field you [110:40] know replacing the sleeves trial those [110:43] trials having people come in from France [110:45] to give seminars and things like that we [110:48] really don't make any money on the [110:49] French ring it just kind of pays for us [110:51] to have that kind of passion exactly and [110:54] that's what I've experienced too it's [110:55] with a lot of the clubs the ships in or [110:57] the IPO clubs even you know PSA or [110:59] mondeo ring now these are all the [111:01] protection sports but even the AKC clubs [111:03] and things like that a lot of the people [111:04] and that's why it's so good to seek out [111:06] a club if you want to be a professional [111:07] dog trainer and you may not have the [111:09] financial backing to go to a school that [111:10] cost fifteen grand you can go to these [111:12] clubs and you're working with people who [111:14] share that same intense passion and the [111:16] beauty about it because even coming from [111:19] you know being and going through the [111:21] school and having my own business every [111:23] single club that I've worked with and [111:24] the people in the club I've learned a [111:26] great deal from so even having a [111:28] background you can learn stuff and I'm [111:30] sure every time you train with somebody [111:32] new you might pick up a new piece of [111:34] information that increases your ability [111:36] to train more effectively and they talk [111:40] don't talk to your neighbor watch the [111:42] dog that's on the field ask questions [111:44] that you know when the dog is done don't [111:45] interrupt training but when the dog is [111:47] done why did you do this how did you [111:49] teach your dog this every dog is [111:51] different everybody has their met [111:52] it's for for doing certain things but [111:54] the more the more tools you have in your [111:56] toolbox the more methods that you have [111:58] for teaching and exercise there's gonna [112:00] be a dog that you're this method doesn't [112:02] work but this one does you have to be [112:04] able to adapt again that goes back to [112:05] the art of dog training is to be able to [112:07] change your methods for each dog in each [112:09] situation because not every dog is the [112:11] same if somebody's not near a club or [112:15] they don't have the means to even pay [112:16] the club fees is there any sort of [112:18] online things that you might recommend [112:20] really there's some really good training [112:22] on YouTube if you if you know what to [112:25] look for and you can either send myself [112:26] or Nate a message and we'll point you in [112:28] the right direction because I don't I [112:30] don't know everybody's links to their [112:32] pages but there's plenty if you want to [112:35] learn purely positive for you know [112:37] everything I can point you to a webpage [112:39] you know YouTube page that has from [112:42] leave it to walking on a leash to [112:44] aggression to everything now again I'm [112:46] not gonna use every method that this [112:48] president provides for everything but [112:51] it's good to know same thing if you want [112:53] to use remote collars there's a [112:54] different page that I would send you to [112:55] that walks you through all the steps to [112:58] how to use remote collar for X Y & Z if [112:59] you're into aggression I can send you [113:01] that this person who has some really [113:02] good how-to videos on how to do [113:04] aggression at home though there's also [113:07] all kinds of junk online so I do not [113:09] recommend you go home and you google dog [113:12] training he'll you know because you can [113:15] find all kinds of stuff and you can [113:16] really mess up your dog just like if you [113:18] listen to the barber who knows how to [113:20] train your dog don't listen to him do [113:21] the research know the the theory behind [113:24] the art because if you don't know the [113:26] whys it's very hard for the application [113:30] but at the same time I know lots of [113:33] fantastic trainers that don't know [113:35] operating classical conditioning means [113:36] but they've been in it for so long they [113:38] know exactly what they're doing and [113:39] they're phenomenal training trainers I [113:41] know some trainers who click 5 times [113:43] before they give a treat and they have [113:45] fantastic results at tricks training [113:47] because they have their method they [113:48] stick with it and they're consistent so [113:50] it's it's not necessarily about method [113:52] again it's going back to results and do [113:55] you see the results and lauren has many [113:57] different methods as you can and just [113:58] make sure that you know if you're [114:01] watching garbage that you know that it's [114:02] garbage mm-hmm yeah there are a lot of [114:04] videos just like you said that pop [114:06] and it has incorrect information I've [114:09] seen him a hundred times I've even seen [114:10] ads that have popped up because of [114:12] course the way that they use on these [114:14] YouTube pages and things like that it's [114:15] that target marketing so if you look up [114:17] a dog video ads are gonna end up popping [114:19] up and I constantly look at different [114:22] dog videos now I actually so talking [114:25] them online I'm I'm pretty sure you're [114:27] are you a fan of Michael Ellis yeah so I [114:30] always direct people like check out [114:31] Michael Alice's dogs very patient the [114:36] videos that are out there also sure lots [114:38] of mistakes that the people make [114:42] he's a very good resource and he has a [114:44] school as well he does yeah Forest [114:46] Mickey he has some good stuff like [114:49] healers toolbox I've even suggested [114:50] healers toolbox to people who want to [114:52] know just some of the basics a friend [114:54] did you go through that program did you [114:55] know I didn't but there's also a program [114:57] called bow-wow flexkom and it's Netflix [115:01] for dog training seminars no kidding [115:05] okay I want two videos at a time or [115:08] three videos and they have Michael Ellis [115:09] they have I think they have for us [115:11] Mickey they have Ivan I'm gonna put your [115:13] name Babel they have Ian Dunbar listen I [115:24] don't know about that one but they I [115:26] would like to see something she's [115:28] fantastic [115:29] but there's all kinds of videos on there [115:31] so if you want to learn and again you [115:34] have to be able to watch and be able to [115:36] retain things and then apply so [115:38] everybody's gonna have their guinea pig [115:39] dog they're gonna make lots of mistakes [115:40] on but yeah bow-wow flicks calm it's [115:44] like a netflix about dog training [115:45] seminars so I'm not able to go and [115:48] travel to a lot of seminars anymore [115:49] because I have my business here I have a [115:51] kid now and husband and plenty of my own [115:53] dogs so I can't travel so that allows me [115:55] to go to seminars that actually [115:57] physically having to leave and pick and [116:01] choose what you like right I mean you [116:03] know there's what's the saying there's [116:05] nine ways to or twelve ways to skinny [116:07] what's the same yeah more than one thank [116:10] you there's more than one way to skin a [116:12] cat right so there's different ways and [116:14] you know pick what you like pick and [116:17] choose you don't have to say like okay I [116:19] like this person so I have to do it [116:20] thing they do you can choose what works [116:21] for you yes and expand your toolbox so [116:24] so my big thing too is some people go oh [116:26] I want to do this method and I go well I [116:29] understand that method because I've seen [116:31] it before but this is the problem with [116:33] that method instead of going oh I don't [116:34] like that method so if you've seen it [116:36] even if you don't agree with it you can [116:38] go I know what you're talking about but [116:39] the problem with that method for your [116:41] dog in this situation is this and it [116:42] could be good with other dogs exactly [116:44] but if you're not even familiar with the [116:46] method you can't say that it's bad [116:48] because you don't have any experience [116:50] with it you know and that person might [116:52] want to use a clicker for their dog for [116:53] dog aggression and I might go well yes [116:56] let's use bat for this dog because you [116:58] you have 10 acres before you'll see [117:00] another dog and you're gonna work your [117:01] threshold but most of the time the [117:03] problem with that there's a program is [117:07] is thresholds if you leave your house [117:10] some dogs are over threshold if you have [117:12] neighbor dogs that bark so what are you [117:13] gonna do not walk your dog so that's it [117:16] again if you don't understand the [117:18] program you can't say well yes but that [117:21] program wouldn't work for you and your [117:23] dog because of this or just because I [117:25] can go on a walk with like I said a tree [117:27] in a clicker and a food bag does not [117:29] mean that this other person is gonna be [117:31] able to use all those tools just because [117:33] I can use a remote caller there's lots [117:34] of clients I would never give a remote [117:36] caller because they can't use it [117:38] correctly and so again the the possible [117:42] damage that the person could make would [117:44] weigh out risk the possible rewards so [117:46] and again that goes back to the art of [117:49] knowing what method to use with each [117:50] client to help them reach their rewards [117:52] because I can do something does not mean [117:53] that you can do it just because you can [117:54] do something doesn't mean that I can do [117:55] it you know it doesn't mean that you're [117:57] bad and I'm right or vice versa [117:59] that just means that you have to be able [118:01] to be willing and able to change your [118:03] method in order to help that person in [118:04] their dog and if you're stuck in the [118:06] purely positive even though that's not [118:08] even real yeah if that's what your goal [118:12] is you're adding limitations in again [118:14] that goes back to being selfish [118:16] you're putting your desires above your [118:18] dogs and for me that's not fair [118:19] and you did just mention seminars as [118:21] well in seminars I think is a great way [118:23] for somebody to learn what's a good way [118:24] for somebody to find seminars you can [118:27] again go to your the training clubs will [118:30] pote like we just hosted [118:31] are on genetics and things like that you [118:34] can go to like I said I think the [118:37] website is tosser dog ta wcer dog calm [118:42] and they record a lot of the seminars [118:44] and I think they have a seminar list I [118:47] think if you go on Ian's Dunbar's [118:49] website or it's the association of [118:52] professional dog trainers I

okay all right this is the [00:13] show so as I told you before we're just [00:15] gonna have a good time we're gonna talk [00:16] about I'm not wearing this really yeah [00:19] no I'm not gonna wear I don't like [00:20] wearing it you can wear it if you want [00:21] but you don't have to so for those of [00:24] you that don't know Freeman and myself [00:26] we go way back and we do go by last name [00:28] more often than by first name and the [00:30] reason why is because we were in the [00:31] Marine Corps for an extended period of [00:32] time I did two combat deployments with [00:34] this warrior and he went on to do three [00:37] more combat deployments I believe and [00:39] some of the craziest stories that I have [00:41] that I enjoy sharing with people since [00:43] I've been out of the Marine Corps have [00:44] been about Friedman here and some of the [00:47] crazy things that he did so I'm excited [00:50] to have you on the show buddy thanks for [00:51] having me Romer all right so what's on [00:54] your mind [00:55] not a whole lot man I'm pretty I'm [00:56] pretty excited for you and in your [00:59] podcast this is exciting stuff man [01:01] let's let's talk a little bit about some [01:04] of the crazy things that you have [01:06] experienced because five combat [01:07] deployments and also let's note that [01:09] this is five combat deployments as [01:12] infantry record imagery so this is an [01:16] admin this isn't you know there's a lot [01:18] of other MLS's that go over there and we [01:20] need them but the ones that are on the [01:22] ground the ones that are kicking in the [01:23] doors the ones that are laying lead [01:25] downrange to make sure everybody can [01:27] sleep peacefully at night is infantry [01:29] they are the linemen of the tell me some [01:35] what are some crazy stories that come to [01:37] mind besides ones that I was already [01:39] there inside so not the two first [01:41] deployments but you're the three that [01:43] you did after this actually stilling I [01:45] was watching something on TV today with [01:48] my girlfriend and it reminded me of [01:51] something that I told her the story but [01:53] then she just looked at me and she's [01:55] like I was like I guess you just had to [01:56] be there but but we were on a hilltop in [02:01] Afghanistan and we were doing a turnover [02:05] with [02:07] the helical and cop maybe something like [02:10] that Elizabeth of course is my fifth one [02:13] my last one okay [02:14] and the Kumari Plateau and it was the S [02:19] curve in the upper breast Valley and we [02:24] over watched this thing and there was [02:26] this place called the Glass House and we [02:27] always got attacked from it that's where [02:29] I first came out because we do love it [02:31] and we had we had pretty interesting [02:38] rules of engagement we could basically [02:40] return fire with small arms no big deals [02:43] and some medium machine guns but to [02:48] shoot a missile you would have needed [02:50] clearance from battalion or something [02:53] like that and we had just done a [02:55] turnover and it was like the this one [03:01] post was all Afghan forces it was in his [03:05] air post and we start we start taking [03:08] fire and we're down below and these [03:13] these guys starts popping off rounds pop [03:16] up out we get up to me and this in this [03:20] kid summers here's one of my GM race we [03:22] get up to like this observation position [03:23] and and then all of a sudden these guys [03:27] from the Afghan forces like none of us [03:30] spoke posh steel so I mean very little [03:33] like Madonna is thank you [03:51] they just out of nowhere they just you [03:54] know RPG and then they just to shoot an [03:59] RPG right out of the tower it's like [04:02] whoa [04:02] right into the glass house and then and [04:06] then they they're gonna do it again and [04:10] then you're like do like RPG and they [04:13] look at us and I feel like they're like [04:15] I don't know if they're looking at us [04:17] for approval [04:18] they're just warning us they're shooting [04:20] RPGs but my cherry Summers is like a [04:23] corporal he said RPG kissing the tough [04:26] stuff and then they just they just kept [04:31] doing it back and forth for like a many [04:33] others like summers dude stop say stop [04:35] yelling it back you gotta just just let [04:38] him yell what they're gonna yell and do [04:39] what they're gonna do but was that his [04:41] first deployment no that was his like [04:43] second or third but it wasn't that [04:45] junior though that was such a shitty [04:53] deployment like I don't know how long [04:55] were you in Afghanistan for oh god I [04:57] can't was like seven months some the [05:02] summer 2011 we ended up there October [05:06] was that the only time you're in that [05:13] last one it was like it was night and [05:15] day between varsity and to University [05:17] like when the when the winter season [05:21] kicked around the cool weather came in [05:23] so the combat was worse in Afghanistan [05:26] then where then Iraq that Iraq I mean it [05:30] depends boy 2004 Iraq was uh these [05:33] people saw some [ __ ] and then to [05:36] actually like it just depends where you [05:38] were who you are what you did yeah I [05:40] mean well that's true for I mean when [05:42] our first deployment when we went in for [05:43] the invasion and cross the line of [05:45] departure [05:45] what was the going joke for quite a bit [05:47] of time so we were one for 1st battalion [05:50] 4th Marines or I don't know war one for [05:52] know or one for I thought for sure that [05:55] that was gonna be the reality to that [06:01] was because I mean when people might [06:03] talk about of1 that's like yeah [06:06] you could count the gunfights we got [06:08] into or maybe one or two hands and my [06:12] two deployments I only been in heaven [06:13] lemon conflicts on one or two hands but [06:16] uh Afghanistan [06:18] with sleep deprivation it was digging [06:20] holes every night I'm a fat guy always [06:22] hungry a lot I was like that was the one [06:31] MRA day was a brutal that's not enough [06:34] food and people think there's a lot of [06:36] calories in an MRE but there are yeah [06:38] but you tried a listicle II I mean like [06:40] you can probably I don't know how long [06:42] you can survive here's some interesting [06:43] [ __ ] I don't know would uh would you [06:46] what did you how many anthrax shots did [06:48] you get I don't know you guys want like [06:51] a bunch of series of anthrax yes see [06:53] what what are your what were your [06:55] expectations getting the anthrax shot if [06:58] the enemy were to drop some anthrax on [07:00] you you know what I didn't even think [07:02] about it to be honest it was just go [07:04] ahead who did whatever they did you [07:07] think it would you do it whoa cool I'm [07:09] immune I got the interaction I like em [07:10] you don't good now knows that it was [07:13] like it was like it's they give you that [07:15] just to give you the concerted amount of [07:17] hours of more fighting they're gonna get [07:19] out of you that's it that is kind of [07:23] crazy that's it just you know that is [07:27] something announcements I got [07:28] enhancements for my soldiers for all [07:30] those kids that play those word Warcraft [07:32] games on the computer or whatever [07:34] they're playing those games upgrade [07:35] enhancements sometimes on the iPhone [07:37] I'll download what

personality that I trust them I try to [07:52] stay away from the video games because I [07:54] don't get caught on a video game eight [07:55] hours later I'm still playing well you [08:02] know it's funny so it's easy to talk [08:04] about military experiences I don't want [08:06] this entire episode to be about me but [08:08] listen unless you want to talk more [08:10] about that's hard you know what there [08:12] was there was a there was years ago and [08:15] I was living with two other sergeants in [08:19] a house in yoga and it was a time let me [08:21] tell you and three single fellas ah

[08:50] years I think like well I do I mean 17 [08:53] when I did the paperwork I shipped [08:55] finally but 18 all my birthday's like [08:59] was that turned 19 in Baghdad 20 at sea [09:04] 21 at sea well and that's all you do for [09:07] an extended period of time [09:09] yeah let me figure this out because I'm [09:11] studying as you know my credentials if [09:14] you were to we're gonna throw the resume [09:16] on the table Micah Friedman and I am a [09:20] semester shy of having a bachelor's in [09:23] criminal justice with a minor in public [09:26] administration Wow in Iraq you were also [09:28] the Entertainer you came up with a song [09:30] about our company company first sergeant [09:34] so our first sergeant right yes it was [09:36] all of them man I started doing that [09:38] trying military school I'd be jamming [09:41] out on the guitar but it'd be like some [09:42] others some random four three quarters [09:44] song that was super easy as a closing [09:47] time or something else just did you keep [09:49] playing the guitar on your last moments [09:51] oh well they all were different my third [09:58] one we had a guitar because we lived at [10:01] the dam and so I mean you'd be out for [10:04] days on end you wouldn't have that [ __ ] [10:05] there you'd be out dodging IEDs that was [10:08] a shitty one and then you'd be back at [10:10] the Haditha dam for a couple days and we [10:13] had guitars going around we jam out and [10:16] have a good time but then my fourth yeah [10:20] probably the fourth tour we were living [10:22] at it yeah it was a little it was the [10:24] troop surge it's like it was great the [10:28] the we were on a boat headed to Iraq and [10:31] they were giving like swear to god one [10:33] of the most annoying things about the [10:35] military tell me how he didn't find this [10:39] like sometimes it was alright but it was [10:41] like after a while you're like you knew [10:45] you were going to war you knew we were [10:47] doing a deployment but I'll be goddamned [10:49] if every leader didn't like what I have [10:53] there Braveheart no no William Wallace [10:56] were they're just like oh [ __ ] ah the [10:59] captain's done with them the [11:01] lieutenant's done with them [11:02] like the it's it's my turn to keep my [11:05] grave was like [ __ ] I just want to go [11:08] home dude like come on [11:09] but he gave this is how the beginning of [11:13] his moto speech went and he was talking [11:17] to I would say about a hundred Marines [11:18] out of hundreds gentlemen we're all [11:23] gonna die good to go I guess he had my [11:32] attention he it turned out it turned out [11:34] he turned his speech around over the [11:36] course of about 45 minutes but the point [11:38] was eventually at some point in time [11:40] your own we're all gonna die so you know [11:43] like be brave really kid all the other [11:45] way which the bus which deployment was [11:48] that was okay well what about some of [11:58] you had a few posts on Facebook about [12:01] there we go [12:03] I believe what you're you're studying [12:04] you know criminal justice and things [12:06] like that and you ran into an issue that [12:09] wasn't worried if I had my platform in [12:13] my moment in time here we go [12:15] here we go baby so so he didn't even [12:18] know that day that day that guy ooh so [12:22] here's what's happening [12:23] old old Friedman's on his way home okay [12:27] once again the before and after in these [12:29] stories that's irrelevant but I'm [12:32] traveling and you're you came here what [12:36] what would how would you describe the [12:38] roads in the area of the surrounding [12:40] area well ironically enough on one of [12:43] the roads driving out here I actually [12:44] said to Erica there were certain [12:46] sections that reminded me of Iraq oh [12:47] yeah for sure it's like [12:49] Middle East but he's like long it's like [12:51] information fields yeah Al's all stuff [12:54] like the palm groves that is hilarious [12:56] yeah that takes some getting used to [12:57] especially when dove season kicks off [12:59] here it moves it but uh but there it's [13:03] like long single dotted line highway [13:05] roads where like you get stuck behind [13:07] some we're gonna be bonding for a minute [13:09] until you hit the passing you see the da [13:11] boys so going and this fellas going well [13:14] below speed limit and it's a dotted line [13:16] section and I get over I pull up here's [13:22] an interesting I don't know if I'm gonna [13:25] so I won't admit that I went beyond the [13:29] speed limit because that would be [13:30] illegal but let's just say this guy [13:33] starts to speed up as I go around him [13:35] like a dick so I'm like whatever I hit [13:38] it and get around the fella I'm like [13:40] whatever so I get down the road and all [13:44] of a sudden I see this cop car on the [13:48] left and he's got his hazards flashing [13:50] and I go up and I go by him and he turns [13:54] his little lights on and it gets behind [13:56] me and I'm like what the [ __ ] and he [13:59] pulls me over and I get over rolls down [14:03] that window and he's all like seems in [14:06] registration please and I'm like hey I [14:09] know I've been pulled over and he's like [14:11] oh you'll see and I'm like actually [14:14] that's uh this is critical justice [14:17] student I'm like that's that's not [14:18] correct you uh yeah you actually have to [14:21] tell me why he pulled me over funny it's [14:23] just one of them things [14:23] so he's like and I handed my license and [14:29] registration like I'm gonna be [14:30] non-compliant and he's like oh some [14:32] other officer called me and he said he [14:34] saw you driving erratically let's it's [14:38] simply just not true he said do you have [14:40] anything illegal in the car I'm like [14:42] hate to do it again hate to do it again [14:45] big dog but uh fourth amendment do I [14:50] have a probable cause like Greg I [14:52] searched my car the guy I'll never tell [14:55] you like [14:56] and then he goes back at the time at the [15:03] time I was driving a bulletproof [15:06] Mercedes as 420 so listen we're down [15:13] here we're down there on on the Mexican [15:17] border [15:17] the California Mexican border and there [15:20] was an advertisement for a bulletproof [15:21] or Sadie's where was it like Craigslist [15:24] and it was like the original owner the [15:27] original and here it is it was a 90 it [15:30] was a 96 or 95 or 96 and I decided no no [15:36] no so after just four oh yeah I got I [15:39] got dope told air what kind of car we [15:41] have after this all went down after I'm [15:45] not I got to finish the story with the [15:46] cops but after the solvent yeah I got I [15:48] got rid of that [ __ ] car ya know [15:51] after this incident I got rid of that [15:53] [ __ ] cuz just attracted ya know it was [15:57] it was like so I don't know what the [15:58] story was but this guy's like he got no [16:01] so the car the car I looked it up it was [16:03] originally like one hundred and fifty [16:05] thousand dollars like you bought that [16:07] thing in 96 brand new it was like no no [16:11] no 95 96 but yeah okay hold on so let me [16:14] let me clarify let me clarify that let [16:17] me let me clarify that it would be [16:19] equivalent to buying a hundred thousand [16:21] dollar car today I think it was like [16:23] seventy or eighty thousand dollars but [16:25] uh it had a bunch of miles on it there [16:27] were some ownership that went wrong with [16:29] it but uh but so I know what the story [16:32] was I didn't wise dude at it but it was [16:34] like the original is that and I peeled [16:36] off peeled off some windows I was like [16:38] here you go fella that was that all [16:45] right start your vehicle driving a car [16:53] that's that the police would a profile [16:56] as potentially suspicious for you oh [17:00] come on [17:04] you know what anyone asked me they're [17:05] like why do you have a bulletproof car [17:07] I'd be like well why don't you know [17:08] broke you corner like like really I'm [17:11] doing Jeep like you had the option [17:12] between I get this car or this car or [17:14] this one's bulletproof and you'd be like [17:16] for that off chance you drive by a [17:19] shooting who knows let's say going back [17:25] to the pose of the searching yeah that's [17:28] gonna search your V you want to search [17:30] you search my vehicles and I wasn't [17:32] having it so he went back the off-duty [17:36] guy pulled up in his [ __ ] car and [17:39] then if supervisor showed up now the [17:43] supervisor is a squared away fellow I [17:46] still have a hard time madam madam was [17:50] before he pulled me over on one of these [17:52] roads that I have been I was going a [17:54] little faster than you should have [17:55] yeah but you're not a habitual yeah so [18:02] Lou gave me a ticket and here's the deal [18:04] you got me dead right so you got out of [18:06] speed got me dead to rights I pull over [18:07] I know a bunch of stuff that made me [18:10] uncomfortable about pulling vehicles [18:13] over in Iraq so one of the things I do [18:15] is I roll the windows down on my car so [18:17] they can stay in pull over to the side [18:19] real good to the side so they're safe [18:22] because you don't want this [ __ ] to [18:23] get sideswiped by some idiot coming up [18:26] because he wants to pull your fur [18:27] taillight because they're gonna blame [18:29] that [ __ ] on you so you get your car as [18:31] far off the road as you can so this [18:34] idiot can get somewhere safe [18:35] daddy come pull you over you have all [18:37] the windows down and keep your hands [18:39] where you can see them and this and what [18:41] in pull and I do this even when [ __ ] [18:44] Choi pulled up on me so but this I've [18:47] done that when the corporal guy had [18:49] caught me speeding and he was super cool [18:51] gave me a warning didn't even give me a [18:53] ticket gave me a warning because I had [18:55] the hands up he's like Oh what do you do [18:57] I'm like go to school on the GI Bill [18:58] he's like oh cool here's a warning slow [19:01] down thank you [19:02] - go on this way that's the supervisor [19:05] that shows up out there or whatever and [19:09] he's like alright alright [19:12] this guy and then he's like what [19:15] happened I tell him what happened he's [19:16] like he's a choice a Capri and new cop [19:19] he's like but you know he's like I gotta [19:21] back him up [19:22] he's like he's like let me let me [19:25] reverse a little bit he walks up to my [19:27] vehicle on the side and he's like have [19:29] you step out of the vehicle and I'm like [19:31] may I know why I'm getting out of the [19:34] vehicle he's like yeah you're being [19:35] placed under arrest I was like well [19:37] that's fair enough is the supervisor [19:39] yeah yeah that's the choice don't think [19:42] he knows it's me yet l he knows me he [19:44] walks up he gets a briefing from joy and [19:46] in Granado Corrado's the bad guy about [19:50] not allowing them to search the vehicle [19:52] about yeah the whole thing the whole kit [19:54] and caboodle and he walks up and I got [19:56] my window down he's like good evening [19:58] super cordial good evening you know he's [20:00] like can you get out of the car I'm like [20:01] man I know why it's like you're bi [20:02] you're being arrested well that's a [20:04] legitimate reason to get out of the car [20:05] so I get out of the car and then he [20:07] wants to do a terry search but Nick [20:09] isn't why you're being arrested [20:14] I believe he did tell me I was being [20:16] arrested for reckless driving think he [20:19] did he said I was being arrested I knew [20:21] that's that's reason enough to gather [20:22] car I'm being arrested for something [20:23] he's gonna have to tell me about the [20:25] charges you're right [20:26] you're probably right I probably should [20:28] have been more up on that like what's [20:29] the charge but uh but I'm like he's [20:32] going get out so P and what Oh probably [20:44] I've been road tripping on the vehicle [20:46] though a vendor they get they get to [20:48] search they get to search it you need to [20:50] search the car they get the search we'll [20:58] get to them they where was that I'm [21:04] being arrested and he's like I'm gonna [21:07] I'm gonna give you a Terry search they [21:10] could do they could do a Terry search [21:12] what's a Terry search a Terry is Terry V [21:15] Ohio's are ruling this fella Terry and [21:20] some of his fellows were casing outside [21:22] a liquor store now let me let me explain [21:24] this you this is my thief with criminal [21:26] justice stay in America and as I'm [21:28] studying it in school and what you're [21:30] having and this is I've taken this I've [21:32] studied this case in three or four [21:33] different classes one is from a [21:35] constitutional law class from an actual [21:37] sitting judge and what had happened was [21:43] this officer was able to articulate what [21:46] he saw what he had seen was early [21:49] morning hours I want to see if Chicago [21:51] or something got to get the details [21:53] right usually you read cases before you [21:55] talk about him free briefed him he sees [21:59] a couple gentlemen outside of a liquor [22:02] store I want to say it is and it's like [22:05] 8 o'clock in the morning Chicago one of [22:07] them's like on the corner what he [22:09] described as possibly a lookout one of [22:12] them's walking over talking to him [22:13] walking back over to the window looking [22:15] in the store walking back over the [22:17] walk over like this he says this goes on [22:20] a couple types of doing Terry V Ohio [22:23] justice I brought it up on a spot so how [22:26] was how how you would look at how you [22:28] would brief it and read it it be like [22:30] this was decided by the Supreme Court 67 [22:33] give you the case the docket part you [22:36] December 12 67 facts of the case Terry [22:39] and two other men were observed by a [22:41] plainclothes so there's a bunch of key [22:43] things you have to heard ok plainclothes [22:45] policemen I'm direct so he's he's not [22:47] wearing uniform plainclothes policeman [22:49] interesting so alright plainclothes [22:52] policeman in what officers do believe to [22:57] be casing job a stick-up the officers [23:00] stop okay so it'll give you all the [23:05] alright now I got our articulated well [23:11] let's go back to the original story [23:13] maybe he was able to articulate that he [23:19] saw this kid casing the casing a liquor [23:22] store or whatever back and forth back [23:24] and forth back and forth looking and [23:25] talking to his lookout this at the other [23:27] and he did a limited search he patted [23:31] him down around the waistband and he [23:33] felt a hard metal object he believed to [23:37] be a gun he pulled it out sure enough it [23:40] was a gun rested and his lawyers argued [23:42] Fourth Amendment protections against [23:45] unreasonable search and seizure you have [23:46] the right to be securing your possession [23:48] no person should be searched unless [23:51] probable cause or a warrant signed off [23:53] by a judge so on and so forth so they [23:57] were they were able to articulate that [23:59] what they saw was enough to do and the [24:02] judges eventually the Supreme course the [24:04] question so how they how the facts of [24:07] the case gave you that question was the [24:09] search and seizure of Terry and the [24:11] other man in violation of the Fourth [24:12] Amendment in an eight to one decision [24:14] the court held that the search [24:16] undertaken by the officer was reasonable [24:18] under the Fourth Amendment and that the [24:20] weapon seized could be introduced as [24:23] evidence against Terry attempts to focus [24:25] narrowly on [24:26] to this particular case the court found [24:28] that the officer acted on more than a [24:31] hunch and that a reasonable prudent man [24:33] would have been warranted in believing [24:35] Terry was armed and thus presented a [24:38] threat and that kind of thing out ways [24:40] to think so fast forward to the day and [24:44] age of New York City the New York City [24:46] Police Department takes that decision [24:48] they go we can stop and [ __ ] frisk [24:50] anybody walking down the street for a [24:52] gun [24:53] that's basically what stop and frisk was [24:56] I mean it's like but they can do what [24:58] they want until somebody gets arrested [25:00] with enough money to put up a fight and [25:03] say [ __ ] you I'm not gonna take that and [25:07] then the courts in some cases backed out [25:09] or whatever but in most cases the poor [25:10] don't have that that option in most [25:12] cases the poor are minorities and they [25:14] don't have that option to to get to to [25:18] have someone I mean you get your public [25:19] defender and the guys never works and [25:21] maybe place in horror maybe doesn't [25:23] maybe you're guilty maybe I got it [25:25] that's why I'm gonna be that's my goal [25:26] is to be public defender you don't know [25:28] what uh what if you don't know your [ __ ] [25:31] well there's a lot of things I learned [25:32] just from watching a lot of these [25:34] documentaries that are coming out on [25:35] Netflix you know there's a lot about [25:37] there was this one I don't remember what [25:38] it's called but it's basically about [25:40] people that were wrongfully convicted [25:41] and years later they were released from [25:43] prison and some of the evidence that [25:45] they get them on and then the the [25:46] biggest problem that I see it's the [25:48] authority bias they take the birds [25:50] bought it then there's no better case in [25:53] point of that then if you get if you get [25:55] a tan because a ticket you're not facing [25:58] incarceration okay you're not looking at [26:01] jail time the only time you rate a [26:03] public defender is if you're actually [26:06] facing incarceration like time behind [26:10] bars so they look at a traffic ticket as [26:12] a misdemeanor thing you complete not [26:13] guilty but you're on your own it's your [26:15] word against a cop and if you say I've [26:17] learned that too if you say I didn't do [26:19] it he says you did it that's beyond a [26:21] reasonable doubt unless you could [26:23] present something else another thing [26:25] like that's it and you're like that's [26:28] [ __ ] I don't think it's on it's just [26:30] money it's just money you're like yeah [26:32] yeah you're gonna pay your $100 fine [26:33] today when it's small most people will [26:37] just pay they're not that's what's scary [26:40] about the authority bias and I didn't [26:42] even know that until I watch these [26:43] documentaries where they basically [26:47] bargain with these people and and the [26:50] person's head position that's all that's [26:51] all it is like they say it's 80% [26:54] plea-bargaining 20% actually seized [26:56] trial if everybody in the criminal [26:59] justice system right now said I'm not [27:01] guilty and demanded a trial the criminal [27:03] justice system would come to a crippling [27:04] hole it is incapable of dealing with [27:07] that it is all plea bargaining and a lot [27:10] of it they could even be innocent [27:12] that was the thing that freaked me out [27:14] took a lot of these people there they [27:16] are in a position where they could be [27:17] innocent I need to be better [27:21] I need to be better with names I'm so [27:24] terrible memory names plays professional [27:27] NBA basketball player who got rolled up [27:31] for something and he got arrested for [27:34] like straight-up resisting arrest [27:36] amongst other charges outside of like a [27:38] nightclub in New York or somewhere [27:40] somewhere else and I'm sure we get into [27:43] all the details wrong and but he he went [27:46] to trial he hired an expensive attorney [27:48] and there's a welder's and there I can [27:52] explain in my own story there's a [27:53] there's a portion called pretrial [27:57] conferences I for this one particular [28:00] arrest on the reckless driving I had [28:02] four or five different court appearances [28:04] and some of those are pretrial [28:07] conferences and it's like it's [28:09] negotiation it's trying to it's trying [28:11] to flee represent yourself nope nope i [28:14] pled not guilty they looked over my [28:16] finances and said yeah you ran a public [28:19] defender some like I'm a poor disabled [28:21] veteran bro anyway going to school [28:26] please know like yeah but I've been [28:30] working so here's the other crazy thing [28:35] they have one year from the date of [28:38] arrest of reckless driving to bring you [28:40] to trial to bring me to court [28:42] and if they don't that's the statute and [28:45] they can't ever talk to me so they it [28:48] was like it was like two or three days [28:50] before two or three days before the year [28:54] and it happened that they they gave me a [28:59] thing that was like yeah this is your [29:01] court date you need to be there this [29:02] time we're bringing charges against you [29:05] so yeah all right I know you said you [29:07] want to finish the rest of the story [29:12] yeah was the terry search but i do want [29:14] to quickly mention about because I'm [29:17] curious to see what your opinion is on [29:19] this since you've been studying criminal [29:20] justice and this is something I can't [29:22] remember the name of the documentary but [29:23] I was on a roll where I was watching [29:25] just one criminal documentary have - oh [29:27] man is it the Netflix one this is [29:31] something about it's its life in prison [29:32] or living in prison or something like [29:34] that basically it's about how so many [29:36] people are wrongfully convicted let them [29:39] take the plea bargains because they're [29:41] basically told by somebody yeah you're [29:43] sure you're innocent but if you take the [29:45] plea barking bargain you're gonna get [29:47] five years yes they told him a bunch of [29:51] times sir and all that pretrial stuff [29:52] they were like so here's the deal plead [29:54] plead not guilty or plead guilty plead [29:57] guilty it's nothing he'll give you [29:59] unsupervised probation community service [30:01] like nothing it was like he was if we go [30:04] to trial and if you go to trial on [30:06] resisting arrest it was like some time [30:09] in jail or whatever and you don't know [30:13] what a jury's gonna do no one does [30:14] so like that's if you're like man I can [30:17] either face jail time and try and plead [30:22] my case against this cop who said I was [30:24] resisting arrest or I can plead guilty [30:28] and do some community service and it [30:30] won't even go on my record or anything [30:32] and like yeah that's that's a very [30:34] tempting time to be like yeah I'll take [30:36] the guilty plea yeah yeah so his lawyer [30:38] even said this he's paying this six this [30:41] mea fighters gets this expensive lawyer [30:43] and his lawyers like take the goddamn [30:45] deal he's like I'll go to try with you [30:47] but I'm telling you on a resisting [30:50] arrest charge or whatever [30:51] never seen anything such as good a deal [30:54] is this like take the deal [30:57] and thinking about how worse it is for [31:00] somebody who's facing possibly life like [31:02] in his prime years there's like so many [31:04] years of you have on the show [31:05] I mean it's terrifying I actually got [31:08] into an argument not an argument but a [31:10] conversation because I watched and I [31:11] thought to myself if we were going to [31:14] try to fix it how we're gonna fix it [31:15] what you said made me think about this [31:16] the jury we don't know what the jury is [31:18] gonna do right now so it's a jury your [31:20] peers so and so forth but it's the [31:21] authority bias the the judges on a [31:24] pedestal and then the what's the side [31:28] that is on the state side the [31:30] prosecution prosecution they're they are [31:33] also held on a pedestal it's the State [31:35] against Micah Friedman the state [31:43] resources to bring that case against you [31:46] and if you look at the conviction rates [31:47] California has like an eighty ninety [31:50] percent conviction rate the federal [31:52] government they have an eighty ninety [31:53] percent conviction rate so like they [31:55] know what they're doing and this may [31:56] sound silly so I'm kind of curious [31:58] someone from your perspective with [32:00] education on here but I thought this [32:01] would be a problem-solver with everybody [32:04] who's on the jury if they are not [32:06] willing if not one so only one person [32:08] not the entire group but one person has [32:11] to say okay if we are wrong on accusing [32:14] this person of being guilty if we're [32:16] wrong and that evidence comes up later I [32:18] will take his position oh yeah yeah but [32:24] you see like if you're not you I I [32:26] personally feel like if you're in a [32:28] position if you're not willing if you do [32:29] not have that much confidence yeah [32:32] because you're gonna send someone away [32:33] for five years high there's a high [32:39] burden of proof yeah without it beyond a [32:41] reasonable doubt and then in capital [32:44] cases like in some of the more serious [32:46] ones you have to have a unanimous [32:48] decision from all the jurors if one or [32:51] two of them says no like then you have a [32:53] hung jury it's like that happening [32:55] Cosby's first trial can that be [32:56] pressured I mean these people could be [32:58] pressuring yeah for sure and that and [33:00] that happens as well people want to go [33:02] home but you know like it's it's what we [33:05] got [33:05] it's the system well what about so are [33:08] you familiar with the staircase murder [33:09] yeah there was another documentary on [33:12] that yeah I know I know [33:18] blue is more I feel like that's like [33:21] it's like Corvo the problem though is [33:24] this blood splatter expert that false [33:26] wagon I was a piece of [ __ ] like I took [33:29] a basic and my ex pinned up in my my [33:33] pursuit of my law degree and my getting [33:37] my undergraduate here I've taken a [33:39] forensic science class and like I [33:42] literally have done some like blood [33:44] spatter [33:45] type stuff where they show you and like [33:47] I'm like what the [ __ ] is that guy doing [33:49] like if you just did a one-on-one class [33:51] I feel like you would have had more more [33:55] than what the guy he's like yeah and [33:57] like he's like trying to get it visit [34:00] this is how it happens like splatter [34:01] splatter he's like aw he's just like all [34:04] covered up like there's no science to [34:07] what you're doing whatsoever but you put [34:09] him on the stand say this guy's the Dean [34:12] action or the FBI thing and there's [34:14] supposed to be a kelly fry standard and [34:17] that's the thing so the public you get a [34:19] public defender he's not going to have [34:22] the ability it's called vedere to to [34:26] examine this guy's credentials to be [34:28] like show me how you're an expert like [34:30] show and then this at the other and then [34:32] you have a private defense you hire [34:35] someone else's like see this is what an [34:37] actual guy would do who actually does [34:40] science what do you think about that [34:41] he's like who but if you're poor then [34:45] again though that's the authority bias [34:46] because he actually did hire a DNA blood [34:49] splatter expert and that person was [34:51] completely and the guy came out he said [34:58] based on my expertise and what I know [35:00] but here was the thing the jury believed [35:02] the [35:04] yeah they believe the DNA for the DNA [35:07] blood splatter expert from the [35:10] prosecution side because that is the [35:12] state and a lot of them even said we [35:14] only determined guilty based on the [35:16] evidence that he approved in court are [35:18] now approved but state I think both [35:20] defense and prosecution are aware that [35:23] juries like to do the whole the whole [35:26] CSI I'm so bored they're like they get [35:31] this nice neat picture they're like well [35:33] that's how it happened the defense they [35:35] don't realize that it's not the other [35:36] way that you have to prove that that [35:38] happened beyond a reasonable doubt to [35:40] exclude all other possibilities like you [35:43] know and like so I don't know there's [35:46] some problems there so I'm looking [35:48] forward to being a public defender for a [35:50] while anyway like that's that's I'm [35:52] gonna do it for at least a couple of [35:54] years I'm looking at that's gonna be my [35:55] boot cycle where where you just figure [35:58] out all the ins and outs of that's the [36:02] trenches the grunt work doing that well [36:05] all these cases are when you hear about [36:07] your Miranda rights people don't realize [36:09] the stellar people don't realize that [36:12] Miranda case [36:14] Miranda was a murdering rapist a [36:17] murdering rapist I believe he was a huge [36:30] yeah Brandon wasn't he wasn't [36:33] necessarily good guy but we got a bunch [36:35] of good rights that come out of it so [36:37] like that's like your Miranda rights are [36:40] important so that the one Netflix thing [36:43] I didn't like making a murderer oh that [36:50] kid was just I can't use the r-word [36:53] anymore everyone so offensive but if I [36:56] could mean if I could if I could use the [36:58] r-word easily offended if I could use [37:00] the r-word it's now 2019 I would use it [37:03] to describe this kid so all everyone in [37:06] that is an R word I was a fan I watched [37:09] all the different documentary stills but [37:12] but why then Miranda things so important [37:16] it's like you can see how the one kid [37:18] they pulled out of school and they're [37:21] like totally just lead again like this [37:23] happened and then this you know you [37:25] gotta tell it like they're like [37:26] eventually getting this kid with a low [37:28] IQ to say exactly what they wanted him [37:30] to say all those interrogations are guys [37:33] you need to understand like you have the [37:35] right to not say anything and get a [37:38] lawyer right now like if they really [37:40] they have interesting ways they teach [37:42] police how to to get around like you get [37:48] it out did you brand them they're like [37:50] got it out of the way but like what what [37:52] would uh if you were to sit down and be [37:55] like dude you're in big trouble and you [38:01] can have a lawyer and you can stop [38:03] talking to me right now and you can get [38:04] that lawyer and then have him there for [38:07] all the questions for your own [38:08] protection [38:09] like and that's really what you should [38:11] do best like yeah hey man they're like [38:16] we're gonna is it cool if we talk for a [38:18] minute dude you know you don't have to [38:21] but you know they're just the guilty [38:23] people really do you want you want your [38:25] lawyer you want a lawyer huh you have a [38:28] person you have a private attorney first [38:30] off you have a private attorney I should [38:32] know about [38:32] no you're gonna go find well then yeah [38:36] there's a great bit by Tom Segura where [38:39] he's talking about the first 48 and at [38:41] the very end he says you know what I [38:43] learned from the first 48 [38:44] if you're ever in some [ __ ] boyar up boy [38:49] he goes everybody who said he goes I've [38:52] watched about 80 episodes and there's [38:55] maybe three where the person says can I [38:57] have a lawyer and every detective is [38:59] like [ __ ] all charges were dropped [39:06] that's where the episode ended they [39:10] asked for an attorney yeah that's [39:12] basically what happens basically with [39:14] that so you get out of the car for the [39:15] Terry search Terry searched [39:19] I don't know maybe you can chop it edit [39:20] this so the story of a Explorer says it [39:22] doesn't matter so uh so he's patting Pat [39:26] me down I don't have a gun and I accept [39:28] like he's like I'm gonna do it Terry [39:30] search on you and I'm like Terry the [39:31] Ohio baby Pat away like I referenced it [39:34] man and patted me down he's like we're [39:37] resting you for reckless driving he's [39:40] like I would give you a sign and release [39:42] those two one of me cuz they could have [39:44] arrested me and taking me in and printed [39:48] me and put me in jail before I saw a [39:50] judge to get out on bail and so on and [39:52] so forth but the supervisor was like [39:54] give him a site release and they gave me [39:56] a site release but they can impound my [40:00] car because I've been arrested in [40:02] California if you're arrested for [40:04] reckless driving you can get your [40:05] vehicle impounded and my vehicle was [40:08] impounded there on the scene so one of [40:11] the things California is allowed to do [40:13] with an impounded vehicle is to search [40:18] it will not search it excuse me [40:21] inventory it so they're gonna inventory [40:24] the contents to make sure that [40:26] everything's there you can sign for it [40:29] in the morning time and everything's [40:30] know no harm no foul so they inventory [40:33] my vehicle they definitely I've been [40:35] road tripping with that vehicle for a [40:37] while so there was definitely a piss [40:38] bottle in there and I'm sure they were [40:40] not they were not thrilled about that [40:44] there's a [ __ ] up thing so I don't [40:47] have anything in my car they don't find [40:49] things but I do get a court date and I'm [40:51] now facing reckless driving charges [40:54] which in California carries with it if I [40:57] remember correctly two thousand dollars [40:58] in fines and up to three months in jail [41:01] so I could go to jail for three months [41:05] realistically off this incident and they [41:08] and that's with them searching my car [41:10] not finding anything that's with some [41:11] off-duty cop saying that I [41:14] I was recklessly driving a menace to [41:17] society if you will and and so I go to [41:22] get my car out of impound first off my [41:24] to pay a hundred and twenty five dollars [41:25] to the city of Imperial to get a piece [41:30] of paper they said I [41:31] paid this fine I can get my [ __ ] outta a [41:33] pallet they died ago the impound guy [41:34] who's like yours $300 or something for [41:36] the impound for I could pay this tow [41:39] truck on you tell my the turtle my [ __ ] [41:41] and then sitting there for a minute with [41:43] old good so we're sitting there for a [41:55] minute but this guy is not bringing the [41:58] corner round he's not bringing the [41:59] corner it's been a minute and he's not [42:03] bringing the car around and I'm like so [42:06] I I go into the lot I go huntin for this [42:11] guy and [ __ ] he can't get it started [42:13] it's kind of a oh I don't know what's [42:15] wrong there whenever he's like I can't [42:17] get it started [42:18] I'm like [ __ ] you you can't get it [42:20] started it was driving when I got [ __ ] [42:22] pulled over and [ __ ] [42:24] recklessly I sparked were ho recklessly [42:28] and now all of a sudden it doesn't work [42:30] so they were I [ __ ] I was getting [42:33] heated but they actually look cool and [42:34] they're like they do some [ __ ] up she [42:36] did happen they're like will tell it [42:45] will tell it to wherever you want to [42:47] will tell it to wherever you want to tow [42:49] it to what I tell I tell it to my guy [42:51] he's like there was some dude some [ __ ] [42:54] wrong something-something [42:56] some of the cables that get messed up or [42:59] liver so he puts some cables back [43:01] together it was suspicious to say the [43:03] least [43:03] but it was a piece of [ __ ] 96 [43:05] bulletproof Mercedes like we could do 95 [43:08] so so again I get up and running and I [43:14] figure out the only real recourse I have [43:17] at this point in time is on the and this [43:20] is a interesting thing you should look [43:21] if you ever have an issue you need to [43:24] look for your local police department [43:26] and see if they have a complaint that's [43:29] start start number one is file a [43:32] complaint against what happened to you [43:36] feel like the first people that [43:39] contacted you was the DMV did you go [43:42] over that already [43:44] not them not them yet you're coming I [43:49] didn't even know about them like it [43:50] restricted day it was I was so pissed [43:53] about the money it was like the Jade or [43:55] two after that that I filed and I don't [43:58] want it I don't want to say I consulted [44:00] a lawyer I don't wanna say who it was [44:02] but I've a lawyer at my discretion [44:07] I got theirs I got I'm surprised I got [44:12] some friends and some fans and Ango seen [44:14] higher places and and there they sent me [44:18] this form they're like to fill this [44:19] [ __ ] thing up like print off fill it [44:21] out make it look good you know and I [44:23] filled it out I explained what happened [44:24] you know basically what I said and they [44:34] know their investigator came out their [44:37] investigators so they actually did [44:39] investigator came out off that thing and [44:41] took my statement against this cop so [44:44] Granato [44:44] badge 4:08 from the imperial police [44:48] department i'll put that [ __ ] on glass [44:52] he's [ __ ] beat and tased a veteran to [44:55] death [44:55] he pulled a veteran over for DUI kid pi [44:58] should have been drinking Roger that [45:00] drinking and driving dumb dumb and he's [45:03] gonna say resist him he was in he's in [45:05] [ __ ] handcuffs and he ends up getting [45:08] beaten and tasted a no charges come to [45:11] Grenada but they paid 600 K out to the [45:13] kids family whatever ground is still [45:16] where in life everyone I talked to [45:19] vocalize I call that guy's a [ __ ] [ __ ] [45:21] I think there's a piece of [ __ ] like [45:23] this is not working like still working [45:25] now did you get a video of the officer [45:27] that shoots the kid in the hallway at [45:28] the hotel oh yeah [45:30] all that kid was a [ __ ] he didn't get [45:32] any charges either that's unbelievable I [45:35] put it that my meme was there's a [45:36] twister on that kid on his knees on a [45:39] twister board with his hands up I mean [45:41] that that video is unbelievable though [45:43] because the guy giving directions was [45:45] not giving directions [45:47] you got a got a good hook to get back [45:49] [ __ ] shoot you [45:53] do it Elsa for iPhone I mean I felt bad [45:57] for that kid you could tell you it's [45:58] terrified yeah and I kiddin somehow that [46:02] officer who was a kid gets away in in [46:05] the ejection port cover of his rifle [46:07] said kill him or something like that oh [46:09] yeah so yeah so those that don't know on [46:15] an m16 there's or that was air 14 right [46:19] air 15 whatever was but the ejection [46:22] port cover when is open is where he had [46:24] written some samoto things goofy they're [46:28] like this Spurs the cowboys the bells [46:30] the whistles but he obviously wanted to [46:32] shoot he want the sheets Laura I feel [46:35] like if you look at that he had killed [46:36] some piece he's got some some bodies [46:39] under his he's got he had some bodies he [46:41] hadn't she had some numbers he killed a [46:43] few probably but uh well we were still [46:54] on being searched we were on the nose [46:56] rested of least got my car got my car [46:59] back now the complaint filed the [47:00] complaint the investigator came out took [47:02] my story did some research got and the [47:04] DMV car God killed so then I get a [47:06] letter in the mail drivings of privilege [47:09] it's not a right first of all everyone [47:11] should know that driving is a privilege [47:13] there's not a constitutional right to [47:16] operate a motor vehicle they say a [47:18] privilege if you will is that as I put [47:20] it to you know that's just that but [47:22] that's just the law of the matter so [47:24] anyway I get a note from DMV it says I [47:28] got a [ __ ] I get a hearing me for my [47:30] suspended license oh they're gonna [47:33] suspend my [ __ ] for reckless driving so [47:36] they're like you get a suspension here [47:37] I'm like get the [ __ ] out of here like [47:41] what happened to due process well I [47:43] haven't even had a court date yet like [47:45] what the [ __ ] over so the first day [47:50] comes around and it's just lady she's [47:54] like oh I'm the hearing officer this is [47:56] being recorded [47:58] blah blah blah and she's like you know [48:01] give me your side story I tell [48:03] and she's like so you're contesting this [48:05] I was like yeah I'm contesting this this [48:08] is and I've read that I read my stain I [48:10] told her I filed a complaint with the [48:11] police department that this guy was [48:13] shady he was off-duty like all the stuff [48:16] so so they're like well alright then we [48:20] get a continuance to get them up there [48:22] science story so they give me another [48:27] date for the DMV hearing that date rolls [48:29] around and and they're like she calls me [48:34] a few hours before and she's like mr.
document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 204/468,[48:35] Friedman she didn't like yeah she's like [48:37] we're gonna have to push this again I'm [48:39] like really I'm like what's the story [48:40] she's saying well apparently officer [48:43] Green Arrow is on administrative leave [48:44] at this time or whatever and he won't be [48:48] able to testify so they're fighting [48:50] officer Choi and we're gonna chose that [48:54] the uniformed officer his name's on a [48:57] ticket and that hearing came around [48:59] again Choi said he didn't see anything [49:01] he was just following granado's [49:02] directions and the DMV finally dismissed [49:04] it but that could have been a separate [49:06] thing I could have lost my license [49:08] altogether that that worked out in my in [49:10] my favor but that couldn't believe [49:12] that's the whole thing I did deal with [49:14] on my own Isis a year I think six months [49:17] or a year and they sent me a thing they [49:21] sent me a thing because they had all [49:23] these rights for DMV so it's not like a [49:25] completely arbitrary pause process you [49:27] have a DMV hearing so they sent me all [49:30] this information I watched hours of [49:32] powerpoints on driving law and stuff [49:34] like that in preparation yo and they [49:39] send me all the paperwork because I had [49:41] never seen anything like you're supposed [49:43] to be entitled dose no so I had I had [49:46] finally gotten to seen firsthand some of [49:48] the paperwork and I've got to see a [49:50] statement Granado envision where he had [49:52] said I had driven on the other side of [49:55] the road and other cars were swerving [49:57] like off the side of the road in the [49:59] dishes and multiple cars were like [50:02] that's what he is really weren't Robert [50:04] had said that that was what was going on [50:06] I can't get all my facts together so [50:16] when I filed the complaint against the [50:18] police I looked up in the Imperial [50:21] police handbook the duty or the conduct [50:24] for an off-duty police officer and it [50:26] specifically says then all the inertia [50:29] police officers should not involve [50:31] himself and minor traffic incidences [50:34] such as reckless driving or DUI call [50:39] 9-1-1 call 9-1-1 the dispatch called [50:43] proper purpose personnel and reported [50:47] that was probably the deciding factor [50:49] yeah he didn't he didn't do that it [50:53] called his friend out to call this [50:55] rookie he's just a cowboy he'd call I [50:57] like I said this originated because I [51:00] passed him he was going below the speed [51:03] limit I wanted to pass him my only [51:06] conclusion is this guy was like who the [51:08] [ __ ] does this kid think he is passing [51:10] me like I said the speed limit I'm an [51:12] off-duty police officer like an ego too [51:16] large that's Noah thing I could think of [51:18] that's the only thing I can think of [51:20] literally the only thing I could think [51:22] of was the DMV he's on administrative [51:26] leave now oh yeah I keep calling the DA [51:30] I called the DA every month for a year [51:34] so this is like a lot of legwork and I [51:37] like I said I'm studying it I have [51:39] teachers to bounce things off of like [51:44] the judge never helped he was actually [51:47] he was super he was super he had a lot [51:50] of integrity and his class was his class [51:54] was ethics no I talked I talked as [51:56] general as I could but he definitely he [51:59] definitely was like look it up like read [52:02] a book well it's unfortunate that there [52:06] are so many highly qualified [52:09] professional people within the law [52:12] enforcement system and the court system [52:14] and then you just have a couple [52:16] knuckleheads that ruin it forever ya [52:17] know and that's and so when I post about [52:19] this on Facebook I get just an onslaught [52:23] well a lot of our friends are here's the [52:29] deal here's the deal currently currently [52:32] currently 1% of the US population is in [52:37] the military active duty seven to nine [52:41] percent of the population is a veteran [52:44] of some sort has ever served in the [52:46] military or whatever like all that how [52:51] many do you think are cops what [52:54] percentage of the population are police [52:56] officers they're like what percent of [52:58] police all using car veterans do you [53:00] know the percentage first of all the [53:01] entire police officers I think there's a [53:05] if I had to look it up I want to say [53:06] there's a million cops google it there's [53:09] a million there's a million sworn law [53:11] enforcement officers percent 365 million [53:15] so the population in total that's the [53:26] claim to fame is through the thin blue [53:35] they're saying 19 percent of police [53:37] officers that are accessible that's how [53:41] many cops are there in America that's [53:43] gonna claim to fame they're the thin [53:45] blue line that protects that protects us [53:47] from total imeem I understand it I [53:55] understand the ones that are cautious I [53:57] understand you know what my point is are [53:59] buds make up in astronomically low [54:03] percentage of police officers veterans [54:06] yeah yeah our Marine Corps infantry [54:09] combat veteran friends that are placed [54:13] as more police officers [54:15] in their own departments across America [54:18] represent one of the smallest minorities [54:21] like there there's a one-percenter of [54:24] like the pure truest officers like who [54:26] you would want to be a law enforcement [54:27] officer who you're when you close your [54:30] eyes at night and you're like I can [54:31] create this ideal [ __ ] no sir that's [54:33] who you want is those guys you see you [54:35] see not who the [ __ ] is out there you [54:38] see Brent Brett down I mean that guy is [54:45] the ideal perfect warrior special [54:48] perfect marines purpose officer he is [54:51] like Dolph London like he's just like a [54:53] pure specimen of a human being just that [54:57] he's just got that yeah like that I mean [55:00] if I was doing the job though I would [55:02] definitely I would be cautious you know [55:04] what I mean it would be I'd be cautious [55:08] I wouldn't would like that's one of the [55:09] main reasons why straight up I won't do [55:11] it it's a tough chapter five tours [55:13] I will cap a [ __ ] I'm the captain [ __ ] [55:17] he'll sneeze funny and I'll shoot him in [55:18] there yeah I mean have you seen the [55:20] video of they say it was a Vietnam [55:22] veteran I don't know whether or not [55:24] that's true but it's a police training [55:25] video that they show current police [55:27] officers at least from my understanding [55:28] and this officer pulls over this man in [55:31] the truck and the man in the truck is [55:33] supposedly a Vietnam veteran and he gets [55:35] out and starts dancing around and the [55:37] police officer tries to call it in and [55:39] then the man goes back to his vehicle [55:41] and the police officer is telling him [55:43] hey I need to see your hands I need to [55:45] see your hands I need to see her he's [55:46] sovereign citizen and then the guy pulls [55:48] out a rifle and starts shooting at the [55:50] police officer in that video that [55:52] officer dies and the guy drives I feel [55:55] like there or and there's some [ __ ] they [55:56] have to deal with to my if I could plug [55:59] I mean it's not video like I think I can [56:01] say that I don't want to drop their own [56:02] name drop but I'm just I'm being Devils [56:04] Devils add I got buds in the LAPD like [56:09] gang task force that I was like [56:11] in Iraq with and they've had to move [56:13] they've had to move to a new house [56:16] because bad guys found out where their [56:17] personal home was and was like [ __ ] [56:19] with her family like it's a real it's [56:22] some real [ __ ] there's some real [ __ ] [56:24] that goes down and it sucks because of [56:28] the it's the same [ __ ] we had to deal [56:32] with there this strategic Lance Corporal [56:34] you act like every time we pull the [56:36] trigger we didn't have the same [56:37] realistic [ __ ] we would have to deal [56:39] with overseas that they have to deal [56:41] with maybe there's a little more [56:42] scrutiny here back home but like we if [56:47] you shot someone you knew there is an [56:48] investigation you couldn't just [56:50] arbitrarily shoot someone even in a [56:52] gunfight anything that you want [56:54] you gave an after-action report there's [56:56] actually more put your name on something [56:58] yeah but I mean if we're in a firefight [57:01] liking the job cemetary yeah I let me [57:05] let me let me same with the same with [57:09] let me put a caveat to that some of [57:14] those convoys that we were on starting [57:16] in like 2005 you couldn't shoot anybody [57:18] okay there were times when we were [57:22] driving in our convoy going from [57:23] wherever to wherever point A to point B [57:25] and we would hit contact right and [57:27] there's just a ton of buildings to our [57:29] right side yeah and we can't even see [57:31] anymore that's true but we're firing [57:33] rockets at that building we realize no [57:37] you definitely there are times embassy [57:41] arbitrarily sure same st.
document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 205/468,"well same with [57:43] that college to grade that was in Time [57:46] magazine here's one of my favorite [57:48] stories story okay so let's do the [57:52] Afghanistan so let me ask let me ask you [57:55] this Dana because you you are a machine [57:58] a machine gunner by trade have you heard [58:03] of suppressive fire yes I have heard of [58:08] suppressive fire really yeah it's [58:10] interesting cuz we got a visit I don't [58:16] wait is that interesting because there's [58:19] some there's uh there's what explain [58:28] what a battalion gunner is he's [58:30] basically the main guy he's a Warrant [58:32] Officer with an infantry unit that knows [58:35] everything about every single weapon [58:36] system he said he goes to and in order [58:45] to being Warrant Officer you must be a [58:47] staff and CEO within the enlisted ranks [58:51] weren't born officers are the ones that [58:53] have the respect not only from the [58:55] enlisted but also from the officers but [58:58] I think the higher up the totem pole you [59:02] guys you forget where you come from you [59:04] forget some [ __ ] [59:05] so let's this wasn't a battalion gunner [59:07] this was like a higher higher up gutter [59:10] it becomes more political like it does [59:12] so this guy comes down bitching about [59:15] ammo expenditure reports he said do you [59:18] know what the arrow expenditure was in [59:21] Vietnam he's like for every 10,000 [59:25] rounds dozen 10,000 rounds for every one [59:38] guy killed or whatever he's like you [59:41] know what is now significant hundred [59:43] it's 300 rounds for every one got killed [59:46] and summers I [ __ ] love this kid you [59:48] look so easy is it nice price he said [59:52] we're getting better we're getting [59:54] better this guy's he's I think was [60:06] surprised so far he's like there's no [60:07] such [ __ ] thing as suppressive fire [60:09] wait who said there's no say he's a [60:11] goner his [ __ ] gunner and he's from [60:14] like high up headquarters he's like [60:16] there's no such thing he said we spent [60:19] all these money on these sites [60:21] he said you uh you [ __ ] you don't [60:24] shoot [60:26] [ __ ] can tell me what color their [60:28] talents in you're our CEO or whatever [60:31] looking through it [60:33] he's like we've all he's like he's on [60:35] who's been who's been shot at except [60:37] we've all worked on the rifle range it's [60:39] the same those little pop pops over your [60:41] head pop pop pop pop long story short [60:45] the next day pop pop pops he's like see [60:49] there's not the pop right there was [60:51] [ __ ] face calling through his face to [60:54] the god suppressive fire Now or Never [60:57] like Calvino [ __ ] around he caught one [61:00] through his face putting a dip in on [61:01] patrol trying to try to calm everyone [61:04] down because they've taken pops and you [61:06] didn't nobody would was putting any [61:08] suppressive fire down [61:09] it's the same pop when some pop ups your [61:12] instinct is to get [ __ ] down and seek [61:14] cover you do it back to them maybe that [61:16] same [ __ ] instinct but did you see my [61:23] hate so he lived he lived he lived and [61:26] now I'm sure he's gonna tell [ __ ] so [61:28] you don't do it but what my big takeaway [61:31] was is that I like suppressive fire [61:34] holy Jew yeah but here's the thing when [61:36] it comes to one of the things in my [61:38] opinion that really separates Marine [61:40] Corps infantry from a lot of other [61:42] combat units out there is that we do our [61:45] fire team rushes and part of a fireteam [61:48] rush is as one team moves up the other [61:51] team is laying down suppressive fire [61:53] everything the reason for this is [61:55] because when you're in a combat [61:56] situation if you're the enemy and you [61:59] hear that gunfire getting closer and [62:01] closer oh yeah closer and closer because [62:04] the way that we orchestrate our [62:05] movements that's wing that's when you [62:08] that's when you overwhelm the enemy [62:10] overwhelm them with superiority and if [62:14] you're moving and someone's not shooting [62:16] you're dead [62:17] yeah movement without firing suicide [62:19] fire without movement and stiff and [62:21] waste of bullets yep but and this is [62:27] another big reason why and a lot of you [62:29] know I mean all right so being part of [62:32] Kami's and canines we have a lot of [62:33] different branches that come in through [62:35] our organization and we always talk [ __ ] [62:38] back and forth but [62:40] one of the things that really separates [62:42] the Marine Corps and I'm biased towards [62:43] the Marine Corps obviously I think it's [62:45] the best fighting force this world has [62:46] ever seen [62:47] now one of the things about them and why [62:49] the enemy will often engage against the [62:51] Army or any of the other branches Air [62:54] Force Navy and not the Marines as often [62:57] is because when we are attacked so [62:59] depending on their standard operating [63:00] procedures within a combat situation the [63:02] Army is often their standard operating [63:05] procedures is to drive through it so if [63:07] you're on convoy from point A to point B [63:08] in your ambush drive through it if you [63:11] can write the Marine Corps if the beat [63:14] yeah you're darn right if you shoot us [63:17] it doesn't matter where the where the [63:18] little kid is going to bite you we do it [63:21] like Afghanistan was its own base to the [63:24] ground moved around and Ranger files [63:26] which are just straight lines everyone [63:28] staying behind everyone in their boot [63:29] prints and [ __ ] that's just some stuff [63:31] you never trained on that's just well [63:44] the IDS are improvised explosive devices [63:46] I don't know everybody knows what in [63:47] ideas and yeah I wasn't in Afghanistan [63:51] but I was trying to talk about how if [63:53] the enemy engages the Marine Corps its [63:57] locate close that Taliban figured that [64:01] out what they would do is they'd like a [64:03] whole bunch of [ __ ] IEDs find [64:05] everything that I'm up he sees me I'm [64:06] down behind so they were waiting they [64:09] shoot pop pop pop and they wait for that [64:11] Marines to turn and push towards him and [64:14] then the Marines would walk into [ __ ] [64:15] minefields so we had to redo everything [64:18] we know well Ken yeah so that all [64:21] changed at all that everything the whole [64:25] way you fight yeah the oh I have one two [64:27] three well we are we always older blasts [64:30] tardies [64:34] oh man they came out they came out with [64:37] these blast Underpants here's go Souter [64:40] these were [ __ ] magic Underpants [64:42] Nathan I [ __ ] you got the they really [64:45] weren't anything special [64:47] they're like your standard boxer briefs [64:49] but supposedly they would like close up [64:52] around the bottom of the leg to keep the [64:56] wound fresh and clean while someone was [64:59] putting a tourniquet on whatever and so [65:02] like they were like a shooter and I want [65:06] to say his name I don't know how far [65:07] your little shits gonna get I don't want [65:09] [ __ ] family and friends to hear that [65:11] [ __ ] come on but uh just [ __ ] kid guy [65:16] on his truck too he was on an Opie and [65:19] observation position the hilltop there's [65:21] a bunch of trucks and a 316 he was [65:23] walking from his truck to another truck [65:25] to get to get a battery or something and [65:28] he stepped on an ie D it was meant for a [65:30] truck and it [ __ ] bloom in half like [65:34] [ __ ] just in half like he flew across [65:37] the OB the other side landed like they [65:40] tried to pull like six from under [65:42] staying six or seven tourniquets on the [65:44] kid and it just it wasn't happening and [65:47] then in the after actions it all comes [65:49] out he wasn't wearing his blast undies [65:51] and like it [ __ ] everywhere it was a [65:59] [ __ ] wasn't he wearing this place and [66:01] he's like that if that's true are bad if [66:05] he had had the magic Underpants on to [66:07] shame and then we kind of makes me think [66:09] of the show we got shitless so we got [66:11] super sarcastic with it so I get [ __ ] [66:13] because you know while I was the cat the [66:15] combine in an armored team and we had [66:16] two trucks and we could move throughout [66:18] the battle space and everybody need a [66:20] [ __ ] ride from us we really good taxi [66:22] okay the goal of the time commander [66:24] needs to go over here give him a left [66:25] over [66:26] okay and so what the sexual even started [66:29] doing is like oh we do underwear checks [66:31] now like everyone's got to pull their [66:33] pants down and show us that you're [66:34] wearing plus Underpants [66:36] no he did it just to be a sarcastic [66:37] [ __ ] because we had to take them to [66:39] tack because it was Italian I was making [66:41] such a big deal about it so [ __ ] of [66:43] course none of them had a bond no no [66:45] Madame on they're like oh those are four [66:48] essential personnel we like know if you [66:51] need a ride you got to put them all in [66:52] service battalion policy they have made [66:55] it very [ __ ] clear that this is a [66:58] priority so oh man I gave the section [67:01] leader props for that by the name of [67:03] dare that makes me think of oh I have [67:05] one when we were at the pistol Factory [67:07] and it was a hundred and thirty plus [67:09] degrees up it was basically as hot as [67:11] that rag has ever been I don't know what [67:13] the temperature was but it felt like it [67:15] felt like a sledgehammer beating your [67:17] face and every time you stepped outside [67:18] of that heat and every time we went on [67:21] patrol or if we went on post or if we [67:23] did anything that involved outside [67:25] activity before we went to do that we [67:28] would have to present a bottle that we [67:30] were peeing in oh remember that [ __ ] [67:33] yeah good too because there's like [67:35] different colors of urine right Oh [67:40] [ __ ] shitty jack is my absolute [67:43] favorite human being we up naked on [67:57] video chat and he's yeah I'll [ __ ] [68:03] drop I won't i won't i'll leave it there [68:05] he has been he's been enjoying himself [68:08] throughout the evening for sure [68:11] he's letting me know he's having no what [68:14] would have been going on up to that [68:16] point so shitty Jack shitty so before [68:22] you go on guard mouth at the pistol [68:25] factory you had to present the purple or [68:29] sergeant of the guard with a bottle of [68:32] your urine to demonstrate that you were [68:35] properly hydrated and that everyone [68:38] throw away the trash can around the [68:40] corner afterwards or whatever and [ __ ] [68:43] shitty jack was late the guard [68:45] welcomed putting this [ __ ] on he didn't [68:48] have to pee [68:49] [ __ ] I'm sure if he peed it would be [68:52] in yellow he was like he just wasn't [68:55] having it so he just grabbed the bottle [68:57] of piss out of the trashcan and brought [69:01] it over to formation and was holding it [69:04] and the Corporal of the guard was pretty [69:07] sure he had seen shitty Jack follow my [69:23] facebook after they can't member his [69:27] nationality was Bill do my best to do [69:29] it's [ __ ] active which I'm sure you [69:32] should do 2018 it's fine so is this new [69:42] piece in jeggings yes it is corporal [69:47] such a smartass yes it is card roll and [69:53] simultaneously there is a left seat [69:56] right seat going on for those of you at [69:58] home and left seat right seat is when a [70:00] new unit comes on deck and they're [70:03] learning how you do things and you take [70:05] you're showing them and then you switch [70:07] and they take things and you [70:08] your transition away so we're doing a [70:11] left seat right feet with the Polish and [70:13] there is a Polish general that's [70:16] observing or change of the guard and how [70:19] we do business and I totally forgot [70:22] about the yeah are we coming oh yeah he [70:25] was he was there the Polish army was [70:27] funny [70:27] no [ __ ] I mean I'm not I'm not being I'm [70:30] not being racist I'm not being racist [70:32] I'm not being ain't like I'm this is [70:34] straight up a true fact the Polish [70:37] arrived and we were at the guard gate so [70:40] we had to give the exact numbers and [70:42] vehicles and the Polish are you there [70:45] like 72 personnel 96 vehicles you see [70:57] why that's funny right 72 personnel 96 [71:01] vehicles the closer to people 96 people [71:09] I think Lippman are they truck and some [71:11] of the other there is so much fun to [71:22] work with though I know those guys [71:23] they're doing the left seat right seat [71:25] they're watching the old Jack a debris [71:27] me have their little interaction did you [71:33] piss drink it music drink it I on [71:38] corporal and he uh he opens up and he [71:41] just starts dumping it all over his body [71:44] like Carla then poured it all over

caches and things like [75:56] that but we weren't we were we were we [75:58] were searching they're like sweeps all [76:01] right but anyways we were doing one of [76:03] those and this is a Doran's o story we [76:05] pushed out and we're literally just [76:07] walking and I remember I was super [76:09] stoked because I was on the machine gun [76:11] on the seven-ton I'm sitting there [76:14] watching everybody walk in the hot [76:16] weather and I'm you know this is great [76:17] and they find a [76:19] weapon cache a off to the right so I get [76:21] out I'd go over there and I remember [76:23] it's by a tree and about fifty feet away [76:25] there's a line of bushes that block [76:28] what's around the corner and we're [76:30] sitting there and we found like three [76:31] trash bags filled with ak-47s and [76:34] magazines completely fully loaded so [76:36] these guys were ready to do business is [76:38] something hit the fan they had weapons [76:39] ready locked and loaded and we're [76:41] sitting there and I don't remember which [76:42] officer was there but I remember the [76:45] Renzo and myself were there and then one [76:47] of the officers and dorando says whoever [76:51] the officer was like sir there's a few [76:53] people watching us over by those bushes [76:55] don't make it obvious and the officer [76:58] glances over and he sees him he looks [77:00] back at me and - Renzo he says I see [77:03] them when I tell you - you're gonna [77:06] apprehend them now so me and des Renzo [77:13] just take off and we run down and as I [77:16] remember as I'm running we were so far [77:18] away they saw us when we were running it [77:21] wasn't like oh no they're here like [77:23] these people had time to run around the [77:25] corner run around the other bush shut [77:27] down get in position aim in through [77:30] their scopes and take us out as we came [77:31] around the corner but we came around the [77:34] corner and then there was another corner [77:35] that we went around and they were just [77:36] sitting there so we took him in and [77:39] brought him back and I just remember how [77:41] insane that was no they weren't playing [77:46] a card you know they they ran away from [77:50] us and they stopped they ran and yeah [77:54] they no they won't say and they just ran [77:56] and stopped that was no I don't remember [77:57] where that was okay so yeah it was and I [78:00] don't remember where we were but it was [78:02] I think it was I don't were the name of [78:04] the officer but who was the tall skinny [78:06] blonde haired dude he looked like a frat [78:10] boy [78:13] he actually had to Renzo cracking up [78:15] because he meant to say office one time [78:17] and he said I want you down to my [78:18] orifice car was the radio operator and [78:30] he's like he was [ __ ] talking to car [78:33] in his sleep like giving orders and [ __ ] [78:35] cars like call him and say what everyone [78:41] was sleep-deprived on Cox so we love the [78:47] guy great guy we're out in I don't [78:49] remember where we were at this point we [78:51] weren't at the pistol Factory this was [78:52] before that [78:53] yeah it was before the pistol factory [78:56] and we were doing the cigarette factory [78:58] we were doing eight on four off so eight [79:00] hours on post four hours off everybody [79:03] was sleep-deprived nobody liked sleep [79:08] you're stopping you're eating you're [79:10] right it was it was ridiculous and the [79:15] guy cox's that actively eight hours of [79:17] sleep a day within a 24-hour period [79:19] that's sure it's broken up right that's [79:22] how they worked it so he's standing it's [79:25] a nighttime and he's standing by himself [79:27] just standing there and we're looking [79:29] over at him like what is he doing [79:31] yeah and somebody walked over to him and [79:34] said hey Cox what do you got going on [79:36] over here [79:36] and he goes whoo [ __ ] off I'm waiting to [79:38] take a piss and he was there by himself [79:43] and I was on post with him once and we [79:45] were on this rooftop post of the date [79:47] factory so we're at this date factory [79:49] and we're on this rooftop post back [79:55] only places that can rotate is where [80:00] you're like here in there no kidding [80:11] well we're at this date factory and [80:14] myself and Cox were on this rooftop post [80:16] and all these local kids kept coming [80:19] over and they would try to sell a soda [80:21] and stuff and this was the one I think I [80:23] may have told you this story I know I [80:24] told you this story this kid comes up [80:26] and I went esta you know would go away [80:28] or whatever it means and he looks at me [80:30] English and I said egg go away and he [80:33] goes it go away and he does like this [80:36] little dance so I this is not so no well [80:42] I think after he was copying what I was [80:45] saying I looked at him and I said how [80:46] much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a [80:48] woodchuck could chuck wood and he looks [80:49] at me and his eyes get really wide and [80:51] he says which wood so we were on this [81:00] post for 12 hours we are up there so [81:03] we're there day to night and it gets [81:05] nighttime and Cox falls asleep and I'm [81:07] wide awake so I was perfectly fine ice [81:09] in the way you know I mean this is how [81:12] I'm pretty sure you were too if you're [81:14] on coastal something there so like yeah [81:19] you let the other dude sleep you know [81:21] you might get some sleep [81:22] somebody you know one of the higher-ups [81:23] you know do my yep [81:29] and I'm sitting there and he wakes up [81:32] and he's right next to the edge of the [81:33] building and he wakes he's not even [81:36] really a wick he leans over and he goes [81:38] hey that's John he leans back [81:56] that's what power he's a good guy this [82:03] is not Saddam Hussein's army he will he [82:06] will they will not shoot me for no [82:08] reason at all yeah well I mean over the [82:20] next over the course of the next decade [82:23] it would be a lot of back and forth the [82:29] woodchuck kid you know we bought some [82:31] soda from him and I think we even bought [82:34] some and then we bought cigarettes from [82:38] them we definitely bought a lot of [82:44] cigarettes and we bought soda from the [82:45] locals remember this Sumer so more some [82:50] our cigarettes [83:03] oh yeah once we got the pegs [83:07] no but dipping was a big thing to [83:10] actually that's how I quit smoking [83:12] cigarettes was dipping I mean no I don't [83:16] dip but I mean when is easy stop well so [83:23] the way that I looked at it was smoking [83:25] is more socially accepted than Venus [83:28] depending on where you are with you yeah [83:33] yeah yeah but for some reason dipping [83:38] old people within the college class you [83:40] definitely give me a stink eye let it [83:46] drip all over my beer they give you this [83:48] tank guy this is still is this no Kodiak [83:51] no grizzly [84:00] well the worst was on ship I drink a [84:04] community spit bottle Oh Davis is the [84:11] other crazy one still missing in action [84:15] I think Davis is in Chicago right no I [84:18] so let me tell you here's the here's I [84:21] did some detective work on Davis I [84:23] tracked down track down investigative I [84:34] did some [ __ ] on the Internet [84:36] I paid for some pay some pace sir pace [84:39] some pay websites over there like get [84:41] and I have Davis in 2008 being arrested [84:48] and going to Cook County Jail in Cook [84:52] County Chicago that's Schaumburg yeah no [84:54] he's going he's in genre Cook County no [84:56] that's why Cook County I noticed I know [84:59] Davis's birthday I know his name full [85:03] name with middle initial and that's [85:06] enough to get a lot of stuff actually [85:08] and so I went to the Cook County so I [85:18] went to the Cook County website which is [85:20] not the thing I went to the Cook County [85:22] website to look up if Davis was still [85:26] incarcerated as a male oh it's tough and [85:28] determined that Davis was not in Cook [85:32] County so he had been arrested in 2008 [85:35] he had done time how much I'm not [85:39] currently in Cook County and that was [85:42] like 2016 how much time I don't know [85:45] and it was for some [ __ ] it was her it [85:49] was for resisting it was for like [85:51] resisting arrest it was for evading it [85:54] was for evading police it was for a [85:57] high-speed pursuit it was for her it was [86:00] personal there was [86:01] there's a story there was a story there [86:04] for sure [86:06] speaking of doing time do you remember [86:07] the story with please who was it with I [86:12] can't remember his name Shores net more [86:15] the one who shot Martinez in the neck [86:20] it's like it's not schwarzy it schwartz [86:23] schwoz schwartz that might have been my [86:26] defense well yeah so we're well we have [86:29] one we have one guy in our unit they [86:30] were messing around on post they were at [86:32] post ten I remember post ten was the one [86:35] far from the corner and Martinez kept [86:37] joking around saying no somebody's [86:39] coming to relieve us somebody's coming [86:41] to relieve us and they were supposed to [86:42] have the weapons in condition 3 which is [86:44] magazine inserts and G's which is [86:47] magazine inserted no round and chamber [86:49] bolt forward safety on ejection port [86:51] cone closed right but he had it in [86:54] condition one which is magazine inserted [86:57] both forward safety on round in chamber [86:59] ejection port cover closed so he clicked [87:02] it off safe joking around [87:04] he unseated the magazine and when [87:07] Martinez turned around he was just gonna [87:09] back hahaha [87:10] click joking but he went bang shot [87:16] Martinez through the neck no when he was [87:20] shot through the neck he fell back and [87:22] Schwartz freaked out jumped off the [87:25] tower because he tried calling it in on [87:27] the radio and nobody was answering so he [87:29] took off to try to get help in Martinez [87:32] called in his own evac and so they [87:35] basically came and it was on his mom's [87:37] birthday too that is more crazy stories [87:40] from the pistol factory in the date [87:42] factory didn't we have a vehicle burned [87:44] down in the pistol factory or something [87:47] like that [87:47] pistol factory smoking on post face [87:50] contraction of those kids [87:54] when we were in Babylon though I was on [87:58] the east side I think of the Tigris [88:01] River I was at one little separate unit [88:04] that was often already [88:05] the one were ski driver oh yeah yeah I [88:08] gave him his last cigarette no [ __ ] [88:11] because he came over and I was up on the [88:12] rooftop post and he came up to my [88:14] position he was talking mean we we had a [88:17] good connection from the beginning [88:18] because back when we were at the bear [88:20] it's cool to boots he was super cool he [88:22] talked to me quick that's what stands [88:24] out to me before he tell us he story is [88:27] talking to him all I had was boot camp [88:30] stories but I was a [ __ ] boot and the [88:33] only thing I know for 1% was that he did [88:37] not like swimming he was not a strong [88:39] swimmer he said that he told me he was [88:42] an iron duck straight up he straight up [88:45] told me he was in iron Doug ice kid you [88:48] not that [ __ ] burned into my brain he [88:51] is he knew he was not a good swimmer he [88:55] was a hard charger though that guy was [88:57] good guy he didn't he in charger no he [89:01] died oh I have one well this one died in [89:05] 2003 but when I first when I met him in [89:07] 2002 this is also a Brent story and I'm [89:12] using his first name because he's a [89:13] police officer now and he told me not to [89:15] use his last name he's like I you know [89:17] I'm an officer now oh cool [89:19] but anyways so I remember ski asked if I [89:26] could go pick him up a pack of [89:27] cigarettes or something like that and I [89:29] said I couldn't do it I said but I have [89:30] cigarettes and he says well let me get [89:33] one and I said I'll give you one one [89:35] condition he's like one condition I said [89:37] do some push-ups and I'm private first [89:40] class shomer at this time and when I [89:43] said do some push-ups his eyes got wide [89:45] he's like what in charge of me and like [89:47] put me in a headlock or something and [89:49] all the other higher up Marines are [89:51] running and Brent comes running on the [89:54] back like John Rambo rah [89:57] jump sit on the pile oh he's great I [90:00] mean that deep I had some good times [90:03] with some of the fights with [90:06] yeah it was cool afterwards I gave them [90:09] a cigarette and that's all okay for now [90:17] but there was it was such a cool moment [90:19] cuz after that I gave him a cigarette [90:22] and then I got mine and he lit his [90:25] cigarette and then I'm getting reading [90:26] light mine and he goes no I'm lighting [90:29] your cigarette and he says somebody with [90:31] balls enough to say what you said to me [90:34] I'll light your cigarette for you [90:36] but he came by and so this was right [90:41] before he actually drowned in Iraq and [90:43] it was at the other side of the river [90:44] and he comes up and I'm on the rooftop [90:46] post and I remember looking down talking [90:47] to him and he says hey can I get a [90:50] cigarette I said yeah I don't promise I [90:51] throw him down a cigarette and he takes [90:53] and he goes you want to know a little [90:54] trick to pick up the ladies let me show [90:56] you he puts a singer in his mouth he [90:58] takes up the matchbook and he goes with [91:00] one hand and lights it [91:03] I'm started smoking in it and I'm [91:05] sitting there and I said so what else [91:07] he's like that's it what the [ __ ] else [91:09] you want yeah well there is an iconic [91:19] photo of him I'll actually uh I'll put [91:22] it on the YouTube video it was it was [91:28] literally an iconic photo of the United [91:31] States military forces in Iraq and how [91:34] we are seen as invincible and he's like [91:36] standing there and he has the suspenders [91:38] a shirt looking I'll cut smoking a [91:40] cigarette I mean it's a badass photo huh [91:48] [ __ ] that's the crazy part your [91:50] talent is the crazy part was a [91:54] helicopter crashed into the fray beast [91:57] river and he saw it and he [ __ ] took [92:01] off his [ __ ] and just [ __ ] ran and [92:03] jumped in yeah he jumped in to try to [92:05] save the pile around here's the thanks [92:09] we [ __ ] stuck out to be you know if [92:11] you drowned like why he [ __ ] jumped [92:13] in [92:14] no though I think everybody died I think [92:17] everybody died yeah I think everybody in [92:21] because the helicopters the thing is [92:22] about the helicopters that's why you do [92:24] the helo dunker and training is all the [92:27] heavy shits up top so as soon as it hits [92:30] the water it flips upside out and goes [92:32] why I mean I was a McCoist in the Marine [92:35] Corps which is marine combat that's my [92:36] crazy [ __ ] that's the that's the R word [92:40] again [92:40] that's the R word strength you have to [92:42] be R word strong to be able to be able [92:46] to be able quick we have a Kris you are [92:48] our words throw well no I mean what I [92:54] was gonna say what so in the muck whist [92:57] chorus when you go through it they [92:59] separate you into two groups you're [93:02] either the fish of the Guppies the fish [93:04] are the fast stronger swimmers and the [93:07] Guppies are the slower and when I was [93:09] going through the course I was the best [93:10] in the Guppies so you know not not the [93:13] best note I mixed it up I mix it up I [93:22] wasn't the best in the Guppies I was the [93:24] worst in the fish that's what it was I [93:27] was the worst in the fish and it was [93:30] brutal [93:30] it sucked it because every all the [93:32] different training things they always [93:33] said it pays to be a winner well if [93:35] you're the slowest one you're never the [93:37] winner so it's torture but I know that [93:39] but you I mean people think that you [93:42] look at something when it comes from [93:44] swimming perspective and so I could do [93:46] that in this situation I could do that [93:47] in this situation but the moment you get [93:49] to that point where you're running out [93:50] of breath and you start to panic and [93:52] they put you through that multiple times [93:54] of course wow those torch around out [93:57] there you feel like it's no well right [94:01] before I went through the course a staff [94:03] sergeant actually drowned like died died [94:05] no I'm saying that some people choked [94:07] down some water oh yeah everyone does [94:09] it's it's yeah I mean I so out of [94:12] everything I did in the Marine Corps you [94:14] know being in combat I in a machine [94:17] gunner [94:18] because there's a cupping things along [94:20] the way where I'm like [ __ ] that like [94:23] you see that the military and you're [94:25] like [ __ ] no and then the other time I [94:28] met woold we won't say his name but he's [94:30] a Navy SEAL now and I saw him after he [94:32] got out of buzz and no homo his muscles [94:35] had muscles he was he was like I'm like [94:41] buddy some [ __ ] huh he's like yeah no [94:43] gel like buds is hard not for me [94:50] and that's the thing with them with the [94:53] McCoys course out of everything that I [94:55] did in the Marine Corps if there was one [94:57] that I would rather skip again you know [94:59] or here let me put it in a different [95:01] perspective everybody thinks going [95:02] through drill instructor school is [95:03] challenging because you're gonna be a [95:05] drill instructor top ten or some of the [95:06] marine corps it's when the hardest [95:07] things that you could do in the marine [95:09] corps which it is but i would rather go [95:12] through drill instructor school twice [95:14] then do my quiz once I tell my kids [95:20] stories about [ __ ] your bequests [95:22] adventures we were at the condo pool in [95:24] San Diego well that and here's the crazy [95:27] I got a buddy I was like I got a buddy [95:30] that can swim this pool underwater with [95:33] a helmet on bagging board they don't [95:39] care but while the drills stricter [95:41] school is three months and mccoys [95:43] courses three weeks so I'd rather do six [95:45] months of drills were schooled in three [95:47] weeks it was the only course in the [95:49] marine corps that I dreaded the end of [95:51] the day because at the end of the day we [95:53] did what was called water aerobics now [95:55] it sounds like something that a bunch of [95:57] old people would be doing in the pool [95:58] rotating their arms it was absolute [96:01] torture but the point that I'm trying to [96:02] make with all that training right I've [96:06] had people say well if I flipped a [96:07] vehicle into the water I'd be able to [96:09] get out because a lot of people overseas [96:11] died because their vehicle cats got [96:17] grumpy [96:17] hey so a lot of guys overseas actually [96:21] ended up drowning by flipping a vehicle [96:23] over into one of those into the canals [96:25] things like that and some of the guys [96:27] would say well if I was in that vehicle [96:29] I'd be able to get out how are you not [96:31] able to get out right [96:32] well after than the quiz training and I [96:35] flipped a Hummer [96:38] you know I flipped a Hummer right okay [96:40] yeah do you remember we were doing that [96:42] raid we're gonna raid this house and we [96:45] went there and cat had done recon [96:48] beforehand I know wasn't Apple grabbing [96:51] em hmm it was before that where were we [96:53] at no it was a back rub it was nostril [96:56] wall salon you're right it was I was [96:57] wrong that's right because that's the [97:00] only time we got hung because we rely [97:01] company we out there like hey you're [97:04] gonna take over for this 3-1 unit [97:06] because they were gonna go join the rest [97:07] of Fallujah push and they're like a good [97:09] is going to house Kurtz and they're like [97:11] so here's the other deal you're uh [97:14] you're gonna do it home these and your [97:17] machine gunners right guys and nobody's [97:20] guys never be licenses we got a library [97:22] card so good nuts whoa when I flipped [97:28] the Humvee out in Iraq it took us 15 [97:32] minutes to get out of that vehicle after [97:34] we had flipped and that was on dry land [97:38] so imagine that being underwater and [97:40] when we flipped the vehicle it went from [97:45] being an open space like it would be [97:47] when you're inside of a vehicle to all [97:49] Sun everything crushing in on you as we [97:52] flipped and I remember once we flipped I [97:54] heard somebody saying help help me get [97:57] in my head because I flipped it in my [98:00] head I was thinking it was Kirk we'll [98:06] take that out I thought it was Kirk and [98:08] we didn't [ __ ] dude why okay but anyways [98:13] so I thought it was Kirk but he was [98:15] smart enough cuz he was up top on the [98:17] machine gun that when we went to roll he [98:19] ducked inside [98:20] we had an Army National Guard guy with [98:23] us who was claustrophobic and the market [98:26] 19 ammo cans rolled on top of them [98:28] that's one thing whoa he's really why [98:30] the doors open so [ __ ] it takes a [98:34] forklift to put a wall it takes I get a [98:36] piece of very well armored doors yeah [98:39] those doors are legit [98:42] they're heavy so you flip over and you [98:44] get in water it's not opening in the top [98:46] of the Humvee where the hole is it's now [98:49] upside out but you dress just like wait [98:53] what else were you gonna say about Davis [98:55] I think there was something else we were [98:56] going with that [98:59] yeah he's out there that's it [99:06] he's out there there's a lot of [ __ ] I [99:09] love this he's [ __ ] if I could if I [99:12] could pinpoint house we're always when [99:16] you look at these stats and they're like [99:18] twenty two guys a day kill themselves or [99:22] whatever the number is no you're like [99:24] how does that happen like you have to [99:27] take someone someone has to take [ __ ] [99:31] personal responsibility at some point in [99:34] time because we all we as close ones we [99:38] talk to each other fairly regularly but [99:42] like I don't know if I would take it out [99:45] if someone in our circles that we talk [99:47] to you on the rag that we see it become [99:49] another show no Facebook or we've been [99:50] staged at this end there if one of them [99:52] off themselves you product 81st oh oh [99:55] you probably see it he probably said [99:57] arrow is a touchy it's a touchy it's a [100:00] touchy subject but Davis if something [100:03] happened to Davis I would take it died [100:04] say [ __ ] you cuz I could Pitt I can [100:06] pinpoint it's on me [100:08] I can pinpoint there's a couple times [100:10] before I totally lost contact with him [100:13] where I was just so wrapped up and still [100:15] being in the military and still getting [100:17] ready to deploy and still going through [100:20] my own [ __ ] trying to get my own [ __ ] [100:22] squared away and drinking all the time [100:24] to do him a [ __ ] and he'd be like he was [100:27] trying to get me to Western Union and [100:28] bloody I news for heroin he was like [100:30] back on heroin or whatever like I mean [100:33] he was probably what am I gonna do [100:35] I'm either probably something if we're [100:37] being honest maybe I could have called [100:38] baby there's there's a bunch more [100:40] programs now [100:42] this would have been [ __ ] 2008 maybe [100:46] something like that yeah but I mean what [100:49] about Maher max so I I tell us I Bruce [100:54] like I took a class while I was still in [100:57] the military creative writing then one [100:59] of the short stories I wrote about was [101:01] about him [ __ ] you not again when we [101:05] left for dinner [101:06] I remember this [ __ ] kid sitting by [101:09] himself over people smoked cigarettes [101:15] kill themselves and it felt like there [101:17] was something bad I don't know I [ __ ] [101:19] asked me wouldn't come to dinner with us [101:20] it's like we're all walking up like good [101:24] dinner [101:24] guys good the bucket okay well I sit by [101:30] myself and smoke cigarettes too [101:31] sometimes [101:32] all right look I've told people about [101:35] that because suicide is something that a [101:38] lot of people deal with yeah somebody [101:40] commit suicide and somebody they know [101:42] and I've known a few people who have [101:44] commit suicide and you hear about people [101:47] that are struggling and they're feeling [101:48] something you know they're going through [101:50] a hard time and that's something that we [101:51] deal with a lot down at Cammy's and [101:53] canines where people are depressed [101:54] they're at you know their rock bottom oh [101:56] sure [101:57] you know the I almost feel as if the [101:59] ones a lot of times the ones that are [102:01] going to do it they don't really give [102:02] you any signs and if there is a sign [102:05] it's a cry for help you know [102:06] so with Maher I didn't see any I didn't [102:09] see signs with Meyer and he was liked by [102:16] everybody [102:16] [ __ ] but if date right right now Davis [102:19] turned up dead door swings both ways [102:31] though I mean the [ __ ] he is he's all [102:41] bad it was such a sense to his mom who [102:43] was holding the whole family together [102:44] got cancer died and then like I said the [102:49] last known address I had for him I [102:51] called someone named David Davis [102:54] turn now that wasn't the same guy that [102:56] [ __ ] he was like I told him the story [102:59] and he drove by the house the address I [103:01] had for said this [ __ ] was all boarded [103:03] up it wasn't last time you heard from [103:08] him [103:08] oh wait oh wait [103:12] mm-hmm I thought you said it was like [103:15] 2016 no I've seen he went to jail oh I [103:20] saw there was an arrest for him I'm like [103:25] to get my ears [ __ ] up am i last time [103:28] talk to him those six seen he was [103:30] arrested how often he got time in jail [103:33] he's not in Cook County [103:34] I feel like lat he probably got released [103:37] in 2002 well how often was he reaching [103:40] out to you though before that even knows [103:43] because we're [ __ ] 20 like how often [103:47] do you text so it's a with your 20 sleep [103:49] I don't I [ __ ] I don't know [103:54] I wish anymore I wish I don't know I [103:56] kicked myself for Davis I wish I knew [103:58] [ __ ] we were best friends meet him [104:01] and Jack and [ __ ] three of us lived [104:03] together and that God the embarrassing [104:05] no well you guys definitely had some [104:08] crazy stories I remember one time I [104:10] showed up to the barracks and he was on [104:14] the third floor and you had to watch out [104:17] because he thought it was a good idea to [104:20] throw Heineken bottles at people showing [104:22] up on the old Foreman oh I don't think [104:28] I'm Facebook friends with Morris anymore [104:30] I don't know what a moose kid no I [104:32] remember the moose but Davis had been [104:35] drunk as [ __ ] huge he would put the him [104:39] on he would put the [ __ ] here Oh Oh [104:43] what is it [104:45] och you turn this off it was it was it [104:48] was a very violent soul you could put [104:50] the new on and he'd be drinking liquor [104:52] and he's chucking smashing empties to be [104:56] had a bunch of empty Heineken bottles [104:57] he started smashing empties around the [105:00] room [105:00] and he's like singing the hill and he's [105:02] smashing empties and then he starts [105:04] launching them off the third floor onto [105:07] the catwalk down below smash smash smash [105:11] smash they're smoking the barracks but [105:14] Davis always lived smoking with lights [105:17] up a cigarette he smoked in the middle [105:20] of our [ __ ] room just broken Heineken [105:22] bottles everywhere and [ __ ] corporal [105:26] [ __ ] he comes up Cobra more as soon [105:29] as oh do you guys know who's been [105:31] throwing [ __ ] green balls [ __ ] out [105:34] there on the [ __ ] corner like no what [105:45] do

or four times [108:31] during our first dose I got a story for [108:36] you [108:37] ready for this yeah shoot man a story [108:39] let's hear it so during my first four [108:47] years in the Marine Corps I stood tall [108:51] before the man five times four times [108:54] four times four times [108:56] I got a fifth one but that was later on [108:58] as a sergeant [109:00] I was njp non-judicial punishment the [109:05] equivalent to being arrested in the [109:06] civilian world four times [109:09] I got a once in my first four years good [109:11] for you [109:12] I got a JP four times so the thing is so [109:22] I did it [109:22] Oh F 1 & 2 I had gone down range four [109:26] times in my first four so anyway let me [109:31] think about that I dunno af100 here's [109:34] out work do you know what I've wanted to [109:35] with you didn't want to extend my [109:38] contract with one port because we got [109:40] that new command and they were awful [109:42] they were awful I'd already

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 206/468,99 is the [110:36] mos First Sergeant and this [ __ ] Pope [110:39] Air Wing no not even an airway like an [110:43] admin dude like straight-up came in the [110:46] military as an admin dude that was his [110:49] original mos this is a first sergeant [110:50] shows up to be the Bravo Company for [110:53] surgery right after boat like the most [110:57] polar opposite he's like and I'm gonna [110:59] [ __ ] an alpha inspection and [111:02] everyone's got their ribbons on upside [111:03] down [111:04] wrapping cellophane around her fat [111:06] though oh isn't this when Bonita said we [111:10] don't fight wars and alphas yeah like oh [111:13] like it was it was it was mutiny [111:15] it was mutiny why we got I bet that's [111:18] why we got to send two three one he was [111:19] making an example because he's like [111:21] trying to get people to extend their [111:23] contracts to go in that mu coz they were [111:25] to go into Iraq they were going on a mu [111:27] to [ __ ] Japan or some [ __ ] [111:31] Singapore a time somewhere yeah they [111:33] weren't going to combat tour but they [111:34] wanted everyone to go with if you don't [111:40] we're gonna send you to Iraq with three [111:42] one [ __ ] went out and bought three one [111:47] t-shirts and warm to PT well like that [111:50] she won't do it and [ __ ] they put us [111:52] in a box formation that marches down to [111:54] three one my time was up and i reenlist [112:09] it with them so back to the story at [112:13] hand in order to reenlist i had been njp [112:18] a bunch of times [112:20] home when we had gotten home from [112:23] deployments the words that were most [112:25] frequently used to describe they were [112:27] drunk and disorderly and then once an [112:32] authorized absence AKA AWOL I took I [112:35] took a couple I was like a week took a [112:38] week and V time I took a three days of [112:40] me time the time I took a week of me [112:43] time which the military really frowns [112:45] upon when you okay where do you like [112:48] just take a a week just flew in your [112:56] life you know what I mean just try to do [112:57] your thing [112:58] and they're like we we sincerely need [113:01] you [113:01] every day for accountability purposes [113:04] they frown on it so that was one of my [113:07] charges but so anyway but some weirdness [113:10] really but I you're supposed to be if [113:13] you get a JP three times in your first [113:15] floor you're supposed to be processed [113:17] for discharge we're supposed to kick you [113:19] out remember you telling me about this [113:20] under honorable discharge and I [ __ ] [113:26] didn't because I was like thunder bird [113:30] and uh so my [ __ ] had to get signed off [113:37] on by like crazy high-level people like [113:41] oh like high up the chain of command [113:44] just like much it was like a matter of [113:46] waiver so uh I get it I get to go on my [113:50] fourth tour and my fourth tour my old [113:54] company commander is now like on the [113:56] staff of general mattis and they're like [113:59] touring the battlespace and it's that [114:01] Hillary and I was out on patrol I was [114:04] out on patrol doing one thing it was [114:05] Bush days and managed to pop in come [114:07] sleep with everybody on the base and [114:10] this guy knew I was worth three one and [114:13] he's like hey sir I want you to meet [114:15] this guy Friedman through Dever and he's [114:17] like hey where's Friedman at like I want [114:19] to know man it's the same list though [114:21] the his 800k who's accused a captain or [114:25] a major and he was like general mattis I [114:27] want you to meet this guy and he's

general was insisting we got to produce [114:40] whatever it was people were losing their [114:42] shader whatever and then [ __ ] I [114:44] finally get back to base like after [114:46] childhood what the [ __ ] get you two free [114:49] banana combo [114:51] why do you [ __ ] his general manager [114:52] looking for use like I don't [ __ ] [114:56] I just got back from Patrol wouldn't [114:58] really know that well I remember on our [115:05] first deployment general mattis was the [115:07] one who extended us about three times [115:08] the budget oh yeah cuz we were we were [115:13] supposed to after the fighting was [115:16] declared over by bush we were supposed [115:20] to come back president bush we were [115:22] supposed to come back immediately after [115:24] that

don't know but I remember [115:49] the last time that we were supposedly [115:51] the last time we were supposed to see [115:54] general mattis didn't they take our [115:56] weapons they told us not to take our way [116:07] every single time that we are extended [116:11] they would stand in front of us and they [116:13] would say this is an opportunity to show [116:15] your true colors [116:16] yeah no but I'll tell you what I'll tell [116:19] you what you see like you didn't even [116:20] mind after you got done talking to you [116:22] you didn't mind but my also he's a [116:25] badass favorite [ __ ] speech has to be [116:32] what the hell was our first company [116:34] commanders name the big tall he looks [116:38] like the guy that was our company [116:40] commander yeah super troopers no call me [116:43] commander he looks like the guy captain [116:45] Gomez from Super Troopers the guy with [116:47] the mustache thorny or whatever the real [116:49] big talk like he's real tall I remember [116:51] a second one you don't remember her [116:53] first company commander Patton Gomez he [116:56] had a big mustache oh he's great [117:00] well his moto speech after we got [117:03] from the first time and he was already [117:07] sitting down and he's like bring it in [117:08] fellas bring it in and it and we were [117:11] all like bringing it and it looked like [117:13] someone had shot a stone but he was so [117:15] sad and he's like well guys she's like [117:19] we can keep to the nut so many times [117:22] just think it doesn't even really hurt [117:23] anymore huh that's a [ __ ] dance Emoto [117:28] speech right there that's my [ __ ] I [117:31] [ __ ] I dig it brother there's [117:34] sometimes a long way but there's just no [117:36] sugarcoating how shitty everything is [117:40] [ __ ] well there was times when we're on [117:43] posts where we would actually sit down [117:45] and we start to wonder whether or not we [117:47] had died in combat that was the rumor [117:49] yeah yeah [117:50] died in combat and that this was like [117:53] like some lost time [117:56] no what's it called not heaven or hell [117:59] but purgatory root or yes we're in [118:02] purgatory yeah this is never any [118:05] deployment you're sitting down oh I got [118:08] a good story what about the time that we [118:10] got a bottle of vodka from the Polish [118:12] army the boys booze one of my favorite [118:20] stories with the Polish army was we were [118:22] sitting there and I was on post with one [118:25] of the Polish soldiers and basically [118:29] what had happened was he fell asleep so [118:32] he falls asleep on post and one of his [118:34] higher-ups come around the corner and [118:36] I'm sitting there and I see the [118:37] higher-up come around a corner and I [118:39] want to wake the guy up some I feel bad [118:41] that he's gonna end up getting in [118:42] trouble because he fell asleep on post I [118:44] mean we would get our asses lit up if we [118:46] fell asleep on post and he comes around [118:48] and he's sneaking he looks at me and he [118:50] goes and he walks a little closer and [118:53] again I'm feeling bad for the guy who's [118:55] about to get in trouble I should have [118:56] woke him up this is a total Blue Falcon [118:58] is what they call in the military which [119:00] is a buddy [ __ ] Blue Falcon so he goes [119:03] around the corner and as he gets closer [119:05] to him he goes ha and the guy gets scary [119:10] goes [119:11] I got you like they hate each other and [119:14] the guy walks off my mind was blown [119:18] I couldn't believe that a higher up in [119:20] another Armed Forces catches a [119:24] subordinate sleeping scares him they [119:27] laugh it out and he walks away that [119:29] would have been a ninja not an njp but [119:32] you would definitely be in trouble if [119:34] you fall asleep on post and you're in [119:36] the Marine Corps yeah that would not [119:38] have happened with all right exactly [119:44] well that's and I remember when they [119:46] told us they did well remember how they [119:51] told us we couldn't dip on post mm-hmm [119:54] they said we couldn't dip we're smoke [119:56] smoke I understand yeah I guess I can [119:59] get that right yeah well I get it too [120:03] cuz a chair you know but dipping I'm [120:07] looking at on the same well dip and [120:09] keeps me awake yeah you lean back you [120:11] fall asleep in that tobacco slides into [120:13] the back here throw you're gonna wake up [120:15] yeah right so if I'm tired I'm gonna [120:17] fall asleep and my option is fall asleep [120:20] or put it in a dip I'm putting in a dip [120:26] puter spitting everywhere it's cuz the [120:28] post we're turning into these [ __ ] [120:30] gross Ness bitten urine it was like a [120:34] jacket this is potentially the grossest [120:40] place on earth well you Davis had some [120:42] pretty good videos that you made it's [120:45] weird that you would there's a video [120:54] that you're filming of Davis and he's on [120:56] post and he's staying in there and is oh [120:58] my god what happened to all those the [121:02] [ __ ] virus to your damage was [ __ ] [121:05] through such a madman [121:06] he completely [ __ ] to his bottoms off [121:10] like is everything but like sticks out [121:15] just like his bottoms off but then his [121:17] flak his top on his helmet and [ __ ] like [121:20] that [121:21] we had it set up so I'd have him talking [121:23] and then I'd [ __ ] slowly zoom elytis [121:26] like talking means like when you're on [121:28] the post and we're doing this a dealer [121:30] and I slowly it was [ __ ] classic [121:37] humor bed what was funny what he said oh [121:41] yeah like that's it dude that's why I [121:43] love we get together what was great [121:52] about it though was it was almost an [121:54] instructional video when it starts out [121:57] Davis is standing there he says we're [121:59] out here oh yes in the middle of Iraq in [122:01] a combat situation it's a very hostile [122:03] environment we have to maintain constant [122:05] vigilance we have to observe the locals [122:08] to ensure that they're not moving in and [122:09] going to become hostile within our [122:10] situations and to maintain [122:12] professionalism is the most important [122:14] thing that we do out here that's true [122:15] and he aims back in and then it zooms [122:17] out he's naked so or at least from the [122:19] waist down [122:23] whatever or the video where you're [122:29] talking about communicating with the [122:31] locals and you zoom in and you see a [122:34] couple of locals working and you're we [123:04] probably got like ten more minutes what [123:05] was the pour-over story yes [123:11] so so I beat the DMV last week here [123:18] Grenada is on administrative leave [123:22] so I'm set up they just got to me with a [123:25] court date before it expired or the [123:29] statute and I get my first court [123:30] appearance and I documented on Facebook [123:33] I got many pictures and he's shooting up [123:36] cuz I got a couple of fancy shoes you [123:38] did look pretty slick I saw those photos [123:40] that's what I put on the suits and I [123:42] went to go stand before the man so [123:44] number one you ever arrested the first [123:46] thing I'm gonna do is they don't give a [123:48] [ __ ] that's the other thing [123:49] everybody goes then they fine it's been [123:51] so long I finally get my day to court I [123:54] got so many stories they don't want to [123:56] hear [ __ ] [123:57] besides guilty or not guilty and then [124:00] you get a public defender or not you [124:03] have attorney and get a public defender [124:05] that's [ __ ] yet don't give a [ __ ] I [124:08] do that already going in with but almost [124:10] bachelor's of criminal justice so I [124:13] guess it was pointless to shoot the [ __ ] [124:15] up [124:16] but why I least got to meet my apology [124:18] offender because I've been called the [124:20] public defender I've been calling the [124:21] district attorney

Following formal schooling, Ali has studied under some of the top sport dog trainers in the country. In addition, Ali continuously attends various workshops and seminars. Ali has had an affinity for all animals from a young age; however, her love for dogs has always been unparalleled. Ali began her professional training career at just 18, after being asked to join the team of a training company where she had been attending classes with her personal dogs. She enjoyed helping handlers learn how to effectively communicate with their dogs and assist them in their growth as a team. However, she felt that the group class setting did not allow her to assist handlers in an individualized manner, as she would like. Ali's quest for a more personalized program led her to begin her own company. The ability to assist handlers better their relationship with their dogs is a skill Ali prides herself in. In addition to helping others with their pet dogs, Ali participates in various dog sports with her personal dogs. Most prominently, a bitework sport, ""Mondioring,"" with her Belgian Malinois. Ali has competed in Rally, Lure Coursing, Dock diving, and Herding over the years, as well. Currently, Ali is exploring the challenge of high-level Trick Dog Training. Episode 3 of The Nate Schoemer Show we talk about dogs being reactive on leash, behavior modification, problem-solving, working with puppies and much more!

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 213/468,"com/nateschoemer/ === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] [Music] [00:07] what's happening everybody thank you for [00:10] joining me for my third episode of the [00:12] Nate Schumer show this is going to be [00:14] another dog training or dog trainer type [00:17] episode for those of you that are dog [00:18] lovers out there this is gonna be one [00:20] that you will enjoy I'm sitting down [00:22] with my good friend Ali who is a [00:24] fabulous dog trainer I've worked with [00:26] her before I had a great time training [00:28] with her I learned a lot from her so [00:30] we're gonna talk about dog training [00:31] we're gonna talk about some common [00:32] problems that people run into and a [00:34] little bit about the experiences that [00:36] she has had and where she's learned from [00:38] and some of the information that she [00:39] will be able to share with you guys so [00:42] thank you for coming out Ali any time [00:44] any time if you don't mind can you tell [00:47] everybody a little bit about your [00:48] background and where you learned dog [00:49] training from and who you apprenticed [00:51] with and yeah yeah so I got my start in [00:54] dog training through a local kind of [00:57] small [00:58] obedience club type business so they did [01:02] mainly group classes and a few private [01:05] consultations but for the most part it [01:07] was a group class based business from [01:10] then I wanted to kind of expand my [01:12] knowledge and my skill set so I went to [01:14] the Michael Ellis School for dog [01:16] trainers and there I learned under [01:19] Michael Ellis who is one of the most [01:21] prominent dog sport trainer type gurus [01:26] kind of in the country so I learned [01:29] quite a few skills in both just regular [01:31] obedience decoy work sport dog raising [01:35] things of that nature [01:37] from then I from there I went on and I [01:40] learned unpracticed under a couple [01:43] different trainers so I apprenticed [01:44] under a trainer who has a very [01:47] successful dog training business so that [01:49] I was able to learn how to kind of pick [01:52] up a good business model for a pet dog [01:54] training business and implement that [01:57] additionally I have worked under a [01:59] couple of sport dog trainers and I went [02:02] and did an inter internship across the [02:06] country for a couple of months under one [02:08] of the top mondeo rank trainers in the [02:10] country then from there [02:12] I came back to California and I started [02:16] my own dog training company beautiful [02:18] that's a good learning experience to go [02:20] through and some of you probably listen [02:23] to the first episode that I did with [02:24] Bethany and we mentioned Michael Ellis [02:26] so he is a very well-known name within [02:29] the dog trainer dog training industry [02:31] I've learned a lot from him and I never [02:33] had the opportunity to go to school but [02:34] I watched pretty much every single video [02:37] and online training platform that he has [02:39] what was your favorite part about his [02:41] school definitely my favorite part I [02:43] would say actually is when Michael goes [02:44] off into kind of like a tangent so [02:47] sometimes he would start our lesson and [02:48] then he would kind of go off on just a [02:52] random kind of topic or something [02:54] pertaining to dog training and so it was [02:57] really nice to kind of see just that [02:58] like off the wall kind of spontaneous [03:01] thoughts that Michael has those are kind [03:03] of something that I feel like you don't [03:04] get to experience when you watch the [03:06] videos online because they're kind of [03:07] very rehearsed and edited and so it's [03:09] nice to just see him in that casual [03:11] manner I suppose did you do all the [03:14] different courses that he offers cuz he [03:16] breaks it down a little bit different [03:17] than the time Road School where I went [03:19] to school where you just sign up you do [03:20] the professional program and you go [03:22] through it I know he has a course [03:24] specifically focused on protection of [03:26] course that is specifically focused on [03:28] basic obedience and then advanced [03:30] obedience and competition obedience then [03:32] ring sport right yeah he has one for [03:34] almost every single different main [03:36] category yep [03:37] for someone to come down which i think [03:38] is really cool because you know somebody [03:41] who does have a background in training [03:43] might be able just sign up for his ring [03:46] sport course I don't know exactly what [03:47] it's called but you know instead of [03:49] having to do these thing but did you go [03:51] through most of them since you were [03:53] those at the beginning of your career [03:54] mm-hmm I actually went through the [03:56] initial one so I in my understanding is [03:59] that most trainers have to go through [04:00] what's called the obedience intensive [04:02] course so that's a two-week long course [04:05] and in that they kind of focus on the [04:07] very basics of dog training teaching a [04:09] good marker system setting a really good [04:12] foundation for you know like a young [04:14] adult dog or maybe an adult dog that has [04:16] as Green has no training behind them and [04:20] so from there I kind of went and then [04:22] did some internships with people that [04:24] trained and a like-minded [04:26] is Michael so that I was able to further [04:28] my skills in that sense and then I came [04:30] back and did a decoy course so basically [04:32] what a decoy does is they get into the [04:34] big bite suits and the dogs bite them so [04:38] that was a ton of fun and I was able to [04:40] really expand my knowledge and my skill [04:43] set as a decoy for different types of [04:45] dogs and so that was a really good [04:47] learning experience which sports [04:49] specifically were you learning decoy [04:51] working mondeo ring mondeo ring okay and [04:54] so manya ring is a very popular ring [04:58] sport in the United States and it's a [05:01] lot more than you kind of you're being [05:03] humble about it like are you just [05:04] getting a soon you get bit right there's [05:06] so much more to it there's so much [05:08] detail to it you have they have two [05:12] different types of decoys to you know [05:13] you have the helper decoy or not the [05:15] helper decoy but the training decoy and [05:18] then you have the trial decoy yeah you [05:20] know and and the ones who are super [05:21] impressive or the ones who are able to [05:23] do both yes you have a client that gives [05:25] you a call and they're running into some [05:27] sort of issue doesn't matter what it is [05:28] most of the time when a dog trainer [05:30] receives a call I'd say 9 out of 10 [05:33] times it's somebody that has a problem [05:34] right they wait too long they didn't do [05:36] the puppy classes they didn't imprint [05:39] the puppy correctly which we could talk [05:41] about imprinting if you like but they're [05:42] running into issues now that the dogs a [05:44] little bit older maybe the dog is at [05:46] that fear stage right between 7 to 9 [05:48] months or the dog is at the adolescent [05:51] stage or the dog has reached full [05:52] maturity and now they're running into [05:54] different types of issues when you go to [05:56] somebody's house and you're getting [05:58] ready to work with them and do the [05:59] lesson what is your I know you have to [06:02] adjust with each dog I mean there's [06:04] always adjusting and that's that's the [06:05] art of dog training is being able to [06:07] take the science figure out what [06:09] situation is that you're dealing with [06:10] and adjust the science accordingly to be [06:13] most effective for that particular dog [06:14] what is your normal approach though when [06:17] you're working with somebody that has [06:18] any sort of issue again we don't have to [06:20] necessarily talk about that the issue is [06:22] but what is the process that you like to [06:24] do when you first meet a dog and you're [06:26] first working with a dog and not a dog [06:28] that's people aggressive because that's [06:29] one that's gonna change the way you have [06:31] to deal with the dog but a dog that any [06:33] other situation besides people [06:34] aggressive yeah so personally how I like [06:38] to address [06:40] first I'm gonna ask the owner a lot of [06:42] questions so I want to know hey does the [06:44] dog like food as a dog like toys what [06:46] motivates the dog sometimes we have dogs [06:49] that are motivated by nothing that's [06:51] okay we can work with that but most the [06:54] time they say oh yeah Fido loves his [06:56] kibble or Sparky loves to play fetch or [06:59] something of that nature so what I want [07:02] to use those things that motivate the [07:03] dog to help them learn the criteria so [07:08] when we first introduce a criteria to [07:10] the dog I want to be very fair and I [07:12] want to teach them you know what I mean [07:15] through motivators if possible one big [07:18] thing that I actually tell clients is I [07:20] say hey make your dog work for their [07:22] kibble so a lot of people kind of look [07:24] at me funny they're like what do you [07:25] mean like you know my dog just gets the [07:27] food in the bowl however I personally [07:30] think that working a dog for a kibble [07:32] like for kibble in a low distraction [07:34] setting is the best way to kind of help [07:37] create a bond with your dog and then [07:39] also teach them a good work ethic you [07:42] know and I'll tell people hey maybe skip [07:44] one meal if your dog says I'm not [07:46] working for my food that happens quite [07:48] frequently my personal dog sometimes do [07:50] that you know there's so used to the [07:52] food being in the bowl and so if maybe [07:55] let's say we offer the dog food they're [07:57] like no I'm not working for this I say [07:58] hey wait a little bit try again later [08:01] then the dogs gonna say okay now I'm [08:03] willing to work for my food so in this [08:05] way we can use food I like to use food [08:09] more so over toys just because usually [08:11] toys they get really excited and so we [08:13] want them to be in a commerce state of [08:14] mind when we're teaching so usually I [08:16] like to use food and I do what's called [08:18] luring so I want to be able to [08:20] manipulate the dog's head by having them [08:23] follow my hand with food in it and so in [08:27] that way once I control their head I [08:28] control the rest of their body so if I [08:30] move their head up their butt will come [08:31] down into a sit [08:32] if I move their head you know in a [08:35] circle they're gonna spin things of that [08:37] nature so I want to teach the clients [08:39] how to teach their dogs to lure first [08:42] and foremost and then I want to be able [08:44] to use that to teach the dog different [08:46] behaviors so for example pretty much any [08:49] dog with any problem I always want to [08:51] start with like just the general OBD [08:53] because I want to create a good learning [08:55] environment and I want them to know the [08:56] dogs to know that now they have to [08:58] respect their owners and they have to [09:00] work for things that they want so it's [09:03] kind of my very starting procedure is [09:06] usually you know hey they're gonna work [09:08] for their kibble and we're gonna teach [09:10] them just the basic obedience behaviors [09:12] and usually by making them work do you [09:14] find that the dogs end up becoming [09:16] happier because now they almost have a [09:18] job during the day or they have [09:20] something to keep them a little bit more [09:21] occupied than just sitting by the window [09:23] and trying to collect the sunlight [09:24] absolutely and I also find a lot of [09:28] people that have problems maybe let's [09:29] say like digging or barking or things [09:32] like that those problems also very [09:34] largely decrease just by doing very [09:36] simple basic obedience because like you [09:39] said now the dog is being mentally [09:41] stimulated which in my opinion is far [09:44] more important than physically [09:46] stimulating your dog so a lot of people [09:47] say hey I have a dog and I ran it I run [09:49] it five miles a day and he's still crazy [09:51] and I say hey well what training do you [09:53] do oh we don't do anything most times [09:56] when we do an hour lesson the dog is far [09:58] more tired than if they've gone on a [10:00] five-mile run because they're being [10:02] mentally stimulated exactly and that has [10:04] been proven to exhaust a dog yes sir [10:06] than just doing physical exercise alone [10:08] and I like that you said that too though [10:10] because one of my one of the things that [10:12] I agree with Cesar Millan mm-hmm is that [10:16] he often talks about is if we want to [10:19] create a balanced dog we want to make [10:20] sure that they're being stimulated [10:21] mentally physically they're also [10:24] receiving that affection on a regular [10:27] basis so a lot of times some people [10:29] might get the physical side and not the [10:31] mental side absolutely just the [10:33] affection and not the mental so by [10:35] adding all of those it really does help [10:37] create create that stable more balanced [10:40] dog and just by absolutely yeah [10:42] lamenting the obedience so now you have [10:44] the dog you're working with the owner [10:45] you're teaching them those skill sets to [10:46] be able to lure them into different [10:49] positions the dogs starting to [10:50] understand it what's your next step to [10:52] start developing maybe a little more [10:54] reliability or make it more fun or what [10:57] are things that you could do a little [10:58] trick trick of the trade that you might [10:59] have that could benefit somebody yeah so [11:01] one thing that I really like to utilize [11:03] as far as you know without [11:06] to add in a bunch of training tools and [11:08] things of that nature I really like to [11:10] add in a practical rewards and B [11:13] frustrations so a practical reward is [11:16] something where the dog's environment is [11:19] rewarding to them so for example let's [11:21] say that we're teaching the dog a place [11:23] meaning like hey you're gonna go put all [11:25] four feet on your bed I'm gonna teach [11:28] the owners when for me personally some [11:30] people do it differently but for me [11:32] personally I teach the dog all four feet [11:34] go on the bed when the dog chooses to [11:36] lay down we want to mark that moment and [11:38] kind of good job so one really big thing [11:41] that I do cuz I know that a lot of [11:42] people have dogs that jump when you know [11:45] new people come into the door they're [11:46] just frantic everything's like kind of [11:48] chaotic because the dogs are really [11:49] excited so what we want to do is we want [11:51] to teach the dog go to your place as [11:53] soon as that dog shows that they are [11:55] relaxed meaning they choose on their own [11:57] to lay down they kind of maybe like take [11:59] a deep breath like they are showing that [12:01] they are now moving into a calmer kind [12:04] of state of mind I tell them now release [12:06] the dog to go say hi so the dog hasn't [12:09] gotten any food any rewards their reward [12:11] is getting to go say hi to guests [12:13] because they have to like chose to relax [12:17] so in that way we're giving the dog the [12:19] decision and most times the dog start to [12:22] relax fairly quickly because they learn [12:24] this is what gets me to go say hi to [12:26] guests the other thing I really like to [12:29] utilize is frustration so especially [12:31] with recalls I love love restrained [12:33] recall so basically what that entails is [12:36] we put the dog on a harness if we don't [12:38] have a harness available I just say to [12:40] hold them around their chest so one [12:41] person holds the dog and one person is [12:43] gonna call the dog the person that's [12:45] holding the dog their only job is to [12:47] hold the dog back and then let them go [12:48] when the person the caller says the [12:51] dog's name and come or just the dog's [12:52] name depending on where we are in [12:54] training the collar is gonna show them [12:57] some food or maybe a toy or maybe even [12:59] just themselves if that the dog is [13:01] really motivated by their person and [13:03] they're gonna run away so this creates a [13:05] lot of freshman like frustration and [13:07] tension for the dog because they can't [13:08] immediately go to their owners and so [13:10] that gets them really amped up and [13:12] excited when you finally let them go [13:14] they're gonna rock it right to their [13:16] owners because you know they've kind of [13:17] been held back and have some frustration [13:19] now [13:20] so I like to use those things to build [13:21] kind of excitement for doing the [13:24] behaviors that can help with speed as [13:26] well exactly right now you have a really [13:29] nice fast recall and your friends are [13:30] asking you how the heck do you get your [13:32] dog to come to you so fast yep [13:33] I added value to it that's exactly what [13:35] I did you know and another thing that [13:38] people will run into is from maybe [13:41] trying to do a recall in the wrong [13:43] situation yeah you know if you're [13:45] talking about doing it in a controlled [13:46] environment now you have somebody where [13:48] they're trying to call their dog but [13:51] they haven't done any of the training [13:52] and the dog is now interacting with [13:54] another dog or interacting with the [13:55] person and they're trying to call their [13:57] dog and they're wondering why the dogs [13:58] not listening and now the dog is [14:00] learning not to listen because they [14:02] didn't set the dog up for success [14:04] exactly that's another big thing that I [14:06] talk to my clients about is management [14:08] so while we're in the process of [14:11] training I say that management is key so [14:13] for example just like you said not [14:15] asking your dog to come in a situation [14:17] where they probably are not going to [14:19] come if they're with another dog or you [14:22] know they're saying hello to their most [14:24] favorite person and then you say come [14:26] chances are the dogs gonna ignore you [14:28] and like you said now the dog is [14:30] learning oh I can just ignore this [14:32] command so in cases like that I tell my [14:35] clients that they should have a [14:37] different word that's more casual so [14:40] especially with the recall so when I say [14:42] come to my dogs that means coming to my [14:44] space and sit if I say let's go that [14:47] means just kind of be near me and like [14:50] keep coming with me so that's a good way [14:53] to kind of like get your dog's attention [14:54] but not using our calm word so that we [15:00] don't get them you know kind of used to [15:01] ignoring that command yeah exactly and [15:04] we have a dog that I'm kind of bouncing [15:07] around a little bit here but a dog that [15:08] is maybe reactive on the leash and we're [15:13] trying to work with that so we want to [15:15] implement all the obedience the [15:17] communication the Lori and everything [15:19] you talked about before and then also [15:21] adding the leash pressure we take the [15:23] dog on a walk and this just popped in my [15:26] head and often I don't think about it [15:28] until I'm actually in the situation [15:29] working with the person and their dog [15:32] a lot of times people want to allow [15:34] their dogs to smell whatever they want [15:37] to pee on whatever they want to do all [15:39] these different things and they say well [15:41] it's a dog shouldn't the dog be a dog [15:42] and and what's difficult about that is [15:45] there's like this balancing act because [15:47] yeah we want the dog to be able to go to [15:49] the bathroom we want the dog to be loved [15:50] do things however if the dog learns that [15:55] if I'm in a heel position and I just [15:57] decide to go off and smell the flowers [15:59] or pee on something they're instantly [16:01] breaking the heel position and they [16:03] learn that that's okay what are ways [16:06] that people can use maybe a formal [16:08] command but then also implement an [16:10] informal like you're saying with the [16:12] let's go to make it to where they can [16:14] play a clean balance to where it's clear [16:16] to the dog but they're not allowing the [16:18] dog to not listen to them in a sense by [16:21] breaking the command by doing something [16:22] like peeing on a tree so it's funny that [16:25] you actually mentioned that because I [16:26] just posted something on my facebook [16:28] about this that exact scenario so [16:32] basically what I like to do for my [16:35] personal clients is I want the dog to [16:37] have a formal command like you said that [16:39] means hey you're gonna be walking next [16:40] to me and there's no sniffing where [16:44] we're not peeing on things we are purely [16:47] walking right now when I stop you sit [16:48] you're you have a job to do however I [16:52] tell clients especially in the beginning [16:53] when we're first starting this give the [16:56] dog breaks so I think I had mentioned it [16:58] earlier maybe I like every command that [17:01] I do to have a beginning and an end so [17:03] the end is gonna be a specific word that [17:05] means now you're done doing whatever the [17:06] command was whether it's a sit or a [17:09] place or appeal or anything like that [17:11] like a release word or yeah exactly so a [17:15] release word I use the word release for [17:19] my clients so it's make things simple so [17:22] you know let's say the dog is in a heel [17:24] position and they're being super great [17:26] they're rock stars it's awesome and you [17:29] can kind of sense the dog shirt make it [17:30] a little bit agitated maybe like they [17:32] want to go sniff or something like that [17:33] once the dog has proven that they have [17:36] been doing a good job and you know you [17:38] can end things on a good note I tell [17:40] clients to release your dog for a couple [17:41] minutes let them sniff the grass then [17:43] maybe let them go to the bathroom do [17:44] whatever they need to do [17:46] you could even maybe walk them like that [17:47] for a block if it's not too you know [17:49] much of an inconvenience for you and [17:51] then call the dog back into the heel [17:53] position and keep walking so in this way [17:55] they get kind of what I like to call [17:56] like brain breaks where they don't have [17:58] to be focused on being right in this [18:00] position sitting when you stop like it's [18:02] kind of they have a chance to sniff and [18:05] do whatever but still you know we're [18:07] coming back to that hey now we're [18:09] there's gonna be control and we're gonna [18:10] continue walking nicely I have another [18:13] question to add to that okay and this is [18:15] actually a question that was asked that [18:17] wanted to be addressed I take my dog out [18:19] on walks and when I'm getting back to [18:22] the house my dog always pulls like crazy [18:25] to the house my dog walks nice when [18:27] we're on the walks but once I'm headed [18:28] back to the house and my dog knows I'm [18:30] headed back to the house they pull on [18:32] the leash there choking themselves out [18:33] how can I fix this problem so this was a [18:36] question that I that was recently asked [18:38] so hopefully they listened to this [18:40] episode but how would you fix something [18:41] like that a dog that walks fine but for [18:44] some reason we're going back to the [18:45] house it's it's choking its way back to [18:47] the house okay yeah so that's actually [18:49] super common so dogs are very good at [18:52] recognizing patterns and dogs know when [18:56] you know if we walk the same block or [18:59] the same circle every single time they [19:02] know when they're going home and so this [19:04] is a very common problem even like [19:06] myself as a kid I remember our childhood [19:07] dog doing stuff like that [19:10] so what we want to do is we want to [19:12] break the pattern so for example let's [19:16] say that there's an alternative route to [19:18] go back to the house I say hey take that [19:20] route maybe once twice and then the [19:23] third time we're gonna go the normal [19:25] route or alternatively if there's only [19:27] one route back to the home taking the [19:30] dog and let's say you know they are [19:32] starting to pull alright well now we're [19:34] going the opposite direction so I want [19:36] the dog to know that that behavior is [19:38] not what's going to get them to back to [19:40] their house is not going to get them to [19:41] the end goal so I'm gonna do whatever it [19:43] takes whether that's turning around and [19:45] walking 15 circles before I go back to [19:47] the house or you know maybe we get [19:51] three-quarters of the way to the house [19:52] and we're gonna just walk right past the [19:55] house just whatever it is that kind of [19:58] throws the dog for a [19:59] so that they kind of get out of that [20:01] cycle in that pattern of learning hey [20:03] you know if I pull this takes me [20:06] directly back to the home so kind of [20:08] breaking that cycle so understanding [20:12] patterns I love it yeah and that's [20:13] something that a lot of people do it's [20:15] it's it's why a dog if somebody tells [20:17] them to sit the dog sits lays down and [20:20] rolls over yep why is the dog doing that [20:22] because they said sit lay down roll over [20:24] a hundred times yep the dog figures it [20:26] out and starts to just do it now you can [20:28] use patterns right in a good way to [20:31] where it could help teach a dog the [20:32] behavior for example I love using [20:34] pattern training to teach the automatic [20:36] sit one halted yes I'll take five steps [20:38] stop stop and sit the dog five steps [20:40] stop and set the dog five steps stop and [20:42] sit the dog and yeah you know and I'll [20:45] mix it up a little bit too because then [20:46] you're gonna have a dog who's sitting at [20:47] five steps yes I'm trying to continue to [20:49] walk if I don't do it but that helps [20:50] really teach the automatic sit one [20:52] halted but times where patterns could be [20:54] bad what people run into which would is [20:56] one of the worst ones for you or [20:57] somebody does a pattern unintentionally [21:00] and because of that it creates some [21:02] problems in the training if you're not [21:03] thinking oh the one I'm thinking of I'll [21:05] tell you it but I'm kind of curious to [21:07] see which one you you see me personally [21:11] well as far as my clients go the one [21:14] that I personally see a lot of is when [21:16] we're doing leash walking actually they [21:18] only reward their dog when they stop and [21:20] the dog sits so the dog says why should [21:23] I walk nicely when I only get rewarded [21:26] when we stop and say so they stopped [21:28] beautifully and they sit wonderfully but [21:31] the space in between is a little iffy [21:33] not as good as it could be yeah because [21:36] the dog is now seeking out the scent to [21:39] get the reward instead of the nice walk [21:40] exactly I've actually seen that quite a [21:42] bit with competition level tracking yes [21:45] people will teach the dogs that they get [21:47] the reward at the articles [21:48] right for article indication and [21:50] basically you know those of you that do [21:53] not do any sort of competitive obedience [21:55] there's a sport called shits and at [21:56] least it's known as shits and it's [21:57] called IPO now but it's broken down to [22:00] three parts tracking protection and [22:02] obedience and on the tracking the dogs [22:04] have to walk basically a perfect track [22:06] where the human walked prior to them and [22:08] there's little articles on the ground [22:10] and the dogs have to indicate on these [22:11] articles by either sitting or laying [22:12] down [22:13] long story short the trainer's will [22:15] reward the dogs only at the articles at [22:17] least a lot of trainers that I worked [22:18] with and then you have a dog who's [22:19] rushing just to get to that article [22:22] instead of effectively tracking which [22:25] can create issues the one that I see a [22:28] lot is people putting their dog in a [22:31] down or a sit or a climb in fact a good [22:34] friend of mine who I trained with for a [22:36] while as well her name's Ashley what she [22:39] used to tell people was if you can't [22:41] touch your pup don't free them up which [22:43] I thought was kind of cute it's a good [22:44] way to remember it because what happens [22:46] is a lot of times I'm sure you've seen [22:48] it people put their dogs in a stay they [22:50] walk 20 feet away they call their dog [22:52] yep they put their dog in a stay they [22:54] walk 20 feet away the dog breaks the [22:56] position and they wonder why their dog [22:57] broke the position because they started [22:59] to create a pattern where the dog goes [23:00] once or 20 feet away you release me so [23:03] and the dog jumps up and releases [23:05] themselves yep quite a bit and the [23:08] easiest way to fix it would be basically [23:11] just burying it breaking the pattern so [23:13] you walk away you come back to your dog [23:15] I tell my clients when we're working on [23:17] sits downs or you know places or climbs [23:21] that hey you walk 20 feet away and you [23:24] come back to your dog every single time [23:27] maybe one out of 20 of those times we [23:30] can recall the dog but other than that [23:32] don't recall them because like you said [23:34] that's very very common and so you get [23:37] far enough away and they say great now [23:39] it's party time I'm coming over maybe we [23:42] didn't want that it can be downright [23:44] dangerous in some situations like if you [23:46] let's say you put them in a sit and you [23:47] go across the street or something so we [23:49] want to be really sure that we make sure [23:51] to not have that particular pattern [23:53] where we walk away and the dog just [23:55] flies on over yeah and going back to the [23:58] trainer that I was telling you about [23:59] before we said if you can't touch your [24:00] pup don't free them up that is the rule [24:03] that you would give them for like the [24:04] first couple weeks yeah because of [24:05] course we still want an effective recall [24:07] exactly but we just don't want to teach [24:09] the dog said they can break once you're [24:11] you know however many feet away now when [24:14] it comes to working with a dog and [24:15] adding Corrections I like how when we [24:17] were talking at the beginning you talked [24:19] all about using luring effectively [24:21] communicating with the dog there's [24:24] probably been times where it's been [24:25] three months before you even added a [24:26] crack [24:27] because your puppy imprinting your [24:29] training this dog for competitive [24:30] obedience or whatever what is the most [24:33] common if you are using a form of [24:35] correction when does the correction [24:37] usually start let's say basic pet [24:39] obedience and that's if you're doing [24:42] Corrections cuz I've worked with some [24:43] people where they said I don't want my [24:45] dog to be correct and I say no problem [24:47] absolutely you're not gonna make anybody [24:48] correct their dog yep [24:50] it's your dog you determine what you [24:52] want same thing if somebody says can my [24:56] dog come on the couch can my dog jump on [24:58] the bed can your dog yeah you know I [25:01] really liked what Bethany said on my [25:03] first episode she goes it's not a [25:05] problem until it's a problem yeah right [25:07] and yeah you're letting your dog jump on [25:09] the couch and there's no issues but if [25:11] your dog starts resourcing the couch [25:12] resource guarding side of the couch then [25:14] it can become a problem I'm totally good [25:17] with that because I don't want to make [25:18] somebody use a tool that makes them [25:20] uncomfortable so I want them to feel [25:23] comfortable training their dog and I [25:25] want them to enjoy it and just like you [25:27] said as well about you know I don't [25:30] there's no universal set of being a good [25:32] dog owner if your dog goes on the couch [25:34] it's on a problem great my dogs sleep in [25:36] bed with me sometimes that's how like [25:38] you know they enjoy it I enjoy it it's [25:40] not a problem [25:43] so I you know same thing as you like I [25:44] tell people yeah your dog can go on the [25:47] couch sure like no problem if it's [25:49] creating problems then we should address [25:52] that but otherwise it's not really you [25:54] know you're not a bad dog owner for [25:56] letting your dog up on the couch or your [25:58] bed or anything like that there are [26:00] things you know we introduced pressure [26:02] for me personally I introduced pressure [26:04] to a dog I tried to wait as long as [26:07] possible but it really depended on the [26:09] situation so you know I have a very very [26:13] very great client they're excellent and [26:15] their dog is a lab a young lab year old [26:19] and she was jumping and just being a [26:22] wild animal and her owner had gotten a [26:25] hip replacement so that is absolutely [26:27] not acceptable for her to be jumping [26:29] because she could really hurt him so in [26:31] that case we moved to a pressure you [26:34] know a little bit quicker than maybe if [26:35] it was just like a single you know young [26:39] person who's [26:40] yeah whatever the dog can jump on me I [26:41] don't really care so in that you know in [26:44] that sense I think it just kind of is [26:46] dependent on the owner the dog as far as [26:49] when we introduce pressure yeah and [26:51] that's all that art that we were talking [26:53] about being able to figure out with each [26:54] dog and which motivating factor is going [26:56] to work best you know and before you [26:59] said that you prefer using food instead [27:02] of toys in the beginning when's a good [27:05] time that somebody could use toys or [27:07] start to introduce toys within their dog [27:10] training as the reward if they no longer [27:11] want to use food when would be a good [27:13] transition for somebody to make that [27:15] yeah so what I tell people too is it's [27:18] very dependent on the actual exercise so [27:22] like for example I think that adding [27:24] toys isn't is a great way to add another [27:27] level of control per se to your training [27:29] so if a dog really loves to fetch their [27:33] ball they're gonna be in a much kind of [27:35] crazier higher drive state of mind when [27:37] we're throwing the ball if you can get [27:39] your dog to sit and remain seated until [27:41] you release them to throw the ball I [27:44] think that's a mark of a very good [27:45] trainer so what I tell people is once [27:47] your stuff is really really reliable [27:49] with food and in higher distraction [27:52] areas that's a good time to start [27:54] implementing toys and it's super easy to [27:56] do like I just said you could be playing [27:58] fetch with your dog you know maybe your [28:00] dog brings the ball back one time and [28:02] you stop and you say sit and you might [28:04] have to wait a minute because your dog [28:06] is probably gonna be really amped up [28:07] really confused like I've never been [28:09] asked to do this before the moment they [28:11] sit either yes and throw the ball or [28:13] whatever they're released word is and [28:14] throw the ball and I think that's a [28:16] great way for the dogs to learn hey even [28:18] when I'm in a heightened state of mind I [28:20] still need to pay attention and listen [28:22] to commands taking something like fetch [28:24] and making it a training opportunity [28:26] exactly what about somebody who has a [28:29] dog that likes to play fetch but they [28:31] can't get the dog to bring the ball back [28:33] to them and they're having trouble [28:35] getting the dog to out what's one of the [28:37] best ways you've seen with a dog that's [28:39] you know happy-go-lucky lab that wants [28:41] to play fetch but also loves to hold on [28:43] to that ball and doesn't want to bring [28:44] it back what's a good setup that you do [28:46] to help teach or help somebody to teach [28:48] their dog how to bring it back to them [28:50] how to release it so they can actually [28:51] play the game yeah so I'm [28:54] of dogs do like to play fetch but they [28:56] don't know the rules and so you know [28:58] that's something that a lot of people [28:59] run into like you mentioned so to help [29:01] teach the dog the game what I like to do [29:04] is I like to have multiples of whatever [29:06] the toy is so if we're talking about [29:07] fetch maybe I'll have 10 tennis balls [29:10] not where the dog can access them [29:13] they're gonna be on me on my person and [29:16] I produce one I throw it the dog goes [29:18] and gets it maybe they're kind of laying [29:20] on the outskirts playing keep-away [29:21] they're not really sure I'm gonna put [29:24] another ball back in like either my hand [29:26] or the chuck it or whatever I'm using [29:28] and I'm gonna say hey this ball is way [29:29] better because now I'm making it move [29:31] I'm making it exciting this is where the [29:33] exciting thing is when they come back [29:35] towards me I'm gonna throw it hey now [29:37] you get this ball they're gonna drop the [29:40] ball that's in their mouth but it's no [29:41] longer a thing of value and so kind of [29:43] playing to toy in that way that hey you [29:45] trade me you drop this one and I'll give [29:48] you this one [29:48] I love value transfer and then using the [29:51] prey drive to get them to go after the [29:53] other one because the one becomes boring [29:55] and that's something that a lot of [29:56] competitive dog trainers will do is they [29:59] try to teach the dog that the toy or [30:02] whatever it is is more fun when it's [30:04] with the human instead of running and [30:07] just playing with the toy by themselves [30:09] yep [30:10] what are some other common playthings [30:12] that you can think of that somebody [30:14] might want to do with their dog but the [30:15] dog just doesn't know the rules a lot of [30:17] times I see tugging dogs aren't really [30:19] sure about the rules of tugging I love [30:22] to play tug with my dogs [30:24] well tugging make a dog aggressive no no [30:27] that's a very that is a common [30:29] misconception that I have heard no it [30:32] has nothing to do with aggression or [30:35] anything like that it's it's just a game [30:37] and the dogs like to play tag I think [30:41] it's a really great way to bond with [30:43] your dog because it like you said it [30:45] makes the playing very personal to you [30:47] so it makes you the bringer of the good [30:49] things a little bit more personal [30:51] personable I think than just throwing a [30:53] ball or you know maybe like giving them [30:56] a toy and then going and sitting on the [30:57] couch so a lot of dogs don't really know [31:00] how to play tug correctly and I think [31:02] the reason for that is a lot of times [31:04] people think tug means you rip the rope [31:06] out of their mouth [31:07] now you've won it and this is how we [31:09] play tug this is not fun for the dog so [31:12] if you think about it if you were racing [31:14] somebody let's say someone challenged [31:16] you to a fun racing match and they beat [31:19] you 10 out of 10 times and they said [31:21] let's do it again you'd probably say no [31:23] because this is not fun anymore [31:24] you've never won you've never even [31:26] gotten close to winning why would you [31:27] want to continue to play this game so I [31:30] tell people when you're playing tug with [31:32] your dog let them win occasionally let [31:34] them you know gloat and have their [31:36] little thing and kind of like call them [31:38] back to you to reengage with the toy [31:41] that's the most important part so a lot [31:43] of times dogs will win it and they'll [31:44] run away we want to teach them come back [31:46] here because I'm gonna continue playing [31:49] the game with you as soon as you [31:50] reengage with me so a good way to do [31:52] that is with the to toy you know having [31:55] another child to play with them or some [31:58] dogs even if you just kind of get their [31:59] attention maybe run backwards a little [32:01] bit make yourself exciting they'll come [32:03] back and re-engage with that toy I'm so [32:05] happy you said that because I was [32:07] literally gonna say something about I [32:09] was gonna ask you so is it good to show [32:11] the dog that you're the stronger one by [32:13] ripping the toy away from them which a [32:15] lot of people do you know and for some [32:17] reason people look at dogs so [32:19] differently than kids and I know we [32:21] talked about being anthropomorphic and [32:23] anthropomorphic being anthropomorphic is [32:26] not a good thing however there are some [32:29] things I'm it's it's like a balance [32:31] though because the analogy that I'm [32:34] trying to make is people will have a new [32:36] infant toddler right the toddler just [32:38] starts to walk around the house and [32:40] they're following the toddler everywhere [32:42] Yeah right they're making sure that they [32:43] don't touch the outlet that they don't [32:45] touch something that could be sharp or [32:47] whatever they're they're making sure [32:48] that the child is safe then they get a [32:50] puppy and they let the puppy do whatever [32:51] they want the house and world why the [32:53] puppy peed on the floor and chewed the [32:54] furniture and ripped up the trash can [32:56] yeah and drink out of toilet bowl right [32:57] we need to address the same way but the [33:00] same thing if I'm if if I'm working with [33:02] a young kid and I'm trying to teach that [33:05] kid a sport maybe or if I'm doing [33:07] martial arts with that kid I'm not gonna [33:09] just throw them down and put them in an [33:11] armbar every single time they're not [33:13] gonna want to play and people are so [33:15] confused why oh my dog doesn't want to [33:17] play when I'm showing them how big and [33:19] tough I am [33:19] no show the [33:21] how big and tough they are yeah and [33:23] that's something I try to push on people [33:25] as well because if you have a dog that [33:26] is really confident and really does [33:28] believe that they're super capable you [33:30] end up having a dog that's not [33:32] aggressive yeah because they don't have [33:34] those fear issues that can be developed [33:36] by trying to create that submissive dog [33:38] which makes me think of something what [33:40] is your thought on the whole concept of [33:43] creating a submissive dog that's [33:45] something people hear quite often [33:47] so I hear I also hear that a lot as a [33:49] dog trainer is having submission [33:52] submissive dog or asserting yourself as [33:54] an alpha or things of that nature so as [33:58] most dog trainers know the Alpha theory [34:00] was debunked pretty shortly after it was [34:04] actually created so the person who made [34:07] it when my understanding was that he [34:09] studied wolves in a type of situation [34:12] that wasn't necessarily like a wild [34:14] population it wasn't mimicked exactly to [34:17] how wolves are in the wild so he [34:19] published a book and he's basically like [34:21] hey you know there's alphas and there's [34:24] betas and and you know one of them kind [34:27] of rules them all and that thing and so [34:29] some dog trainers except took that [34:31] theory and said okay the same thing [34:33] applies to domesticated dogs and so now [34:37] we have this widespread theory that you [34:39] need to like shove your dog to the floor [34:41] or make them roll over on their back or [34:43] kind of silly notions like that to prove [34:46] that you are the Alpha of your dog [34:49] whereas you know we would both know that [34:52] that isn't true [34:53] and there's actually a pretty funny bit [34:55] if you're listening to this go to [34:57] YouTube and pull up Adam ruins [34:59] everything Elfa alpha wolf it's it's [35:02] pretty funny now the thing with it is [35:04] there are some dogs within a group that [35:06] will seem to present the alpha type [35:10] behaviors and so it's not saying it's [35:12] just it's more about how we define the [35:14] word alpha and what I've noticed and you [35:17] probably notice the same thing if you [35:19] have a family that has multiple dogs [35:21] which one doesn't matter size or [35:24] anything but which one tends to be the [35:27] one that would present themselves as the [35:29] alpha I'm usually the dog that's been [35:32] there the longest yeah [35:34] yeah that's exactly right and that's how [35:36] they do it it's more about it's the same [35:38] structure that we have as humans you [35:41] know the grandparents are kind of the [35:42] most senior and then the parents and [35:44] then the kids and they usually fall [35:46] under that structure but what are some [35:47] of the bad things that may develop from [35:50] somebody who is using some of these [35:53] techniques and trying to be the alpha [35:55] and alpha rowing their dog or trying to [35:57] make their dog submit yeah no definitely [35:59] well I have actually seen it depends you [36:02] know kind of what the issues are that [36:03] the people are experiencing in their [36:05] home but first and foremost you can ruin [36:07] your relationship with your dog you know [36:09] the dog doesn't understand if you roll [36:12] them onto their back on the floor they [36:14] don't they don't get it they don't [36:16] understand that this is you somehow [36:17] asserting yourself over them they're [36:20] just scared so a lot of times people [36:22] unintentionally ruin their relationship [36:24] with their dog and then also create [36:25] unclear communication with their dogs [36:27] because the dog is kind of you know [36:29] maybe our rules and our boundaries are a [36:31] little loose and so suddenly we get [36:33] really angry and we quote/unquote assert [36:35] ourselves as alpha and now the dog [36:37] saying hey what did I do wrong I don't [36:39] know I have no under I no understanding [36:41] of this additionally if dogs that have [36:45] aggression or reactivity or things of [36:48] that nature a lot of times it can worsen [36:50] the problem because we're not actually [36:52] getting to the root of the issue or just [36:54] kind of maybe mitigating some surface [36:56] level kind of issues or symptoms right [37:01] so of a dog I've seen this before [37:02] especially living up in LA as long as I [37:05] lived up there being at a dog park or [37:07] something like that somebody's dog might [37:08] get a little excited they take the dog [37:10] hold it down for a couple seconds which [37:12] yeah sure it stops the dog from being [37:13] excited in that moment in time but the [37:15] minute they let the dog back up or the [37:16] second rather the dogs doing exactly [37:18] what it was doing before yeah it's not [37:20] teaching anything and it's not clear [37:22] communication and that's something that [37:23] in my opinion is probably one of the [37:26] most important things is clear [37:28] communication and how can people become [37:31] a little bit more clear with their dogs [37:32] what are some of the mistakes that you [37:33] see is most common where people are [37:37] unintentionally confusing the heck out [37:39] of their dogs yeah well unfortunately it [37:42] happens quite frequently because we love [37:45] our dogs and as we should you know dogs [37:47] are really great [37:48] and so there's a reason that they're [37:49] called man's best friend so the problem [37:53] that comes with that is that we tend to [37:56] treat our dogs like humans and so in [37:58] this sense we talk to them like people [38:01] we give them quote-unquote timeouts or [38:03] warnings or things like that dogs don't [38:06] understand that so they need a really [38:08] black-and-white picture of this is wrong [38:10] this is right if we allow them to make [38:13] their own decisions sometimes they'll [38:15] make a good choice and sometimes they'll [38:16] make a bad choice but if we have no way [38:18] to let them know that they're doing [38:20] right or wrong they're gonna be [38:22] incredibly confused so a lot of times [38:24] what I see is people will let something [38:27] slide for maybe five six seven times [38:30] then the eighth time now this is really [38:32] annoying this is really bad so we're [38:33] gonna have a huge correction whether [38:35] that be with our voice or you know [38:37] pinning them on the ground or whatever [38:40] people do commonly and now the dog is [38:43] confused because they they were allowed [38:45] to get away with it the first seven [38:47] times so why now on the eighth time is [38:49] this a problem such as jumping up on [38:51] somebody or maybe jumping up on the [38:52] furniture [38:53] yeah they allow it for a long time then [38:55] they get frustrated one day or maybe [38:56] they have nice clothes on exactly the [38:58] dog jumps up and now they get mad and [39:00] they just confused the heck out of their [39:01] dog yep it's something that was [39:04] requested on the last podcast that I did [39:08] was to talk a little bit about leash [39:11] reactivity so we didn't address that [39:13] very much on my first episode and I [39:14] think that would be good to talk about [39:15] because it is a really big problem that [39:17] people have and I'm sure it's something [39:19] that multiple clients of yours have [39:21] asked you for help to fix so what is [39:24] what what's the most common thing that [39:25] you see with people that have dogs that [39:27] are leash reactive and what are some of [39:29] the best solutions in order to help fix [39:31] it or make it a little bit smaller than [39:34] what it is yeah so you're right I do see [39:36] a lot of people that have dogs with [39:38] least reactivity I'd probably say the [39:40] most common breeds are like golden slabs [39:42] Shepherds they're dogs that may not [39:45] necessarily be aggressive but are very [39:47] overly friendly so the one thing that I [39:50] see is that a lot of people have dogs [39:52] the dogs develop or come to them with [39:56] leash reactivity and they assume that [39:58] the dog is aggressive most [40:01] the time this isn't the case they're not [40:03] aggressive with other dogs there's just [40:05] a lot of tension and excitement going on [40:07] within them when they see another dog so [40:10] I think one mistake that people make is [40:13] a not trusting their dog so then they [40:15] say hey like I've never let my dog play [40:17] with another dog I've never let my dog [40:19] see another dog anything like that [40:20] because they think that now this is [40:23] aggression that being said not saying [40:26] that you should just walk up if your dog [40:27] is barking and growling you shouldn't [40:29] just be like Oh fluffy wants to come say [40:30] hi and walk right up to the other dog [40:33] but you know I think that most of my [40:36] leash reactivity cases are dogs that are [40:38] very very friendly and that's where the [40:40] reactivity comes from so it's not always [40:42] based an aggression per se as far as [40:45] mitigating leash reactivity if you have [40:49] a very food motivated dog you can [40:51] definitely teach them engagement so hey [40:54] like when you look at me you get food [40:56] but it takes a lot of the owner being [40:59] very observant so before the dog sees [41:01] the other dog coming the owner ideally [41:03] will be saying hey look at me here's [41:05] some food good job the problem with that [41:08] is if your dog a isn't food motivated or [41:11] B is more interested in the other dog [41:14] now you're gonna have a problem so this [41:16] is kind of where we need to explore the [41:20] other quadrants of kind of learning [41:23] theory and start to use maybe a little [41:26] leash pressure [41:27] would you mind defining leash pressure [41:30] yeah so leash pressure is basically [41:33] teaching the dog that hey the leash is [41:35] going to get tight or there will be [41:37] tension on the leash for whatever reason [41:41] maybe the dog decides hey I don't want [41:42] to walk anymore and I'm going to plant [41:44] my feet in the ground or I'm gonna start [41:46] so their dog or whatever once the dog [41:49] comes with the pressure meaning that [41:51] they step forward into the leash [41:52] creating slack then that the [41:54] quote-unquote pressure turns off so [41:56] they're they're learning here that [41:58] there's a mild discomfort of feeling [42:00] maybe like leash or the collar around [42:02] their neck or the leash tighten and then [42:04] it stops once they move into that [42:06] pressure and that means the leash can [42:08] become a form of communication to the [42:10] dog one more tool to add to your [42:12] repertoire in order to effectively and [42:15] merely communicate which we already [42:16] noted is one of the biggest problems [42:18] that a lot of people run into so a lot [42:20] of times for leash reactivity we can use [42:23] you know a leash to either a guide our [42:26] dog away from the situation or be even [42:29] doing like some small leash pops which [42:32] would mean basically you let the leash [42:33] get a little slack and then give it just [42:35] a little tug to kind of snap the dog out [42:37] of that mine state of being kind of [42:40] hectic and really frantic looking at the [42:42] other dog and kind of starting to bark [42:44] or putting their hackles up or things of [42:45] that nature [42:46] what it would be the next step if the [42:48] leash pressure isn't working if you keep [42:50] pulling the dog back and the dog stops [42:52] for a second that runs back the end [42:53] leash and continues to bark what I like [42:57] that you're saying earlier is is in a [42:58] way finding something that the dog wants [43:01] and then using that as a tool to get the [43:04] dog to do it you want but it's very [43:05] difficult if the dog really just wants [43:08] the dog in front of them yeah so how [43:10] could you use the dog in front of them [43:11] in an effective way to help teach the [43:14] dog not to pull so if the dog in front [43:18] of you know let's say that we know both [43:20] dogs in this scenario and both dogs are [43:23] friendly or you know we know that this [43:25] is a controlled situation one potential [43:29] way it would be you know we give some [43:30] leash pressure once the dog is maybe [43:32] engaged with us or just gives us a [43:34] second of looking at us and hey now you [43:36] know you're paying attention to me and I [43:38] enjoy you know that you're giving me [43:40] attention you're following the leash [43:42] pressure we could let the dogs meet or [43:46] say hello to kind of get a you know some [43:48] of that reactivity the tension and stuff [43:50] like that kind of move away from that [43:52] it's beautiful yes so it's exactly what [43:55] I was hoping you would say no no yes so [44:03] what we're doing in a situation like [44:04] that because it's a technique that I use [44:06] as well and I like the use of controlled [44:09] environment cuz that's something that a [44:10] lot of people don't do is they will not [44:12] rehearse situations that they want their [44:15] dog to act a certain way No you know [44:17] that was a great a great analogy that I [44:19] would use when I was in LA is I'd say [44:20] it's like theater you know somebody's [44:23] gonna perform in front of an audience [44:24] they don't just step up day one [44:27] and hope to be able to perform and do it [44:28] perfectly they rehearse every single day [44:30] so when that day comes they know exactly [44:32] what to do and we need to do the exact [44:34] same thing with our dogs we need to set [44:36] them up in scenarios that we want them [44:37] to perform a certain way whether it's [44:39] people coming over or going out on a [44:40] walk yeah so taking you know a friend [44:43] that has a dog that is more calm and [44:45] relaxed and using that dog as a tool to [44:48] teach yours hey if you're sitting down [44:49] and you're relaxing or you're not [44:51] getting overly excited we'll slowly [44:53] start to move towards the other dog but [44:54] the second you get crazy you don't move [44:56] yeah so it's that simple concept of [44:58] cause and effect and it's beautiful it [45:00] works amazingly and what are some of the [45:02] biggest problems that you have seen with [45:04] dogs that develop fear issues based on [45:07] some of the bad things or accidental [45:09] things that someone may do yeah I [45:12] definitely see dogs a lot of dogs that I [45:15] see that have fear issues or a nerve you [45:18] know they're kind of nervous they're not [45:20] really sure maybe you know in the home [45:22] they have some problems a lot of times [45:25] they're accidentally created by their [45:27] owners so and it can be genetics though [45:29] - yes absolutely so that's very [45:32] important to know it's a very important [45:34] kind of piece to say is that I've also [45:37] seen some dogs have a lot of problems [45:39] and it's not the owners or anything [45:42] wrong they were just genetically kind of [45:43] weird dogs or something was wrong a very [45:45] fearful mom when they're it's within the [45:47] whelping box yeah and you know and the [45:49] puppies will pick up the behaviors of [45:50] the mom and so then you know sometimes [45:52] it's not the humans fault [45:54] quite often it can be yeah and it's not [45:57] intentional yes exactly so like you said [46:00] like you know people we love our dogs [46:01] and so we you know we tend to think of [46:04] them as like little people when it suits [46:06] us per se however a lot of times we'll [46:12] talk to our dog like a human being they [46:15] don't understand English they don't [46:16] understand any language really unless we [46:18] teach them what the words mean not [46:20] saying like a full sentence if somebody [46:23] teaches their dogs full sentences I'd [46:25] love to meet this person if their dog [46:27] can speak English but so you know when [46:31] we say let's say the dog is barking out [46:34] the window at something and we say oh [46:36] it's okay we're petting the dog we're [46:38] now reassuring them that [46:39] is a good behavior to do or if they're [46:41] afraid of loud noises and they looking [46:44] to be a truck backfires or something and [46:46] the dog jumps and gets spooked oh it's [46:49] okay that's you're doing a good job we [46:51] are now reaffirming to the dog that was [46:54] a scary thing you definitely should have [46:55] been afraid of it [46:56] and so in that way we're we're kind of [46:59] creating a nervous dog the other thing [47:01] that I see is when dogs don't have [47:02] structures boundaries or rules in their [47:04] home that they become nervous because [47:07] there is nobody to kind of guide them or [47:10] leave them per se not be an alpha but [47:14] they kind of just you know be to show [47:18] them what their role is I suppose in the [47:20] household they take it upon themselves [47:22] to give themselves something a role or [47:25] something of that nature you know if you [47:27] have a family and there's three kids and [47:29] the two parents and everybody is [47:31] implementing different rules and [47:32] expecting different things from the dog [47:34] that can confuse the heck out of them [47:37] yeah what could somebody do to mitigate [47:39] those problems when it has when they [47:40] have a large family like that yeah [47:42] so I I love working with families [47:45] especially with children because I feel [47:47] like they really should be a part of the [47:49] training process as well as the adults [47:51] in the home and for the children I like [47:54] them to learn like hey let your mom and [47:57] dad handle like our formal commands or [47:59] have your mom and dad present when we're [48:02] when we're practicing that way the [48:05] adults can assist the children and I [48:07] also like teaching the children how to [48:09] do tricks with the dog so that the dog [48:11] has some idea that these smaller humans [48:15] should be respected and bring good [48:18] things and aren't super confusing [48:20] however for the most part I like the [48:23] adults to handle the training style and [48:25] then I also sometimes you know I have to [48:27] get frank with people and I say hey you [48:29] guys need to be on the same page because [48:31] if you're not on the same page you're [48:33] wasting your time you're wasting your [48:35] dog's time and you're wasting your money [48:37] on you know hiring a dog trainer because [48:41] everybody needs to be on the same page [48:42] here so you know if if mom says the dog [48:46] can't jump on people and the dad says [48:48] well it's not a big deal now the dogs [48:50] gonna be confused exactly yeah and also [48:53] what [48:53] porn is teaching the children how to [48:56] properly handle a dog absolutely right [48:58] so they're not pulling you know [49:00] something I had always just drives me [49:01] crazy where somebody says I want the dog [49:03] that allows my kid to pull the tail and [49:05] pull the dog's ears I'm thinking to [49:07] myself that's pretty cruel to the dog [49:09] isn't it would it be better to teach the [49:11] child how to properly respect the dog's [49:13] respect goes both ways yep so that's one [49:17] thing that I really like teaching [49:18] children when we work on the place or [49:20] you call it the climb when the dog goes [49:22] for their bed or something is hey we can [49:25] tell the dog to go to their bed but this [49:27] is their space this is their bedroom [49:29] nobody you know it'd be rude if your [49:31] brother came barging into your bedroom [49:33] you probably wouldn't like that [49:35] so we wanted to we want the dog to know [49:37] that this is his bedroom and that he's [49:39] not going to be you know barged in on or [49:43] laid all over or anything like that when [49:45] he's there and then additionally what I [49:47] like to teach dogs is go to your place [49:49] if you need space per se so this is a [49:53] good a really good boundary and a way to [49:55] teach the children don't touch the dog [49:57] if the dogs in the place and teach the [49:58] dog hey if you're feeling uncomfortable [49:59] around the children you go here and you [50:02] won't be bothered per se [50:04] I think that's yeah I think it's awesome [50:05] cuz I've run into people as well where [50:07] maybe one child out of the four might be [50:11] a little too invasive for the dog yes [50:13] and they're having a hard time even [50:15] controlling their youngster yes that [50:17] ends up getting too much in the dog's [50:18] face and by teaching the dog hey if this [50:20] is a situation I want to escape it yeah [50:22] they go to their bed which will prevent [50:25] a good dog yeah from biting somebody [50:29] exactly right you know and I hate when [50:31] something like that happens it's a nice [50:32] dog but the child isn't being supervised [50:35] and the child is doing things like [50:37] pulling on the ears and point on the [50:39] tail and doing these things that is [50:41] really unpleasant and eventually the dog [50:43] does a correction yeah which would be [50:45] the same correction that they would give [50:46] another dog but now you have this infant [50:49] or young child freaking out and now a [50:52] dog at no fault of their own is being [50:55] taken to the shelter or being put down [50:57] or something like that because of the [50:59] improper respect that needs to be given [51:02] you know I mean I wouldn't want my ears [51:04] pulled back so knowing like hey this is [51:06] my safe [51:07] but I can go to and the kids knowing [51:09] when the dogs there don't go to yep you [51:12] know and what Ali saying is the climb is [51:15] or I call it a climb she calls a lot of [51:17] trainers call it a place but all it is [51:18] is it's the dog's bed that's really all [51:20] it is you can make it I had a client [51:22] once that had two Mastiff and [51:24] they're their dogs climb bed was a [51:27] really large futon right so it's just [51:30] something elevated for the dog to go to [51:32] it's their place where they can hang out [51:34] they can chew their bones and it's a [51:36] really really excellent command to teach [51:38] I highly recommend everybody teach us [51:40] I'm glad you brought that up what about [51:43] the common thought that people have it's [51:47] the same you can't teach an old dog new [51:50] tricks [51:50] yeah and I believe that the reason why [51:54] it may seem like that is only because a [51:56] dog the older a dog is the longer they [51:59] practice the behavior the more ingrained [52:01] that they believe that it works [52:03] absolutely you know it's just like with [52:04] a person if somebody does something [52:06] 10,000 times and it works 10,000 times [52:08] the one time it doesn't work they assume [52:11] that that's the fluke yep right and [52:13] they're gonna continue to fight through [52:14] it so it's not that you can't train or [52:16] teach an older dog new tricks what about [52:18] somebody who says my dog always chases [52:22] squirrels how can I get my dog not to [52:24] chase squirrels I know that's something [52:25] that comes up or my dog chases rabbit or [52:27] my dog here's another big one that you [52:29] probably hear fence fights oh yeah or my [52:31] dog digs in the yard yeah right what are [52:34] good ways to address these issues [52:36] oh man you just gave me a whole list all [52:38] right I think that there's a lot of [52:42] behaviors so you know on one hand I [52:47] really enjoy like giving the dogs a [52:50] different outlet so let's say for [52:52] digging for example they're like my dog [52:53] chronically digs if it's possible I'm [52:57] gonna say hey like let's look at your [52:59] backyard [53:01] what can we implement into your backyard [53:02] for your dog to do instead of digging so [53:05] maybe like if the dog likes toys we'll [53:07] hang a rope from a tree and they can [53:09] play with the toy by themselves or maybe [53:11] we need to add some toys in general and [53:13] this would make the dog happier and be [53:14] able to do things some dogs don't care [53:17] about toys or anything like that and I [53:19] just want to dig because it's fun [53:21] so in this case we have to figure out [53:23] how to tell the dog that's not an [53:25] acceptable behavior so personally what I [53:28] do is I implement a negative marker [53:32] so basically when I say no no means in [53:36] this very moment you are doing something [53:38] wrong and you need to do something [53:39] differently what they do differently is [53:42] dependent on you know whatever let's say [53:44] I if we're going to or recall and the [53:47] dog ignores my recall I say no now the [53:49] dog should know ok I've made a mistake I [53:51] need to turn around and come back for [53:53] the recall for fence you know digging at [53:55] the fence if I say no the dogs like ok [53:58] well this means I shouldn't be digging [54:00] maybe you know I should go play with the [54:02] ball or I should come inside or do [54:04] something like that so offering an [54:05] alternative behavior to the dog after [54:07] we've given the negative marker I feel [54:08] like it's very important but having that [54:10] negative marker lets the dog know in [54:12] this moment is when you've done [54:14] something wrong because if we correct [54:16] our dog for digging in the backyard [54:17] once they're coming back towards us [54:19] we've lost the opportunity to really [54:21] effectively communicate with them so I'm [54:23] all about being practical and about [54:25] having the dog adapt to our environment [54:27] versus us adapting our environment to [54:30] satisfy the dog so that makes sense [54:33] believe it or not we are out of time so [54:36] before finishing up the rest of this [54:38] episode where can people find you how [54:41] can they get ahold of you do you have [54:42] any videos that might be available for [54:44] them anything that can add value to our [54:47] listeners yeah so I have a dog training [54:50] business called candid canine it's [54:52] candid with a K basic in spelling a [54:55] little confusing so it's kan di d k and [54:59] then the number 9 [55:00] and that will be in the description [55:01] below yep and so I'm on Facebook [55:04] Instagram and I do have a YouTube [55:07] channel I'm going to start posting some [55:09] more videos here in the new year but [55:11] most of my videos right now can be found [55:13] on my Instagram on my Facebook page if [55:15] somebody wants to request a specific [55:18] video from you training video because [55:20] I'm hoping this spreads worldwide you [55:22] know first of all where are you located [55:25] so the people that could actually hire [55:27] you and work directly with you yeah so I [55:30] am in San Marcos California which is [55:32] North County San Diego [55:34] so I service all areas between Temecula [55:38] and San Clemente all the way down [55:39] through San Diego so I'm kind of within [55:43] like a two-hour span there of the San [55:45] Diego County and so you know if you're [55:48] in San Diego County and you're looking [55:50] for a dog trainer that's where I am [55:52] there's also a ton of other really great [55:53] dog trainers in the area so if I am [55:55] booked I can refer you to somebody that [55:58] is also a good trainer such as Nathan [56:01] excellent and if somebody is to email a [56:04] request for a video or something like [56:06] that since you're gonna be producing [56:07] more YouTube videos where would be the [56:09] best place for them to send you that [56:10] message yeah um either you know Facebook [56:14] or Instagram would probably be the best [56:15] way on my website there's also a inquiry [56:19] form [56:20] I suppose mentioning of a website would [56:21] have been a good idea too I'll post that [56:24] as well on the description so just you [56:26] know either that way or on my facebook I [56:28] just started a weekly question of a [56:32] question of the week rather so there's [56:35] like a comment section below the video [56:36] so if you leave a comment and say hey [56:39] here's my question I'm gonna try to [56:41] address each question if I have a [56:43] surplus of questions I'll probably do [56:45] two questions of the week or something [56:47] of that nature to keep up with the [56:48] requests so alright well believe it or [56:51] not that's a wrap thank you so much for [56:53] coming out I really had a great time [56:54] talking with you cool thanks for having [56:55] me [56:56] [Music] ================================================== CONTENU DE: 2019-02-06_Nate_Schoemer_Show___Episode_4_-_Tony_Gallardo___Marine_Combat_Attack_Pilot."

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 217/468,oh okay so you actually came right [01:20] after i left okay was that your last [01:22] unit before you retired i retired i went [01:24] to uh air station camp pendleton and [01:27] finished up at the at the air station [01:28] there so we both know first sergeant [01:31] alvarez good buddy of mine and i found [01:32] out he's also a good buddy of yours and [01:35] before the podcast started we were [01:36] talking about um he ended up getting the [01:39] navy and marine corps medal correct yes [01:42] and that is something that i didn't [01:44] fully understand how it happened or what [01:46] took place can you talk about it a [01:48] little bit [01:49] yeah from what i've read and what he [01:51] told me was uh they had i think they [01:53] were in jordan and [01:55] or somewhere in the middle east it was [01:56] not it was it was a training exercise [01:59] they had just landed [02:00] uh joe and his team first sergeant [02:02] alvarez and his team had gotten off of [02:04] the osprey [02:06] and as it lifted to uh take off it [02:08] actually [02:10] ended up [02:11] i'm not sure exactly what happened but [02:13] it ended up arguing into the ground [02:15] it crashed in the ground right there in [02:16] front of him and he and his team [02:18] all ran into the ostrich to try to pull [02:20] out any survivors that they could get [02:23] i believe two survived two did not but [02:25] they were instrumental in getting these [02:26] guys out of the aircraft so at least [02:28] they didn't they didn't burn to death i [02:31] was asking you about it because i [02:32] thought it was a helicopter and then you [02:34] corrected me because you were an attack [02:35] helicopter pilot what helicopter exactly [02:38] did you fly in combat i flew the ah1w [02:41] super cobra super that sounds so awesome [02:44] which has been phased out now by the [02:45] ah1z [02:46] okay and uh if you're listening to this [02:49] on itunes you won't be able to see the [02:51] image but on youtube we'll definitely [02:52] put an image of these helicopters uh and [02:55] what was it that these guys were in when [02:57] that incident happened a v-22 osprey and [03:00] that's like a normal troop carrier or [03:02] what exactly it is they replace the [03:03] ch-46 as a medium lift troop carrier so [03:07] it um it's a tilt rotor aircraft which [03:10] is it's different it can it can hover [03:12] like a helicopter and it can fly like an [03:14] airplane it just depends on the uh the [03:16] configuration it's in at the time [03:18] and he was telling me about it so what [03:19] they were doing is they were practicing [03:21] dropping troops off taking off getting [03:23] more troops and they were kind of going [03:24] back and forth and he said as it was [03:26] taking off so you're telling me that it [03:28] didn't [03:30] how would it nose dive like that so it [03:32] came up what is it was it did it catch [03:34] the wind or something or was it just [03:36] like a completely fluke accident or how [03:37] would something do you know how to pilot [03:39] one of those i do not no it's uh [03:42] and and the thing about that when i do [03:43] talk to guys it is [03:45] it is a very foreign type of aircraft [03:47] when i understand the requirements [03:50] to make it fly as a tilt-rotor airplane [03:52] because when the helicopter everything [03:53] is always at 90 degrees [03:55] the uh [03:57] the rotor and the aircraft or the mass [03:59] of the aircraft are [04:00] supposed to be at 90 degrees it depends [04:02] on you know what you're doing whereas as [04:04] a tilt rotor aircraft [04:06] they'll be at 90 degrees and then as [04:08] they transition to forward flight [04:10] the nacelles i think they call them [04:12] they'll [04:12] once they get fast enough then the cells [04:14] will be pointed straight ahead and it'll [04:16] fly like [04:17] a like a twin propeller airplane and [04:19] then as it comes into land it'll adjust [04:21] its speed and then the cells will then [04:24] pivot back up [04:26] until it's in a landing configuration [04:28] and then it'll drop down onto the ground [04:31] so it has some some different [04:32] aerodynamic [04:34] properties and requirements that either [04:36] both an airplane [04:37] and a helicopter have [04:39] from my understanding so him jumping in [04:41] and pulling out the guys that were in [04:43] there he ended up being awarded the navy [04:45] and marine corps medal now how big of a [04:47] medal or how important of a medal is [04:49] that that's pretty much the highest [04:51] medal you can get for a non-combat [04:54] action so um in the military i think you [04:57] know there's there's different ones at [04:58] higher levels of government but you know [05:00] for the marine corps or the navy [05:02] it's the highest one you can get in a [05:04] peacetime operation and it's for putting [05:06] yourself in danger [05:08] in a peacetime operation to save fellow [05:10] service members basically risking your [05:12] life right yeah when he was telling me [05:14] about that i completely because i'd [05:16] already been out of the marine corps [05:17] since 2010 and he was telling me about [05:18] that maybe six months ago [05:20] and i'd completely forgotten about that [05:22] medal i mean i had to look it up and [05:23] read about it again and and i thought [05:25] about it for saying i'm like what type [05:27] of situation would you be in a [05:28] non-combat operation where you could [05:30] risk your life but i mean even training [05:33] operations things can happen to where [05:35] somebody's life could be put in danger i [05:37] mean when i was [05:39] after i came back from my second [05:40] deployment from iraq we were i was a [05:42] track company and we were doing some [05:44] training operations and often the troops [05:46] in the back of those amtraks and an [05:48] amtrak is uh basically it's a troop [05:50] carrier you know i'm telling this to the [05:52] audience yeah i know you know so it's a [05:54] troop carrier it's almost like a tank in [05:56] a way that carries troops often it'll [05:58] have a mark 19 which is like a fully [06:00] automatic grenade launcher or it'll have [06:02] a 50 caliber machine gun up on top and [06:04] often the top doors will open the troops [06:06] will be sitting up on top to provide [06:08] security but a lot of times when we're [06:10] doing training operations a lot of the [06:12] training kind of cruising around camp [06:14] pendleton is for the the trackers you [06:17] know so we're sitting in the back and [06:18] we'll get to the location we need to get [06:19] at and we'll do some drills we'll run [06:21] out so on and so forth so we were [06:22] training and we were you know i'm [06:24] sitting in the back not even really [06:25] paying attention to where we're going [06:27] and all of a sudden the amtrak started [06:29] to tilt on its side and it tilted so far [06:31] on the side that some of the guys who [06:33] had fallen asleep fell forward and face [06:36] planted into each other so we're [06:37] completely on our side at this point [06:40] and i looked out the door and we were on [06:42] the side of a hill [06:44] so we went up the side of this hill and [06:46] it tilted over and we had our packs [06:49] attached to the side and had the packs [06:51] not been attached to the side it would [06:53] have continued to roll and we were [06:54] probably [06:55] 100 plus feet up this hill so if it [06:58] continued to roll it probably would have [07:00] rolled maybe 20 times or so [07:02] give or take and [07:04] the guys inside the amtrak would either [07:06] be dead or severely injured so i mean [07:09] there's always risks when you're [07:10] training for any sort of combat [07:12] operations where something can happen [07:15] and speaking of have you ever had any [07:17] because i mean just thinking about being [07:19] a attack helicopter pilot it's pretty [07:22] intimidating sounding were you [07:24] intimidated when you're first getting [07:25] ready to go to school or to learn about [07:27] it or [07:28] kind of walk us through how that works [07:30] well the what they call the hmla [07:31] community the helicopter marine light [07:33] attacks the hmla community [07:35] is very well known they always say that [07:37] they're very well known for eating their [07:38] young so it's a it's a tough community [07:40] when you show up you are expected to [07:43] study hard work hard [07:46] learn your aircraft learn your weapon [07:48] systems learn your threat weapon systems [07:50] so that you [07:52] when you become an aircraft commander [07:54] you are a functional and useful part of [07:56] the team so not only can you fly the [07:59] aircraft but flying talking [08:01] employing weapon systems uh you know [08:04] proper weapon to target match and also [08:07] employing that against threat weapon [08:08] systems so that you you ensure that your [08:11] survivability is higher and their [08:13] survivability is lower [08:15] how long was the school for it [08:17] um so for to get basically qualified in [08:21] the in the cobra was [08:24] i think it was six months and then from [08:26] there i went to my tactical squad and [08:28] hmla 369 the gun fighters gunfighters [08:30] rule [08:31] and um that's our that's the thing that [08:33] was we do that nate flexes for no reason [08:36] but when he does it we'll have to say [08:37] gunfighters rule right [08:40] there you go yes gunfighters rule but um [08:43] so when i went to the gunfighters i [08:44] think it was october 1996 when i joined [08:47] the gunfighters [08:48] and you know that's where it begins you [08:50] know you're really nothing in the [08:52] squadron [08:53] and you know typical military fashion [08:55] you know [08:56] so it's you know it's a tough community [08:58] so when you show up you are expected to [09:00] make all your maps for all the local [09:02] training areas start learning and you [09:04] have a specific syllabus that you fly [09:06] they call it training and readiness [09:07] manual the tnr [09:08] so you have specific flights and there's [09:10] specific requirements for each flight [09:11] that you have to study for and be [09:13] prepared for [09:14] and as you go through the syllabus you [09:16] know they start breaking out the folks [09:18] that that are good pilots that work hard [09:20] to study hard and [09:22] have the ability to you know advance [09:24] more quickly or get more designations [09:26] and qualifications in the cobra [09:28] police officers when they're going [09:30] through police academy i mean i'm not a [09:31] police officer but they do some sort of [09:34] or an extended course on defensive [09:36] driving techniques and tactics that [09:37] they're able to implement when they're [09:39] you know chasing the bad guy or whatever [09:41] the case may be are there extended [09:43] amount of different sort of maybe [09:46] piloting exercises that you guys have to [09:48] rehearse over and over again or [09:50] how does that work i mean how often are [09:52] you able to actually get inside of your [09:55] you know uh respected craft and go up [09:57] there and practice some of these [09:59] techniques that you are quite possibly [10:01] going to implement when you're in a [10:02] combat situation yeah so when i was a [10:05] junior marine i remember the commanding [10:06] officer of the [10:08] of the squadron he wanted everybody to [10:09] have at least 20 hours of flight time a [10:11] month so that equated to about 10 [10:14] flights because each flight would be [10:16] about two hours so if you think about 10 [10:18] flights a month 10 you know if you were [10:19] lucky you got 10 to 12 maybe even 15 [10:21] flights a month [10:23] and each one had a different uh [10:25] requirement so some days you would you'd [10:27] go out and your job was to just shoot [10:29] rockets in 20 millimeter and just [10:31] concentrate on that only it's just [10:33] aerial gunnery so you go in and you [10:35] you're shooting at targets just to [10:36] practice and in other days you would [10:38] create a tactical scenario where you [10:40] would put a threat out [10:41] a notional threat and then a pretend [10:44] threat out in an area and then what you [10:46] would do is you would [10:48] figure out and overlay all the threat [10:50] systems [10:51] capabilities and then you would create a [10:53] tactical scenario to be able to fly in [10:57] and attack that [10:59] that pretend target with the weapon [11:01] systems you have on board so it just it [11:03] can made you think a little bit more you [11:05] know started at the basics just basic [11:07] shooting and then okay now there's a [11:08] threat out there [11:09] figure out how to to to fly into the [11:12] area and attack that threat without [11:14] getting shot down yourself [11:16] talking about getting shot down you've [11:17] been shot at in combat right i mean up [11:20] in the yeah i mean a lot of times you [11:22] don't know until you get hit but [11:24] talking to some guys on the ground um [11:27] once some folks that we supported in [11:28] different cities in iraq they [11:30] they told us that they they shot at us a [11:32] lot were you in iraq and afghanistan or [11:34] just iraq just iraq i never made it to [11:36] afghanistan i wasn't just iraq too okay [11:39] how many deployments do iraq did you do [11:41] i did three three two so you got me beat [11:43] there i only did two [11:45] and you flew it was over 300 correct [11:48] it is you know i don't remember the [11:49] number it might even be closer to 400 [11:50] total oh wow yeah [11:52] do you have any um stories that stand [11:55] out that [11:56] might be worth sharing [11:59] yeah no i do um [12:01] it's funny because i usually don't talk [12:02] about these a lot i think about them [12:04] every now and then i remember when i [12:06] came back from iraq and you just didn't [12:07] think about it constantly [12:09] because it's uh it's something that's [12:10] raw and in your mind [12:12] you know i remember yeah the first time [12:14] we [12:14] we shot back at somebody it was just [12:18] kind of a we were just out doing a [12:20] patrol flying and there was an army unit [12:22] on the ground and [12:23] they were on one side of the euphrates [12:25] and there was this house on the other [12:27] side of the euphrates and they kept [12:28] telling us hey we're you know there's [12:30] guys in the house that are taking pot [12:31] shots at us and [12:33] can you take a look so we we flew in and [12:34] we're [12:36] we're you know we're perched up high [12:37] probably a thousand fifteen hundred feet [12:39] just kind of looking down i got the my [12:40] front seater was in the in the optics [12:42] taking a look [12:44] and all of a sudden these guys in black [12:46] pajamas start pouring out of this house [12:49] and [12:50] with ak-47s and everything else so [12:53] my gunner's like hey we got mams we call [12:55] them mans military-age males it was the [12:57] uh the term we used over the radio so so [12:59] we got man some we got mamms in black [13:01] pajamas with weapons [13:02] coming out of the house and [13:04] the uh the jtac the joint terminal [13:07] attack controller said his only words [13:10] were cleared hot [13:12] and we're like wow okay so cleared hot [13:14] and we just i just basically [13:17] tipped over and the huey i had behind me [13:19] with uh [13:20] wedge rampy an awesome guy um if he gets [13:23] to hear this wedge well we were we were [13:25] an awesome combat crew [13:27] the huey just opened up with the minigun [13:29] and just started obliterating this area [13:32] was [13:32] they all ran into this palm grove [13:35] we dove in and we just i just [13:37] popped rockets [13:38] all in the different spots of the palm [13:40] grove we pulled off came back around [13:42] because they wanted to put a hellfire [13:43] missile in the house [13:44] and so we did that we came back around [13:46] put a hellfire missile in the house and [13:47] then and then pulled off and it was just [13:49] just like that we went from [13:52] just flying around to [13:54] pretty much [13:55] a combat situation yeah emptying our you [13:58] know coming back what we call winchester [14:00] with uh you know shooting off all our [14:02] ordnance and uh and people hear hellfire [14:04] all the time but can you explain exactly [14:06] what a hellfire is yeah people do hear [14:08] what hell fires so a hellfire is a it's [14:10] a 100 pound missile [14:12] so it's not that big i mean it's i [14:14] forget what the exact length was i i had [14:16] to know it at some point in my life [14:17] where i would have gotten yelled at [14:19] so but i remember it was 100 pounds so [14:21] um 100-pound missile [14:23] and basically what it does is it seeks [14:25] uh coated laser energy so when you [14:28] when you put a laser whether it's from [14:30] the aircraft or from the ground they [14:31] will tell you a code so you know the [14:33] code might be a lot of times we used one [14:35] one one one [14:36] one two three four i mean something [14:38] simple they would just say code [14:40] you know quad ones which was a common [14:42] one because it was uh the strongest what [14:44] they called prf pulp pulse repetition [14:47] frequency so they shine a laser on the [14:50] target you code the missile [14:52] or you program the missile to read that [14:54] code [14:55] and once the missile sees the code it'll [14:57] give you a uh [14:59] indication in the cockpit that it sees [15:01] it and then it's within the limits as [15:03] long as the diamond showed up inside the [15:04] circle you're within limits [15:07] boom fire the missile off and it would [15:09] it would ride that laser [15:12] or ride the [15:13] the reflection of the laser all the way [15:14] down to the target and hit it would you [15:16] have to maintain on the target in order [15:18] for it to hit so if you start to move it [15:19] would veer off as well right yeah so the [15:22] laser had to stay on the target [15:24] correct that's almost like a uh [15:26] what is the rocket that has a wire [15:28] attached to it where they're totally [15:30] controlled the token right mm-hmm [15:33] that's uh [15:34] they've had some uh [15:36] training incidents with those as well [15:37] those are kind of dangerous because of [15:39] that they can be we shot toes off the [15:42] the cobra as well oh really yeah yeah [15:44] they don't now i'm pretty sure the zulu [15:46] doesn't shoot it anymore i think it's [15:47] hellfire's only because they have so [15:48] many different models of hellfire now [15:50] but we used to shoot the tow missile and [15:52] yeah i mean every now and then they [15:53] would fail [15:55] um you know one of the things people [15:56] don't understand about ordnance so if [15:58] you see a somebody shoots a rocket and [16:00] it just go or a mortar and you see this [16:02] all the time the mortar fails where a [16:04] mortar will somebody will drop a mortar [16:05] and they'll go dunk and it'll just come [16:06] out of the thing and land on the ground [16:08] right [16:09] well [16:10] a mortar requires a certain amount of or [16:13] or all these weapons whether it be [16:14] rockets toes hellfires everything else [16:17] is indirect fire so often a lot of [16:19] people listening are not going to be [16:20] military people yeah so but the point [16:22] i'm trying to make with these explosives [16:24] is they have to hit a certain amount of [16:26] g-force [16:27] to actually arm it [16:29] so with a toe even if you have an [16:31] accident if it just thunk it shoots out [16:33] of the tube and it falls on the ground [16:35] it's not armed [16:36] similar to the 203 as well how it has to [16:38] have a certain amount of spirals before [16:41] it right activates it yeah defuse it [16:43] yeah [16:44] we actually had a really close call when [16:46] we were in one of our amtrak so for [16:48] whatever reason when we were going in to [16:50] the invasion in iraq in o3 [16:53] uh crossing the line of departure they [16:54] had everybody place their weapons into [16:57] condition one and so [16:59] condition one is magazine inserted [17:01] rounding chamber bolt forward safety on [17:02] ejection port cover closed right and so [17:05] some of the guys had their 203s loaded [17:07] which i thought was absolute insanity uh [17:10] and one of the guys he jumped back down [17:12] into the amtrak from being on overhead [17:15] watch or airwatch and when he jumped [17:17] down it [17:19] somehow shot his 203 off [17:22] and his hand was in front of the 203 so [17:25] it hit his hand [17:27] shattered his entire hand oh yeah and [17:29] landed in the center of the amtrak with [17:31] 22 marines inside [17:33] and everybody i wasn't in this amtrak [17:36] but from what i heard they're all [17:37] looking at it everybody's you know [17:39] hearts pounding [17:41] wondering if it's going to go off but it [17:42] didn't go off because of course it [17:44] wasn't able to arm because it didn't [17:46] spiral enough so when it shoots out of [17:48] the 203 it starts to turn and it needs a [17:51] certain amount of rotations and luckily [17:53] for them it didn't rotate enough so yeah [17:56] yeah so a lot of me i have fail-safes [17:58] built into them like the tow it has the [17:59] tow has two motors a launch motor and a [18:02] flight motor so the launch motor it was [18:04] designed for people to shoot it on the [18:05] ground so that hit the launch motor and [18:07] it just goes you know basically so you [18:09] can puff [18:10] it shoots the [18:12] the explosion out the back everybody [18:13] knows not to be there it launches the [18:15] missile about 60 feet i think it is and [18:17] then the flight motor [18:19] kicks in and the flight motor goes off [18:21] so that it doesn't burn the guy that's [18:23] shooting it [18:24] so that was that was the thought process [18:26] behind the toe well it fired the same [18:27] way off the [18:29] cobra because the missile was [18:30] essentially the same kind of missile [18:33] did you do any um [18:35] uh night missions [18:37] oh tons yeah we trained a lot at night [18:39] yeah vision goggles what is it you know [18:41] we had one one um raid that we did at [18:43] night long story short we we came in it [18:46] was um [18:47] it was basically a college that they [18:49] were using as a stronghold [18:52] and so our mission was to go there and [18:54] take them out and they didn't even tell [18:55] us or maybe they did maybe the higher [18:57] ups i mean i was just a corporal at the [18:59] time so i didn't get all the details and [19:01] when we got there a humvee pulled up and [19:03] this humvee started playing on the [19:05] speakers let the bodies hit the floor [19:07] super loud and we had a building that we [19:09] were going up on top of and we were [19:10] actually in newsweek because of this [19:12] exact attack that we did and we placed [19:14] all our machine guns up on top of this [19:16] uh rooftop and once we got up there we [19:18] still hear the music playing but then a [19:20] couple helicopters just started laying [19:22] down fire from the sky and i had no idea [19:25] they were there and my only assumption [19:26] is that the music came in to mask the [19:29] sound of the helicopters coming in to [19:31] maybe confuse the enemy yeah because a [19:33] lot of times if they heard the rotors of [19:35] the cobra the huey's coming in they [19:36] would just disengage and run [19:38] they used that a lot actually when we [19:40] were there in ramadi and in fallujah [19:43] the time that i was there 2005 2006 [19:46] when they would get surrounded because [19:48] the marines were in this spot in ramadi [19:51] that was easily surrounded so whenever [19:53] it would things would heat up they would [19:55] send us on what they called a tick a [19:56] troops in contact and we would just come [19:58] in and as soon as they heard the noise [20:00] enemy would disengage and disperse [20:02] because they knew what was coming were [20:04] you part of operation phantom fury [20:07] no that was before we got there i [20:09] believe that was two thousand five four [20:11] five okay so it was early two thousand [20:13] five seconds of fury was fallujah yes [20:15] when we got there fallujah was [20:17] relatively calm [20:19] there were still [20:20] things going on there but it was [20:22] relatively calm [20:23] pretty much the main [20:25] fighting had already ended at that point [20:26] the main fighting in fallujah now up uh [20:29] in al-qaim right next to the uh right [20:31] where the euphrates and the syrian [20:33] border money was pretty bad too right [20:35] was pretty bad [20:36] yeah we did a lot yes we we we support a [20:39] lot of ramadi operations yeah my brother [20:41] was in ramadi he was also marine corps [20:43] infantry and he basically shot it every [20:45] day up there yeah he only spent three [20:47] months overseas in iraq i spent 18 [20:50] months and he probably got into just as [20:52] many firefights as i did in his three [20:53] months just being at part of that it was [20:55] called the ramadi triangle right [20:57] i believe so [20:59] am i yeah for the ground guys because [21:00] remember on the on the aviation side [21:03] we weren't always privy to you know the [21:06] the way you guys would would call it on [21:09] the ground we just had our intel reports [21:11] we'd go we would get you know we would [21:12] get call we would have a frequency [21:14] somebody to talk to and then um we go [21:16] from there so they may have called it [21:18] the ramadi triangle i don't remember [21:19] have you seen it i'm gonna throw in a [21:21] movie reference here have you seen um [21:24] the most recent mission impossible [21:26] i don't know i saw one uh flying back [21:29] from georgia a couple weeks ago okay so [21:31] it was a really new one and really [21:32] recent it was the most recent one and [21:35] tom cruise is an actual helicopter pilot [21:38] and one of the things that he does is he [21:40] does this like spiral where he goes down [21:42] this canyon and he actually oh i did see [21:44] it yeah i did see that in the movie is [21:46] that a technique you guys would do as [21:47] well [21:49] um [21:52] what's that what is that called do you [21:53] know just a spiral down [21:55] yeah i mean you know basically you would [21:57] just you push the nose down kick the uh [21:59] kick the pedal in that direction and [22:00] just and just [22:02] you you push the stick down to the right [22:05] right pedal and then it would just you [22:06] just get into a [22:08] i imagine that would be pretty dangerous [22:10] no as long as you stay controlled it's [22:12] not dangerous no no [22:14] i've only been in a helicopter once and [22:16] it freaks me out [22:17] i was in one of the the [22:19] what is the troop transporter where it [22:21] has the two helicopters the two rotors [22:22] on top ch-46 yeah yeah that freaked me [22:25] out it made me super sick [22:27] yeah well those are i mean those things [22:28] move like this constantly moving like [22:30] this so if you're prone to motion [22:31] sickness a frog would get you sick is it [22:33] like a car though if you're the pilot [22:34] it's not as bad but if you're a [22:35] passenger it's it's way worse yeah if [22:37] you're if you're the uh if you're the [22:38] one doing the flying you it's not nearly [22:41] as bad [22:42] was it intimidating though the first [22:43] time you got in the pilot's seat and you [22:45] took off [22:46] oh yeah i mean i remember that flight [22:48] yeah what did that feel like [22:50] it's got to be intimidating it was i [22:52] mean having because we train in flight [22:54] school we train in the th57 which is [22:56] your basic news helicopter that you see [22:57] flying around [22:59] and then you get into a cobra and it's [23:01] you know the cobra weighs five times [23:03] more than that one does [23:05] weighs five times more i mean the blades [23:07] are literally that wide you know the one [23:10] the 57's like five six inches wide [23:14] and [23:15] it's just i mean you know you're in an [23:17] attack helicopter now i mean it's just [23:19] you know this is kind of badass when you [23:20] get in there and you just see all the [23:22] you know you you're sitting in the [23:24] cockpit and you got the armor all around [23:26] you and all the weapon system [23:28] it's uh it was it was really cool [23:30] and talking about the armor all around [23:32] you did you ever feel any of the bullets [23:34] impacting the helicopter when you're in [23:35] there i mean i know that you in fact on [23:38] your plaque yeah i've got the one the [23:40] one bullet that hit me is up on my uh in [23:43] my shadow box there on my uh the iraq [23:45] patch that i wore while we were uh so [23:47] you only your actual you're only hit [23:49] once only hit once [23:51] it's pretty lucky yeah which is it is [23:53] and [23:54] it's silly because it was on i don't [23:56] want to call it a kind of a dumb run [23:58] but uh you know there were other runs we [24:00] did where [24:02] you know um [24:05] so we were supporting uh second [24:06] battalion first marines [24:08] after we went through alkyne [24:10] second battalion first marines in a in a [24:13] city called new beatty [24:15] and we did multiple danger close [24:19] attack runs in there [24:21] and i never got hit and [24:23] what was interesting was after that [24:26] operation and [24:28] and i was i remember being and still to [24:29] this day when i think about it it's like [24:31] holy mackerel [24:32] um [24:33] some of the uh the marines came back [24:35] through the the forward operating base [24:37] at al qaeda where we were where the [24:39] helicopters were kept [24:41] after the battle was over and one of [24:42] them we were talking to one of them and [24:44] he said he said yeah sir he says every [24:46] time you guys dove in when you pulled [24:48] off the target we had to jump underneath [24:50] the vehicles and i said why he said [24:52] because [24:52] all the bullets they were shooting at [24:54] you would start coming down like pouring [24:56] rain [24:57] all over the place and i said really he [25:00] said yeah i was like i had no idea i [25:02] mean i assumed they were shooting at us [25:04] but i had no idea they were shooting [25:06] that much at us so i was pretty lucky [25:09] that's that's surprising yeah because i [25:11] was actually about to ask [25:12] if maybe they do not shoot at [25:15] attack helicopters as much because it is [25:18] such a hard target you know i mean they [25:19] always say be a hard target and if [25:21] you're a really hard target i was almost [25:23] thinking i'm trying to put myself in the [25:25] perspective of the enemy you know and i [25:27] thought about that when i was over in [25:29] iraq during my second deployment and we [25:31] were in najaf cemetery which before [25:33] fallujah happened was considered some of [25:35] the worst fighting scenes since vietnam [25:38] and i remember thinking of how [25:40] intimidating it was i mean we would [25:42] drive by the cemetery and there would be [25:44] insurgents sitting on these different [25:46] tombs and whatnot looking at us holding [25:48] rpgs and ak-47s and rpk's and just [25:51] staring at us as we drive by and we [25:53] weren't able to engage because it was a [25:55] religious location second largest [25:56] cemetery in the world [25:58] until they started to engage us and then [26:00] when we pushed into the cemetery i just [26:02] remembered [26:03] how intimidating it was going into that [26:05] environment and then i thought to myself [26:07] imagine how intimidating it's gotta be [26:09] from their perspective because this is [26:12] what is i mean we're known throughout [26:14] the entire world as being one of the [26:15] greatest fighting forces that has ever [26:18] stepped foot on this planet and we're [26:20] coming in facing them and not only is it [26:22] just the troops but you also have the [26:24] tanks and you have the amtrak's and you [26:25] have the helicopters and you have [26:27] artillery and all these other things [26:29] going on i mean that's got to be [26:31] incredibly intimidating from the enemy's [26:32] perspective and then to think okay am i [26:35] going to sit here and engage as a attack [26:38] helicopter most likely not doing any [26:40] damage and then give away my position to [26:43] where they're easily going to turn [26:44] around and take us out is it worth [26:46] taking that shot [26:47] you see what i mean well [26:49] and that's an interesting perspective [26:50] because there were there were times [26:52] where [26:54] if we were not in a specific [26:57] um you know named operation or you know [26:59] an engagement with a battalion like we [27:01] were there [27:02] a lot of times they were hesitant to [27:04] shoot at us because if they gave away [27:05] their position [27:07] we were cleared [27:08] to engage immediately so [27:10] i think a lot of times they wouldn't [27:13] shoot at us because they knew like [27:15] because a lot of the patrols we would do [27:17] we would just do standard routes [27:19] in areas where there were hot spots and [27:21] there were i'm sure there were people [27:22] down there that wanted to shoot at us [27:24] but they wouldn't do it because they [27:26] knew that [27:27] uh we would turn on them quickly right [27:29] there were several times where they [27:31] fired [27:32] sa7 shoulder-to-launch missiles and that [27:36] was a calculated risk as well because [27:38] the sa-7 leaves space it leaves a trail [27:41] from where it goes so if you meant well [27:44] if there's two helicopters because there [27:45] was always two if you shoot and you hit [27:48] one the other one is still going to [27:49] attack you [27:50] so it uh [27:52] it was a [27:53] big risk a big risk and they took it [27:56] they took down [27:57] they shot several [27:59] missiles at us only one hit [28:03] um [28:04] they didn't hit your crap no no or [28:06] wingman [28:07] no it didn't no it didn't hit my wingman [28:08] yeah you still call wingman no this was [28:10] uh [28:11] interestingly yeah and i figured we [28:13] would talk about this as well so it was [28:15] was november 2nd 2005 [28:17] i was up in alchem um getting ready to [28:19] kick off because i think november 5th [28:21] was when [28:22] operation steel curtain was going to [28:24] kick off up at al-qaeda near the syrian [28:25] border in the euphrates river [28:28] and we got a call over the radio that [28:31] gunshot six six was down and and usually [28:34] you know that that that's kind of the [28:36] term of been shot down [28:38] and nobody had any details of what [28:40] happened um [28:42] yet some we were all glued to the radios [28:44] trying to figure out and there was i [28:45] mean they basically they launched the [28:47] qrf the dash two landed and did what [28:50] they could because they had mini guns [28:51] and a 50 cal and qrf is quick reaction [28:53] force right yeah so they got some [28:55] infantry guys on the ground some nates [28:57] i got some nates [28:59] running out there [29:00] to try to secure the area so they could [29:02] you know figure out what was going on [29:04] and um [29:05] turned out you know one of my one of my [29:07] good friends major gerald bloomfield and [29:10] one of my other squadron mates mike [29:11] martino both uh they both died [29:14] they were shot down in the missile and [29:15] they uh they fell out of the sky and [29:16] died did you guys go in there and pull [29:19] them out we did [29:20] i i did not yeah but you're up in the [29:22] air providing security as the ground [29:24] troops were going in i was not because [29:25] this actually happened uh between ramadi [29:30] well kind of right outside ramadi maybe [29:31] a few miles outside i think we'll say to [29:33] the west of ramadi [29:35] just this random house this guy had a [29:37] shoulder-fired missile and he just [29:38] stepped out and shot down the helicopter [29:41] did they take him out [29:43] don't know i don't know if they have [29:44] about him don't know if they ever got [29:46] the particular guy [29:48] but um [29:48] [Music] [29:50] yeah it was a pretty ugly day and what [29:52] was worse was the insurgents were at [29:55] this point in time people may remember [29:57] this they used to videotape everything [29:59] they did [30:00] so [30:02] um [30:03] there were certain websites where they [30:04] would post these things and myself and [30:06] another guy ira clark who's he's a ceo [30:08] down here in miramar now [30:10] we were surfing through the internet and [30:11] we found the video and this was you know [30:13] one of what i call one of the the raw [30:16] moments of my life [30:18] was [30:19] many times they would post a video of [30:21] them shooting the missile and hitting [30:23] the helicopter because nobody had any [30:24] clue how [30:26] they got them right because we had [30:29] systems on board the cobra that would [30:31] react to missile firings and shoot [30:33] flares off so [30:35] that system obviously didn't work so we [30:37] were trying to get clues well [30:39] this particular time [30:41] this video and and i don't think it was [30:43] up very long before it got we might have [30:45] been the only two that saw it was [30:47] not a video of them shooting down the [30:49] helicopter but a video [30:51] of the cockpit of my squadron mates [30:54] and basically what they were trying to [30:56] do was [30:57] you know get them out so they could do [30:59] the usual like they did in somalia [31:01] parade them around and and everything [31:03] and i think the qrf got there fast [31:05] enough it stopped you know stopped that [31:07] whole thing they did bomb some of the [31:09] houses and around the area so [31:12] whether the one that shot him or not um [31:15] was was killed also i don't know but i [31:17] know that between the f-18s and the qrf [31:20] i know they went in and [31:22] and took care of business there yeah i [31:24] remember they didn't do that often [31:25] because in a job cemetery uh same thing [31:28] the first group that went in [31:30] uh one of the guys that we know was or [31:32] one of the guys from my unit was taken [31:34] out and the next day we saw a photo of [31:36] them standing on his helmet [31:38] you know so they would do stuff like [31:39] that but [31:41] for me you know they're trying to show [31:42] how tough they are but from the [31:44] perspective of the grunts that just [31:47] pissed us off [31:48] and we went in and took them out yeah [31:50] and that was you know that was a few [31:52] days before steel curtain kicked off and [31:53] that you know which led to new baby [31:55] which was steel curtain [31:57] steel curtain was the uh was the [31:59] operation up at the syrian border so the [32:01] city of alcom so it was i think like [32:02] went to the 440 district al qaime [32:04] hussein [32:06] and i'm just going from memory and but i [32:08] think i'm right husey but down to [32:10] what they called old ubati [32:12] and new ubati and it basically it ended [32:13] at new baiting as they [32:15] as we fought from east to west all the [32:17] bad guys ended up [32:20] running into a new baby [32:22] and you know like you talked about you [32:23] know they as [32:26] as they were if we were going in [32:29] and fighting you know these guys were [32:31] dressing up like women and hiding [32:32] amongst the sheep the bad guys that try [32:34] to sneak out and you're like wow room [32:36] tough [32:38] tough guys you know it's like you talk a [32:39] big game and then when it comes down to [32:40] it you know you you cower out i'd be [32:42] afraid too if the marine corps was [32:44] coming after me yeah [32:45] and it was yeah it was and it was [32:47] interesting because i mean the fight [32:49] through that area [32:50] you know they spent weeks and weeks and [32:52] weeks basically getting all the the um [32:56] we call them friendlies the the good [32:57] people out of the city by telling them [32:59] hey whoever remains behind [33:02] we are clearing the city we're going [33:04] house to house room to room and if you [33:06] stay [33:08] you're staying to fight [33:11] and some did you know so there were [33:12] encampments up to the north up to down [33:14] to the south where the the residents [33:16] went to live [33:18] and then [33:19] marines basically went through and we we [33:22] provided close air support all the way [33:24] through the city [33:25] which is the one day that i i got ended [33:27] up getting shot [33:29] was that person was that near the uh end [33:31] of your third deployment [33:33] no second that was your second second [33:35] deployment yeah when was the last time [33:37] you were there what point in time 2009 i [33:39] was just there on a staff so [33:40] even though it wasn't like in 2009 [33:42] because i left last time i was i was [33:44] 2005.
document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 218/468,i mean was uh has any of the [33:48] rebuilding [33:49] you know has any of that taken place [33:51] they start rebuilding anything or fixing [33:52] anything or is it still pretty similar [33:54] to the way it looked and i think it was [33:56] it was still pretty similar this was [33:58] when they were trying to [34:00] build up so i was on [34:02] the what they used to be called the mnfi [34:04] marine [34:05] multinational forces iraq it was the [34:07] four-star headquarters there with [34:08] general odierno and basically what we [34:10] were there trying to do was [34:13] transition [34:14] out [34:16] so president obama had [34:18] basically issued the order figure out [34:19] how to uh [34:21] draw down and get out of iraq [34:25] uh properly or [34:27] in the best way so that's what the the [34:29] staff that i was on was doing so it was [34:32] getting you know the ministry of [34:33] interior the ministry of defense the uh [34:36] all those different government entities [34:38] in a position where they could [34:40] start [34:41] policing and governing their own [34:44] country [34:45] but what we found was you know and uh [34:48] and typically i think of this part of [34:49] the world is everybody [34:50] you know you would have the ministry of [34:52] interior [34:53] he wanted to have all the same weapon [34:54] systems as the ministry of defense so [34:56] they wanted mortars and machine guns and [34:58] everything and you're like dude you're [34:59] the you're the police [35:00] so you know and [35:02] so in that that part of the world you [35:04] know if someone has more than you do [35:05] they're stronger than you [35:07] and so everybody wanted to be the [35:09] strongest one [35:10] and so [35:11] it's just difficult to to work with that [35:14] did you find yourself in any uh combat [35:17] situations on your third deployment i [35:19] don't know so it was just all in the [35:21] first and second deployment right did [35:22] you find yourself being in more intense [35:25] combat during your song and deployment [35:26] the reason why i'm asking that is [35:28] at least from my personal experience the [35:30] first time we went out there and this is [35:31] what a lot of grunts would kind of joke [35:33] about is the first time we took out all [35:35] the idiots right all the guys who came [35:37] out waving their ak not really aiming or [35:40] doing anything like that and the second [35:41] time it was you know a lot of people [35:43] coming in from different countries i [35:45] just wanted to shoot americans or [35:47] whatever it was and we found that the [35:49] fighting ended up being more intense [35:51] the second time out there yeah and there [35:53] were a lot of foreign fighters that was [35:54] the reason why we went and [35:56] i think the majority of the reason for [35:58] the the fight up in al qaim was a lot of [36:00] foreign fighters were pouring across the [36:02] border through syria [36:03] so they were coming from [36:05] the different areas and uh you know [36:07] filtering through syria and just [36:09] funneling their way down [36:11] kind of down the euphrates to [36:15] ramadi and so on and so forth so we went [36:16] through and basically just [36:18] put a plug at the border and [36:21] fought everybody through that entire [36:23] area [36:24] so you kept having to stop people from [36:26] coming in and you're having to stop them [36:28] with force [36:29] yeah well yeah i mean the whole time [36:31] yeah exactly so they you know they they [36:33] stopped it and then we basically you [36:35] know the the [36:37] uh the infantry guys [36:38] got on the east end there right by the [36:40] syrian border and they just went through [36:42] so every day you know the the flock [36:44] changed the forward line of troops [36:45] changed [36:46] and we would go out and support whatever [36:48] they needed and a lot of times we would [36:50] you know we were firing hellfire [36:52] missiles many many times just they would [36:55] there would be a guy in a building [36:56] whatever else had called the building [36:57] we'd say [36:58] got it and they cleared hot and [37:00] we'd put a missile in there boom [37:02] and uh [37:04] what was what was the [37:06] largest [37:08] organized combat mission that you're on [37:11] what is one of the most intense [37:12] experiences that you remember that [37:15] that would have to be new beatty the one [37:17] where uh [37:19] um i was telling you where they were [37:20] shooting at us so much it was raining [37:22] raining bullets afterwards that was uh [37:25] that was a crazy crazy morning and uh i [37:27] remember that [37:29] you know like like it was yesterday [37:31] it was a very interesting uh [37:33] thing so [37:35] um segment battalion first marines [37:38] was there a new baity if you if you look [37:40] at new baby on these on the euphrates [37:41] river it's kind of like mickey mouse [37:42] here's what they called it it was almost [37:44] like a heart that was cut off at the [37:46] bottom [37:47] so it was it was bound by the river on [37:49] each side [37:50] and for whatever reason [37:52] um all the bad guys ended up running [37:55] into this [37:56] i don't know if they'd [37:57] i don't [37:58] couldn't tell you why but it was [38:01] probably one of the most one of the [38:02] nicest and most well-built up kind of [38:05] cities in this area where they had they [38:07] had these row homes and they were all in [38:08] a very predictable pattern rows [38:11] like blocks of six or eight [38:13] houses [38:14] all the way across with roads in the [38:16] middle and everything else so it was uh [38:18] it was it was easy for us [38:20] to be able to find targets because it [38:22] was uh what they did was they created [38:24] these they called them grg's grid [38:26] [Music] [38:28] grid reference graphics so they would [38:30] give us this this sheet of paper and [38:33] basically they would circle a group of [38:35] houses and they would call that a [38:37] and then they would number each one of [38:39] those houses so a 1 through [38:41] 20 or whatever and then it would be b c [38:43] d e so when they needed us to hit a [38:45] house they would say hey we got uh we're [38:47] taking fire from a20 [38:49] let me know when you got the target and [38:50] it's like boom pull up the map count it [38:52] you know looking out there one two three [38:53] rows over two five houses oh okay yup [38:55] got it so you're doing that while you're [38:57] in the air more in the air [38:59] yeah [39:00] that's how sophisticated our stuff was [39:02] yeah that's pretty cool though yeah i [39:04] mean it was it was pretty intense [39:06] because they would [39:08] i remember that particular morning it [39:09] was uh [39:11] you know we were down to the south [39:13] and [39:15] uh [39:16] 2-1 [39:17] was getting lined up around the city and [39:19] they had tanks and support as well [39:21] and while they were running around and i [39:22] can't remember his name [39:25] but he was a very very highly thought of [39:27] company commander [39:29] in 2-1 you know we were down south and [39:31] also we saw an explosion [39:33] this big explosion [39:35] and there's a bunch of chatter over the [39:36] radios and figure out what's going on [39:38] and it turned out that [39:40] the company commander um stepped on an [39:43] anti-tank mine i think it was an [39:45] anti-tank rank whatever it was it was [39:47] not good it killed him [39:48] right there on the spot and uh that [39:50] basically kicked off the fighting it was [39:52] i don't know if the the rc the [39:54] regimental commander came up over the [39:56] radio and gave the uh the code word or [39:57] whatever it was but it was like [40:00] go and [40:01] and the fight was on and it was it was [40:04] crazy it was intense like one of those [40:06] where you hear you know people screaming [40:08] over the radios and they had three [40:11] j-techs well they had two forward air [40:12] controllers and a j-tac so um a joint [40:15] terminal attack controller so he was a [40:17] he was not a pilot forward air [40:18] controller being a pilot who's trained [40:20] as a jtac a jtag being a non-pilot who's [40:23] trained as a [40:24] as a joint terminal attack controller [40:27] so we're talking to him on the radio and [40:29] and it's the you know the stuff you you [40:30] see in the movies where people are [40:32] screaming over the radios and i'm taking [40:33] fire [40:34] and [40:35] and we're like okay you know we're [40:37] trying to get in full information so we [40:38] can start narrowing it down and then [40:39] they went quiet [40:41] and really so we're you know we're still [40:43] holding south [40:45] coming in to uh [40:47] you know trying to get more information [40:49] that we can and he comes back on the [40:51] radio he's like you know we need you in [40:52] from the south now and i'm like okay [40:54] roger so we [40:55] we're coming in and is and [40:57] trying to make sure i uh i remember this [41:00] right just in case somebody i know [41:02] or somebody was there [41:04] and correct me [41:05] but as we as we were coming for 10 years [41:07] ago yeah there's been missing details i [41:10] think people understand [41:12] but it's like burned into my mind i [41:13] remember this you know very intensely [41:16] as we're coming in and i remember [41:18] we knew we were on the left third so [41:20] we're working with that guy so we came [41:22] in pointed down at the left third and as [41:24] we're coming in he comes back over the [41:26] radio we need you to hit [41:28] whatever it was d15 [41:30] was the particular house so as we're [41:32] coming in i'm trying to get pulley [41:35] information so he gives it to me [41:36] and and i'm literally i'm flying in and [41:38] as i'm flying in i'm looking at the map [41:41] and i'm counting the houses and the [41:42] roads count houses and roads [41:44] i'm like okay [41:45] got the target where are the friendlies [41:47] and he comes up and i think it was [41:49] i think he said south 75 [41:51] and [41:53] i said i remember i think i it was [41:57] i understand south [41:59] 75 meters [42:00] yes [42:02] okay [42:03] i understand you need me to shoot over [42:05] their heads [42:07] yes [42:08] and then i i can't remember if i even [42:10] asked him [42:12] i think him over and i was i said [42:13] something like you understand what you [42:14] are asking for correct because usually [42:17] danger close distance with rockets i [42:19] think it was over 400 meters [42:22] and [42:23] anybody who's ever seen cobras or hughes [42:25] shoot rockets they're not incredibly [42:27] accurate [42:28] so the worst case scenario is to be [42:31] shooting over friendly heads with [42:33] rockets [42:34] because if you shoot one short [42:36] you know you can hit your own guys [42:38] and so [42:40] we're coming in i'm counting the houses [42:41] i'm talking on the radio [42:43] getting from this guy you know where the [42:44] target we got the target where the [42:46] friend leaves we got the friendlies [42:48] and i remember [42:49] you understand what you're asking for [42:51] and then the company commander came over [42:52] the radio and the company commander came [42:54] over and gave us initials [42:56] you know said this is you know whatever [42:59] you know bravo alpha hotel whatever [43:01] and when the company commander gives his [43:03] initials that's his way of saying i'm [43:05] taking responsibility [43:07] for this i want it and i'm taking [43:10] responsibility for this it's that bad [43:12] and so we're like all right and so i [43:15] remember i'm coming in i'm checking my [43:18] dope i'm telling my gunner [43:20] he's got the 20 i'm like shoot long [43:22] and walk it down you know don't don't go [43:25] on the crosshairs because [43:27] you know just in case [43:28] and uh you know then to compensate for [43:30] drop because sometimes you know when [43:32] things are happening super fast if you [43:33] don't set the drop compensation you [43:35] could have the tar the crosshairs right [43:36] on the target and the and the bullets [43:37] will fall short as they drop so [43:40] shoot long and [43:43] so [43:44] they cleared us hot [43:46] he shot long [43:47] i came in a little bit shot my first [43:49] rocket and i think it went [43:50] right over or right into the target and [43:54] when i knew i was zeroed i just let the [43:56] rest of them go and it was just boom [43:58] boom boom boom boom boom right in the [43:59] target and pulled off and then as i [44:01] pulled off the huey [44:02] it also shot rockets and followed up [44:05] with the minigun so a mini gun shoots [44:07] 3000 rounds per minute [44:09] so 50 rounds per second and they just [44:12] finished up with covering our pull offs [44:14] what they call it cover the pull off so [44:15] he's just throwing a beehive of bullets [44:17] out there [44:18] to uh and that's to give you time to get [44:21] out of there without having any [44:23] uh without being attacked as you're [44:25] escaping in a sense [44:27] and let me rephrase it keep the enemy's [44:28] head down keeping the enemies heads down [44:30] as you're pulling out so you're not [44:32] getting shot from behind yeah and that [44:34] was the awesome thing about having a [44:35] huey with us and the huey and cobra as a [44:38] kind of 100 killer team [44:39] worked really well because [44:41] the huey could always you know the the [44:44] the guns could traverse almost all the [44:45] way backwards [44:47] so they can engage and suppress targets [44:49] until you're completely out in the clear [44:51] so it's nice and what is the longest so [44:54] a lot of times [44:55] i think when somebody who hasn't been in [44:58] combat and they think about a [45:00] combat situation or a firefight you [45:02] often think about what you see in the [45:04] movies and you think you know okay maybe [45:06] what 20 minutes or something like that [45:08] but [45:09] i mean from my experience i was in um an [45:11] eight-hour firefight where it just kept [45:14] going and kept going and it didn't stop [45:16] for such a long time what was the [45:18] longest one that you were part of dude [45:20] were you ever in any [45:21] where you actually had to go back [45:23] resupply refuel and go right back out [45:25] immediately [45:27] yes but generally [45:29] we were limited with our fuel so that [45:31] particular morning that was a that was a [45:33] full two hour flight because not only [45:35] did we we do that but we also [45:38] went off to the west and as the attack [45:40] continued forward [45:42] we were firing hellfire missiles [45:44] off of a predator drone so [45:46] the regimental air officer had a [45:48] predator [45:49] about seven nine thousand feet over the [45:51] city [45:52] so he could look straight down on the [45:54] targets [45:55] so he could find targets with the [45:57] predator [45:58] put a laser right on the target and [46:00] because [46:01] we couldn't see the target [46:03] from the cobra you know three four miles [46:06] away [46:06] he would call the target [46:08] and uh you know tell [46:12] he would basically say laser on [46:14] our missile would pick up the laser and [46:16] we would fire on [46:18] the predator so i mean the ability to [46:20] find targets [46:22] from straight above with the predator [46:23] and then engage them with the cobras [46:24] missiles [46:26] like that was amazing [46:28] because a lot if he could see [46:30] he could see the the friendlies going [46:32] forward then he could see where the [46:33] enemy was gathering so these guys he [46:34] said they were gathering when i talked [46:35] to him afterward they were all gathering [46:37] huddling up in groups behind buildings [46:39] making plans and stuff like that he just [46:40] started dropping missiles right in the [46:42] middle of those guys and that's the same [46:44] one that a lot of people would know [46:45] about if they played call of duty right [46:47] where it shows the black and white [46:49] screen and you could see the little [46:50] figures kind of moving around yeah the [46:52] forward looking infrared the flare [46:54] yeah so those that are not in the [46:56] military or do not know some of that [46:58] terminology just think of call of duty [47:00] right yeah i think those are pretty [47:02] realistic i'm not a gamer but i think [47:04] the games are pretty realistic nowadays [47:06] with they're pretty accurate they're [47:07] like crazy the the visual presentation [47:09] they give like with the uh [47:11] with the forward-looking infrared and [47:12] stuff like that but yeah they would do [47:14] that and i want to switch gears for a [47:16] minute since you retired out you did how [47:18] many years 22.
document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 219/468,22 years retired [47:20] lieutenant colonel which a lieutenant [47:22] colonel is a pretty high ranking [47:24] individual i mean i was always [47:25] intimidated when i saw anyone over [47:27] captain i was like oh crap okay i better [47:30] make sure i have everything squared away [47:32] and i'm doing everything correctly what [47:34] advice or what recommendations would you [47:35] give to somebody who's thinking about [47:37] joining the marine corps whether it be [47:38] enlisted or if they want to go the [47:40] officer route what are some things that [47:42] had you known when you were [47:44] 1920 or whatever it was when you started [47:46] thinking about it that if you had that [47:48] information then it would have made your [47:50] career [47:51] smoother or easier or better or whatever [47:55] yeah well i mean it's [47:57] it's definitely different because if [47:58] you're if you're very young and we used [48:00] to do these things called educators [48:01] workshops at the at the [48:03] depot you may have done one before [48:05] and [48:06] so one of the things we would always [48:08] pass on to the educators [48:10] so that they would [48:11] encourage and mentor the young college [48:14] students is you know not everybody's [48:15] ready to go to college when they finish [48:17] high school [48:18] and it's hard to to get educators or [48:21] anybody everybody wants their kid to go [48:23] to college and [48:24] and and go on from there but not [48:26] everybody's ready for college when they [48:28] when they finish maybe they want an [48:29] adventure they want to go in the marine [48:30] corps and one of the things we always [48:31] tell the educators is you know they go [48:33] in the marine corps they can get [48:35] they'll have tuition assistance so if [48:37] they're smart they can get two years of [48:39] college done and their first two years [48:41] of uh active duty service for free [48:45] because all the colleges on campus [48:47] charge what tuition assistance [48:49] pays [48:51] which they used to [48:52] and so you could get two years of [48:53] college done in the first four years [48:56] and then when you've if you decide to [48:58] get out of the marine corps now you have [48:59] a gi bill that will get you two years to [49:02] your bachelor's degree and then you can [49:03] save the last two years for a master's [49:05] program later on if that's what you want [49:07] to do or a vocational program or [49:10] you know whatever and there's there's [49:11] lots of opportunities for young folks [49:13] and you get the va benefits for the rest [49:15] of your life so you know to buy a house [49:18] and and uh you know whatever it is [49:20] so that's great uh it's a great deal and [49:23] and for the officers you know i always [49:25] say [49:26] using myself as an example so i'm not [49:27] the smartest guy in the world but the [49:29] one thing that i did [49:31] i think that made me successful was i [49:32] just never quit [49:34] and if you never quit if you just keep [49:36] on [49:37] working hard and trying people will [49:39] help you along the way [49:41] so you know i grew up here you know even [49:44] though i was i was lucky you know i i [49:46] had a good career i [49:48] i probably could have been [49:51] so if i wanted to i would have i could [49:52] have been at least competitive for for [49:54] colonel so i could have made it to [49:56] full bird colonel [49:58] had i stayed in longer [50:00] and you know done some [50:01] some other things post command [50:03] you know i had a i was lucky when i was [50:06] in the marine corps i mean i was lucky [50:07] to a point where i had great leadership [50:09] and [50:11] i was fortunate enough to get [50:12] meritorious corporal meritorious staff [50:14] sergeant uh i was also selected for [50:16] marina the quarter and i was uh winner [50:18] drill instructor of the quarter and [50:19] selected for senior drill instructor of [50:21] the quarter but what a lot of people [50:22] don't know is my first year in the [50:24] marine corps my nickname was [ __ ] [50:26] showmer [50:27] and you know i had the mentality where i [50:30] wasn't going to listen to authority i [50:31] joined the marine corps because i [50:33] slacked off when i was in high school [50:34] didn't get the grades that i was capable [50:36] of getting and i thought to myself well [50:38] am i going to go flip burgers the rest [50:39] of my life or i'm gonna go get myself [50:41] into shape and do what i need to do to [50:42] have a successful career and i also you [50:44] know i wanted to be infantry and i [50:46] wanted to be a drill instructor as well [50:47] and when i first got in i saw how much [50:49] the drill instructors were working i [50:50] thought to myself there's no way [50:52] there's no way i'm gonna do that which i [50:53] was lucky enough to do it later on but [50:56] something that i would tell young [50:57] marines when they were joining or [50:59] signing up or even you know um recruits [51:02] at recruit training depot is [51:04] if you [51:05] push yourself and you try to outperform [51:07] everyone what you're going to hear from [51:09] some of your peers is that you're [51:10] kissing ass or you're doing things like [51:12] that and when i said i s you know i said [51:14] you know when you get to a point where [51:15] you're out performing people that's just [51:16] what they're saying because they're not [51:17] capable of doing what you're doing and [51:19] then when you get meritoriously promoted [51:21] and you're collecting a bigger paycheck [51:23] and you're being able to do things [51:24] because you work hard and i got to the [51:26] point where i said to myself i said you [51:28] know [51:29] i never want to be in a position again [51:30] where somebody has to tell me to do [51:32] something [51:33] i always want to do it before i'm told [51:36] and anytime somebody said hey how come [51:38] you didn't do this or how come your [51:39] uniform doesn't look good it was like i [51:41] was slapping myself in the face because [51:43] i didn't have it done beforehand and i [51:45] felt bad not because they were telling [51:47] me that i had to fix it but because i [51:49] didn't take the initiative to fix it [51:50] beforehand and i think just having that [51:52] mentality alone like always have it done [51:55] so nobody else can tell you that you [51:57] didn't fix it you know never let [51:58] somebody do that and just by doing that [52:00] alone and then as i moved up and i would [52:02] see junior marines working hard and [52:04] pushing themselves then i wanted to help [52:06] them [52:07] you know i want to do what i could so [52:09] for example you know with the marine [52:11] corps martial arts program right you're [52:12] supposed to be a certain rank in order [52:14] to get certain belt levels [52:16] you know i would have young marines who [52:17] were just working their asses off and i [52:19] would push it through the chain of [52:20] command so they can get their belt i'm [52:22] like this guy is working hard he's [52:23] putting in the time he's putting in the [52:25] effort he's done the entire syllabus and [52:27] putting up the chain and then they they [52:29] give him the belt or you know he earns [52:31] it though right but they they allow it [52:33] for something that maybe you need you [52:35] have you're supposed to be sergeant to [52:36] be a black belt but now corporal is a [52:38] black belt well it means something when [52:41] uh you know people take the time to [52:44] to show [52:45] do something like that you [52:46] let somebody progress ahead of their [52:48] peers [52:49] and [52:50] what does it do in reality it uh it [52:53] pushes their peers [52:54] they're like oh it is possible [52:57] and then [52:59] and then it motivates them to you know [53:01] well [ __ ] if he can do it i guess if i [53:02] if i put in the effort maybe i can do it [53:04] too [53:05] and that uh [53:07] i think especially in the marine corps [53:08] when you get the people the right the [53:10] right balance people that want to be [53:12] competitive and want to work hard and [53:14] and do those different things [53:16] it pays off [53:17] and i remember seeing that you know at [53:18] the recruit depot with guys like joe [53:20] alvarez you know we my sergeant major [53:22] and i star major wayne peterson [53:25] sorry mater how you doing she's out [53:27] there he's retired now [53:28] but super guy uh sorry major peterson [53:31] but we we fought hard to get [53:33] joe meritoriously promoted to gunny [53:35] which is meritorious promotion of staff [53:36] sergeant's hard [53:38] meritorious promotion to gunny is even [53:40] harder really hard so wait did he get [53:42] merry tourists gunny oh yeah oh that's [53:43] awesome yeah we got a meritoriously [53:44] promoted a gunny well i'll say we got [53:46] him [53:47] we pushed him [53:49] and he earned it oh absolutely now he [53:52] was one of my you know i told a lot of [53:54] people about this because when you move [53:55] up as a drill instructor it's it's nice [53:57] if you're if you're in a company that [54:00] sees how hard you're working when you [54:02] move up [54:03] one of the hookups is they'll give you a [54:05] really strong j [54:06] right a really strong team so if you're [54:08] the senior you don't have to work as [54:09] hard yeah you know and that was one of [54:11] the best things he was [54:13] uh i believe it was my last cycle [54:15] i was a senior senior and he was my jay [54:17] and he made it so easy i didn't have to [54:19] do anything it was so nice i mean he ran [54:22] the entire thing yeah superb guy and [54:23] that's why you know and i zeroed in on [54:25] certain [54:26] drill instructors um chief warrant [54:28] officer bergeron another one he's [54:30] watching and i was i always give him a [54:31] hard time about this [54:32] i had a staff sergeant who was an [54:34] awesome awesome marine [54:37] but um [54:39] i think his [54:40] his first year on the depot or so just [54:42] wasn't he was like the [54:44] the honor man in his di class [54:46] had done phenomenally well but [54:49] there was a certain time down at the [54:50] recruit depot where being a uh you know [54:52] by the book marine was [54:54] not look at very highly and he was one [54:57] of those guys he was gonna do the right [54:59] thing and [55:00] he got caught up in a uh in a staff that [55:02] was you know not didn't promote those [55:04] kinds of things and kind of killed his [55:06] morale a little bit and [55:08] he came to support battalion he worked [55:09] out at the swim tanks so he was mcquis [55:12] uh a water survival instructor [55:15] and i just came to realize you know this [55:17] guy's really really sharp and i started [55:20] pushing him [55:21] it's like hey i think you should put in [55:23] for the warrant officer package john i'm [55:24] like i don't have the asvab score i [55:26] can't do it i was like someone i asked [55:29] them you know hey [55:31] is it too late to take the asvab and [55:32] they say well it won't make it in time [55:34] for the board but as long as he takes it [55:37] and gets it [55:38] up to the depot [55:40] before the packages go to headquarters [55:42] marine corps then we're good so i told [55:43] him and that's had kept pushing and kept [55:45] pushing and kept pushing [55:47] when are you gonna do it and it was kind [55:48] of like reluctant that i just didn't i [55:50] think he didn't think he was good enough [55:51] to do it and i was like [55:53] you're you're way more than good enough [55:55] to do this so we finally you know we [55:57] worked on got his package in took the [55:59] asvab got the azab score in there right [56:01] like like [56:02] literally right before they went to [56:03] headquarters marine corps [56:05] first round selection warrant officer [56:08] i'm glad you brought that story up too [56:09] because a lot of [56:11] young enlisted marines are really [56:13] intimidated by [56:15] you know officers that are higher up [56:16] such as yourself [56:18] and the thing is you know talking to you [56:20] right now and hanging out it's you know [56:22] you're you're just like us you know [56:23] you're you're there and you want to take [56:25] care of them you want to do what you can [56:27] to move them up and help them get [56:28] promoted so something that might be [56:30] valuable to any young marine that's [56:32] listening to this to know that a lot of [56:34] the officers are there and they're on [56:36] their side you know they're often [56:38] worried like oh no the officer is the [56:39] only one that i see when i get in [56:40] trouble and i have to stand in front of [56:42] you know the man that's like no if they [56:44] come out and they seek you guys out and [56:46] they ask for your help you're gonna help [56:47] them and you're gonna do what you can to [56:49] move them up which i've seen quite often [56:51] throughout your career that you told me [56:52] about where [56:53] marines were uh [56:55] pushed into a better position because [56:57] you were there to [56:59] support what they were doing and you're [57:01] able to see how much work they were [57:02] putting in and you know not as we said [57:06] with the first sergeant alvarez where [57:08] you didn't give him gunny but you were [57:10] in a position to be able to help him [57:13] in a sense get what he had earned and [57:15] worked very hard for [57:17] yeah and i think especially in his case [57:19] i believe that year there were [57:22] there was one spot and it was kind of [57:24] like a toss-up i think between the east [57:25] coast and west coast [57:27] and we were able to get that second spot [57:29] because it was another marine i think [57:30] it's uh first stars you might be a star [57:32] major no i think with hidalgo [57:34] another superb guy i mean just [57:37] stellar marines it's hard you know when [57:38] you got these two guys or just stellar [57:40] dudes and i think what they did was [57:42] because joe was so good [57:46] they were able to get that second [57:47] meritorious spot to san diego and get it [57:49] for him so he got the second meritorious [57:51] spot so we ended up getting two [57:52] meritorious gunnies that [57:54] that year his being the second both on [57:56] the depot both on the depot yeah yeah [57:58] both uh yeah both on uh depot recruiting [58:01] for san diego and that was a big win for [58:03] us you know because it was like you know [58:05] wow you did so well we were able to get [58:07] an extra [58:08] meritorious gunny spot [58:10] um because i think they were going back [58:12] and forth well there's one for sure we [58:14] might have two we don't know and [58:16] and we pushed so hard and i think they [58:17] finally realized this guys i mean he was [58:19] a [58:20] he was a mcmap instructor he was a [58:22] mcquist i.
document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 220/468,t i think it was a instructor [58:25] trainer and and the water survival [58:28] um [58:29] stellar [58:30] all the way around you know multiple [58:32] combat tours and he's a scout sniper [58:34] he's done more combat tours since then [58:36] yeah i mean just [58:38] just i mean you look at him and you're [58:39] like you know okay this is a combat [58:42] marine you know and not to take away [58:43] from uh first hidalgo i think he might [58:46] have been he was admin or one of the [58:47] support establishment mosses and [58:50] and there's certainly nothing wrong with [58:52] that but i think there's there's [58:54] something to be said for the guys that [58:56] are gonna be going into the combat arms [58:58] that are just [58:59] stellar superb guys super highly trained [59:02] you know so one day when he's a sergeant [59:04] major you know he's been there he's been [59:06] to the depot two tours he's been on [59:08] multiple combat tours um [59:11] he understands the process he knows how [59:13] to take care of people everything else [59:14] so when he becomes a sergeant major [59:16] he's already gotten all those [59:18] experiences and oh by the way he's a [59:19] combat arms guy on top of it all [59:22] and uh you know as we all well know in [59:24] the marine corps on the infantry side [59:26] the infantry is the main effort for [59:27] everything the marine corps does [59:29] backbone yeah the backbone everybody [59:31] else in the marine corps supports the [59:32] infantry [59:33] period so that's actually an analogy [59:36] that we use at camis and k9s right the [59:40] veterans within the program are the [59:42] backbone and then everything else [59:44] supports it how did you become involved [59:46] with cam using canines being the vice [59:48] president [59:49] well actually kalani and i served on the [59:51] depot together and that's where we we [59:53] got to know each other and um [59:56] you know the different interactions and [59:57] i had no idea about the struggles i was [59:59] lieutenant colonel he was a captain so [60:01] he's probably and he wasn't one of my [60:02] marines [60:03] but you know we kind of gravitated [60:05] toward each other and you know i got to [60:07] know him there and um [60:10] like i said i didn't know any part of [60:11] the story i didn't know the struggles he [60:13] was going through and then you know i [60:14] left the depot i think we [60:16] loosely stayed in contact [60:18] and then [60:20] you know he came back from his uh in [60:22] situations he'd had up north came back [60:24] to san diego [60:27] i ran into him at a networking mixer [60:30] a uh [60:31] veterans beer club [60:33] bbc yeah veterans beer club [60:35] i think it was the one down in coronado [60:37] so you know ran into them there and we [60:39] just kind of reconnected and [60:40] and i was uh i was [60:43] post divorce at that point and just kind [60:45] of you know [60:47] doing a lot of things myself and felt [60:48] like you know hey i need to do more [60:50] now and uh you know do stuff for the [60:53] community it was kind of like you know i [60:55] like [60:56] i don't i don't care for recognition for [60:58] anything i do but i like to help people [61:00] along and um [61:01] so i was like you know i like to you [61:03] know volunteer so i just started [61:04] volunteering with cameras and canines [61:06] doing different you know booths or [61:07] different events and stuff like that and [61:08] he just asked me if he wanted to team up [61:10] with you and him and i said yeah of [61:12] course we'll do that and [61:14] and uh kind of the rest is history and [61:16] starting a non-profit is a lot of work [61:19] oh my god and you know there's and and [61:21] you guys do the lion's share of it i [61:23] mean no i'll be honest yeah you do more [61:24] than what you take credit for but [61:27] a lot of people out there i hear quite [61:28] often you probably do as well [61:31] once people see that you're operating a [61:33] 501c3 nonprofit and you're doing things [61:36] within the community you have other [61:38] people who want to embark on the same [61:40] thing or they want to start their own [61:41] non-profit and they want to help the [61:43] community or they want to help dogs they [61:44] want to help you know name it [61:47] what are some things that you might be [61:48] able to give them as advice for when [61:51] they're starting out or things that have [61:53] maybe [61:54] helped you along the way [61:55] well i mean it's [61:57] you know like they say and everything [61:58] else it's network network network is is [62:00] have a good network of people [62:03] that can at least introduce you or [62:05] you know help you along with other folks [62:07] that may not be able to provide [62:09] financial assistance but can provide [62:11] business assistance or you know just [62:13] advice [62:15] things to think of because [62:16] like i've always talked about you know [62:17] even when i was active duty i never [62:20] could think of everything on my own and [62:21] i always [62:22] would rely on you know my junior guys to [62:25] you know officer and enlisted to come up [62:27] with ideas about stuff so it's you know [62:30] it's branching out and [62:32] seeing who has good ideas and things [62:34] that will work and [62:35] you know who has a good business acumen [62:37] who has uh you know networks of folks [62:39] that can volunteer you know people that [62:40] want to donate because like i always say [62:43] you know here you know with candies and [62:44] canines is [62:46] a lot of people support us but they [62:47] don't have the time to to do what we do [62:50] but they can support us financially [62:52] so that we can do [62:55] what they like [62:56] that we're doing so you know that's [62:59] that's what's helpful and beneficial to [63:00] us is folks that can help us out [63:02] financially because it is you know it is [63:04] very expensive and like we always say [63:07] 100 of [63:08] everything we do goes right back into [63:10] cammies and canines and it's just you [63:12] know if it's not going into [63:14] the veterans specifically it's going [63:16] into you know you and kalani putting gas [63:18] in your car so that you can [63:19] go do things you know it's not [63:21] taking care of the dogs yeah i mean [63:23] we're not making any money on this it's [63:25] you know any everything that's spent is [63:26] spent toward canvas and canines what's [63:29] great and i think what you said is [63:30] perfect too with the networking because [63:32] the networking that we have done with [63:34] cammies and canines has really helped [63:36] continue to support what we're doing you [63:38] know i mean for example recently ib pets [63:40] which is a local pet store here in the [63:42] san diego area they just donated 900 [63:44] pounds of dog food and then we also have [63:47] lucy pet which is up in los angeles they [63:50] donated 3 000 pounds of dog food so if [63:53] you're trying to start a non-profit a [63:55] 501 c 3 absolutely networking getting [63:58] those connections because the support of [64:00] the community is really what makes a [64:02] non-profit thrive it really what helps [64:05] make the nonprofit successful and what [64:06] we always say is you know cammies and [64:08] canines is not [64:10] our non-profit it's the communities you [64:12] know everybody is part of it so by kind [64:15] of having that mentality and noting that [64:18] you're starting a 501c3 for the [64:20] community when you look at it that way i [64:22] think it really helps the growth and it [64:24] kind of gives everybody a sense of [64:26] ownership in a way because everybody's a [64:28] part of it and having to grow in another [64:30] big part which we're constantly trying [64:32] to do and it's always [64:33] a struggle is that social media is kind [64:36] of getting out there showing people what [64:38] you're doing and that's going to help [64:40] get people to want to help and continue [64:41] to support what it is that you're doing [64:43] now you're also [64:45] one of the co-founders of on-season [64:47] canine nutrition [64:49] a lot of people want to be entrepreneurs [64:51] i think that's something that is [64:52] becoming more and more popular being an [64:54] entrepreneur [64:56] what advice would you give for young [64:57] entrepreneurs trying to start out [65:00] everything is not easy [65:02] you know i mean it's [65:04] everything is is a lot of work and you [65:06] know i've always used the analogy of [65:07] growing up businesses you know i think [65:09] back when the dot-com boom happened you [65:11] know i always use [65:12] i always use the tree analogy and i [65:14] think i i use the tree analogy with you [65:16] the other day didn't i help [65:17] if a business grows you know like a tree [65:19] a tree if a tree grew too fast the first [65:22] storm that hit it would blow it over [65:23] because the roots wouldn't be strong [65:25] enough to hold it up [65:26] so the analogy i always use is is out of [65:28] a tree you know a tree's roots grow [65:31] commensurate with the tree so that when [65:33] a storm comes it can withstand the storm [65:35] if uh [65:38] like i said if tree grows up too fast [65:40] like a business if the business grows [65:42] too fast and the roots aren't really set [65:44] then it probably can't weather the first [65:45] storm and so [65:47] it's being patient and you know life [65:48] cycle of a business is i think you [65:50] really don't see [65:52] moderate success at least for about [65:54] three to five years it takes time and [65:56] then um and then things start to happen [65:59] pretty quickly [66:00] so the snowball effect yeah so you know [66:02] for us [66:03] starting and it's like okay we have you [66:05] know [66:06] several hundred bags of dog food and [66:07] it's like okay now what do we do [66:09] if we if we grow too fast then we can't [66:12] keep up with demand [66:14] but if we don't create demand then we [66:15] don't sell our products so it's like [66:17] trying to find that [66:18] that happy medium you know of okay [66:20] we're we're in a good spot because you [66:22] know we are so small it takes time when [66:24] we say oh like we did with the salmon [66:26] oh we want to do salmon well what's [66:28] what's the process well we got to call [66:29] the pouch manufacturer who are awesome [66:31] guys american pouch converters awesome [66:33] dudes [66:34] they're jim andre and drastic also [66:37] veteran owned yeah also veteran owned he [66:38] was an army and marine corps veteran so [66:40] um [66:41] great guys i remember calling him up and [66:43] he's like brother i got you you know we [66:45] can do this [66:46] and made awesome pouches for us and then [66:48] so but that takes time put the order in [66:50] takes time because we're not the only [66:52] customer he has so he's got to put us in [66:53] line [66:54] get our pouches filled with the product [66:56] and then when they're all done get them [66:57] sent back to us so you know it's not a [67:00] it's not an immediate process and we're [67:02] small fry so you know we had to jump in [67:03] line if we were a huge [67:06] order i'm sure they would drop [67:07] everything and fill all of our stuff [67:09] first but we're not so it's uh [67:11] you know it's the process of of just you [67:13] know growing slowly and [67:15] growing correctly and one of my favorite [67:17] quotes talking about the tree that is [67:19] knocked over [67:20] becoming an entrepreneur this is [67:22] being part of on-season canine i think [67:24] is my sixth company [67:27] in total and uh let me tell you all the [67:29] other ones are not running and it's [67:31] you're gonna fail at times right and [67:32] failing forward [67:34] you know that's one of my favorite [67:35] quotes as cliche as it sounds fail [67:36] forward i think too many people [67:39] they become very excited about something [67:41] they start it [67:42] it doesn't work out the way that they [67:43] planned and they quit you know and i was [67:46] reading this book a while back i don't [67:47] remember what book it was but i loved [67:49] the story that the author wrote and he's [67:51] basically talking about this young man [67:52] who wants to start a company and he [67:54] called it [67:55] uh four up [67:56] you know and it was a soda company that [67:58] he wanted to start and it wasn't [68:00] successful and then he started another [68:01] one called five up and and that one [68:03] failed and he said you know what i'm [68:05] gonna try another one so he tried six up [68:07] and that one failed and he quit and [68:09] about a year later 7up came out and blew [68:11] up and he made millions in it you know [68:12] and he wasn't part of it because he quit [68:14] too soon so the big thing you know if [68:16] you're going to be an entrepreneur is to [68:17] not quit is to push through the hard [68:19] times is to you know focus on [68:23] focus on everything that we do and this [68:25] is you know i relate a lot of things to [68:27] dog training a lot of people know i'm a [68:28] dog trainer is motivation whether it's [68:31] motivation to access something pleasant [68:33] or motivation to prevent something [68:34] unpleasant [68:35] and i'm i love tony robbins i love [68:38] listening to him talk and one thing he [68:39] talks about is you know figure out [68:42] try to [68:43] focus on what [68:45] where the rewards are far too often [68:46] people think about the pain right the [68:48] pain of doing something oh i don't want [68:49] to do it but they're not focused on the [68:52] benefit of doing the hard work right [68:54] it's like oh i don't want to go to the [68:55] gym the gym is a lot of hard work but if [68:57] you focus on the value the benefits that [68:59] you get from working out and that's your [69:01] main focus then going to work out is the [69:03] easy part because you know it's going to [69:04] increase your health it's going to [69:06] increase the way that you feel you're [69:07] going to be better day to day you're [69:08] going to live longer you're going to be [69:09] healthier all these different things so [69:11] focusing on the right thing because [69:14] we're the only creatures that can really [69:15] decide what it is that we focus on you [69:18] know when somebody else said it they [69:19] said embrace the suck right yeah [69:21] that's a common term embrace yeah [69:23] especially for marines you know it's [69:25] like [69:25] it sucks it's cold it's wet it sucks but [69:30] there's going to be something [69:32] and one of my i'm gonna do a shout out [69:34] to one of my favorite authors uh tim [69:36] ferriss i even i listened i subscribed [69:38] to his podcast and he wrote the four [69:40] hour work week and i've read that book [69:42] probably three times i also bought a [69:45] copy and sent it to kalani i need to [69:47] give you a copy of it as well but [69:50] reading through it that was actually one [69:52] of the [69:53] main inspirations that helped start on [69:56] season k9 because when i was reading it [69:59] far too often we get our own way we [70:01] think that something's not obtainable we [70:03] think oh how can we start a dog food [70:05] company how you know how are we going to [70:06] be able to create the product how are we [70:07] going to be able to do and you get [70:08] overwhelmed by thinking of all the [70:09] different things that you have to do [70:11] and then once you realize that it is a [70:12] possibility it becomes much easier which [70:15] leads me to the last point that i want [70:17] to say is if you are starting a business [70:20] find a good team [70:21] right finding a good team is probably [70:23] one of the most important things and it [70:25] has to be a good team because you don't [70:26] want to get a bad team because they [70:27] never know people you can trust i think [70:28] is you know the biggest thing [70:30] and that's huge finding that good team [70:33] someone that you trust someone that [70:34] you're good to work with and you're [70:36] willing to work with even when it does [70:37] suck yeah [70:39] that's true well i mean and you know and [70:41] hopefully in five to ten years you know [70:42] you're on the joe rogan show [70:45] you're on his podcast he has a podcast [70:46] right yeah i think i see some of those [70:48] um on youtube i usually follow jiu-jitsu [70:51] podcasts you know when they're talking [70:52] to eddie bravo and all the other guys [70:53] when they're talking about those things [70:55] but well i train at eddie bravo's gym [70:57] that was it that's ten points [70:59] okay that's eddie [71:00] yep yep yep and joe rogan helped him [71:02] name it oh did he but i was also [71:04] fortunate enough to be on the fighter [71:05] and the kid so the fighter and the kid [71:07] is brian callan and uh brendan chob okay [71:10] who is a ufc champion fighter uh retired [71:13] recently and i was lucky enough to be on [71:15] there for probably 15 minutes it was a [71:16] will sasso episode and will sasso was [71:19] running late so brian cowan i trained [71:21] his dog so brian khan said you know [71:22] let's just start talking for a little [71:23] bit and i'm sitting there like really [71:25] okay you know he gets a million [71:27] downloads a month so that was really [71:28] intimidating but fun at the same time [71:30] yeah that's good yeah but like i said [71:32] you know you'll you'll be on joe rogan's [71:34] show talking about the first five [71:35] failures you had and [71:37] and you know and and how you're [71:38] successful now and that you know the [71:40] whole point is [71:41] never quit [71:43] you know and a lot of the [71:45] one of the things i used to tell [71:46] especially my junior marines was you [71:48] know say you know hey i'm just a regular [71:50] dude i grew up in san diego i went to i [71:54] live in claremont went to point loma [71:55] high school i was just a regular kid i [71:57] was the uh i guess you want to call it [71:59] the top gun generation top gun came out [72:01] when i was 16 so i'm dating myself i was [72:03] 86 yes i'm 49 almost [72:05] a month and a half [72:07] so i'll be 49 on my next birthday but [72:09] so as you know the top gun generation [72:12] you know we all wanted to go fly for the [72:13] navy or we don't know whatever we all [72:15] want to go fly f14s and and and do all [72:18] that cool stuff [72:19] but i never really understood the [72:20] process right so i was just a regular [72:22] high school kid i mean i i [72:24] went through i didn't set the world on [72:26] fire [72:27] and so i ended up going to community [72:29] college i went to mesa college here in [72:31] san diego [72:32] and took some time even then to figure [72:34] it out because what i think is is [72:37] beneficial is when you have parents that [72:38] have gone through the process they [72:40] understand the college process and what [72:41] you need to do you kind of have a leg up [72:44] well my neither one of my parents did [72:45] you know we were [72:47] i was [72:48] you know my sister and i grew up great [72:50] you know pretty much straight middle [72:51] class here in claremont and we had good [72:54] lives but neither one of our parents [72:55] went to college [72:56] so i had to figure it all out on my own [72:58] so you know once again never quit and [73:00] show up you know back in the old days [73:02] and people won't understand this now you [73:04] couldn't do everything online you [73:05] actually had to fill out a form and go [73:08] stand in line [73:09] at the school and wait your turn [73:12] turn it into admissions [73:14] pick your classes i mean it was just a [73:15] whole different kind of process you [73:17] really had to [73:18] put in a lot of effort you couldn't just [73:20] sit in your house on your computer and [73:21] do it back then [73:22] and [73:23] back then 1988 [73:27] so [73:29] the community college and try to figure [73:31] out and that's when i kind of got [73:32] learned i was dating a girl then whose [73:34] dad was a marine corps pilot and so i [73:36] was like oh that sounds pretty cool and [73:37] he kind of [73:38] introduced me to the process of how to [73:40] you know get [73:41] go see officer selection officer and the [73:43] whole bit so i did that while i was in [73:45] college and transferred to san diego [73:47] state [73:48] in my junior year i went to officer [73:49] candidate school 10 week course out in [73:52] quantico [73:54] and then i came back did one more year [73:56] of school and then i was commissioned in [73:57] 1993 [73:59] and [74:00] you know it was a [74:01] you know the whole thing is you know [74:03] like i said i wasn't the smartest guy in [74:04] the world there were a lot of people [74:06] that had way better grades than i did [74:08] but [74:09] i just kind of just [74:10] never quit i just kept plugging through [74:12] and plugging through and finally got it [74:14] went to ocs and got my commission i was [74:17] contracted to go to flight school and [74:19] went to flight school and [74:21] you know i think [74:22] academically especially with uh [74:24] like multiple choice tests i struggled [74:26] with those at the [74:27] the basic school i was just not a good [74:29] multiple choice test taker like [74:31] everything else i did really really well [74:32] in but i just was terrible at multiple [74:34] choice tests and it carried over to [74:35] flight school where i had some trouble [74:37] with those but my flying was always good [74:39] so [74:40] i just never quit i just kept powering [74:43] through and [74:44] and uh you know made it through flight [74:45] school got my wings made it to the to [74:47] the hmla communities flying cobras [74:50] did well there and that's where i worked [74:52] hard and kept working and working work [74:54] and learned you know was very [74:55] interesting to me so i learned all the [74:57] weapons systems did really well and [74:59] within three years or so [75:01] was able to attend uh webs and taxes [75:03] instructor course you know which is a [75:05] high level graduate level aviation [75:07] training school so i got to do that in [75:08] the cobra which was pretty prestigious [75:10] and and just kind of continued on from [75:12] there so i was i was very lucky and it [75:15] just came down to [75:16] hard work and perseverance i mean that's [75:18] i think perseverance is a big word and [75:20] that actually made me think of something [75:21] far too often when somebody is trying to [75:23] attempt to do something they want that [75:25] tree to grow really fast or they're [75:27] trying to [75:28] take on a challenge that may be too big [75:30] for them at the time and it doesn't mean [75:32] that they can't get to that point [75:34] but multiple [75:35] successful opportunities i think help [75:38] create more successful opportunities and [75:39] it helps it grow and [75:41] uh an analogy i heard a while back which [75:43] i thought was an absolutely brilliant [75:44] analogy [75:46] if you're trying to if you're [75:48] just now start trying to uh work out [75:50] right you want to start working out you [75:51] want to get into shape you can't sit [75:53] down on a bench and put 300 pounds on [75:55] and start knocking out reps you have to [75:57] start with just the bar you have to get [75:58] your muscle warmed up and then you have [76:00] to add weight and you slowly add to it [76:02] and everybody knows that's the process [76:04] that you have to take in order to [76:05] increase your muscle and increase your [76:07] strength and we need to look at [76:09] everything like that start small get [76:11] multiple successful opportunities or [76:13] multiple successful [76:15] events and that's going to help create [76:17] more successful events and it's also [76:19] going to boost your confidence because [76:20] if you try something too difficult [76:23] and you fail [76:24] then i think that's when some people [76:26] will quit so start small get those small [76:30] wins over and over again that increases [76:32] the confidence which helps get you in a [76:34] better position to do something even [76:36] more challenging and to become that [76:38] super successful person right yeah as we [76:40] both learned with uh jiu jitsu yeah i've [76:43] been doing jiu jitsu for about a year [76:44] now and it um [76:46] you know for me it's been life-changing [76:48] where [76:48] you know you wouldn't think and i kind [76:50] of blew it off for a little while my my [76:52] little one was going and i wasn't [76:53] blowing it off but i was a little [76:55] intimidated but also want to make sure [76:56] that i was physically ready at my [76:58] advanced age to start jiu jitsu and [77:02] it's been amazing i mean i i can't think [77:04] of any better like [77:06] physical and mental therapy than [77:08] jiu-jitsu and you sit and wonder why you [77:10] know after a year why am i still making [77:12] the same mistake and still getting my [77:13] butt kicked because like he said it is a [77:16] slow process there's a reason why it [77:18] takes [77:19] seven to ten years to get a black belt [77:21] in jiu jitsu is because [77:23] it is i mean a minute by minute learning [77:25] process and you don't learn it in a year [77:28] you don't learn it in two years i mean [77:30] you're always learning but you know to [77:32] get to that level it takes a long long [77:34] time and i think sometimes people just [77:35] don't have the patience to [77:38] to wait you know it's so complex yeah [77:40] that sport is so complex i thought i [77:43] thought that i was so good at grappling [77:45] when i got out of the marine corps since [77:46] i was a black belt instructor in the [77:47] marine corps which is you know it's like [77:49] mixed martial arts you know it's more [77:52] oriented towards combat and i signed up [77:55] at a school in l.

Whether you were supplied this dog-training series directly from Nate Schoemer, or you discovered this product separately (perhaps through learning about us on the series Rescue Dog to Super Dog on Animal Planet), the following is a highly detailed system to revolutionize life with your canine companion. The purpose of dog-training is to enhance relationships between dogs and their owners. Implementation of training principles is designed to put you and your dog on the same page together. Dogs especially are animals that are loyal to their owners; with a desire to please. This is why a dog may live in confusion as she notices how her owners are unhappy, but the poor pup doesn’t understand why. Because communication is weak, the situation never improves, the owner remains frustrated, and the dog remains confused. Sadly, this pattern can deteriorate the relationship, and in the worst case scenarios prompt an owner to give the dog away to a shelter (where it is eventually put down). I believe it’s essential to stop this pattern, improve the lives of dogs and their owners and thus save the lives of dogs in the process. In summary, dog training is the process of helping your dog to understand your expectations. As they are not capable of cognitive reasoning as is practiced by us bi-pedal mammals, we must instead use systems of conditioning, pattern-recognition, and positive habit forming to create our desired results, and help the dog to comprehend our thoughts and feelings. Together, we can help you and your dog to enjoy a brighter future with your canine companion!"

to sit down and have a [00:12] conversation I'm really excited about [00:13] this episode because I know you've done [00:15] so many things in your life and you have [00:17] so much wisdom and so much that you [00:18] could share to my audience and people [00:20] listening that want to go out and be an [00:22] entrepreneur they want to do things and [00:24] really make a difference so before [00:26] getting started if you want just you [00:28] know give a little introduction of [00:29] yourself to everybody listening I'm not [00:31] sure I have a lot of wisdom a lot of [00:34] experience so I was born here in LA I [00:37] grew up through high school here in LA I [00:40] went to a Jesuit High School went back [00:42] east to college came back did a few of [00:45] things like writing a children's book [00:47] and then got into real estate now my [00:50] most 8 company and you've been in real [00:52] estate for a little while now right at [00:54] 45 years it's a real estate brokerage

into with a huge yard because [01:19] you know I have the dogs they need to [01:21] run around you know hundreds for their [01:23] and horses and yeah and you're gonna be [01:27] get another dog eventually as well so [01:29] you know that way I have a yard to watch [01:31] your dog when you need somebody yeah [01:36] thank you very much another lap right [01:38] labs are amazing dogs it was a

[01:49] good job he was a really sweet dog [01:51] so before we start talking about the [01:52] real estate cuz I do want to talk about [01:54] that but you've done some amazing things [01:55] you told me in stories before while we [01:57] were hanging out having a couple [01:59] cocktails you know and the one that [02:01] really fascinated me was the the [02:04] involvement that you had during the time [02:06] of Martin Luther King so you're out [02:09] there and you did a lot of things to [02:10] contribute and help out can you talk a [02:12] little bit about that [02:13] Wow that's a long time ago funny you [02:17] asked cuz I just watched Ken Burns great [02:20] documentary on the Vietnam War [02:23] and it covers the period from our [02:28] involvement there until the end in the [02:30] mid 70s but during that period [02:31] coinciding with it was the civil rights [02:34] movement 60th and so I was in college it [02:39] would have been 1965 and somebody's that [02:42] friends of mine and I from college went [02:44] down to Selma because there was that [02:46] with the center of activity was and [02:49] we're hanging out in me there was the [02:51] AME Zion Church heard Martin Luther King [02:54] speak because this is 65 before you shot [02:57] and a number of civil rights leaders and [03:01] we were all considered to be communist [03:04] or nefarious people who were acting you [03:07] know against the best interests of our [03:09] government so it was a little bit a [03:11] little bit tight to say that was super [03:14] dangerous there are some kids who were [03:16] killed there there were some people [03:17] killed on the bridge that we marched on [03:19] and well they have it earlier but I was [03:22] not involved in that particular day but [03:24] you know it was a very active time in [03:26] our particular for college kids and the [03:30] civil rights movement and the people who [03:32] were in this out but during that time I [03:34] believe Lyndon Johnson our president [03:37] gave a speech that got Congress to pass [03:39] the 1965 Civil Rights Act it was it was [03:43] important period their wife and their [03:45] country's life Dennis yeah and so those [03:49] sort of Jo that was probably yeah I want [03:52] to hear all that stuff and I know my [03:54] audience or our audience rather would [03:56] like to hear all of it as well it's [03:57] fascinating because not that many people [03:59] know somebody who was part of that [04:01] movement and help support you know I [04:02] feel okay well I was a reminder then I [04:05] was remarked nothing really happened to [04:06] me except the time we were exiting [04:09] Selma down what I thought was an unknown [04:11] Road which was mistake we're traveling [04:14] down it stopped by police cars took us [04:17] to some remote town threw me in jail for [04:20] some remote reason and what was the [04:22] reason that I speeding put up in there [04:25] Victorians you [04:27] they didn't I think that there was some [04:29] you know white boys meaning good old [04:32] boys who were in the cell with me and [04:33] there's a big seller but no seven guys [04:35] that didn't appreciate college kids like [04:37] me at coming in the north so we got a [04:40] few scuffles I did not want to spend the [04:42] night in jail that night how'd you do in [04:45] the scuffle how'd I do yeah did you hold [04:47] your ground pretty well yeah I wasn't [04:51] like you it was not to be a fighter I [04:55] get my butt kicked all the time and then [04:58] you know there's a lot of other cool [05:00] stories that you told me before you've [05:02] been you grew up in LA so you've been [05:04] out here the entire time and you've been [05:05] pretty successful and I know at some [05:07] point you had a beautiful piece of [05:09] property out here and a lot of [05:10] celebrities would even come down and [05:12] hang out with you right well I don't [05:15] most beautiful Iran had a big view and [05:17] at the time there were yeah some actors [05:20] that were hadn't quite made it [05:21] yeah and they came to hang out cuz I had [05:23] a pool I don't mention their names only [05:26] because yeah that's okay but I thought [05:29] that was really awesome when you were [05:30] telling me that story I couldn't believe [05:31] it they had all these different people [05:33] coming constantly to your house hanging [05:35] out with you and so you know you know a [05:37] lot of people within the industry that [05:39] people are so fascinated about you know [05:40] the industry of Corey would the movie [05:42] industry maybe at the time this would [05:44] have been in the seventies early [05:46] eighties perhaps I'm not in any way part [05:52] of Hollywood anymore so I can't be [05:53] blamed for what's going on [05:55] right after the events that took place [06:00] with you know the civil rights movement [06:03] you continued on with in your education [06:05] you ended up graduating and you at what [06:08] point did you move towards your career [06:11] path of owning this really successful [06:15] company that is involved in real estate [06:17] how did you get to that point what [06:18] obstacles that you have to overcome what [06:21] challenges did you face on a regular [06:22] basis and were there times where you [06:24] want it to quit or you want to give up [06:26] because it was way more of a challenge [06:27] than maybe you thought it was it's [06:30] always a challenges that you learn by [06:32] right absolutely you you know that well [06:35] the challenges of being an entrepreneur [06:36] number one [06:37] is to be fearless and to take risk [06:40] knowing full well you may not succeed [06:42] even today you know I own a company and [06:46] real estate has a way of like all [06:49] markets going through a lot of [06:50] volatility you know the ups and downs [06:52] and the crests of the market whether [06:55] it's a real estate market or the [06:57] equities market the bond market and you [06:59] know one has to be prepared to sustain [07:01] that and when you're young you don't [07:03] necessarily have the wherewithal to do [07:05] that so you have to take the only risk [07:07] you know search out no good support [07:10] mechanisms whether it's banking [07:12] relationships investors and I know you [07:17] have a business partner with your [07:18] company did you start at the very [07:19] beginning with him like you guys started [07:21] together no I brought him in to help [07:24] expand the first company I founded it [07:27] was very confident that he would do that [07:30] mine was too but it didn't work out for [07:31] care of my partner's at the time he [07:34] didn't have the same vision so off of [07:37] the old company and start a new company [07:39] this is about 13 14 years ago and now [07:43] some setting those two your agents who [07:45] work for us and the staff probably 35 40 [07:48] which is amazing well it's small it's [07:50] still smaller than giving them well [07:54] you're also very humble it's still a [07:57] small cover yeah well how did you get to [07:59] that place so when you decided that you [08:01] are what made you decide to get into [08:03] real estate how did that become [08:04] something that you wanted to embark on [08:06] well you know that's a good question I [08:09] got I went to when I went to grad school [08:11] I took a degree in urban planning and [08:14] City Planning and urban studies so I [08:17] became very involved in in the sphere of [08:22] land use the valuation of real estate [08:26] how important it was to the viability of [08:29] our cities our [08:30] that was just a treatment that so I had [08:34] founded when I was at the University [08:37] went to a nonprofit housing corporation [08:43] and this is for part of my thesis went [08:46] out and we started building or [08:48] renovating housing in New Haven [08:50] Connecticut using funds from the [08:55] University we're opening for the backing [08:57] of the university help that one foot [08:58] back and got one oh how I did this and [09:00] we had some for foundation money so we [09:02] started renovating you know housing for [09:05] middle income low income families and we [09:08] supported them by putting students in [09:10] that housing situation to they'll [09:12] support the rents well it's kind of [09:14] innovative idea I think we had some [09:16] success doing that anyway that was the [09:18] beginning of my real estate so sorry [09:20] good I mean went from nonprofit to my [09:23] thinking well you know there must be a [09:25] way of doing this for profit well I was [09:27] about to say to was didn't that lead [09:29] into you had some involvement in the [09:32] development of section 8 housing to be [09:35] able to get yes that was well I don't [09:38] know section 8 housing was actually [09:41] called section 8 housing I think was a [09:43] section of law called 221 d3 and I think [09:47] that was the program we actually [09:48] utilized what a slight section it has [09:50] and how did you end up helping with the [09:53] development of that or how are you [09:54] involved with well we provided you know [09:56] the physical shelter and the money to [09:58] either renovate or construct you know [10:01] that shelter and then by getting the [10:03] subsidies available to us to make that [10:08] physical improvement we had a bit back [10:12] up and say you know we did that by [10:14] getting students to rent which were [10:16] pretty much unsupported they didn't need [10:18] the support of rent subsidies but the [10:24] community people who rented in the same [10:26] complex they did so that's how it worked [10:28] I believe in one or two cases we know we [10:31] rented to the house just happened to be [10:34] in New Haven Connecticut didn't we have [10:35] a the New Haven Housing Authority so [10:39] it's kind of complicated that's why it [10:41] works out the first real estate company [10:43] you started you had different business [10:44] partners that you started with from the [10:46] current one and you guys just had [10:48] different visions did they go on to [10:50] create their own real estate company [10:52] they continued in their own if somebody [10:58] has a different vision there's nothing [11:00] wrong with being able to separate and [11:02] would do something else with whatever is [11:04] making you happy and that's I actually [11:06] like that you said that too because [11:07] there's a lot of times I think where [11:09] people get stuck doing something for an [11:11] extended period of time and it may be [11:12] good at the very beginning when they [11:13] start off like a job or relationship or [11:16] whatever the case may be and then they [11:18] stick with it because they're afraid of [11:19] changing or they're thinking Mayall I'm [11:21] getting too old I can't do something [11:22] different I might as well stick with [11:24] this and I think it's good for people if [11:26] they're in a position where they're no [11:27] longer going in the direction that they [11:29] want whether it's with a company that [11:30] they've started or as I said before [11:32] different situations to be able to let [11:35] go and move on to something else [11:36] even if you have to in a sense start all [11:39] over and rebuild and do it again I mean [11:41] I I love doing that though I love [11:44] starting something new and building it [11:45] and seeing it grow I mean I think it's [11:47] amazing but again I think I've seen a [11:48] lot of people that get stuck like that [11:50] have you seen that oh yeah for sure how [11:52] can some you're not one of them I would [11:54] say how can somebody get past that or [11:56] how can you know I really want to talk [11:58] about some of the hurdles because nobody [12:00] builds a really successful company [12:02] without hitting hurdles and I want [12:03] people who are out there who want to be [12:05] you know an entrepreneur and want to [12:07] start their own company to understand [12:10] that and know what some of the [12:11] challenges that they might face and like [12:12] some of the things that might be really [12:13] important for them when they're starting [12:15] out such as finding a good team to start [12:18] with well you just hit on the right [12:19] thing finding if you're in business the [12:21] right partner in this case I found a [12:23] great partner you know who was excellent [12:26] in marketing and advertising and also [12:29] very very good at organizational [12:32] management principles where I was weak [12:35] and that helped I think confidence [12:38] gaining confidence for the you know for [12:40] the core team the people that we had [12:43] coming with us you know had they were [12:46] full of that confidence and [12:48] and so that's the first step with one [12:50] confidence and as I said that confidence [12:53] helps to overcome fear and fear ISM as [12:57] you know it's probably the demon of all [13:00] progress mm-hmm yeah book I read a few [13:04] years back was called field of fear and [13:06] do it anyways and I think I haven't told [13:08] you the story I was reading with [13:10] Mauricio you know reading different [13:11] books and I worked with him at the time [13:13] so we would talk about the different [13:14] books that we were reading and one day [13:17] him and I went out paddleboarding and as [13:19] soon yeah and as you know I'm afraid of [13:22] sharks they absolutely terrify me and [13:24] we're in the marina and the marina yeah [13:27] and so usually there's not that many [13:28] sharks in the marina but nonetheless it [13:30] still freaks me out if it's water we're [13:32] a shark and gain access to and he's [13:34] probably around 50 feet away from me [13:37] give or take and he's on a thinner [13:39] faster style board mine's a little [13:42] bigger kind of amateur type boards where [13:45] you're not gonna fall off that ease and [13:46] he says hey why don't we switch paddle [13:48] boards I want to try that one out for a [13:49] little bit you can try this one I said [13:50] yeah no problem how about you paddle [13:51] over here and we'll switch and he said [13:53] no no how about we jump in where we are [13:55] now and we'll swim to each other's [13:56] paddle boards I said you lost your mind [13:58] there's no way I'm doing that and he [13:59] said feel the fear and do it anyways and [14:01] and I said it's like you got me you know [14:04] what I mean he got me what am I gonna [14:05] say to that so I jumped in and you know [14:08] I was a Marine combat instructor water [14:10] survival I'm a strong swimmer the moment [14:12] I jumped in that water those instant [14:14] panic my adrenaline shot through the [14:16] roof and I swam as fast as I could to [14:18] get to that other paddleboard and not [14:20] even being that long of a swim by the [14:22] time I got to his paddle board from the [14:23] absolute panic just thinking of sharks [14:25] gonna swim up and bite me in half I [14:26] could barely even breathe I got to the [14:29] other side but I did it I did it but [14:31] yeah I think that's really important [14:32] anytime you feel something where you're [14:35] nervous about it or you're fearful just [14:37] go in and and do it some things that you [14:39] know I gave a speech for what you're [14:42] aware of for Veterans Day this year and [14:43] I was super nervous and I care a lot [14:47] about the military because I've seen it [14:49] I've been out in combat I'd done those [14:50] things and I was emotional given the [14:54] speech I was nervous as hell I was [14:55] emotional there was a man who was given [14:58] a [14:58] award before I went up to speak because [15:01] his son went through that school where I [15:03] was the guest speaker and his son died [15:05] in combat so they were giving him the [15:07] reward and he gave an emotional speech [15:09] I'm like oh my gosh I'm so nervous how [15:10] am I good you know I went up there but [15:12] people like that to people like the the [15:15] authenticity you know there's some [15:17] variance see you your stories are a lot [15:19] more interesting than mine yeah yeah but [15:21] I'm gonna tell you something right now [15:23] you know in the marina yes it's packed [15:26] with sand sharks you didn't see any that [15:29] time I did see some of those yeah I did [15:32] but you know what their teeth they're [15:33] like not even as long as pin pricks yeah [15:36] so they can earlier really they don't [15:39] think they heard but they're a lot [15:40] of them for some reason they hang out [15:41] there we yeah you see him when you first [15:43] get on the paddleboard but like you said [15:45] they're tiny you know I was talking to [15:47] this [15:47] I remember where was I think it was [15:49] actually at an event that we're at [15:51] kiddies in the park and we're there and [15:53] somehow somebody said something about [15:55] sharks and I said yeah I don't swim in [15:57] the water and she says yeah sharks [15:59] aren't that bad but this kid was just [16:00] attacked by a shark the other day and I [16:03] said yeah you're really selling the idea [16:04] of me jumping in the water when you're [16:06] mentioning a kid that was just attacked [16:07] I think it was a tiger shark he was [16:09] diving by himself or diving in their [16:12] previous no tiger sharks yeah I don't [16:14] want to mess with those bill burr has a [16:15] great bit on that I'm not gonna ruin the [16:17] bit by trying attempting to say it but [16:19] it's pretty funny people need to look it [16:21] up anyways so do it anyway let's do the [16:25] bit yeah no no no I don't want to do [16:27] that if you don't mind talking about [16:29] like are there any things that you could [16:30] think of where you actually really [16:31] struggled when you're setting up your [16:33] business at the very beginning or was it [16:35] like smooth sailing the whole way you [16:37] didn't hit a single storm well there are [16:39] always storms I think you know I don't [16:41] remember though the just think the [16:43] biggest hurdle well when we first began [16:47] a concept of sailing we considered my [16:52] first partner like crosby Dell [16:55] architectural real estate which was [16:57] promoting the historically important [17:02] properties in Southern California [17:04] because of their architect and [17:06] architects [17:07] heritage you know home was designed by [17:10] Hamilton Harlow Harris the guy who [17:12] designed this house that we're in right [17:14] now Richard Neutra Rudolph Schindler and [17:17] Rafael Soriano no one really understood [17:20] what we're talking about but these are [17:22] masterpieces and there's so much a part [17:24] of our cultural history it was amazing [17:27] to me that no literally believed that [17:28] these have value so anything most most [17:31] important hurdle we had was convincing [17:34] people that not only did these have [17:36] value but there was a niche in the [17:37] market the marketplace that wanted these [17:40] kinds of properties that we that we [17:42] wanted to sell to those kinds of bars [17:43] now you hear mid-century modern and [17:46] everybody used it to the light of [17:47] everything built from 1941 to value but [17:55] I think dealing with preconceptions and [17:58] dealing with cultural norms to me was a [18:01] big challenge just as it was in the very [18:04] first story we talked about that came to [18:07] civil rights and dealing with [18:09] preconceptions and cultural norms that [18:12] are very different from what you would [18:14] expect is the biggest fertilizer [18:17] experience weather and that's why I [18:26] think [18:28] you and I have very different [18:30] backgrounds or counsel to the military [18:33] and very shortly after the Civil Rights [18:36] Movement we were talking about earlier [18:38] in the mid 60s we got to a point in late [18:41] 60s where that kind of translated into [18:46] the anti-war movement which became very [18:49] connected to some historical it was and [18:54] once again it was a matter of [18:56] transforming the cultural values at the [18:59] time which are very much in favor of the [19:02] war very much in favor of the government [19:05] being in the right even though the [19:07] government thought that anybody was [19:08] marching against the Lord was primarily [19:10] influenced by Hinault a or Red China [19:12] which is not the case but I was always [19:19] right jealous though of my brothers who [19:21] went into the military because I was 4f [19:24] because I was blind in one eye and so I [19:29] didn't really have to fight the issue of [19:31] knowing or not going so but those who [19:34] but I felt I should put myself on the [19:36] line and that's why I actually went back [19:40] to the incident though we can't talk [19:41] about that did what I did and became an [19:45] object of vilification pursuit by the [19:50] FBI and people like that because that [19:53] was a communist sympathizer and all the [19:55] stuff that by the end of the 60s the [20:00] attitudes in this country have changed [20:02] but it will say this which is very [20:05] relevant for today where we are living [20:08] in a fractious community as a whole the [20:12] entire nation and everybody thinks that [20:14] we're going through tremendous [20:16] I'm swelling of infighting and lack of [20:21] truth and the lack and maybe even [20:24] violence well late 60s and maybe really [20:27] 70s for a lot more tomorrow and as a [20:29] country would be going through this [20:30] before so I'm confident that we will get [20:34] through this variability you know and [20:38] yet when you're 17 you can sign up yeah [20:42] you can sign up when I was 17 I signed [20:45] well we'll talk about what we can for [20:48] example when you know all the different [20:50] businesses that I've started I've ran [20:51] into issues for example of how do I [20:53] learn properly how to market how can I [20:55] use certain things to leverage and build [20:57] my company up even something as simple [21:00] as dealing with taxes the first time you [21:02] start a business it's everything is new [21:04] and sometimes it could be quite [21:05] overwhelming did you run into anything [21:08] like that in the very beginning when [21:09] you're starting out or you're like oh my [21:10] gosh how do I get this logo made or how [21:12] do I get my website built up how do I [21:14] start getting my clients how do I start [21:16] letting people know that I'm an expert [21:18] within this field and they can trust me [21:19] with there were all of those who knew [21:22] questions no absolutely and that's the [21:23] beginning of starting a you know any [21:25] kind of company we made use of extremely [21:28] good graphics and artistry at the time [21:33] way back in the 70s [21:34] believe it or not of course you didn't [21:37] have anything wrong wine print media but [21:42] there wasn't any emphasis on photography [21:45] and so there are two things impressing [21:48] at the time about real estate the [21:50] contracts or probably a half a page in [21:54] length [21:55] now there the contract is 8 to 10 pages [21:59] took anyone thought you measured the [22:00] agenda what's about 5 attachments that's [22:06] what's gotten from a half a page with no [22:08] contingencies to all kinds of [22:10] contingencies protecting the bar the [22:14] caveat emptor say too extreme the bars [22:16] are protected so where am I going with [22:19] that that was a lot easier at the time [22:22] to construct deals because nothing we [22:25] would take advantage of a bar but we [22:27] didn't have to go through all the hoops [22:28] you know to go down to create but the [22:36] way back to branding you know the at the [22:38] same time there was no such thing as a [22:42] database accumulated all the listings of [22:47] possible options that were available for [22:49] buyers you have go through a broker [22:51] today you just simply gone that's a big [22:55] change at the time in the late 70s we [22:58] had to create a mid seventies Ashley the [23:00] imagery we did that by using extremely [23:03] good photography and using photography [23:05] and placing upon you know a quality [23:09] paper and distributing that to not only [23:11] clients but also to others now you may [23:14] think that this is very standard but it [23:16] was not standard at the time and how did [23:19] as speaking of technology as technology [23:22] started to change and started to improve [23:24] and get better and new things like [23:26] Zillow was added to the equation how did [23:29] you have to adjust fire in order to [23:31] maintain the position and to continue to [23:34] grow and not fail because of not [23:36] adjusting to that technology you know in [23:39] my business the the industry felt which [23:43] was what some about the brokerage [23:45] industry that agents primer agents with [23:49] the best apostrophe their primary job [23:51] was to uncover what was available to [23:56] buyers and sellers [23:58] we realized today that's not the case [24:01] because bars can do any number of online [24:03] you know platformers and find out what's [24:06] available and what's become more [24:08] important for our industry and for the [24:11] agent is to understand that their [24:13] primary role is to negotiate and [24:16] secondly to Shepherd the decline of the [24:19] buyer in this case or this example [24:22] through a transaction that's extremely [24:24] complicated you know the same thing goes [24:25] for a seller so the buyer or seller can [24:30] choose to go through an attorney who may [24:32] or may not understand all the [24:34] intricacies of that particular or they [24:35] can go through an agent my feeling is [24:37] that you know the the actual presence of [24:40] a shepherd in this case is vitally [24:43] important especially here in Los Angeles [24:46] were the contracts and the available [24:49] inventory it's extremely complicated and [24:52] rife with all kinds of difficulties you [24:54] know hillside properties and [24:56] construction defect property like [25:01] contracts that you're saying earlier to [25:02] as they started to become larger is that [25:07] maybe a byproduct of let me see best way [25:14] to put this its navigation maybe that's [25:17] a byproduct of trial and error in a [25:19] sense for example with Facebook when [25:23] they first started out they had about [25:25] maybe a dozen people that would regulate [25:28] posts that were put on Facebook to [25:30] determine whether or not they should be [25:32] removed a human has to look at every [25:34] single post now of course that has grown [25:36] from 12 people to 12,000 or something [25:38] like that the number is incredible as [25:41] Facebook continue to grow and more and [25:43] more people were posting on Facebook and [25:45] using it as at social platforms social [25:47] media they had to continuously adjust [25:50] the rules for what could be placed on [25:52] Facebook and what couldn't you know for [25:54] example for the longest time it was [25:57] anything that is inside of the body [25:59] should not be outside of the body so no [26:01] gore violence anything like that and [26:04] then when the Boston Marathon bombing [26:06] happened there was a very iconic photo [26:08] of a man being wheeled off from the [26:11] scene [26:11] and his leg had been blown off and you [26:14] could see some of the bone and somebody [26:15] posted that and of course Facebook [26:17] pulled it off but then they were [26:19] starting to think well this is a very [26:20] iconic image people need to see the [26:23] violence that could take place so [26:25] they're more equipped to deal with it or [26:27] protect themselves or increase security [26:30] whatever the case may be so certain [26:31] things as far as politics are now [26:33] getting involved and they're constantly [26:34] having to change according to eats at [26:36] each situation for another example [26:38] nipples weren't supposed to be shown and [26:41] then there was these women that were [26:42] posting photos of them breastfeeding [26:45] their infants and those were pulled off [26:47] and there was this huge uproar why are [26:49] you pointing this isn't pornography this [26:52] is a mother feeding its infant then they [26:54] had to change for that and they said [26:55] well one nipple right so point being is [26:57] it went from being one page of rules to [27:00] now it's 50 pages because every time [27:03] somebody would post a new photo and [27:05] there was nothing that would cover that [27:07] particular photo whether or not it could [27:08] be on there they had to change the rules [27:09] do you think it could be that's a [27:11] long-winded way of saying is that maybe [27:13] some of the reason why it became larger [27:15] concerning things would happen well I [27:17] think in the in the case of Facebook [27:19] there was some threat maybe of [27:21] litigation or control regulation bar by [27:25] the government agency a lot of [27:26] controversy and the case of that [27:29] particular contract was a it was a way [27:31] of protecting the age of antic buyer and [27:34] seller well I think Facebook was [27:36] protecting itself and to certainly the [27:39] contract was an attempt of the real [27:40] estate contract was an attempt to [27:43] protect the agents and agencies involved [27:46] in that but also of the buyer and seller [27:49] from extensive litigation [27:54] they chose to be very expensive did you [27:58] run into a lot of issues during the 2008 [28:02] crash yeah that was a difficult time but [28:09] you survived through it you wish did [28:10] it's funny been enough because I guess I [28:12] didn't forget the hurdles because if i [28:14] refresh those and think about why that [28:17] is that's true I guess I do you know [28:22] I think we got through that recession in [28:25] two or three major ways the first way [28:27] was that we were going to determine if [28:30] we were gonna get through it as I think [28:32] everybody did during the recession a lot [28:35] of our clients though work developers at [28:37] the time we're just getting started in [28:39] the development multifamily complexes in [28:42] downtown LA and Hollywood West Hollywood [28:45] so on and they were a very spacious [28:48] development but because valuations fell [28:50] the bank's security in these projects [28:54] you know fell and so now all of a sudden [28:56] the loans that the banks have up to [29:00] these developers you know exceeded in [29:04] some cases what large about the [29:06] valuation of the security so they [29:08] stopped lending so it became our job to [29:12] go out and help them find you know other [29:14] lenders who would take out the the [29:18] primary lender and get the project going [29:20] again but by doing that we eventually [29:24] able to finish the projects get them [29:26] sold in 2009-2010 which provided income [29:37] the other what we were able to devise [29:41] various structures of pricing that [29:44] allowed although we never had to use it [29:46] we with that allowed the developer or [29:49] the seller to guarantee that if prices [29:52] fell their way of backstopping net for [29:56] the bar so fireman said hesitation to [30:00] buy during 2009-2010 because why won't [30:03] they buy something for five hundred [30:05] thousand well they were convinced that [30:06] was go down to four hundred thousand in [30:08] two years well we had to make sure we [30:10] divided them about getting into we tried [30:13] to devise a good devised ways of [30:15] stopping so if reduction didn't have [30:19] witness oh and we take on some [30:20] responsibility no that never happened [30:23] just a very fact that we gave confidence [30:25] to the buyer then able to buy would go [30:28] forward so once again it's a matter of [30:29] confidence confidence I think a key word [30:33] to take from that - it is trust you know [30:36] I was talking to some of the other day [30:38] cuz I'm currently in the process of [30:39] developing dog training videos and I was [30:43] talking to a friend of mine about how I [30:44] was planning on pricing it and how I was [30:46] planning on selling it and my return [30:48] policy and I said you know I'm gonna [30:50] give that 30-day money-back guarantee [30:51] and he said no cuz people are gonna [30:53] download it and then they're going to [30:55] watch the videos and get their money [30:57] back and I said you know what it's not [30:59] if some people will do that but most [31:01] people are good people and if you say [31:03] here's a product but there's no return [31:04] return or refund then you're losing [31:07] trust from your customers that you mean [31:09] to help so if I have a group of people I [31:12] want them to know you have that [31:13] guaranteed satisfaction I want to make [31:15] sure you trust me I want to make sure [31:17] that I'm gonna do everything I can to [31:19] deliver a good product and not put my [31:22] customers or my what's a better word [31:27] than customers clientele yeah clientele [31:29] not not putting my customers or [31:31] clientele in a bad position I want to [31:33] make sure that they trust me so I think [31:34] confidence but I think it's more of that [31:36] trust being able to trust and know that [31:38] if something did happen you would have [31:39] their back yeah yeah it's exactly right [31:42] Trust is the fundamental to [31:45] I think and I know everyone on your team [31:48] has trust for you and something that I [31:49] really love about your leadership is you [31:51] don't try to portray yourself as being [31:54] some sort of super hero who's perfect [31:56] and doesn't have any flaws really yeah I [31:59] know I know you take good care of your [32:03] team you host different events for them [32:05] right like holiday events and things [32:07] like that right for the team but also [32:10] our clients help if we try to be local [32:12] and reach out to the local communities [32:16] that we serve whether it's the Sierra [32:18] Madre well I don't want this to be real [32:25] and real second we have Reebok drawing a [32:26] very boring I guess and everybody wants [32:28] to talk about it I think that you know [32:30] it's you know my bread and butter and [32:32] people want to learn about it I guess [32:34] they do want to learn about it but for [32:36] the initial uninitiated which are the [32:39] younger people who are just buying that [32:41] tell them that don't hesitate to use the [32:44] assistance of a real estate agent not [32:46] because I am one and because I have [32:49] agents who work there but because it's [32:51] here in this particular market it's [32:53] filled with all kinds of chasms and you [32:56] know crevices which can absorb and [33:00] create failure and so I think it the [33:04] good nature could help you get you the [33:06] buyer and the seller get through all [33:07] that financing is difficult [33:11] the pricing again as we were facing the [33:16] recession we don't have that situation [33:18] right now but whenever there is a lull [33:20] in the market buyers think we should [33:22] wait not realize that by winning [33:24] interest rates may go up and over time [33:26] you may get something for a little bit [33:28] less we're gonna be a lot more interest [33:29] rates mm-hmm but just what's happening [33:31] right now oh this is a great thing so [33:34] advice for possible buyers all right so [33:37] first thing is find a good agent right [33:39] what's a good way for somebody because I [33:42] this will I mean anyone in the United [33:44] States will be able to listen to this so [33:48] yeah so what would be the sales you make [33:51] this a sales pitch no no no not sales [33:53] pitch but what I was gonna ask is [33:56] something that people often ask me that [33:58] are in different locations right [33:59] country they say how can I know that the [34:02] dog trainer that I'm hiring is a [34:03] qualified good dog trainer what do you [34:05] say well you know I explained to them [34:07] that it's good to look at their [34:08] background do they compete in anything [34:10] do they have any formal education on it [34:12] formal education if they don't have it [34:14] that's not the you know end-all if they [34:17] compete or they do something outside of [34:19] just training pet dogs what do they do [34:21] with their own dogs you're right little [34:23] things like that you know so what type [34:25] of advice would you give somebody that [34:26] is looking to buy a house first-time [34:28] homebuyer and they're looking into [34:30] different agents would be a good way for [34:32] them to find or to be in a position [34:35] where they're gonna they're gonna be [34:36] comfortable and it's gonna be a smooth [34:38] easy process for them I think you know [34:41] regardless of whether one is a buyer or [34:43] seller there are so many online programs [34:46] that allow ages to put forth [34:48] you know their recommendations and their [34:51] blogs for example and their referral [34:54] little capacities and a lot of it is not [34:57] necessarily I don't say it's not [34:59] necessary the truth but it could be [35:01] manipulated and the best way I know is [35:05] to meet in person the two or three HS [35:09] that you think know they're going to be [35:11] good either you finding a house or or [35:13] selling your house and as you said [35:15] earlier Trust is the most important [35:17] thing so whether you're buying or you're [35:19] selling it I think property for most [35:21] Americans that is their most valuable [35:23] asset it represents their savings it [35:27] represents their shelter it represents [35:29] their position within the community it [35:32] represents their location within a [35:33] neighborhood all of which are very [35:35] important emotion late to say the least [35:36] as well as financially so Trust was the [35:40] important thing now more important than [35:43] even the knowledge perhaps that may come [35:45] forth from an agent is the is the [35:50] ability for you to trust in that agent [35:55] and a lot of that trust is built on [35:56] knowledge what is the agent done and so [35:59] on but after support to meet personal [36:01] adversity I guess I'm not very not very [36:04] virtual I can't really [36:07] significantly with algorithm but they [36:11] can come into an office they can meet [36:13] somebody out and maybe go right [36:15] eventually I mean they can do the [36:16] research obviously online I think it's [36:18] important to actually meet someone first [36:20] I mean eventually and if you were to [36:23] have the opportunity to go back in time [36:26] and sit down with a young Mike Deasy [36:29] what advice would you give him these [36:32] questions you you must have thought [36:33] about these questions in ages and ages [36:36] months and what's make this thing know [36:38] worth your while what what I do when I [36:40] was younger um well what could you tell [36:42] your younger self you know like what [36:43] advice would you give the younger Mike [36:45] Deasy maybe take more risk take more [36:48] risks again not necessarily be afraid of [36:52] the situation that may come about [36:55] because basically I think I'm a [36:57] conservative person and being able to [37:02] expand once capacity and once you know [37:05] energy through risk-taking I think it [37:08] can lead to disaster but it's also a [37:10] good deal of success when you're in your [37:13] 20s you didn't take as many risks oh my [37:15] 20s went back too much fun you got took [37:17] too many too many risks in their [37:19] twenties that goes back to the 60s and [37:21] 70s yeah well that's what I'm saying no [37:24] what I was doing that well before [37:27] starting your business right like if you [37:29] had an opportunity right before you [37:30] start your business to say you know [37:32] maybe you should do this it'll make this [37:34] process smoother or fill in the blank [37:37] I could have been a lot more money had I [37:40] gone right into industrial and [37:42] commercial real estate I was offered to [37:44] do with my late 20s but I chose to as I [37:49] said found this profit corporation I [37:51] didn't work for the state of Connecticut [37:54] working out a an economic and [37:56] environmental plan for the shore the [37:59] shoreline of Connecticut part of it [38:01] which to me was very interesting was [38:03] dynamic they included not only [38:05] environmental protection but also [38:06] Economic Opportunity protection I [38:08] thought that was worried and all of that [38:10] was integrated to the saint's plan Dokdo [38:12] it's exciting so I did that didn't make [38:14] the most money right [38:15] I just back to my mind I said well [38:18] should I have made the decision to make [38:20] more money probably in my more economic [38:25] sense yes but I think in my emotional [38:29] self into the right thing you you would [38:35] probably advance into the more [38:37] remunerative aspect so well emotion [38:41] Trump's logic almost every single time [38:43] that I don't know I either read in a [38:46] book or listen to an audio book or a [38:48] podcast more like that but yeah motion I [38:52] mean that's why they always say if you [38:53] are trying to sell a product don't just [38:56] try to sell a product you know I mean [38:58] why does somebody want this product that [39:00] you have how is it going to make their [39:01] life better how is it going to benefit [39:03] them and if you're able to get them to [39:04] look at it at an emotional point and not [39:06] you just trying to sell them because of [39:08] course nobody likes to be sold but yeah [39:10] so if you're able to get like if you [39:12] just say you know I have this dog food [39:14] and it's great and you should buy for [39:16] your dog they're not going to be [39:17] interested in it but if you say you know [39:19] since the 1970s a life expecting that [39:22] since the 1970s a life expectancy of our [39:25] dogs has dropped seven years so by [39:28] simply substituting 130 our dogs die [39:30] with more raw biologically appropriate [39:33] food then you'll have a longer happier [39:35] life with your dog your dog will be [39:36] healthier you'll have less health issues [39:38] and then you know how much more time how [39:41] many how much is seven more years worth [39:44] you know with your dog yeah right so [39:46] something like that instead of just so [39:48] by getting that emotional state how do [39:51] we lead into that you said something [39:52] about emotion oh yeah what you did you [39:55] said it's rationality yes and you said [39:57] you made an emotional decision when [39:59] you're younger to do something that you [40:00] would rather prefer instead of the one [40:02] that could have been more beneficial [40:03] financially but you've done pretty good [40:06] for yourself though I mean it's not like [40:07] that destroyed your opportunity to grow [40:09] your successful come you know the [40:11] company [40:11] more and could have done more involved [40:13] and more involved in national supremist [40:16] a better bottom line but I'm happy with [40:21] what I do I mean I live in this [40:23] one-bedroom house right now for me it's [40:28] quite satisfactory and I don't care to [40:30] necessarily I'm not supposed to advance [40:35] my career or my like the sessions [40:38] because of something there's something [40:40] some image that suppose on me by what [40:42] people expect me to do it is a beautiful [40:47] location though I mean Santa Monica is [40:49] amazing I love Santa Monica what about [40:51] hobbies I know you have a few hobbies [40:54] that you enjoy doing on a regular basis [40:56] and one of them is reading I know you're [40:58] a big reader and you're a huge history [41:00] buff right oh it's just right yeah are [41:03] there certain things that you have maybe [41:05] learn from reading about history or [41:07] reading about different things that that [41:09] helped you out while you're getting your [41:11] business started you know I don't think [41:14] it's funny I don't usually read the [41:15] history in order to enhance my business [41:18] career except that number one don't give [41:24] up the fight especially when it's the [41:25] darkest well that's one that too I'm [41:28] sure [41:28] well the reason why I said that is it's [41:30] it's easy to say I read a business book [41:31] to learn how to grow my business right [41:34] but sometimes we can find the most [41:35] valuable information in the most [41:36] unlikely sources yeah so by reading [41:38] something just like you said don't give [41:40] up the fight you know maybe you know [41:41] maybe somebody let's say way in wall is [41:45] I love that that movie Braveheart and [41:47] Wallace and his whole story right not [41:49] giving up so just like you said [41:50] perseverance kind of pushing through [41:52] those obstacles and continuing the fight [41:54] that's why I said most unlikely places [41:56] right well I'm eating right now and also [41:59] there was a TV series on the Medici [42:01] which is the banking family of that [42:04] really began in many ways did the [42:08] Renaissance in Florence the Florence is [42:10] to begin with the Renaissance in general [42:12] and the they went through some tough [42:15] times but it took Lorenzo know for [42:17] example reservation [42:19] you know going through you know [42:21] horrendous difficulty but still you know [42:25] going through and creating negotiations [42:29] that eventually let him advance know his [42:34] family's fortune but also the force of [42:35] that city that to me it builds our [42:37] conscious towards that way what's your [42:39] favorite history story I think it was [42:42] the story of Lincoln and the Gettysburg [42:46] Address the address was penned as we all [42:51] know that getting some small piece of [42:53] paper as Lincoln was traveling from [42:55] Washington to the Gettysburg battlefield [42:57] to give an address which was second tear [43:01] the secondary he wasn't the primary [43:04] speaking the primary speaker was Stanton [43:06] maybe secretary I did with Santa and [43:08] they were same table or something at the [43:11] time and so he stands addressed lasted [43:14] for an hour a half can you believe that [43:17] give a speech no no I mean I could teach [43:25] something in an hour and a half but a [43:26] speech that lasts an hour and a half [43:28] some reason I mean the English language [43:29] the time was very diffusive brief great [43:33] explosive not explosive but I mean that [43:37] big words and structured that one off [43:39] forever and Lincoln got up there and his [43:42] address was I think all of four and a [43:45] half minutes which to me and the Florida [43:47] the demise not only know who we were [43:51] than what we were as a nation what we [43:53] went through and how we're going to [43:54] survive and I think that no one thought [43:59] much of that so fun reflection they [44:01] realized really quickly after this was a [44:04] phenomenal and very important address to [44:07] the nation visible if I can talk or [44:11] speak or write I would love to be at the [44:16] command of language and metaphor that [44:19] Abraham way that's just one of many [44:21] their many historic stories oh I think [44:23] you're capable of doing that and history [44:28] Operation Iraqi Freedom one [44:30] we invaded and we moved into Iraq right [44:34] afterwards I did I did 2003 was when we [44:38] did the initial invasion right it [44:40] continued to go for I'm getting older [44:45] well so Operation Iraqi Freedom 1 and 2 [44:49] I was in both of those and when I came [44:51] back we were hanging out and you said [44:53] that you would like to sit down and talk [44:54] a little bit about the operations [44:57] different missions that we had when we [44:59] were out there in country for a certain [45:01] specific reason what was that reason [45:05] what goes back I think to my room well [45:07] if you just know the truth I always felt [45:09] guilty but never serving in Vietnam [45:11] because I am is for else no no no I know [45:14] you're getting at me I think that was a [45:15] subconscious in many ways is my [45:18] subconscious music I'm yeah I thought at [45:20] the time I would write a book that would [45:22] that enabled that would talk about not [45:26] only war but from the point of view of a [45:27] very specific you know person a persona [45:30] in the war fighting war who would fall [45:34] in love in country with interacting well [45:40] you started writing the book right like [45:42] tip notes I did think oh yeah this is a [45:44] long time ago [45:44] yeah and but I had no idea how to write [45:47] it then so that's when you and I start [45:50] talking about that but by the time it's [45:52] just never had the time to really [45:53] they'll work out the details and by that [45:56] time though there were a number of other [45:58] books written about it they're kind of [45:59] all the same storyline it's okay though [46:01] I mean when quest nutrition decide to [46:04] start their protein bars people told [46:06] them hey there's plenty obtain far is [46:08] out there you don't need to start well I [46:11] started one anyways and it quickly [46:13] became a fortune 500 company yeah but [46:15] are you the the main reason would I [46:17] which I love about the idea of the book [46:19] that you need to finish so the listeners [46:23] can download it no no no well this the [46:24] only note it's only a note fashion well [46:26] go ahead sorry but it's bringing the [46:28] human element into these great conflicts [46:31] you know taking that human element [46:33] taking somebody from both opposing side [46:35] which should be right enemies even [46:38] though they're not and that's something [46:39] we talked about before we're not on this [46:41] podcast but just you and I hanging out [46:43] talking how is it that we can end up [46:45] going into a position in a different [46:47] country and fighting against somebody we [46:50] never met if you look at on a personal [46:52] level it doesn't make any sense [46:53] no because had we met these individuals [46:56] may be in a different location if they [46:57] were born in a different spot and they [46:59] were raised in a different culture it's [47:01] quite possible that they could be your [47:02] buddy that you're going and hanging out [47:04] with well you know I don't mean to [47:06] always refer to the Vietnamese war as [47:10] quite frankly I kind of had forgotten [47:12] about it I didn't think would ever get [47:13] into a situation like that again that [47:15] our collective memory is so strong on [47:16] that it's not going to happen again [47:18] well guess what it did happen again and [47:20] you were involved in it but Ken Burns [47:23] the documentarian did a great series on [47:25] the Vietnam War and it ends with the [47:29] veterans of that war we've had their [47:31] buddies shot killed main companies [47:34] ruined the civilians killed by Americans [47:39] and vice versa going back to Vietnam and [47:43] meeting up with members of the enemy but [47:48] that's Vietcong fighters six members [47:52] seven orthia names are me because the [47:53] tour I've taped together and they [47:56] realize that's exactly what you said you [47:58] know we are really of the same species [48:00] and why are we fighting and when you [48:04] meet and look someone fired an eye and [48:06] there isn't the required impulse of [48:10] shooting or knife thing or bayonetting [48:12] you realize that they argued brothers [48:14] whether they're marine brothers or [48:17] whether you're brothers across the [48:19] trench and that's why I love the idea of [48:24] your book though you know cuz it was [48:27] gonna be that whether it was a marine or [48:29] soldier or somebody but somebody who is [48:31] overseas and and ended up meeting that [48:33] Iraqi woman and building those [48:35] relationship and seeing where that might [48:38] go I mean I don't know you're the one [48:39] right name right right well [48:43] if so I can retire from this business [48:47] you definitely should because I know a [48:49] lot of people would like to listen to it [48:50] or not listen to it read it unless they [48:52] listen to audiobooks because I listen to [48:54] audio books all the time great way to [48:55] get your information guys audible."
document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 228/468,com [48:57] and that's not a plug because they're [48:58] not paying me but it is a great website [49:00] to use audible I don't listen too much I [49:03] mean I like reading it because I think [49:04] reading I like to see the words does the [49:07] words what make it makes literature [49:09] important to me mm-hmm sometimes the [49:12] words in the word play and this before [49:29] there was a written word there is a [49:31] spoken word that's right in Homer and [49:33] all the great tales memory capacity of [49:48] so if we've spoken on this well that's [49:54] what I love though about audible is if [49:57] you're driving if you have a long [49:59] commute you know I mean yeah the [50:01] sanctuary that I stay at cam isn't [50:03] canine sanctuary it's about 35 minute [50:05] drive if I want to get the time canines [50:09] nonprofit organization of course focuses [50:12] on helping transitioning veterans rescue [50:14] dogs pairing the two together [50:15] transforming to isin ones but anyways [50:18] it's a long drive from that location and [50:20] so I'm always either listening to an [50:22] audio book or I'm listening to podcasts [50:24] you know that's kind of what inspired me [50:27] to want to start my own podcast and what [50:29] I like so much about the podcast [50:30] platform now a little bit more than some [50:32] of the audiobooks and I can't [50:33] continuously do audiobooks and the [50:34] reason why is quite often they'll hire [50:36] somebody to read the book for them so [50:38] it's not the author and you can sense [50:40] that there's not as much passion in it [50:42] from the person that's simply reading it [50:43] but when you get a book that is actually [50:46] written by the author for example one [50:49] that I listened to a little while back [50:51] extreme ownership from the Navy SEAL [50:54] Jaco was phenomenal because him and [50:57] his brother in arms he wrote the book [51:00] with read the book so they they actually [51:03] put their emotions into it and they care [51:05] about the story that they're telling and [51:06] it's not just you know it wouldn't [51:08] surprise me though if they paid somebody [51:10] to read it they listen to it and they [51:13] didn't like it and so they did it [51:14] themselves [51:15] it's possible you know I hired the first [51:18] when I was over at the Tom Rose school [51:20] to school for professional dog trainers [51:22] I was one of the instructors as well as [51:25] the marketing director and we've put [51:27] together a promotional video and I hired [51:29] two different people to do the [51:30] voice-over I sent them the script I paid [51:32] them to do it and both of them when I [51:34] linked it up back with the video it just [51:36] it did not work because they weren't dog [51:38] trainers so the emotion wasn't behind it [51:40] and I ended up doing the voice-over [51:42] myself because I could get that feeling [51:44] that somebody who wants to aspire to be [51:46] a dog trainer when they're listening to [51:48] it you know the other one I even tried [51:50] sending them examples of stuff so I [51:52] could see how something like that could [51:53] possibly happen yeah but those books [51:56] yeah and like I said the just listening [51:58] and what I like so much about listening [51:59] to podcasts is because it's a [52:02] conversation it you almost sit down you [52:04] almost feel as if you're sitting down in [52:05] the conversation with them you know and [52:08] you're part of it or you're an observer [52:10] and it's way more interesting that way [52:11] instead of somebody just reading [52:12] something well certainly when there's [52:15] dialogue like what you are doing right [52:17] now there's more involvement and I think [52:19] any third party can jump in right now [52:21] let's start making comments mm-hmm [52:23] that's great they should make a comment [52:26] yeah comment below let us know you think [52:29] about the episode so as we're finishing [52:31] up the episode what books would you [52:34] recommend to people that could provide [52:35] value for them whether they're wanting [52:37] to start a business whether they want to [52:39] learn more about history you know what's [52:41] your favorite book or if they are [52:43] interested in learning more about real [52:45] estate or the history of it or maybe [52:47] some of the great architects that [52:50] designed homes such as this one [52:54] well I mean I don't know gosh and [52:57] there's so many books out there let's [52:59] start with the last question and think [53:01] I'll go backwards to forwards I think [53:05] when the most influential books that [53:06] actually got me started in this whole [53:08] venture architectural real estate was I [53:11] was traveling in Europe as I was kid so [53:15] I was like maybe 20 or 21 then went in a [53:18] bookstore hit Athens Greece of all [53:20] places [53:21] that is awesome yeah then I found this [53:23] book about my homeland it's called five [53:26] California architects by Esther McCoy so [53:29] at the time this would have been the [53:32] baby shortly after was published but I [53:33] read that book and I got home I reread [53:35] it again and it talked about the [53:38] important architecture or the cultural [53:40] history of Los Angeles which having gone [53:43] to school in the East seem to be [53:45] forgotten and to me about all the [53:47] eastern snobs even though we had no the [53:51] the cultural epitome of what our country [53:54] has to offer Navy movies noir films [53:58] Chandler all of that after here in LA so [54:01] I use this book to almost research you [54:04] know every property that was involved in [54:06] this and say these properties stay on [54:08] the market you know I'm the guy who was [54:10] going to represent in terms of so that's [54:14] what real estate terms of businesses I [54:16] said only read a lot of business books [54:20] you learn by doing [54:22] yeah the part of war I would say [54:24] families that make you know about that [54:30] and so many more important let's go way [54:34] back I think Plato was incredibly [54:36] influential for me in the book to read [54:40] was probably the Republic which has a [54:42] number of dialogues that everybody is [54:45] familiar with but it's interesting to [54:46] actually read them see how that the Lord [54:48] is to truth which seems to be solving [54:51] today to the point where it may not [54:53] exist in the region here I radical [54:56] honesty no [54:57] speaking of truth that's a good one [54:59] radical honesty probably one of the more [55:02] challenging things to do is to be [55:04] radically honest with everybody yeah [55:06] it's not for me it's super-hard yeah I [55:08] mean even it was interesting in the book [55:10] the author talks about it's not just [55:13] saying what is truthful but also not [55:15] withholding information and that's [55:17] probably the most common way people will [55:19] lie to one another is by withholding [55:21] information everybody withholding [55:22] information you put yourself in a bad [55:24] position you know by not being honest [55:27] upfront you know quick book have you [55:31] ever heard of that term [55:32] the quake book have you heard of a quick [55:34] book of look that that shakes your [55:36] innards to the point where you change it [55:38] where it changes their life yes sir [55:40] I mean I haven't hurt me that it's good [55:41] term I hadn't heard that term so it's [55:43] this now do you have a quick book um [55:45] there's one sapiens yep I actually no I [55:59] didn't read sapiens but I started [56:01] listening to the audiobook sapiens did [56:03] you what do you think I think it's [56:04] fascinating yeah I mean and the [56:06] Neanderthals they believe they're there [56:09] still are some DNA from the Neanderthals [56:12] that exist today well yeah I mean each [56:14] one of us has a certain percentage [56:16] percent of Neanderthal DNA so completely [56:19] indicates that they were as widespread [56:21] as homo sapiens and that there was a lot [56:23] of hair marriage yep [56:24] absolutely yeah and so you brought over [56:26] a book which one is this this is home [56:28] Linnaeus which is written I think [56:30] shortly act now shortly but what's the [56:32] second book to safe hands again written [56:34] by everything Universal author or an [56:42] author of universal knowledge so it's a [56:44] brief history of tomorrow was it as good [56:48] as sapiens did you read sapiens yes I [56:50] did which one do you like morons well [56:52] I'm just reading this now I think okay [56:57] how far end of this one okay yeah oh [57:04] well you got a good idea of where it's [57:06] gonna be taking you a quick book for me [57:09] let's see have you read the book letting [57:11] go no that's a really good one I mean [57:14] it's as simply it's more about reaching [57:16] a higher level of consciousness you know [57:18] an understanding [57:19] - you know a lot of times we let what [57:22] we're talking about before letting our [57:23] emotions control us and letting go is [57:26] this concept of figuring out what it is [57:28] that's making you feel a certain way [57:30] letting go of those emotions and not [57:32] letting that build-up and adding stress [57:34] on your life you know something as [57:36] simple as and this is one a more smaller [57:39] example but it goes into great depth and [57:41] there's a whole lot to it but you know [57:42] to having somebody cut you off in [57:44] traffic often people get really mad and [57:46] upset about it but it's not personal the [57:48] person doesn't know you and they're [57:50] gonna cut somebody else off in the [57:51] future and if you're not there to see it [57:53] are you gonna get upset about that one [57:55] no because it's not you but for some [57:57] reason when they cut you off you get mad [57:59] because you're driving and of course if [58:00] you're if it's close to almost putting [58:01] you into an accident right then you [58:03] could be a little bit upset but it's [58:05] being able to let go of those feelings [58:06] and you end up being a happier person [58:08] because of it and people start to notice [58:09] the difference around you because [58:10] they're more happy and positive but it [58:12] was a great book in speaking of the [58:14] whole car thing I've heard different [58:15] theories on why people get so upset when [58:18] they're driving in a car one I heard was [58:21] that you're at a heightened state here [58:23] at a more heightened state as you're [58:24] driving well I don't know if I agree [58:27] with that completely because people [58:29] become very relaxed they do it so much [58:31] and they become relaxed with it it's no [58:32] different than when I was overseas in [58:35] Iraq and I'm carrying around my rifle [58:37] 24/7 every single day it was just [58:40] something that I had to carry around [58:41] that's what it felt like but when I was [58:43] first handed my rifle at recruit [58:44] training Depot in San Diego and they [58:46] first gave you that rifle it's it's like [58:48] this powerful tool that was just placed [58:50] in your hands but by holding it for so [58:53] long eventually it just becomes annoying [58:54] because it's an extra six point six [58:56] pounds or whatever the way it is I don't [58:57] remember that you're carrying around [58:58] right it changes your outlook so another [59:01] theory that I heard it I think this one [59:03] I think this one might be a little bit [59:07] more accurate is it triggers the [59:09] primitive part of your brain where [59:11] people are moving in on your territory [59:14] because your vehicle becomes a part of [59:16] your territory you've heard this no no [59:18] but I agree with that I mean it not only [59:19] do I agree with that I think that [59:20] because we are verging into more or less [59:24] a it's subconscious effort to manipulate [59:27] the drive whatever [59:29] anybody cuts in front of you all of a [59:30] sudden now they interrupted that you [59:33] know subconscious raises to a conscious [59:35] level that you know you're reading it [59:37] the same time and that's something that [59:39] may change here in the near future as we [59:42] have self-driving cars exactly you know [59:44] that's why I what if I take over just to [59:54] use my blood pressure and I do that [60:07] sometimes throughout the entire ride and [60:09] it's such a beautiful experience that [60:11] transforms that experience actually you [60:13] know mm-hmm now are you familiar with [60:18] the the the trolley question that's a [60:23] challenge it's a it's a philosophical [60:26] question or a moral issue where it's [60:30] been told for a long time you're in a [60:33] trolley and you have the ability to [60:35] change tracks if you need to yeah and [60:38] there are five workers on the track that [60:40] you are currently on and if you pull the [60:42] lever it'll change it to the other track [60:45] saving the five but there's one [60:47] individual on the other track so you'll [60:49] basically sacrifice the one to save the [60:52] five you're familiar with this right yes [60:54] now this is one point in history though [60:57] where the trolley equation actually [61:00] comes to life and that's what [61:02] self-driving cars right because if these [61:04] self-driving cars are programmed to get [61:06] to one destination to the next and to do [61:07] it safely all the different car [61:09] companies can communicate with one [61:11] another and they can say this right well [61:16] they make an answer how it is with the [61:18] vehicles that are on the road right but [61:20] the issue is in order for it to be a [61:23] perfect system that would have to be no [61:24] other cars I mean where you drive it [61:27] yourself not self-driving and it has to [61:31] also consider natural disasters that has [61:34] to be somehow programmed into it you [61:36] know what does it do it do it or if you [61:42] know [61:43] really slick on the road and one of the [61:44] cars starts to slide and it's going to [61:47] get an accident or what does it do if a [61:52] child jumps in front of the car right [61:53] right is the car at that point let's say [61:56] it's driving in a narrow road and [61:59] there's buildings on each side and a kid [62:02] runs out in front of the car is the car [62:03] programmed to save the child by [62:06] sacrificing itself and the person in the [62:08] vehicle or is it programmed to not these [62:12] are all more questions so no it's not [62:16] the algorithm it's the then how would [62:20] you be able to sell it to you no I mean [62:21] if there is a vehicle that's willing to [62:23] sacrifice the passengers right that I [62:27] don't want to buy a vehicle that's [62:28] willing to sacrifice the passengers but [62:30] at the same time you also don't want a [62:32] vehicle that's willing to just run over [62:34] something that's in the road yeah that's [62:35] right that's right well you know what [62:38] don't think emphasize either one [62:43] hey why me because I'll save the child [62:46] right right yeah it's not gonna be [62:48] something yeah so I think yeah and I [62:59] said that's an escape I shouldn't know [63:01] that is I'm so part of the living world [63:03] I should be part of that answer too [63:05] absolutely and it's it is happening [63:07] right now I mean they think we're gonna [63:08] have fully self running cars by what [63:10] 2022 I mean they're developing it for [63:17] sure when they're on the road oh they [63:18] are like the only self-driving yeah I [63:20] think they're being used I don't know if [63:28] the cars have a human driver next to do [63:35] you think you'll be able to buy normal [63:37] vehicles anymore at some point or do you [63:39] think those will be completely [63:40] absolutely nobody's and make it truly [63:41] safe I think human drivers yeah it's [63:48] crazy it is and those will go away and [63:50] if you think about it that that [63:51] definitely may be the only type that [63:53] would still be driven by the human would [63:56] maybe be [63:56] law enforcement or things of that nature [63:58] where they have to be able to I mean [64:01] those might be programmed as well but [64:02] when I thought about this I started to [64:04] hear about this happening I started to [64:06] think about so many different things [64:07] that would instantly go away of course [64:08] the the obvious is truck drivers right [64:11] that's gonna no longer be a job first [64:14] probably one of the first ones to go but [64:16] then also you know think about criminals [64:19] for example the getaway driver no longer [64:22] have a getaway driver right if you can't [64:25] they can't it's it's so many different [64:28] things the whole the way police will [64:30] deal with situations is going to be [64:31] different the file store car drives [64:38] right and of course but those camera [64:43] probably be spotted to all your crazy [64:54] people who like to drive fast cars or [64:57] sports cars there is a website I'm not [65:10] sure what the website is I heard it when [65:11] I was listening to a different podcast [65:13] and it's it's somebody who's a huge car [65:16] advocate and they have created a website [65:19] something to the extent to save the [65:22] driver calm or something or fight to [65:25] drive or something like that for people [65:27] that are already starting a movement to [65:29] keep human drivers because those people [65:31] that like to be behind the wheel that [65:33] like to you know invest their time they [65:38] can go to a track yeah that'll probably [65:40] become something that will be more [65:42] popular people paid to go drive yeah the [65:45] cars and then would you have to have a [65:47] license at that point is it gonna be [65:48] well kids still get license when they're [65:50] going through school in order to you [65:52] know make yourself automatic driving [65:54] cars I don't think so if you want to [65:55] attract enterprises right [65:57] yeah but that'll probably go away as [65:59] being a normal course in high school for [66:02] students yeah [66:06] you didn't know these an unfertilized it [66:08] was it was not considered an academic [66:11] subject no kidding no no I mean I'm sure [66:15] that's still pretty you know think about [66:20] 15 years ago you know if you were to [66:22] tell somebody that in 15 years parents [66:26] would rather pay somebody to drive their [66:30] kids everywhere [66:31] that someone they don't know than to [66:34] give their kids a license and a vehicle [66:35] you'd say you're crazy [66:36] yeah but now those parents that would [66:39] rather just have their kids like here's [66:41] here's your card that you used strictly [66:44] or they program their card into their [66:47] child's or their teenager whatever their [66:49] app well you know so then they're [66:52] getting charged when they drive around [66:53] but that's much safer and nobody would [66:55] even thought about that before one of [66:57] the when computers became more common [67:04] traffic wasn't nearly as bad but began [67:06] to obviously problems getting across use [67:13] the computer to drivers and such we're [67:16] going to a certain place in touch other [67:20] users we need to get there and they can [67:22] share the drive right Sheriff mhm [67:27] so I took that to some investors and [67:29] some banks just ran some wine and you [67:31] know what they'll it's not that they [67:33] didn't believe in the technology they [67:34] said this will never work because no [67:36] one's going to get into a car with a [67:37] stranger at the wheel and now it was [67:41] only like 20 years I think it's actually [67:44] more of a risk for the drivers yeah one [67:51] of my buddies drives for all of them all [67:53] the different platforms there's a new [67:54] platform out there that I guess the [67:56] drivers own I don't even notice called [67:58] but what do you see what are your [68:00] predictions for the future as far as how [68:03] technology based on what we're already [68:05] seeing right that development just like [68:07] self-driving cars how is that going to [68:10] change the future what are your [68:11] predictions are you talking about no any [68:14] any sort of tech not just technology [68:15] well I think just that alone will change [68:17] the way cities okay [68:19] can develop it most I don't think you'll [68:20] need garages wouldn't you do parking [68:24] garages yeah especially in downtown LA [68:27] that has to be and I couldn't get it we [68:28] got to start changing our laws right now [68:30] zoning laws and land use laws too [68:32] seriously that that's going to change [68:36] you know I think that how do we [68:41] establish norms that were criteria for [68:45] judging it is challenging though that's [68:57] a good point I mean even certain [68:59] platforms that try to help solve that [69:00] problem they don't they still fail you [69:03] know it means something as simple as [69:04] Yelp you know are these different review [69:06] platforms because what do a lot of [69:07] people do they'll write fake reviews but [69:09] then they will or they'll try to attempt [69:14] to undercut or though the Yelp will try [69:17] to attempt to eliminate the fake reviews [69:19] but then in the process they end up [69:21] removing real reviews and then they make [69:23] business owners upset about that and [69:25] deal with all these issues but there's [69:27] constantly ways where they're trying to [69:29] do that but a lot of bad things can come [69:31] from it as well if somebody maybe just [69:34] has and this is I find it really [69:35] interesting with technologies finding or [69:39] developing to to highlight those that [69:42] are good and to block those that are not [69:45] but how is it able to determine that and [69:47] work on some of these issues or issues [69:49] that we may run into from faults in the [69:51] system and the human program alright [70:00] well Believe It or Not Mike that is the [70:03] end of our episode I want to

If you have a behavior that you would like your dog to repeat, then you want to reward them for that behavior. If you have a behavior that you would not wish them to repeat, then you would want to correct that behavior. Before correcting our dogs, we want to determine if we are dealing with an obedience issue or behavioral issues. If we are fixing a behavior issue and that behavior is not based on fear, then we can correct it day one. If the behavior is based on fear, then we can not correct it. This is very important. If we try correcting behaviors that are based on fear, then it will only make the issue worse. If we are dealing with obedience issues, then we need to make sure that the dog knows the command we are asking them to perform and the dog also must know how to turn off pressure by complying. At that point, we can then give the dog a correction for the obedience issue we are having. For example; the dog doesn't want to stay in a sit stay, so when the dog gets up before being released, we can give the dog a correction for choosing not to stay in the sit stay.

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 231/468,com/nateschoemer/ === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] alright guys this video is for those of [00:01] you out there that have a dog or dogs [00:03] that either pull on the leash or bark at [00:05] people when you don't want them to and [00:08] how do we stop that behavior first what [00:10] we need to do is we need to think about [00:12] what it is that the dog is trying to do [00:14] or what is their outcome or result from [00:18] doing a certain behavior so if I have a [00:20] dog and that dog goes into a sit and I [00:22] give that dog a piece of food that's [00:24] going to encourage that dog to go back [00:25] into the sit again but what about [00:27] behaviors that we don't want now we have [00:30] what's called self rewarding behaviors [00:31] this is going to be a behavior that is [00:33] rewarding the behavior itself is fun to [00:36] do so whether or not you reward the dog [00:38] and correct the dog for a self rewarding [00:40] behavior since the behavior itself is [00:42] fun they're going to continue to do that [00:44] behavior unless we show them or tell [00:46] them that they're not supposed to do it [00:48] so again we want to think about the dog [00:50] decides to do a behavior they do the [00:52] behavior it results in some sort of [00:54] outcome which determines whether or not [00:56] that dog will do the behavior again so [00:59] we need to look at it in that [01:00] perspective if the dog does a behavior [01:03] and it makes them feel good then they're [01:05] more likely to repeat that behavior if a [01:07] dog has fun chasing people or barking at [01:10] other dogs that behavior itself feels [01:12] good for the dog then they're going to [01:14] continue that behavior this is no [01:15] different than if you had kids and I [01:18] told you I want you to get your kids to [01:20] stop playing video games and this is how [01:21] we're gonna do it we're going to we're [01:24] gonna ignore them while they're playing [01:25] games and the moment they stop playing [01:27] games we're gonna give them money well [01:29] that's not going to get them to stop the [01:30] behavior of playing games because [01:32] playing games is fun if you didn't want [01:34] them to play games you'd have to create [01:35] some sort of deterrent or you'd have to [01:38] show them that playing games is not [01:39] valuable or won't add any value to their [01:41] life you have to do something in order [01:43] to curb that behavior you can't just [01:44] ignore it since it's a fun behavior so [01:46] this is the same with dogs so you have [01:49] to determine okay I don't want my dog [01:51] barking at other people so we always [01:54] want to remember that we have one second [01:55] to influence a dog's behavior so one [01:57] thing and to reward them or once again [01:59] to correct them for behavior we want [02:00] them to repeat or not to repeat and this [02:03] is also why we use conditioned [02:04] reinforcers or conditioned Corrections [02:06] conditioned reinforcer predicts the [02:08] primary reward which is food to our [02:10] affection condition correct [02:12] chin predicts the actual primary [02:14] correction which could be anything that [02:16] creates some sort of deterrent for the [02:18] dog some people may have a container [02:21] filled with coins that they shake the [02:23] dog doesn't like the noise that becomes [02:24] a deterrent or that becomes something [02:26] that dog wants to avoid and if a certain [02:28] behavior predicts that outcome the dog [02:30] stops doing that behavior that predicts [02:32] that outcome and it doesn't matter what [02:34] it is as long as it works because [02:35] remember we want to focus on the science [02:38] of dog training so if for example let's [02:40] say I'm using a leash pop my dog has a [02:42] martingale collar on my dog doesn't [02:44] behavior I don't like I say no and then [02:46] I pop the leash given the dog a physical [02:48] correction that's going to be positive [02:50] punishment the dog doesn't like that [02:52] correction so the dog stops the behavior [02:54] but the dog's motivation to prevent the [02:57] correction from happening must override [02:59] the motivation to do the negative [03:02] behavior this is no different from why [03:04] if you think about why do most people [03:06] choose not to rob the bank because the [03:08] motivation not to go to jail overrides [03:10] the motivation to make a quick buck but [03:13] there are some people out there who [03:14] would rather risk going to jail to make [03:17] that quick buck so each dog is going to [03:19] vary some dogs I might do a leash pop [03:21] and that's going to get them to stop the [03:23] behavior they don't want to do the [03:24] behavior anymore because they don't want [03:26] to be corrected but there's other dogs [03:28] where that may not work so you have to [03:29] be creative and figure out what it is [03:32] that's going to get my dog to stop doing [03:35] this behavior that is self reinforcing [03:37] to the dog because again the behavior [03:39] itself is fun and most the time when [03:41] dogs are barking as long as that [03:42] behavior is not based on fear so [03:44] sometimes a dog will bark and it's [03:47] because that behavior is based on fear [03:48] if it's not based on fear then we can [03:50] usually correct it out of the dog's [03:52] repertoire but this is also very [03:54] important to keep in mind you cannot [03:56] correct fear-based behaviors out of a [04:00] dog's repertoire this is very important [04:02] because if a dog is doing something [04:04] based on fear and we correct them at [04:06] that point then what we are doing is we [04:08] are reinforcing the fear we just said [04:10] yeah you better be scared of that [04:11] because you're gonna receive a [04:12] correction for it and it's gonna make it [04:14] even worse and it's gonna make it harder [04:16] to fix [04:16] well again you can correct behaviors out [04:19] of a dog's repertoire that are not based [04:21] on fear if my dog is chewing on the [04:23] furniture my dog enjoys chewing on the [04:25] furniture [04:25] I say no and I give the dog leash pop [04:27] and the dog says what I wasn't very [04:30] pleasant [04:30] I'm not going to chew on that furniture [04:32] again it's no different than a dog [04:33] biting a cactus if a dog thinks a cactus [04:35] looks like it's a tasty treat and the [04:37] dog goes and fights the cactus and they [04:39] get pricked in the mouth they're not [04:41] going to bite the cactus again they're [04:42] going to learn from that so again think [04:44] about what it is that the dog wants to [04:46] do when they do the behavior what is the [04:48] outcome of that behavior and you get to [04:50] determine what that outcome is which [04:51] will determine whether or not the dog [04:53] repeats the behavior or chooses not to [04:56] do the behavior again and this goes [04:57] across the board so lastly if we are [05:01] having a dog that is doing a certain [05:02] issue that we want them to stop whether [05:04] it's chasing other people chasing dogs [05:06] we want to set them up to fail so I set [05:09] dogs up for success so I can reward them [05:12] the exact moment they do it right but I [05:14] also set dogs up to fail so I can [05:17] correct them at the exact moment they do [05:18] it wrong I don't want to be surprised [05:20] when my dog makes some sort of mistake I [05:23] don't want to be like oh my gosh I can't [05:25] believe my dog just broke the Sitz day I [05:27] want to set it up so I'm ready the exact [05:29] moment the dog makes a mistake if my dog [05:31] for example barks when somebody knocks [05:33] at the door but I don't want my dog to [05:35] bark I'm not gonna wait till somebody [05:37] randomly knocks on the door and it [05:38] surprises me I'm going to have somebody [05:41] who I know a friend or whatever come [05:42] knock on the door so I'm ready and when [05:44] my dog reacts to it I'm able to respond [05:47] accordingly I set the dog up to fail so [05:49] I can correct them the exact moment they [05:51] make the mistake and give them a very [05:53] clear path to success and lastly before [05:56] I wrap this video up any time we are [05:58] using any sort of correction on a dog [06:01] that relates to obedience so we have [06:03] behavioral issues and we have obedience [06:05] issues behavioral issues are behavioral [06:08] type issues it's for example digging [06:10] chewing on furniture eating Christmas [06:13] tree ornaments even now the trash can [06:15] drinking on the toilet bowl those are [06:17] going to be behavioral type issues and [06:19] those who can correct day one as long as [06:21] that behavior is not based on fear like [06:23] we spoke about before now if I'm [06:25] correcting a dog for obedience issues [06:27] not sitting when I tell it to not [06:29] downing when I tilt it down not coming [06:30] to an called things like that are not [06:32] staying in the sit stay [06:33] I cannot correct them until a few things [06:35] take place before that is but [06:38] where that comes into play so what I [06:40] mean by that is I want to make sure the [06:42] dog knows the command that I'm asking [06:43] them to perform so if I say sit my dog [06:45] better no that's a sick command if I say [06:47] down my dog better know that that means [06:49] to lay down I better it's my [06:50] responsibility is what I mean to teach [06:52] my dog to sit in the down and there [06:54] better not be any doubt in my mind that [06:56] the dog actually knows those commands [06:58] now once I have that in place I also [07:00] want to make sure my dog knows how to [07:02] turn off pressure by complying [07:03] so if I put my dog in a sit-stay my dog [07:05] breaks that sit stay and I say no I want [07:07] my dog to sit back into that sit stay [07:09] and there's ways to teach that which I [07:11] explained in my online dog training [07:13] program so if my dog goes back into the [07:16] sit after it breaks a position when I [07:17] say no that's showing me that that dog [07:20] understands when I say sit to go into [07:22] the sit position and when they break the [07:23] position if I say no they know how to [07:25] get back into that position showing me [07:27] that they know how to turn off pressure [07:29] by complying so when we do those steps [07:31] we give the dog a clear path to success [07:33] we teach them how to turn out pressure [07:34] by compliant now it's fair to give the [07:36] dog a correction for something that is [07:38] related to obedience and if you do the [07:40] steps properly even if you add a [07:42] correction to your dog you're not going [07:44] to get the negative add responses or the [07:48] the bad reactions rather from my dog or [07:50] from a dog that you have been using [07:52] Corrections incorrectly if the dog [07:54] doesn't know what's expected of them and [07:56] they don't know how to turn out pressure [07:57] you're gonna get that worried fearful [07:59] looking dog and that's typical of [08:01] somebody using any sort of Corrections [08:03] on their dog incorrectly [08:05] okay so all these things have to come [08:07] into play and if you do this correctly [08:09] it doesn't matter what the issue is [08:11] you're going to be able to problem-solve [08:13] and come up with a solution to be able [08:15] to fix that again this is why I teach [08:17] the science of dog training if you can [08:19] understand the science you could think [08:21] about each situation you could look at [08:22] the dog and say what type of motivation [08:24] does this dog need in order to perform [08:26] the behavior what is this dog's bank [08:28] account level that's an analogy that I [08:30] like to use some dogs are very rich some [08:32] are very poor the dogs that are more [08:34] rich need a higher correction than the [08:35] dogs that are poor so here's an analogy [08:37] I like to use for that if you're [08:38] speeding down the highway and a police [08:40] officer pulls you over and writes you a [08:42] 25 cent speeding ticket the moment they [08:44] turn the corner off you go speeding [08:46] again that 25 cent speeding ticket was [08:48] not enough to get you to to change the [08:50] behavior now let's take it on the [08:52] their extreme end of the spectrum and he [08:54] writes pulls you over and writes you a [08:55] one hundred and fifty thousand dollar [08:57] speeding ticket [08:58] now you're gonna be stressed out you're [08:59] gonna avoid the behavior completely [09:01] that's an avoidance level correction [09:02] that's a correction level so high you [09:04] never want to do the behavior ever again [09:05] but let's say he gives you a 250 dollar [09:08] speeding ticket that's enough to get you [09:10] to slow down [09:11] without getting you to avoid the [09:12] behavior of driving and again this is [09:14] very important so now you have to figure [09:16] out what is your dog's bank account how [09:18] high or how low of a correction do you [09:20] need to give your dog to get the proper [09:22] response that you want based on the [09:24] training that you are working on and [09:26] again if you do these correctly you can [09:28] get a phenomenal result if you want to [09:30] learn more just check out my website [09:31] Nate show more calm and it's gonna have

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 235/468,S history and psychology was [01:27] not you know the if I taught math and [01:29] science I probably could have [01:30] gotten a job but I but um that was not [01:33] popular but what I taught was not in [01:35] need they weren't you know it was no [01:37] shortage of teachers [01:39] um in in my area so anyway [01:41] um [01:42] and so I just started doing some little [01:44] as a military spouse does [01:45] entrepreneurial side hustle things and [01:48] learned very quickly that I was pretty [01:49] darn good at you know starting something [01:52] and turning it into something well the [01:54] background in the psychology probably [01:56] yeah right uh I don't know I think it [01:58] was more the I was an eager beaver [02:00] wanted to just get out there and start [02:02] making some money doing some fun stuff [02:04] right actually I'll tell you what I did [02:05] I sold lingerie in home parties [02:08] that's awesome and I love telling this [02:12] story because [02:14] um I was only 24 years old and when we [02:18] moved as a military family I did not [02:21] know anybody where we went and so I [02:23] literally took the catalog for this [02:24] lingerie company direct sales company [02:26] into the mall and walked up to strangers [02:30] and said hi my name's Gila Kurtz I just [02:33] got married to a man in the military and [02:35] I'm I don't know anybody here but I [02:37] really want to do these home parties and [02:40] here's what we got and I show them the [02:42] catalog you know would you be willing to [02:43] do one for me and lo and behold after an [02:46] hour or so I got five people to agree [02:48] which was my goal and from those five [02:50] people [02:52] uh launched this business and started [02:54] making some great money and kept myself [02:56] in business at each party by booking [02:58] more parties Etc that's how the direct [03:00] selling model works and so that was kind [03:03] of like my first uh tip toe into the [03:06] world of Entrepreneurship [03:09] um but still dogs were not part of my [03:10] life at that time yeah I love that I did [03:13] going out and so I'm a big fan of Tim [03:15] Ferriss are you familiar with [03:16] temperatures yeah and I was watching [03:18] when he puts these little videos up on [03:19] YouTube where he goes out and he links [03:21] up with somebody who's an entrepreneur [03:22] starting out but they're struggling they [03:24] don't have that hustle mentality to go [03:25] out and he basically had them go do [03:27] almost exactly what you're talking about [03:29] right now going out having some sort of [03:31] goal in mind and not stopping until [03:34] you're able to achieve that yeah what he [03:35] was able to do with these people in such [03:37] short amount of time was incredible and [03:38] like you were just on that right away [03:39] did you how did you get that instinct [03:41] well I just I it was I don't know I mean [03:44] I just had to because I didn't know [03:45] anybody and I really wanted to do this [03:46] business I knew [03:48] um from watching other people actually [03:50] was one of my students his mother was [03:53] one of their top direct selling women in [03:55] that company and she was making some [03:58] great money and I had been to a party as [04:01] a guest and was like oh my gosh these [04:02] are so fun and you seriously can make [04:04] that much money so I just knew that it [04:06] was just something I wanted to do and [04:09] that the only way to do it was just to [04:11] ask and that's kind of been my my model [04:14] of being I think pretty much my entire [04:18] life is just ask for it you know for [04:20] what you want [04:22] um but anyway it wasn't until we moved [04:24] to Japan so there was a series of moves [04:27] as a military spouse in there John in [04:29] the Navy taking us everywhere but we [04:31] were stationed in Japan and I [04:35] um all transparency all I really wanted [04:37] was to have a baby and I was not having [04:40] that baby just yet so [04:42] um there was an ad in our local paper in [04:44] Japan [04:45] that said puppies [04:48] free to good home [04:49] and I was like oh my gosh and it was [04:53] they were Dalmatian puppies now that was [04:55] the exact time period when that movie [04:57] 101 Dalmatians came out so I see this ad [05:00] in our local paper and I called John on [05:02] the ship he's actually the commanding [05:04] officer of this naval ship here in [05:07] station in Japan and of course you know [05:09] I've got he's got way more important [05:11] things to do than to talk to me about [05:13] you know puppies or whatever but he you [05:15] know he takes the call and I was like [05:16] John [05:18] um there is a family that they had [05:21] puppies these little lab Dalmatian puppy [05:23] mixes and you know can we just go look [05:25] at them and he was like we are not [05:28] getting a dog but we are not getting a [05:30] dog and I was like no no no no we're not [05:32] we're totally not getting a puppy I mean [05:34] come on but but let's just go look like [05:37] I'm really bored it would just be let's [05:39] just go look and this was a 20-minute [05:41] drive from the main base out to it was [05:44] called Hario Village [05:46] um [05:47] what yeah it's like 20 minutes I guess [05:50] and um and we get there and there's [05:53] these puppies and I mean come on like of [05:56] course they're so cute and I start [05:58] begging like I'm a kid you know oh my [06:00] God [06:02] and so John it's like you turn into dad [06:05] mode or something I don't know he says [06:07] okay we need to talk and so we were [06:08] sitting in the car and he's like Gila [06:10] dogs are you I grew up with a dog dogs [06:12] are a lot of work you gotta feed them [06:15] you gotta walk them you know all this [06:16] stuff and I was like I'm not 10 like I [06:19] got this and so of course we walked away [06:21] with a puppy and [06:23] um but what was interesting and you can [06:25] probably understand this so I got this [06:28] puppy based on everything that we tell [06:30] all of our clients right not to do [06:34] um On Emotion I just wanted something to [06:36] take care of this puppy was so cute I [06:39] knew nothing about dogs zero other than [06:42] yes they obviously needed to be fed and [06:44] taken out the basics of course the [06:46] basics but I knew nothing about training [06:48] I knew nothing about I I really I just [06:50] knew nothing and of course a Dalmatian [06:52] is probably the worst breed to have a [06:55] novice dog owner get and so she gave me [06:59] a run for the money for sure and uh what [07:02] ended up happening though was once we [07:04] moved back to the States [07:08] um I ended up getting pregnant with that [07:10] child that you know who's now this [07:12] beautiful child in my life but [07:15] she was so demanding like this dog I [07:19] mean who knew we would I would run five [07:21] miles and then with her and then tag [07:24] team John to take her out for the next [07:27] five and it just still wasn't enough and [07:29] I was like oh my gosh like what does it [07:31] take with the stock so we finally uh [07:33] sent her to a trainer [07:34] so I was like I can't take this and she [07:38] it was one of those she was there all [07:39] day training and then at the end of the [07:41] two weeks John and I went and learned [07:43] about the training process and [07:46] um that's kind of you know that's pretty [07:47] much how she came into into our world [07:50] but I I truly didn't know anything but [07:52] where I started my my journey in the [07:55] world of dogs was [07:58] um [07:58] in that on that in that Duty station I [08:02] and after my child was born I still I [08:05] wanted something to do I wasn't selling [08:07] the lingerie anymore I had built a [08:10] really nice business also selling [08:12] skincare and nutritional products as [08:14] well same you know just go get her made [08:17] that happen but I just wasn't feeling [08:19] fulfilled like it just you know you get [08:21] to a place where money just isn't it's [08:24] not the motivator anymore so I started [08:26] this Gourmet Coffee vending business [08:28] which was also very successful [08:30] I know and it was so fun and so I had [08:33] these five machines placed around the DC [08:36] area and would travel a few times a week [08:39] to go take care of those but I would [08:41] always take my dog Zoe the dalmatian lab [08:43] with me and at the end of our route we [08:45] would go to the dog park and one day at [08:48] the dog park this guy walks in he's got [08:50] like seven dogs six or seven dogs it was [08:54] a lot and I just never seen somebody [08:55] with that many dogs so I asked him like [08:58] wow how do you have so many dogs and [09:00] he's like oh these aren't my dogs these [09:02] are my client's dogs this is like the [09:04] third time I'm here and I'm like really [09:05] I go wait a minute this is this is [09:09] um how many years ago almost Abby's [09:12] almost 20 years ago and [09:15] um [09:16] so I was like well what do you do and he [09:19] was a dog walker well I had never heard [09:20] of that before and when I I said so [09:23] seriously you just get paid to go play [09:26] with dogs every day and he said yes and [09:28] I remember calling John and saying it [09:31] was one of those you know the big cell [09:33] phones probably before you were born [09:34] kind and I said I know exactly what I'm [09:38] gonna do when we move to Florida next [09:41] I'm gonna be a dog walker like I could [09:43] play with dogs all day and I could make [09:46] money and this is gonna be so great and [09:49] we get to Florida and [09:52] um most people kept their dogs on rope [09:54] out back it was like rural Panhandle [09:57] Florida or they just let them roam [09:59] around like nobody needed a dog walker [10:01] but at that point I I knew I wanted to [10:06] do something with dogs and I also [10:08] thought about well what am I most [10:10] passionate about and quite honestly that [10:13] was working with people [10:15] and getting back to my roots as a [10:17] teacher so I realized hey if I could get [10:20] trained as a dog trainer I could combine [10:23] my passion for my new love of dogs and [10:28] my real heart-centered passion for [10:31] teaching others and so that's how I [10:33] became a professional dog trainer which [10:36] I know this is so this is a long story [10:38] to get to the point of how we started [10:40] dog is good but it is the path that led [10:42] me to the desire to create something [10:47] specifically for dog lovers and so it [10:49] was at a continuing education conference [10:51] Where I Stood in front of a booth that [10:54] was selling these t-shirts and the [10:56] t-shirts were all white and they all had [10:58] dog breeds on them and they all said the [11:00] same thing I love my and then you know [11:03] whatever fill in the blank right and I [11:06] remember standing there for like two [11:07] minutes thinking well I I do love my dog [11:11] but it's different it's not just like I [11:14] love my dog there's this it's something [11:16] more than that and in fact I can't even [11:18] quite articulate what it is but I see it [11:20] with myself and I see what's happening [11:22] in the families and the people that I'm [11:24] working with and their dogs it's a very [11:26] unique Bond and I want something that's [11:29] cool and hip and express that a little [11:32] bit more deeply and so I came home and [11:34] told John about that [11:36] and he's like why don't we just create [11:37] it why don't we just do it ourselves and [11:40] we came up with dog is good and kind of [11:43] sat on the idea for a year until we [11:45] moved down [11:46] from Washington to California and had I [11:49] was wearing I was training a client and [11:52] was wearing one of our hats and it just [11:53] said dog is good on it and as soon as I [11:56] walked in she said where did you get [11:58] that hat I gotta I have to have that hat [12:01] and I was like really she's like yeah I [12:03] need about 12 of them where did you get [12:05] that and it it was a you know one of [12:08] those moments where it provided that [12:10] moment of validation hey maybe we're on [12:13] to something and so literally that next [12:15] week we did what we had to do to put the [12:18] business together and just launch it and [12:21] so that's the evolution of my journey [12:25] from [12:26] um you know life as a teacher to an [12:30] entrepreneur [12:32] creating something around both my [12:34] passions dogs and education and I really [12:37] loved what uh you and John said the [12:40] other day when we were talking and I [12:42] think it was somebody came up to you and [12:44] asked if you had an apparel company or [12:46] something like that right and you said [12:48] no it's not it's not that and then [12:50] you're telling me the story about how [12:52] people feel when they come home and they [12:54] see their dog oh yeah that they have [12:56] yeah how did you put that again it was [12:58] so beautiful well thanks [12:59] um you know so basically when people ask [13:01] me what is it that you sell I asked them [13:04] to just stop for one second and first I [13:07] clarify do you have a dog and most [13:09] people seem to so [13:11] um [13:12] stop for just a second and close your [13:14] eyes and picture that moment when you're [13:16] walking into your home and they come a [13:19] run-in and their tails they're doing the [13:22] full body wag they're so excited you [13:24] know how you feel in that second which [13:25] is very different than anything else [13:27] that you've ever that you feel during [13:29] the day they're like oh yes and you just [13:32] see them light up right I'm like that's [13:34] what I sell I sell your first two [13:36] minutes home all these products that we [13:39] create are just the tangible that make [13:41] that happen and so um we even came up [13:44] with a word for dog fig nugen John [13:47] always says it better than I do but we [13:49] defined it as being that unique Joy you [13:51] feel that moment you're with your dog [13:53] because it is so different than any [13:56] other relationship we have in our lives [13:58] and it evokes a particular feeling that [14:01] we don't get except in those moments [14:03] with our dogs it really isn't it really [14:05] does too I mean that was the best way [14:07] when you said that I instantly thought [14:08] of my dogs yeah they go crazy when I [14:10] come home yeah I always play games with [14:12] them and stuff and you know I've heard [14:13] this saying too have you heard this [14:14] where people say oh well don't don't get [14:15] excited when you come home or don't say [14:17] bye to your dogs when you leave I mean [14:18] you were how long were you a dog trainer [14:20] well um and I still am actually so it'll [14:23] be 18 years now then train dogs but do [14:26] you still I actively still do yeah I do [14:29] uh but I will say in the past five years [14:32] I have positioned myself really in the [14:36] puppy development area of training so [14:38] families who are selecting a dog helping [14:41] them select the right breed for them on [14:44] through those early stages those [14:46] critical stages of development and [14:47] taking them through that process and I [14:49] do that for two reasons one probably [14:52] very much like you I know that if we can [14:55] help them build a relationship on trust [14:56] and mutual respect and have an [14:58] understanding of what this creature [15:00] really is and how to best integrate them [15:03] into their home then those dogs will [15:04] stay with them for the lifetime and [15:08] um and then you know come on like [15:09] puppies are stress relief so it's [15:11] awesome yeah but I still do that today [15:13] that's amazing how do you have the time [15:15] I don't know like I I really don't know [15:18] sometimes people are like where do you [15:20] get the energy yeah [15:22] and you're right that is such an [15:24] important time is that that puppy [15:26] imprinting yes and you know just like [15:28] what you're saying at the very beginning [15:29] where you did exactly what we tell [15:31] everybody not to do yeah and I did the [15:34] same thing at one point I just I wanted [15:36] a dog and I went and I got a border [15:38] collie which again is not the right type [15:40] of dog for somebody who's a novice right [15:42] and doesn't know anything about dog [15:44] training that dog [15:45] took me for my money I'll tell you what [15:48] yeah I mean that dog hit same thing [15:50] running all over the place I didn't know [15:51] how to stop it from digging holes from [15:54] chewing up things it was it was chaos [15:56] but you know I ended up learning and [15:58] went on from there yeah but that is [16:00] something that I think a lot of people [16:02] run into because they get so excited and [16:03] they want something and they fall for [16:05] those cute little adorable puppy eyes [16:07] without doing the proper research first [16:08] what are some of the things that you [16:10] recommend to people that you are helping [16:12] when they're going to adopt a young [16:13] puppy or they're they're introducing [16:15] somebody into their family like that [16:17] yeah some of the strategies that you [16:18] found well I think the most important [16:20] thing is for them to really assess the [16:22] life that they have and a question that [16:24] I often ask everybody whether it's prior [16:26] to getting their dog unfortunately more [16:28] people reach out to me after they're [16:30] pulling their hair out right that works [16:33] but if I'm fortunate enough to get to [16:35] them before they actually get the dog [16:38] um you know my first question is what [16:40] always what does success look like to [16:42] you like what is your family Dynamic if [16:44] it's a single person or you know a [16:46] couple or a family with Children what [16:48] kind of Life do you guys have on a daily [16:50] basis and what attributes are important [16:53] to you and how are you planning on [16:55] incorporating your pup into your into [16:57] your Lifestyles is are you an active [16:59] family that wants to take your dog [17:00] everywhere you go or [17:02] um are you do you like to just kind of [17:04] stay at home and based on that you know [17:06] they're young kids you know what kind of [17:07] breeds are better for with with kids [17:10] with families Etc and uh you know just [17:13] helping them go through that process to [17:14] pick the right breed you know you [17:16] mentioned the Border Collie so [17:18] or even Aussies sometimes people go to [17:20] these events and they see these amazing [17:22] disc dogs I want a dog like that you [17:25] know and they have no idea like what [17:27] what that is going to entail right how [17:30] much training those right trainers that [17:31] do those types of sports they're working [17:33] with those dogs 24 7.
document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 236/468,yeah and that's [17:36] why they're you know put on such a great [17:37] show and so if I'm fortunate enough to [17:39] get to them prior to breed selection I [17:41] mean most people kind of have an idea [17:43] what they want already so then it also [17:45] becomes a matter of really taking them [17:47] through the process of let's be sure you [17:49] understand exactly what you what's going [17:51] to happen from the moment you bring your [17:53] pup in through that first year of life [17:55] and I think that that's been really [17:56] helpful for the clients that I do work [17:58] with because [18:00] um I always laugh when you know the [18:03] person gets their pups seven weeks eight [18:05] weeks and the puppy appears so trained [18:07] already right and follows them around [18:09] yes and then it sits and yeah you know [18:12] it's like so good because it doesn't [18:13] know what else to do and [18:16] um there's this false sense of like oh [18:17] my God I scored I got the best puppy [18:19] ever and within a couple weeks as you [18:22] know between eight and ten now all of a [18:24] sudden they're experiencing a different [18:25] puppy and they're going to experience [18:26] different puppies every two weeks [18:28] thereafter and so putting I feel my job [18:32] really you know I'm an educator I'm a [18:33] teacher and I [18:36] um that is where my strength lies is in [18:38] my ability to communicate with that [18:40] person on a human level [18:41] and let and take them down [18:44] um to the perspective of the um this [18:47] furball family member that they just [18:49] brought in that they love so much when [18:51] they know what to expect and they and I [18:54] put them in the role of teacher like [18:55] I've just assigned to a new role you're [18:58] not you are their dog mom or dog dad as [19:01] I know you're referring to yourselves [19:02] but for right now you're you're their [19:04] teacher you're their Mentor so let's [19:05] step this up and here's how you need to [19:07] show up and here's what you can expect [19:09] as a result but helping them to Define [19:12] their clear expectations of what success [19:15] looks like to them I'm sure you hear [19:16] this all the time everybody tells you [19:18] what they don't want their dogs to do [19:20] right and I'm very very very clear on [19:24] this one exercise that we go through in [19:25] our first session together I know what [19:28] you don't want your dog to do but do you [19:31] know what you're you want your dog to do [19:33] when the doorbell rings like that's what [19:35] we have to clarify that's what we need [19:37] to articulate because that's what we're [19:38] going to train and if you can see it [19:40] then you'll know exactly like is is it [19:42] you want the dog to run up do you want [19:44] it to go to a place do you want it to go [19:46] like my dogs have all been different so [19:48] bolo my lab the doorbell rings yeah she [19:51] barks for a second then it's a thank you [19:53] good girl and she runs and gets her toy [19:55] so [19:57] um you know every dog's different my I [19:59] had other dogs where they went to a [20:00] place and had to sit stay until I [20:01] released them you know when I was more [20:02] strict about it but but helping them [20:05] Define what they want and then teaching [20:07] those dogs to do those things while [20:09] managing their inability to practice [20:12] what they don't want them to be doing [20:14] and that's so well put too because that [20:16] is exactly and I never even said it so [20:18] simplified as that because [20:21] everybody always just talks about what [20:23] they don't want their dog to do you know [20:26] it's because a lot of the problems that [20:28] people run into with their dogs is [20:30] pretty much non-existent for dog [20:32] trainers and the reason why is because [20:35] dog trainers the moment they have their [20:37] dog they're showing their dog what to do [20:39] yes there was another trainer that I [20:41] worked with before there was a couple [20:42] things that she said that I really liked [20:44] one was [20:45] every dog gets a to-do list right and [20:48] that to-do list when you get your puppy [20:50] or your dog is blank now you can either [20:52] fill it out for them or they will fill [20:55] it out for themselves yeah usually when [20:57] they fill it out it's not going to be [20:59] the same things you would like them to [21:00] do so true and [21:04] um you know and I think you can make [21:06] some parallels as I tend to make a lot [21:08] of parallels between the anecdotal [21:10] lessons we learn from our dogs into life [21:13] experiences and so you can also take [21:17] that as a parallel to if you don't know [21:19] really what you want in your own life or [21:22] in your job or in a creation of a [21:24] business Etc just you know going back to [21:26] the earlier example [21:28] you may be very clear what you don't [21:30] want and we talk about what we don't [21:32] want or a person might complain about [21:34] stuff they don't want or don't like Etc [21:35] but they don't they haven't taken a [21:37] moment to Define with Clarity what they [21:39] do want and pour their energies in that [21:41] channel because that is you know where [21:43] the focus goes that's where that is [21:45] going to grow one of the other exercises [21:47] I love doing this with my clients [21:50] I started it many years ago and it was [21:53] so eye-opening for me and for them was [21:56] to have them list for me all the [21:59] behaviors they considered inappropriate [22:03] um that they absolutely didn't want so [22:04] one of those you know what don't you [22:06] want the dog to do so you see dogs doing [22:07] these things and you're like oh I [22:09] absolutely don't want my dog to be doing [22:10] this inappropriate behaviors and they [22:12] start listing it out uh the typical [22:14] right jumping barking digging running [22:18] away peeing in the house whatever all [22:20] these things and I'm like okay well tell [22:22] me what are all the behaviors that you [22:24] think would be perfectly appropriate [22:25] that would make you know the ideal dog [22:28] for you and they start listing all the [22:30] basic commands right sit down stay [22:32] coming when called you know not stealing [22:34] food and all these things and then just [22:36] for fun I threw in them well what what [22:37] behaviors do you consider like [22:40] a real smart dog you know would exhibit [22:44] and usually it's the tricks or stuff [22:46] like that and then I turn the paper I [22:48] write all these out for them and then I [22:50] ask them to point to the column [22:53] that is [22:54] the real dog [22:56] that our behaviors [22:59] that a real dog exhibits like that came [23:02] on this Earth to to experience that it [23:04] does and of course they point to well [23:07] gosh it's this one the one with all the [23:08] inappropriate or unwanted behaviors [23:11] right [23:12] and so I remind them [23:14] what you've just hired me to do and what [23:16] we are going to be doing as a team right [23:19] now starting this moment is d-dog your [23:21] dog you've just hired me to de-dog your [23:24] dog and they're like oh my [23:28] God I'm like yeah if you think about it [23:30] it's like any of us trying to strip away [23:32] the core of who you are as a person and [23:36] completely change you so that you fit [23:37] into my idea of what I think you should [23:41] be like right so obviously we know that [23:44] it's not [23:47] um the best combination to have a dog [23:48] that's engaging in the normal [23:50] instinctive behaviors on a regular basis [23:52] it just you know isn't going to work but [23:56] um understand that that comes with some [24:00] um responsibility for you as their [24:02] trainer so you need to step up as their [24:04] trainer and their mentor to teach them [24:07] and guide them properly so that they can [24:09] get into this column right here because [24:11] those behaviors are always going to be [24:12] there we just need to manage them make [24:16] the impossible for them to practice what [24:18] we don't want and teach what we do and I [24:21] said so it's not fair for us to expect [24:24] this dog to do anything other than be [24:26] who it is unless we step up to the plate [24:29] and make those changes help them make [24:31] those changes that's awesome I really [24:34] like that and that's [24:35] exactly right too that's what they're [24:37] supposed to do so if somebody doesn't [24:39] take the time I mean every now and then [24:41] you might luck out and get that you know [24:44] golden retriever that just behaves [24:45] perfectly yeah you know before I was a [24:48] dog trainer too I had a golden retriever [24:49] at one point and I didn't do anything as [24:52] far as train the dog I just took the dog [24:53] everywhere that I went and just by being [24:56] with me the dogs I mean goldens are just [24:58] they're such a pleasing breed yes some [25:00] of these breeds out there where they're [25:01] they're desired just to please is yeah [25:04] everything that they want to do and the [25:06] dogs kind of learned what I want but by [25:07] having them with me 24 7 and people [25:10] would say your dog's so well trained [25:12] it's like well I just lucked out with [25:13] this one because if you saw my other dog [25:16] back in the day you would not have said [25:17] the same thing so true oh my gosh so [25:20] true I mean and you know even as [25:22] trainers too like our dogs are not [25:24] perfect I mean I have stepped out of my [25:26] office one of my favorite photos that I [25:28] posted on Facebook uh about a month ago [25:31] I stepped out of my office for a second [25:33] and my Labrador is on my desk ask like [25:37] checking out the the mug where I just [25:39] had some soup you know so it's like you [25:42] can you can manage you can train you can [25:43] do whatever but there's those behaviors [25:45] are always going to be there because [25:46] that is the core of who they are and [25:47] let's face it loud I mean she will do [25:49] anything for food so yeah Labs [25:51] definitely well that's why a lot of [25:52] people that have Labs have really [25:54] overweight Labs yeah because they just [25:56] love food so much I mean my lab if I put [25:58] down an entire bag of food he would eat [26:00] it until he was in a food coma oh [26:01] completely they they are missing [26:03] something that um actually I did hear [26:05] this and I did not know this until I [26:07] heard this that they're about three [26:09] quarters of them are missing a [26:10] particular Gene that indicates [26:13] that they're full yeah that it's enough [26:16] um yeah and then I also heard from uh [26:18] nationally recognized veterinarian that [26:21] goldens and labs are probably well many [26:24] dogs are food motivated but they are the [26:26] top breeds that would swim to Alaska and [26:28] back for one piece of kibble [26:30] and so for people listening who have [26:32] Labs I'm sure you can relate so oh it's [26:34] fine if I do a video that I post on [26:36] Instagram and I use my lab Charlie [26:38] people are like oh my gosh how do you [26:40] get them so motivated for food it's you [26:42] know that's that's just that's him yeah [26:44] I mean that it is loves food it doesn't [26:46] even matter what it is it could be the [26:48] most income you know if we're if we're [26:50] looking at how many dogs like a certain [26:52] dog food you could take the type of food [26:54] that most dogs don't like and it'll [26:55] still be super excited for it so Ebola [26:57] yeah so will my dog for sure yeah they [27:00] are the best [27:02] so I want to ask you how were you able [27:04] to take that idea that you have dog is [27:08] Good from that moment where you had that [27:10] hat and you know you're you're it was a [27:12] dog training Clan right wanted wanted [27:15] what 12 of them I think you said and [27:17] then to be able to start growing it and [27:18] expanding it did you and your husband [27:20] start growing it when he was still in [27:22] the Navy or when he got it so how did [27:25] you get because where it started where [27:27] it is now I mean you guys are doing some [27:29] amazing things and you know there's like [27:32] a we were talking about a little bit [27:34] before the podcast started but there's [27:36] so many people out there that want to [27:38] become entrepreneurs sure but they don't [27:40] know how to do it and they don't have [27:41] the you know super high level energy [27:44] motivation that you have but what are [27:47] some of the things are like little [27:48] tricks or tactics or maybe [27:51] uh here's another example sorry I'm [27:53] going in 100 different things yeah [27:54] that's good you know 80d kicking in [27:56] that's all right but um like the little [27:57] thing that we did last week where you [27:59] were helping us with on season K9 and [28:01] we're going over some of these different [28:02] strategies and whatnot what are certain [28:04] things that people could probably [28:05] implement or maybe learn from or maybe [28:07] some of the the struggles that you had [28:09] some of the mistakes that you made that [28:11] they can learn from oh yeah I mean [28:12] they're you know to break that question [28:15] apart in just a few sections [28:17] um so yes we did start John was still [28:19] active duty military [28:21] um it wasn't until I think year two I [28:23] think that he retired [28:26] um and joined me full-time as our CEO of [28:30] the company but you know quite honestly [28:32] it was [28:33] um I was so passionate about how I felt [28:36] about dogs and that one moment of [28:38] validation was all I needed to just say [28:40] okay let's go and once I make a decision [28:42] like let's go we all get into we just [28:45] get into action mode but here's the [28:47] thing I did not know what I was doing [28:50] and I often referred to myself as the [28:53] unconscious incompetent so I didn't know [28:55] what I didn't know to ask the right [28:59] questions in order to grow it faster or [29:02] to do more and so [29:04] um [29:05] that was kind of a blessing and a curse [29:07] all at the same time and I just had to [29:09] figure out how to ask some begin to ask [29:11] some questions and just try some things [29:13] out through trial and error so one of [29:15] the things that we did [29:17] um in launching you know your basic [29:18] thing for me in LLC Etc and come up with [29:20] our logo and some general designs that [29:23] we wanted to put out there but then it [29:24] was about testing and so we did we just [29:26] the easiest thing that we could test was [29:28] apparel it was super easy to come up [29:31] with something and put it on a product [29:33] of apparel or a hat and take it to [29:36] Market and so we without realizing it [29:39] we're test marketing it at events so we [29:42] started to do events all around our [29:44] local area and began to see what was [29:46] really resonating with [29:49] um the dog lover and from there we were [29:51] able to start growing but I remember [29:53] somebody coming up to us and saying oh [29:55] you need to come to this [29:57] show this trade show where retailers go [30:00] because your product needs to be in [30:02] stores and we were like we knew we [30:05] always wanted to be a brand not you know [30:08] just sitting at events uh selling you [30:11] know Goods direct to Consumer all the [30:12] time but [30:13] um it was kind of a scary leap because [30:15] it was expensive to do this we didn't [30:16] know the whole world of wholesale but we [30:18] just dove in and tried it and we [30:23] um everybody went nuts for the product [30:25] like everybody went nuts but what we [30:27] found was nobody very I shouldn't say [30:30] nobody very few people wanted to bring [30:32] it in as a product because they were pet [30:34] stores and they're like well we don't do [30:36] anything for the people because dog is [30:38] good is a brand that's for the human at [30:40] the other end of the leash not for the [30:42] dog and [30:44] um [30:45] so so we did manage to get a couple of [30:47] good accounts from that particular show [30:49] but we came back the next year and then [30:51] the next year and so what started to [30:52] happen was I finally just started saying [30:55] like look at you guys you're so excited [30:56] about our product [30:58] do you think your customers would react [31:00] the same way you are your customer right [31:03] and that started like oh I never thought [31:06] about it I mean we're just like people [31:07] get into this box this Paradigm and they [31:10] they haven't opened [31:12] um the channels enough to look at what [31:14] are other possibilities what are other [31:16] what could we be doing that other pet [31:18] stores are not doing because the fact of [31:20] the matter is the dog lover [31:23] wants to share who they are as a person [31:25] as much as the football fan wants to [31:28] wear their [31:29] um Patriot Jersey at Super Bowl time [31:31] it's who they are it's it's the part of [31:35] their day-to-day lifestyle and so the [31:38] product line gives the dog lover the [31:40] chance to do that and it gave the [31:42] retailer an opportunity to tap into a [31:45] their customer on a different level and [31:47] B generate new revenues that they [31:49] weren't getting before right so that's [31:51] where we started to begin to see the [31:53] growth and then [31:55] um [31:55] uh [31:57] we started licensing the designs again [32:00] we didn't set out to do this but [32:02] somebody approached us and said oh my [32:04] gosh I just saw your designs I want to [32:06] license them and or take them to [32:09] companies for license it was a licensing [32:11] agent and we didn't know anything about [32:13] that so we had to learn you know what [32:15] that process was and everything is [32:17] always trial and error but here's the [32:18] thing [32:20] as often as there are these phenomenal [32:22] moments in the growing a business the [32:25] most important thing and we talked about [32:27] this while you're here is why you are [32:30] doing it in the first place why if you [32:33] do not have this [32:35] seriously [32:37] defined clear-cut why and reason then on [32:41] the days when it just plain sucks [32:43] because they're going to have days that [32:44] suck [32:45] um you you got to pull that out so that [32:48] it keeps you in the game because it's [32:49] always easy to quit you know the [32:51] sentiment this too shall pass it works [32:54] both ways so when you're having a down [32:58] moment in a business [33:01] um [33:03] and people say oh this too shall pass [33:05] it will but the moment you go up here [33:08] and you're on that high you better [33:10] remember that sentiment too this too [33:12] shall pass and so the real magic happens [33:16] when you are intentional about what [33:19] you're going to do in the moment when [33:21] you're in that low and in the moment [33:23] when you're in the high because you're [33:25] going to go here again and you're going [33:27] to go back up again and so having [33:30] um the preparation and the fortitude and [33:33] the ability to [33:36] step away sometimes [33:38] um you know both John I have a very [33:40] specific morning routine practice that [33:42] we engage in and I think that helps a [33:44] lot where [33:46] for creativity for growth for you know [33:49] all those things that [33:51] we've had to learn I mean I've had to [33:53] learn a lot in the past 10 years of [33:55] building this business and I've had to [33:57] grow a lot with it so that I could show [34:00] up as I need to do as a leader every day [34:02] and and John the same I mean he's an [34:05] amazing leader he always has been great [34:07] probably one of the best commanding [34:09] officers at most Navy sailors who had [34:12] the chance to serve with him would say [34:14] but [34:15] um I didn't have that you know I was I [34:17] never had a team that I was leading [34:20] until building this company and I want [34:22] to go back to what you just said to [34:23] about the lows and the highs and that [34:25] passing so the lows shouldn't be a [34:28] surprise right right if I'm going to [34:30] relate it to dog training this is how [34:32] everything makes sense in my mind when [34:34] I'm doing a lesson with somebody and [34:36] we're working on something like a Sit [34:37] Stay for example and the dog gets up [34:40] from the Sit Stay everybody acts [34:42] surprised yeah everybody goes I I'm like [34:45] why are you making all these crazy [34:46] noises we talked about what we're [34:48] supposed to say and how we're supposed [34:49] to react we know the dog is going to [34:51] make a mistake why be surprised about it [34:53] instead of being surprised let's be [34:55] prepared right instead of assuming the [34:58] dog's gonna be perfect or assuming the [35:00] business is going to be perfect because [35:01] yeah I've seen that that's especially [35:03] true with dog trainers because they have [35:05] really good seasons and then really [35:07] excuse me lower Seasons you know the [35:09] holidays are super busy for dog trainers [35:11] because people are going on vacation [35:13] they want their dog to be trained at the [35:15] same time they're boarding things like [35:16] that but then there's the load times [35:18] maybe certain times of the year when [35:20] people are want to be with their dog the [35:21] whole time and they don't want to do [35:22] training at this point because they have [35:24] that time so understanding that I think [35:26] is a really really good way to put it [35:28] and I've had some of those lows where I [35:30] was incredibly stressed out and yeah not [35:32] thinking about what's gonna happen and [35:33] then becoming complacent [35:36] when it's doing well and I think that [35:38] could be an issue too because I've [35:40] become complacent multiple times it's [35:41] like oh it's going well yeah I don't [35:43] have to worry about it and then all of a [35:44] sudden it's going back down because I [35:46] got complacent right now it's such a [35:48] good point and I like that you use that [35:49] word complacent because I think a lot of [35:51] people get in that place whether it's [35:54] running a business uh or just in their [35:56] life in general [35:58] um [35:58] that really is a good point but to that [36:01] that on those highs be ready for it [36:05] because it is not going to last it just [36:06] it's it and the beauty is that it keeps [36:09] going up but it has to it's a natural [36:12] cycle with the valleys in there too [36:15] um and then the other piece is I think [36:17] especially as it relates to dog training [36:19] is we we tend actually even even with [36:22] dog is good so this is a year that we're [36:24] doing a lot of pivots I am so excited [36:27] about two new programs that we are [36:30] introducing that are very different from [36:32] anything we've ever done before [36:35] um but sometimes you in any business you [36:38] have to be ready to Pivot and you have [36:40] to be nimble enough to do that and to [36:43] also um you know with dog training what [36:46] I find when I've had the pleasure of [36:48] mentoring some trainers is [36:51] um and not not the mentorship on the how [36:53] do you train piece but on the business [36:55] side of it is we're so in our heads [36:58] around around this knowledge and desire [37:01] to help people with their dogs because [37:02] we don't want their dogs to be given up [37:04] but we forget who the real customer is [37:07] right the customer is the person and [37:11] um [37:11] we are selling our service as a trainer [37:14] let's say but if we stay if we only have [37:18] our eyes down in the in the lane right [37:20] in front of us then we're missing all [37:22] this potential opportunity that's just [37:24] peripheral of that so getting to a place [37:27] where you can just stop for a second be [37:28] like and just start asking the questions [37:30] what else could I be doing to generate [37:32] more Revenue [37:33] what is being what could I be offering [37:35] that isn't currently being offered [37:36] offered is it even dog training is there [37:39] something that's complementary is there [37:41] some collaborative things that I could [37:42] be doing with not even another dog [37:44] trainer but another business that would [37:47] yield more business for both I mean just [37:49] kind of thinking out of the box [37:51] um it's amazing what you start to come [37:53] up with and then you [37:55] and that's why I love getting people [37:57] together to talk about stuff like that [37:58] because you just never know what comes [37:59] out of it yeah we came up with some [38:01] great ideas oh my God I'm so excited for [38:03] you guys oh yeah I'm super excited about [38:05] it I think everybody was pretty stoked [38:06] after that meeting yeah and what's funny [38:09] too some said a little bit earlier uh [38:11] which made me think of a quote I'm sure [38:13] you've heard of this quote where it goes [38:15] entrepreneurship those willing to work [38:16] 140 hours a week to avoid working 40 [38:20] hours a week and make less money [38:22] sometimes yeah well that's true yeah [38:25] that's at the beginning though yeah it's [38:26] something that I try telling to a lot of [38:28] people because there's another [38:29] quote that's really nice where it says [38:31] entrepreneurship those willing to work a [38:33] few years like others won't so they can [38:35] live the rest of their lives like others [38:36] can't absolutely and those beginning [38:38] first few years are so important because [38:41] that is when you are building and when [38:42] you're going to go through some of the [38:43] most struggles and that's why I think [38:45] what you're saying earlier about knowing [38:47] why you're doing something is really [38:49] important because if you don't have any [38:51] sort of passion towards it you're not [38:53] going to be able to stay disciplined [38:55] long enough to make it successful but if [38:57] it's something that pulls you well then [39:00] you just go with that pull yeah and you [39:02] continue to work I mean there's days [39:03] where I literally almost every day I [39:04] work till the moment I get up to the [39:06] moment I go to bed but it's all stuff [39:07] that I enjoy you know and adding new [39:09] things like doing this podcast it takes [39:11] extra time but it's so much fun and I [39:13] learned so much by sitting down with [39:14] people like you and it provides that [39:16] extra value to my audience no totally [39:19] and it um you know it fuels you and [39:22] that's what gives you one the energy to [39:24] do you all the easiest way to know when [39:26] you are doing something you don't want [39:28] to be doing is you have no energy energy [39:30] like it just does yeah you dread it or [39:32] you just notice like oh my god oh I'm so [39:34] tired it's you're not in your Zone I [39:36] mean you could be completely sleep [39:38] deprived and be doing something that [39:40] you're so passionate about like there's [39:42] a couple initiatives in dog is growing [39:44] out I literally could also do 24 7.
document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 237/468,I [39:46] literally could and when I'm in it like [39:50] you feel and I tell people that I'm like [39:52] you know you are so dialed in to the [39:55] core of why you are here on this earth [39:57] when you feel this particular way and [40:00] the other thing about the dog training [40:01] component as a business I would have to [40:04] mention this is [40:06] um [40:07] just like we ask our clients and what [40:09] does success look like to you that is [40:11] the biggest lesson that I got in [40:12] building this business I did not have [40:15] Clarity around that so by the time we [40:17] launched in a few years in had done our [40:20] first seven figure Revenue year [40:24] this business looked a certain way I [40:26] wasn't prepared for I wasn't prepared [40:28] for how I was living each day to get it [40:30] to that place now I have no problem [40:32] working super hard [40:34] and we'll go 24 7 around things that I [40:36] really love but [40:38] um I would have done it differently you [40:40] know the hindsight [40:41] Etc so that's a really important piece [40:43] too is okay we get started with dog [40:44] training business you know want to [40:45] launch our business well okay it's five [40:47] years from now what does your business [40:48] look like do you have a team [40:51] how many days a week are you working how [40:53] much revenue are you generating how are [40:54] you spending your free time what do you [40:56] do philanthropically like what does it [40:58] look like five years from now never mind [41:00] where you're going to get your first [41:01] client What's it gonna look like five [41:03] years from now and let's reverse [41:06] engineer that [41:08] it's so much easier yeah it really is [41:11] when you look at it that way if you [41:13] don't know where you're going then all [41:14] roads get you there yeah exactly [41:16] exactly so true and you end up at the [41:20] exact same spot you were if you don't [41:21] have a plan I think that's something I'm [41:23] also a big Tony Robbins yeah I love him [41:25] too yeah what he says is you know if you [41:27] don't know where you're going to be in [41:29] five years you're going to be exactly [41:30] where you are right now completely so [41:32] having that picture where do I want to [41:34] be so if we're talking dog trainers you [41:36] know and I've gotten a lot of feedback [41:38] from dog trainers on the podcast so I'm [41:40] excited that we're getting a lot of dog [41:42] training dog trainer viewers but um so [41:45] like let's say in five years for an [41:47] example if we're looking at a dog [41:48] trainer's perspective do they want to [41:49] have a facility do they want to have a [41:52] team that's training dogs for them do [41:53] they want to run the business side do [41:54] they want to just stay small and have a [41:57] certain amount of clients how are they [41:58] going to be able to balance that out and [41:59] still have enough time what are they [42:00] right yeah all these little details and [42:02] think about being a dog trainer how did [42:04] you I know you just said it's more about [42:06] that picture the five years but how did [42:09] you start getting your first few clients [42:11] because that is something that a lot of [42:13] dog trainers that are just completing [42:14] their dog training school or they just [42:16] finished being a mentor to be able to go [42:19] out there get their first few clients [42:21] and also to have the con the confidence [42:23] to be able to deliver for that you know [42:25] so [42:26] um I had a dog trainer I was just [42:28] mentoring not too long ago and she's [42:29] worried about getting clients like she's [42:31] worried that she's not going to be able [42:33] to deliver right for them well enough to [42:36] where they're going to be really happy [42:37] so would it maybe [42:39] wow well step one there is mindset on [42:42] that [42:44] um you know and I work on this every [42:47] single day [42:49] um I just believe [42:50] Ted I'm good enough that I will get the [42:54] clients that I need to get but I'm also [42:56] a go-getter so just as with the [42:59] um [43:00] lingerie company and asking people to [43:02] host parties that I didn't know just as [43:04] getting my Gourmet Coffee vending [43:06] machines placed in companies around the [43:07] Washington DC area I had to go in and [43:09] ask were you nervous when you would go [43:11] in when you would go to the mall sure oh [43:13] yeah like how would you get past that [43:14] nervous I'd be like I just would I'm [43:16] like you just got to just go do it you [43:18] got this like in my head I'm just like [43:20] just go do it just go do it just go do [43:21] it right and um [43:24] you know with every now [43:28] um I mean when I was selling skincare [43:30] there was a guy that um was doing a [43:32] training once and I I love this and I to [43:34] this day still say it some will some [43:36] won't so what [43:38] next and that's just how it was I I [43:42] guess I just didn't you know it yes I [43:44] was nervous [43:46] um and yes if the person said no I had [43:47] that moment of ugh because it feels like [43:49] they're saying no to you but I just [43:51] wanted something so badly and knew that [43:54] I could pull it off that I just went [43:56] through the nose and um and just didn't [44:00] worry about it and with but I got gained [44:02] confidence you know all I'm a very [44:04] confident person now and I always was [44:07] confident but not the same level I am [44:09] today you know and it's how we built dog [44:12] is good too I mean I would sit on the [44:13] phone my goal was I gotta make 15 calls [44:15] a day and I'd call from California to [44:17] the east coast and be like hey you know [44:19] my name is Gila Kurtz I'm just launched [44:22] a company here in California like I felt [44:23] like California sounded so sexy from [44:25] California [44:27] and uh we're not on the east coast and I [44:30] am looking for a few good retailers to [44:32] take a look at our brand I would love [44:34] for you to be one of the first would you [44:35] mind looking at my catalog I never to [44:38] this day [44:39] almost 11 years into this business I [44:41] have never heard somebody tell me no [44:44] to look at my catalog okay fine once you [44:47] see if they don't like it but I always [44:49] got that yes and that gave me confidence [44:50] you know to to continue to go and [44:53] through the numbers you know [44:55] people would some people would say no [44:57] and certain percent would say yes so [44:59] that's kind of how we grow but as far as [45:00] the dog training goes I just started [45:02] getting out there I knew that again I am [45:05] a teacher so it would be very easy for [45:07] me and this is how I did it I would go [45:09] to oh and let me also refresh your [45:12] memory in that I'm a military spouse I [45:14] had to do it every two years [45:15] so for when I started in Florida I had [45:18] to do this and then I moved to [45:19] Pennsylvania and I had to do it and then [45:21] I moved to Washington and I had to do it [45:22] and then I moved to California faster [45:24] each time yes yes because you I [45:26] perfected my process because I was also [45:28] like crap I got only two years here man [45:30] I gotta get busy and you're also very [45:32] sincere yeah yeah and I think that [45:34] really does a lot too you're sincere and [45:37] you're real and people see that and you [45:39] know that that was something else I was [45:41] trying to say to this other trainer I [45:42] said you know what be sincere be real [45:45] and show that you care because that I [45:48] think is another big thing because of [45:49] course people don't like to be sold [45:50] right right but if you really do care [45:53] and you are really trying to help them [45:55] build that stronger relationship I think [45:56] that goes a long way too because even if [45:59] you're not the best dog trainer you know [46:00] which I'm not the best dog trainer [46:02] because there are some amazing doctor's [46:04] out there yeah I would love to be the [46:06] best yeah but um showing how much you [46:09] care and doing everything you can to [46:10] make sure that they're successful with [46:12] your dog yeah that plays a big part too [46:14] and and everybody's like that glows off [46:16] of you oh thank you thanks sincerity I [46:20] appreciate that [46:21] um yeah and I think part of gaining that [46:24] confidence if I may for those people who [46:26] are questioning that [46:27] they know they know so much more than [46:30] their clients and I think people get in [46:33] their heads and I'm so glad you said [46:34] that because I [46:37] for the longest time people [46:39] um here at dog is good wanted me to do a [46:41] lot of dog training video oh you should [46:42] be doing your using your expertise and I [46:45] was like no I'm all about the [46:46] relationship we have with our dogs and [46:48] I'm selling this kind of stuff right I [46:49] wasn't combining the two and I think [46:52] part of it was [46:53] um in all honesty there was maybe a [46:55] little bit of fear okay wait if I put [46:57] myself out there on video now I've just [46:59] opened myself up to the world of dog [47:01] trainers who are they love you know [47:04] everybody has their opinion right [47:05] everybody you're doing it wrong and [47:07] you're treating this or you should do [47:09] that or don't correct this or whatever [47:11] you know whatever it is [47:12] um and maybe I just didn't want to open [47:14] myself up to [47:16] um [47:18] negativity or um oh you're not doing it [47:21] right [47:22] but now a few years older and wiser you [47:25] know I just kind of realized like look [47:26] we all have our own way my way works [47:29] it's always worked for me and it's [47:31] always helped people your way works and [47:33] it's always worked for you and it's [47:35] always helped that person and so when we [47:38] get out of our heads about that and know [47:40] that as far as the End customer goes we [47:43] we definitely know more than they do and [47:45] so we can help them [47:47] um [47:48] then it should be relatively easy but [47:50] the way that I actually started getting [47:52] it because I had to move so much was I [47:54] would go in and I would um offer I would [47:58] buy lunch at veterinary offices I would [48:00] bring in lunch and I said I'd like to do [48:02] a lunch and learn for you guys and be [48:03] like oh we have trainers we already work [48:05] with I know that's great [48:07] um but you you haven't met me and I am [48:10] here and I would love the opportunity [48:13] just to share with you who I am as a [48:15] person what I believe as it relates to [48:18] dogs and how I can best serve any [48:21] customer that maybe some of those people [48:22] can't and that's how I did it and then [48:25] what would happen of course I would [48:27] bring lunch and then you make friends [48:28] and yeah I mean I'm a person I'd make it [48:31] fun I would do like a little training [48:32] lesson and brief you know I don't need [48:34] to [48:35] throw up all my knowledge on them I [48:37] would just make it fun and brief and [48:38] they would start to refer people but the [48:40] magic happens with those customers [48:42] because [48:44] if you're good enough you're you only [48:48] have one connection with them right and [48:50] hopefully you build a relationship with [48:52] that person and throughout the the [48:55] training process I always ask every [48:58] session even throughout the session is [49:00] this helpful for you and they would say [49:02] yes and I would say how so [49:05] what is working what is helpful for you [49:07] right now like what are you finding [49:09] value in awesome okay and they would [49:11] tell me and I just got oh I did it again [49:14] and I would just kind of build up on [49:15] that and then throughout like once I had [49:18] the Rapport you know the connection and [49:20] I'm friendly person so you know I really [49:22] because let's face it as dog trainers [49:24] and I get it some of them are so great [49:26] with the dogs and they love the dogs [49:29] um maybe not the people as much and [49:31] they've even heard people say that but [49:33] the customer is the person and so you [49:36] have to find that skill set to [49:37] communicate with empathy and Etc with [49:41] them and know that they're not [49:43] unfortunately sometimes as committed to [49:45] their dog as you are right so [49:48] um uh getting those yeses throughout the [49:51] way but then asking for their referral [49:52] hey and you may not know somebody right [49:55] now who has a dog that needs training [49:57] but I know you're going to come into [49:58] people who in contact with people who [50:00] will [50:01] will I be the one that you're going to [50:03] share [50:04] and uh and they would always oh yes and [50:07] so to this day [50:10] since I only trained full-time full full [50:13] full-time all types of training [50:15] when we moved to California for maybe [50:17] two years before this business started [50:19] taking off so much that I couldn't and I [50:22] have never once advertised I don't even [50:23] have a website I don't even have a [50:25] website website but it's a referral it's [50:27] always word of mouth and with every [50:29] client I say the same thing [50:32] I know you may not know somebody who has [50:34] puppy right now but [50:35] I know you're going to run into someone [50:37] who will [50:38] you share me with them and they're like [50:40] oh yes and I still get and speaking of [50:43] referrals or reviews that is something [50:46] that what I've noticed [50:48] new dog trainers have a hard time [50:50] getting those reviews on Yelp or Google [50:52] or Facebook or whatever and I just kind [50:54] of want to share a little strategy that [50:56] I've used before that worked beautifully [50:59] I don't really do it so much anymore uh [51:02] because I have over 105 star reviews but [51:05] it's awesome when I first started one of [51:08] the things that I would do is well what [51:09] I did was I created a dog training [51:12] manual that I would provide to my [51:14] clients after the lesson and I would [51:16] email it to them and in the email I [51:18] would thank them for giving me the [51:20] opportunity to come out and work with [51:22] them and work with their dog and then I [51:24] would say attach I have gifted my dog [51:27] training manual and then at the bottom [51:28] I'd say if you have a spare moment [51:31] reviews really help me continue helping [51:33] other dogs and then I would say thanks [51:35] Nate Chum or whatever and almost every [51:37] single person that I would send that [51:39] manual to to help them to continue their [51:41] training almost all of them would write [51:43] the review afterwards oh so awesome and [51:45] today you can do the same thing on [51:47] Google [51:48] but I would take that one step further [51:50] and ask in that final lesson when [51:52] they're you're saying your goodbyes [51:53] you've built this relationship you're [51:55] right there just say hey would you mind [51:57] could you check out your phone for like [51:59] you've validated it they've gotten so [52:00] much value would you mind writing me a [52:02] review right now [52:04] and it could just be you know give me [52:05] five you know how many stars you think [52:07] this was worth it did it and then [52:08] they're just doing it right then there [52:10] just so you I mean you clearly with 500 [52:12] that's that is amazing 100 reviews oh [52:15] 100 still but it's like 100 no of it [52:17] still that's fantastic and the thing is [52:19] um [52:20] uh [52:21] uh the other thing that someone could do [52:23] is [52:24] um offer to do something free so putting [52:27] it out there and saying hey I am looking [52:28] for [52:29] five [52:31] five dogs one that's a puppy one that [52:34] has challenges with leash I'd like to do [52:36] one lesson with you I'm going to be [52:37] videotaping this and um and then now [52:40] you're gaining con getting content [52:42] you're getting that connection to that [52:44] person and you're getting out there and [52:46] then and then I would just ask them you [52:48] know who could you refer that's [52:50] beautiful and I I did that when I first [52:52] started and I know we're running out of [52:53] time here so I want to be able to wrap [52:55] it up yeah um but before we close up are [52:58] there certain ways people could find you

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 241/468,com/ === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] [Music] [00:08] all right buddy thank you so much for [00:09] coming out today man i really appreciate [00:11] you taking the time and i'm excited to [00:13] talk to you especially about jiu jitsu [00:15] as i have recently dove into it head [00:18] first and i'm trying to become an expert [00:20] as you are [00:21] well i'm not an expert yet but [00:24] we're getting there slowly what belt [00:25] level are you though brown brownie how [00:28] long have you been training for though [00:29] it'll be [00:31] it'll be 10 years [00:33] this this november [00:35] i mean 10 years is a long time it's [00:37] crazy you know i was thinking last night [00:39] when somebody jumps into jiu jitsu it's [00:41] a very intellectual sport you have to be [00:43] able to problem solve and work through [00:44] different situations now if you look at [00:46] somebody let's say someone who has [00:48] photographic memory or the ability to [00:51] really memorize things why is it that [00:53] somebody who is that smart and that [00:55] capable still cannot progress in jiu [00:58] jitsu that quick just from memorizing [01:00] the technique i mean if you think about [01:02] it on an intellectual level if i could [01:03] just memorize all the techniques if i [01:05] know if i do this and this i can pass [01:08] somebody's guard right or if i do this [01:09] and this got you why is it though that [01:11] even if somebody if they can memorize [01:13] every single move like they just study [01:14] for a week let's say someone who's super [01:16] smart super high iq they still will not [01:18] be able to just jump in and start [01:19] competing against somebody at a higher [01:21] level why is that i think [01:24] one of the reasons is because [01:26] in real life scenarios nothing goes [01:28] according to plan everything is you know [01:30] there's so many different things that [01:32] could happen and you you have to be able [01:34] to adapt and you know you might be [01:36] drilling a technique [01:38] a hundred times and if you're not [01:39] dealing with resistance at one point [01:42] right the technique is not always going [01:43] to look as beautiful in real life as it [01:45] does in drilling [01:47] so in drilling there's resistance coming [01:48] from different things different aspects [01:50] and then you have your fatigue what do [01:52] you mean by drilling [01:53] so [01:54] putting in the reps [01:56] so we're gonna practice [01:58] butterfly sweep drilling with a human [02:00] though exactly that's what you mean so [02:02] you practice the coaches show you the [02:04] technique you break off into couples or [02:06] into groups and then you start drilling [02:08] the technique right two and two for [02:09] example so i go two times you go two [02:11] times and then we just keep going back [02:13] and forth back and forth back and forth [02:14] just putting in reps right repetition [02:16] repetition repetition just to ingrain [02:18] that motor pattern into the brain into [02:21] the cns [02:22] but then when you start grappling [02:25] it's not going to be all fine and dandy [02:27] and beautiful right it's not always [02:28] going to flow beautifully but the more [02:30] repetitions you put into it the more [02:32] beautiful it will be what do you think [02:34] causes that though as far as somebody [02:36] who's able to study it and not [02:39] necessarily be able to do it right away [02:40] because i understand like the drills add [02:42] a lot of value to it and being able to [02:44] get that repetition in but how much of a [02:46] difference is it when you are [02:49] when you're drilling or even [02:51] rolling as it's called right getting [02:53] into sessions sparring rolling with [02:55] different people it's got to make a huge [02:57] difference just when you're grappling [02:59] with different people at different sizes [03:01] shapes speed and that has to affect [03:04] every single technique that you're [03:05] trying to implement there's there's so [03:07] many factors like i just said there's so [03:09] many factors coming into it and then at [03:10] one point your fatigue is going to play [03:12] a role into that if you're sweaty you're [03:14] slipping more if there's sweat on the [03:16] mat your feet are sleeping more so you [03:17] might not you're not posting the same [03:19] way you're posting when you're drilling [03:21] so it's just so many [03:22] i mean and and they might have learned [03:24] the technique from somebody else and [03:26] they learned it with this modification [03:28] and and they've done it so many times [03:30] that that's just how they're used to [03:31] doing it so when you're grappling [03:32] against them when you're sparring [03:34] they're they're they're coming at you in [03:36] a different way than you learned your [03:38] opponent to come at you in in practice [03:39] with your original partner yeah let's [03:42] say for uh just these purposes let's say [03:45] there's ten thousand techniques right [03:47] let's just say ten thousand dollars like [03:49] let's say they break down jiu jitsu and [03:50] and there's ten thousand total moves [03:52] right so with that ten thousand even [03:54] though it's ten thousand moves [03:55] realistically because of all these [03:57] factors those 10 000 techniques can [04:00] literally turn into like 10 million [04:02] absolutely because of the fact that one [04:04] technique i might be able to do a sweep [04:06] on one guy who's proportionate to my [04:09] length but the second he has 20 pounds [04:11] on me that sweet may not work or if his [04:13] foot is uh six inches more to the left [04:16] then that changes everything or if his [04:18] technique is better or right how much of [04:21] a factor does it play for somebody who's [04:23] been training in jiu jitsu for an [04:25] extended period of time but they're [04:27] starting to get older is how much does [04:29] age affect somebody who's training and [04:31] also how much does weight play a role so [04:34] if i'm going up against someone who's [04:36] equal to my technique but they have [04:38] 30 pounds on me how much of an advantage [04:40] would that give that person with the [04:42] equal technique [04:43] it's going to be a significant advantage [04:46] um now you also have to consider [04:48] training age [04:49] right so for example you look at pro [04:52] sports right what's the what's the age [04:54] of the of the main athletes right [04:56] because it comes to a point where your [04:58] age starts to to [05:00] to influence the way that you can [05:01] perform right so it could be nfl it [05:04] could be baseball it could be basketball [05:06] after what like you know in your 30s mid [05:09] 40s that's when they start talking about [05:11] retirement because again it's your [05:13] training age you've already reached the [05:15] level of maximal physical potential and [05:18] after that point you know you're making [05:19] this curve up with with games when you [05:22] barely start you know these gains are [05:23] crazy crazy and then as you progress in [05:25] training age it starts to flatten a [05:28] little bit [05:29] because you've learned everything that [05:30] there is to learn you know let's say [05:31] like the basics and then after that [05:33] you're just refining movements the same [05:35] thing happens with the pros so it gets [05:38] to the point where the more you train [05:40] the less you're going to start to learn [05:41] and the more you have to [05:42] mix and play with different aspects of [05:44] the sport and then eventually your [05:46] performance starts going down the same [05:47] with lifting right you can't lift i was [05:49] about to say that because you know [05:51] somebody who's got zero training itch [05:53] could start lifting and [05:55] let's say they've never deadlifted [05:56] before [05:57] and then i don't know five years into [05:59] lifting you know now they're lifting [06:01] they're deadlifting their body weight [06:03] and then five years later so they made [06:05] an increase of zero to 180 pounds [06:08] and then the next five years they're not [06:10] gonna they're not going to be able to [06:11] double their they might be able to [06:13] double their deadlift but as they go [06:15] their lifts are you know the gains are [06:16] going to be smaller and smaller and [06:18] smaller it's that plateau yeah until [06:20] eventually because of their training age [06:22] and their maximal physical potential how [06:23] much they prepared how much they had a [06:25] baseline set up um [06:28] they're going to hit a certain threshold [06:29] and then they start coming off of it and [06:31] that's just natural it's just the way [06:32] the body works and right now you train [06:35] at 10th planet jiu jitsu but you also [06:38] trained it at other schools as well [06:39] right no i've only tried 10th planet but [06:41] you told me that you did ghee [06:43] well i've trained okay so [06:45] i i never trained in the ghee i have a [06:48] ghee [06:48] and maybe playing around we would train [06:51] and then there was a couple of [06:52] competitions little local ones back in [06:53] el paso texas where and you did i signed [06:56] up for nogi and the ghee division did [06:58] you win the ghee no [07:00] i took third place in one of them uh [07:02] okay yeah and it makes me think about [07:04] somebody who is [07:05] because you know there's a lot of people [07:07] out there who want to start a martial [07:09] art they want to jump into it and being [07:11] at how long have you been a template you [07:13] said ten years ten years ten years how [07:14] long have you been working at ten planet [07:17] um [07:18] officially about two months so eight [07:20] weeks tenth planet spring valley but you [07:22] worked at another one i i helped my [07:24] cousin out a little bit back in 2013 [07:27] when he took over the 10th planet el [07:29] paso gym [07:31] and you so you've probably seen a lot of [07:32] people coming into 10th planet [07:35] and a lot of people leaving absolutely [07:37] right what do you think causes people to [07:40] quit a martial arts because it's across [07:42] the board i mean every place that i went [07:44] to people will start and people quit and [07:46] then you have the people who stick stick [07:47] with it [07:48] what separates the dudes or the girls [07:50] whatever who start it and stick with it [07:53] in comparison the ones who start and [07:55] quit [07:56] and usually it's early in the game right [07:59] yes i agree uh i think i don't know who [08:01] put this out but [08:03] i think most blue belts i think gets [08:04] once you get to blue belt a lot of the [08:06] guys fall off you know once they hit [08:09] that blue belt level blue belt it's [08:10] weird i don't know it's like okay like i [08:12] got here and maybe it's [08:15] you know this took so much work [08:17] or to some it's because you also have [08:19] this is what a lot of people don't [08:20] understand and it took me a while to [08:21] comprehend is you have the competitors [08:23] and you have the hobbyists so you have [08:25] guys you have people that have lives [08:27] families full-time jobs you know and [08:29] this is just a hobby to them [08:31] so it'll obviously take them longer to [08:33] progress [08:34] versus a competitor that's [08:37] that might be working full-time that [08:38] might be working part-time or that's [08:40] just a full-time competitor and they're [08:41] training two times a day five days a [08:44] week for i don't know total of three [08:45] hours a day [08:47] so [08:49] i don't i know it really just depends [08:51] some it's not for everybody definitely [08:53] it definitely puts you in a very [08:55] uncomfortable situation at first you're [08:57] you're it's a contact sport so you're [08:59] grabbing somebody they're on top of you [09:01] you're sweaty um a lot of people also [09:04] have an ego issue [09:05] so [09:06] they're not used to being tapped out [09:08] right to tell them it's like like i i [09:10] literally just have to acknowledge that [09:12] you're better than me at this and have [09:14] to tap and a lot of people you know they [09:16] they just can't deal with that and like [09:18] i've met a lot of people who are just [09:19] not used to that [09:20] that makes me also think about somebody [09:22] who's coming in for the first time when [09:24] you first said blue belt that makes me [09:26] think is it possible that [09:28] i mean if you take any blue belt [09:31] from 10th planet jiu jitsu i guarantee [09:33] that person is going to be able to choke [09:35] out any dude who doesn't have any [09:36] training absolutely like the the blue [09:38] belts are really really solid i mean [09:40] it's i was i was super impressed i [09:42] probably [09:43] uh trained at let me say train [09:45] realistically trained at two jiu jitsu [09:47] places but i've been at other jiu jitsu [09:49] places to come in for a free class or [09:51] one of my friends go to that school or [09:53] something like that [09:54] and there's two schools that stood out [09:57] so hey diago's brazilian jiu jitsu in la [10:00] their blue belts were unbelievable crazy [10:03] they were amazing and the blue builds at [10:04] 10 planet like i was rolling with a few [10:07] of the guys and i could have i thought [10:09] for sure they were purple belts oh my [10:11] gosh [10:12] it's like holy cow no that's a blue belt [10:14] so you think it could be possible that [10:15] they get to the blue belt level it was a [10:17] lot of work like you said and they go [10:18] you know what i know enough within the [10:21] sport that if somebody try something i [10:22] could successfully defend myself or my [10:24] friends or my family and i know enough [10:27] or is it you think they just get [10:30] maybe wear and tear because it is very [10:32] physically demanding like you know [10:34] you're recovering from ribs right i got [10:36] bruised ribs from competing last weekend [10:39] yeah my ankle hurts because i messed [10:40] something up there or if somebody their [10:42] ego gets in the way maybe they don't tap [10:44] when they're supposed to [10:45] do you think that plays a role or do you [10:46] think a lot of it can also be when [10:48] somebody first starts out [10:50] and they just don't get past like what i [10:52] tell people because i'm trying to get a [10:54] bunch of my buddies to come down and [10:55] train at ten planets [10:57] um [10:58] one of my buddies i said you know if [10:59] you're going to sign up [11:01] do not quit until you start tapping [11:04] people out [11:05] when you start tapping people out if you [11:07] want to quit then quit but at least get [11:10] past because you are going to get tapped [11:11] out a bunch of times correct you know [11:13] it's and it goes with people like like [11:17] they told me like when they just start [11:18] and it's like dude like i feel helpless [11:20] like and that's that's how it feels when [11:22] you start because you know somebody [11:24] who's got a month of training ahead of [11:26] you and you just started there they're [11:28] gonna they're gonna be all over you [11:30] but [11:31] white belt is generally you know just [11:32] you're playing the survival game [11:34] and you're just trying to survive in [11:36] your fig you're trying to figure you're [11:37] you're they're pretty much throwing you [11:38] into the water and you don't know how to [11:40] swim and you're just trying to float [11:41] you're just trying to be able to breathe [11:43] that's right that's that's really how [11:44] wipeout level is well man when i first [11:47] started submitting people that's when i [11:48] became addicted [11:50] like it's so much fun dude that they're [11:52] really cool because i also was a black [11:53] belt ring for martial arts oh god so i [11:55] did a lot of grappling within the marine [11:57] corps martial arts but it's different so [11:59] in in marine corps martial arts they do [12:00] grappling but it's just it's not to the [12:02] level of jiu-jitsu so combatives right [12:05] is that what they call i know the army [12:06] uses combatives yeah i mean we do so for [12:08] example each belt level has a certain [12:11] syllabus in order to uh get that belt in [12:14] marine corps martial arts you have to be [12:16] able to demonstrate that you can perform [12:18] every single [12:20] exercise that's required in order to get [12:22] that belt so somebody could be let's say [12:26] they graduate boot camp they get their [12:27] tan belt which would be equivalent to a [12:29] white belt and two months later they can [12:31] have their gray if they work with [12:33] somebody they learn the techniques and [12:35] they can demonstrate them once they [12:36] demonstrate them unless it's changed [12:38] since i was there so you can get a great [12:39] really fast i got my black belt in nine [12:41] months [12:43] jesus you know and all i did was i [12:44] trained every day so me and one of my [12:46] good buddies but you think about it it's [12:48] also it's different than the level of [12:51] jiu jitsu or these other ones as well [12:53] any of the mixed martial arts because [12:54] they're trying to get them to a level [12:56] where if they are in a confrontation [12:58] with another human being they're going [12:59] to have the advantage right so we want [13:01] to get them that information as quickly [13:03] as possible get them drilling get them [13:04] working on it and also building their [13:06] confidence by giving them these belts [13:08] and these promotions [13:09] also putting them in a position to [13:11] instruct and teach other people so [13:14] the quality isn't as good but the [13:15] quantity is much larger does that make [13:17] sense and that plays a higher value in a [13:19] combat situation because it's it's it's [13:21] life it's life and death situation right [13:23] it's mainly sport but marine corps but [13:26] they keep training i mean you're gonna [13:28] train the whole time you're in but it's [13:29] also like an ego boost you get your your [13:31] black belt now you're wanting to train [13:32] more you want to show people absolutely [13:34] and you still i mean so i got it really [13:36] fast when i got my black belt and it's [13:37] because me and one of my good buddies [13:39] this guy's a giant i mean you take uh [13:42] take me and scale me up on a computer [13:45] and add a little bit more muscle that's [13:46] this guy so he was like 240 pounds about [13:49] five inches taller than me all muscle [13:51] super great dude and him and i we would [13:54] we seeked out this black belt instructor [13:56] trainer so an instructor trainer can be [13:57] instructors in the marine corps yeah and [14:00] uh we were on what's called a fap fleet [14:02] marine assistant program it's when [14:03] you're going to get out of the marine [14:04] corps if you had a combat mos or mos [14:06] that's very challenging then what they [14:08] do is they offer you a relaxed job as a [14:10] form of transitioning back into the [14:12] civilian world so i was a barracks [14:13] manager because i was originally going [14:14] to get out then i signed back up to be a [14:16] drill instructor he got out uh and he [14:18] was the uh i forget the term for it but [14:20] basically he did all the drug testing so [14:22] we had tons of free time on our hand so [14:24] we would find this guy he would show us [14:26] a new technique every day and then me [14:27] and my buddy would fight for the next [14:29] five hours and then the next day we [14:31] would find this guy and we were sick we [14:33] did that every single day and we [14:35] progressed pretty fast and then my unit [14:37] saw that i was really passionate about [14:38] it and they sent me to the instructor [14:40] course [14:41] so but [14:42] that's awesome at that level i was like [14:45] a really good white belt you know what i [14:47] mean [14:48] that in jiu jitsu yeah because that [14:50] directly spilled over into jiu jitsu [14:52] because you already have the competitive [14:54] aspect to it you already know what it [14:55] feels like to have somebody else's [14:57] weight on you their knee on you on your [14:59] stomach on your face on your ribs and [15:01] you're [15:02] actively searching for a positional [15:04] advantage so you already had that it's [15:06] not like you're waiting to see what [15:08] they're gonna do it's like i i kind of [15:09] have an idea of what he's going to try [15:11] to do so if he's on top of me i know i [15:14] need to get him off of me yeah right [15:15] keep the elbows tight keep the knees in [15:18] exactly right what are some things that [15:21] okay i want [15:22] legitimately there's a question i care [15:23] about yeah [15:25] don't want anything ask me anything the [15:26] audience is going to care i'm sure as [15:27] well those that care about jiu jitsu [15:29] martial arts but i really i want to get [15:30] better faster i mean i'm not going to [15:32] but i also learned from being in the [15:34] marine corps what we were talking about [15:36] earlier to be humble [15:38] right to not have that ego because when [15:40] i was training in the marine corps i've [15:42] popped both elbows both shoulders both [15:45] knees [15:46] and that was because i had that ego i [15:48] didn't want to tap was it from [15:50] okay so this was from a submission they [15:52] had and you want it and i didn't tap [15:54] yeah i it actually my shoulder popped so [15:56] bad from uh what's this one uh that's [15:58] the american americana yeah so my buddy [16:00] had me in the americana and he's like [16:02] that and i said you [16:03] right we're like yelling back and forth [16:05] in his pop it just popped super loud [16:07] don't tap yeah so [16:10] since like i mean for example when we [16:12] trained uh what was this friday i think [16:14] i didn't yeah because i didn't go [16:15] saturday i had to go to la yeah it was [16:17] friday friday i i only [16:19] tapped one person once and we were also [16:21] grappling at a very easy level because i [16:23] told everyone since my ribs were bruised [16:24] i said hey man 30 if you don't mind [16:27] so we're rolling but i was still tapped [16:29] that day maybe [16:31] 15 times really [16:32] dude yeah because i couldn't move the [16:34] right way because of my ribs so i'm [16:35] trying to get out of position you're [16:37] compensating and you're trying yeah but [16:39] anytime they get in a position if they [16:41] get me in for example the the basic arm [16:43] bar where you have the legs going over [16:44] right [16:45] once i feel my arm bending i'm pretty [16:48] much tapping i mean if it's a [16:49] competition you want to try to roll out [16:50] of it and do that hail mary fine correct [16:52] you know what i mean but that's one [16:54] thing that i love so much about [16:55] jiu-jitsu too is you can train every [16:57] single day there is wear and tear but if [16:59] you're humble it's not like sparring in [17:02] boxing you know what i mean we were [17:04] getting punched in the head constantly [17:06] broken nose broken yeah i mean if you're [17:08] humble in jiu jitsu and just understand [17:10] there's always someone better [17:12] absolutely you know yeah i mean [17:13] one day and you could you could have [17:15] that partner because this happened to me [17:17] where i started with a group of guys who [17:19] had never trained [17:20] and you kind of start to see like who's [17:22] gonna be who's at your level and who [17:24] you're progressing with and then the [17:26] coach will put you guys together and so [17:28] it's like this constant battle back and [17:30] forth to see and then all like i tapped [17:32] him out two two times today and then oh [17:34] he got me three tomorrow and the next [17:36] time nobody tapped out and then whatever [17:38] so it's just like this back and forth [17:40] and this guy that i know like we still [17:42] go back and forth hard and we've we've [17:44] both been training for the exact same [17:45] time frame and what are certain things [17:47] that was the question i was going to ask [17:48] my add kicked in and went in a different [17:49] direction [17:50] what are certain things [17:52] if you were to give somebody advice on [17:54] like if you want to accelerate faster [17:56] and let's take out the train every day [17:58] thing right because some people based on [17:59] their schedule [18:00] for example i go in every chance i get [18:02] correct right and i'm busy sometimes i [18:04] can't make it and i'm not going out to [18:07] the bars i'm literally working you know [18:08] all night that's why i can't get in [18:10] there and there's a lot of people that [18:11] are like that so based on how many days [18:13] you're able to train each day what are [18:15] certain things that you might be able to [18:17] think of to say hey if you want to get [18:19] better faster i recommend doing this [18:22] maybe at home so like for example [18:23] stretching right or something what are [18:25] certain things that [18:26] would give you a little bit more of an [18:28] edge so there's there's a few things you [18:29] can do uh just going back a little bit [18:32] to what you were telling me about the [18:33] ego thing and tapping [18:34] in training tap right and tap tap often [18:37] because you don't want to injure [18:38] yourself because if you injure yourself [18:40] well guess what you can't train and not [18:41] only can you not train but now you're [18:43] one less training partner for everybody [18:45] else that's that's their trying to train [18:47] so that one pro fighter who's trying to [18:49] get ready for camp and he needs a [18:50] sparring partner that's let's say your [18:52] frame and your size he needs you there [18:55] so i mean and i've known people that [18:57] have this ego too and they don't like [18:59] they don't want to tap and like i've [19:00] popped their ankles and popped their [19:01] elbows their knees and it's because like [19:03] i literally took it to the to the edge [19:05] and they're still not going and i just [19:06] go that extra two percent and then now [19:09] he's got a torn lco [19:12] so tap like screw it like if they if he [19:14] got you whatever next time you already [19:15] know [19:16] you know at what what at what level you [19:18] know or at what end of the spectrum you [19:21] can you can hold off on a choke is [19:22] different right they're going to put you [19:23] to sleep [19:24] but your joints yeah dude you got to [19:26] take care of that you've never been put [19:27] to sleep i haven't i have have you [19:29] really [19:30] i've been really close i was i was [19:32] rolling with my brother and uh so he [19:35] hasn't trained anything outside of the [19:36] marine corps so i would just teach them [19:37] different things that i was learning and [19:40] this one guy somehow i i don't know what [19:42] i was doing but i got my foot in front [19:44] of his face and he pushed into me and it [19:46] popped my knee right i wasn't flexible [19:48] enough at the time and then somehow my [19:50] brother got in that same position [19:52] and i didn't want to push into him [19:54] because i didn't want [19:55] to do like i didn't because he's not [19:56] flexible at all [19:58] so i didn't want him to get his knee [19:59] popped so when i moved back i don't know [20:02] what he had in but when i moved back it [20:03] cinched it super tight and i was out [20:05] like exactly it was that quick yeah [20:07] because i didn't feel it i was just like [20:09] out [20:09] and i woke up [20:11] and he's laughing at me he's like ah i [20:14] made you put you to sleep you know [20:16] and i'm sitting there and i couldn't [20:17] even tell what was going on no you [20:19] you're looking around like where the [20:20] hell yeah people they wake up and they [20:22] have no idea what happened it's it's [20:23] kind of funny it's confusing yeah it [20:25] throws you off but i mean i was choked [20:27] out in the marine corps just from you [20:29] know uh [20:30] working with the other marines and it's [20:31] like oh let's see what it's like to get [20:32] choked out and it's stupid stupid stuff [20:34] you know i mean you'll be fine i was [20:36] reading this article recently they're [20:37] looking into the long-term effects of of [20:40] choking out to see if it's like really [20:41] bad for the brain i don't remember like [20:43] what the conclusion was in the article [20:44] but it's already it's like they're [20:46] looking into it i'm sure if you're [20:47] getting choked out constantly yeah but [20:49] it depends on the length too because you [20:51] you could die like if you hold on long [20:54] enough obviously you're preventing you [20:55] know enough blood to the brain and that [20:57] that people usually let go once someone [20:58] goes to sleep though yeah and there's [21:00] been times talking about people not [21:01] tapping there's been times though where [21:03] i've put somebody in a technique and i [21:04] know i i knew i had them and they [21:07] weren't tapping i just let go yeah yeah [21:08] that's that's what i do it's like [21:10] whatever like i had this one even the [21:11] other day i had him in the arm bar and i [21:13] was back and he wasn't tapping and he [21:15] wasn't able to roll out of it so i just [21:17] clearly [21:18] your elbow cannot go anymore yeah [21:20] i can't wait to really learn the [21:23] the uh escapes from that arm bar though [21:25] because i i don't know i was talking to [21:27] somebody and and that's what i use when [21:28] i went to overtime at the competition i [21:31] i took the arm and you went [21:33] for [21:34] yeah spiderweb yeah cause i knew it i i [21:36] just knew if i just grab it and i just [21:37] pull with everything i have you were [21:39] gonna out power them and crank that arm [21:41] yeah yeah exactly uh but it even [21:44] happened to me when we were when we were [21:45] training we were getting ready one of [21:47] the blue belts female 2 female blue belt [21:51] i was legitimately trying as as hard as [21:53] i could to keep it locked in and she got [21:55] my arm back [21:56] and uh i remember she told me she said [21:58] oh i've been working on that for a long [22:00] time i'm like geez you almost ripped my [22:01] arm off like that was crazy um [22:05] but yeah so but i was talking to i think [22:07] it was it was josh i might have been [22:08] talking to and he said yeah white belts [22:10] just don't have that many options to get [22:12] out of that position [22:14] correct but how many other options are [22:16] there really i mean [22:17] i i think maybe flexibility plays a big [22:19] role if you can rotate your hips around [22:21] there's the [22:23] the first thing you want to do which is [22:25] what i learned is try to get to your [22:26] knees [22:27] right so in spider web if they're not [22:30] hooking that arm that near side leg just [22:32] try to switch your hips as much as you [22:34] can get on your knees [22:36] get and get on top of them and start [22:37] stacking them [22:39] right and you could start pushing your [22:40] arm into their chest and then at one [22:42] point you pull hard and you get it out [22:43] so if you can't get on your knees though [22:45] you're almost [22:46] i mean you just have to hold on and wait [22:48] for them to make their move and then [22:50] maybe you'll catch a little window [22:51] opportunity to where you can corkscrew [22:53] out [22:54] or you can just pull it out that [22:56] corkscrew seems so risky it's that one's [22:58] like [22:59] when the arm's [23:01] already almost full extension that's [23:03] when you that's when you try that or the [23:05] hitchhikers [23:06] that seems so risky and what i so what i [23:08] used to do was i would try to if i had [23:11] somebody's arm i would try to travel up [23:13] the arm because i felt like i had more [23:14] leverage absolutely yeah [23:16] it's it's levers but what i noticed [23:18] though when people were doing it to me [23:20] and i was trying to defend against that [23:21] position if they pulled directly into [23:23] the it was almost like a elbow pit it [23:25] was almost what's it called a bicep uh [23:27] like a bicep slicer yeah that's what it [23:29] felt like like it hurt your body for me [23:31] to keep my arm closed [23:33] and then my so that's like that's what i [23:35] did i just i figured if i pull as hard [23:36] as i can into their [23:38] the the bend of their arm the elbow pit [23:40] it's gonna hurt [23:41] i mean and some people are bonier than [23:43] others you have more lean tissue on you [23:45] so maybe that that that smashing of your [23:47] bicep is [23:48] gonna it's gonna definitely affect that [23:51] i always find it interesting in class [23:52] too when when you know like let's say [23:54] for example you've been practicing a [23:55] technique for a long time and it works [23:58] right against [23:59] most people some people it doesn't work [24:01] on and then you learn it's one little [24:03] thing that you're doing differently and [24:04] by making that little adjustment it's [24:06] like oh my gosh but like me even at my [24:08] level like every single time i take a [24:10] class for example with gabe tuttle from [24:12] 10th planet mission gorge [24:15] every single class that he teaches [24:16] there's like a tiny detail that he [24:18] sprinkles in and it's like a game [24:20] changer for me because i've been doing [24:21] it for a long time and it's those small [24:24] details like i said that curve right [24:26] once you're almost flatlined it's like [24:27] the tiniest adjustments that you're [24:29] really focusing against that makes sense [24:31] that's kind of how it is with uh dog [24:33] training for me i mean i feel like if [24:34] there was a belt level in dog training i [24:36] would consider myself a black belt and i [24:38] did this [24:39] online program [24:41] it's called forest mickey's healer [24:43] healers toolbox friend of mine and it's [24:46] all about focus heal the entire thing [24:47] and he gifted me the series it's just [24:49] heal focus heal so focus when they're [24:52] when they get to your side right focus [24:53] heal it's for competitive obedience the [24:55] dog is walking next to you in perfect [24:57] heal position and as they walk they [24:58] maintain contact on your eyes so they [25:00] look at you the entire time so some dogs [25:03] will even prance and they look at you so [25:04] it's an entire series on just developing [25:07] the focus heel and i went through it i [25:09] mean it's a lot of good information a [25:10] lot of it i already knew but the things [25:12] that i didn't know added so much value [25:16] it's like the little pieces like i i [25:17] would watch an hour and i would get [25:18] maybe [25:19] two minutes of something new but those [25:21] two minutes were so it's all you needed [25:23] yes it's like holy yes that's [25:25] amazing [25:27] how many aha moments have you had in [25:29] jiu-jitsu dude [25:32] every day i get them like i see some [25:33] somebody doing something different [25:35] uh you know even with like pj his game [25:38] is [25:38] very wrestling based so we're doing a [25:41] lot of stuff that i never really did [25:42] when i started i was talked to i would [25:44] literally pull i would jump into guard [25:47] you like jumping in the garden yeah [25:48] that's what i was used to doing because [25:50] 10 planet is you know heavy mission [25:52] control base so i would jump into guard [25:55] we would fall onto my back and then [25:56] immediately start working reber guard [25:58] but we never really focused on [26:00] singles and the russians and arm drags [26:02] and the double like takedowns it was [26:04] never really wrestling based and now [26:05] that i'm over here these guys are really [26:08] tough at wrestling so it's i have to [26:09] have to match it i have to [26:11] how does that wrestling impact your game [26:13] it's tremendous [26:15] um i mean how does it imple like so when [26:17] you start to go like if you're rolling [26:18] with uh pj for example [26:21] right uh how would his level of advanced [26:23] wrestling [26:24] impact your defense or even your offense [26:26] within the match because people say it [26:28] all the time i mean you know you listen [26:29] to i'm a huge fan of joe rogan and when [26:32] he talks about it he often talks about [26:34] the power that these wrestlers have and [26:36] how they're crazy how they're able to [26:38] dictate the position so he's like if you [26:42] can control what position you're in you [26:43] control the match absolutely and it's [26:45] it's always going to be positioned [26:46] before submission [26:48] so a lot of these dudes like i said when [26:50] i would start because there's different [26:52] types of game right i could play the [26:54] game where i'm just going to sit down [26:55] into garden i'm going to let you come at [26:57] me right which is i guess you could see [26:59] it as more of a defensive tactic versus [27:02] the wrestler is actively going for the [27:04] takedown and actively advancing and [27:06] attacking [27:08] so i haven't grappled against pj [27:10] unfortunately but some of the other [27:11] wrestlers you know they're relentless so [27:14] it's taught me like hell no like i like [27:16] instead of me pulling guard now like now [27:18] i'm gonna go on the attack what are they [27:19] doing that's making it hard are they [27:21] using a lot of their weight it's just [27:22] the pressure dude the constant pressure [27:24] it's just it's the pressure [27:26] so they're they're adding pressure [27:27] pressure as far as weight or attack is [27:29] like relentless attack non-stop like [27:32] they're not gonna sit back [27:34] and then just let you come at them like [27:36] if they're gonna push you and push you [27:37] and push you and push you so now i'm [27:39] getting into the habit of [27:41] it doesn't matter how exhausted i am [27:43] like once we reset i get back up fast [27:46] and then i immediately go on the attack [27:48] again like i don't give them a break to [27:50] like even try to think about breathing [27:52] or catching a break or or maybe i'm [27:54] going to push them a little bit and it's [27:55] happened to where i'm going against [27:56] these bigger dudes [27:58] who could definitely throw me across the [27:59] room if they just push back with the you [28:01] know harder than i'm pushing them but [28:03] they're fatigued they're tired and i'm [28:04] just moving faster and quicker and i'm [28:06] getting up on my feet and i'm just [28:08] attacking more and now i'm seeing myself [28:10] being in more of a [28:12] of a pressure passing game versus me [28:14] sitting down and letting them come at me [28:15] which is normally what i would resolve [28:17] to when i was exhausted or i was dead or [28:18] i was fatigued so you need a lot of [28:20] cardio cardio plays a big it's a it's an [28:22] endurance sport [28:24] uh you asked me earlier like what can [28:25] you start doing to to get better faster [28:28] there's a few things you can do one of [28:29] them is going to be mobility so you need [28:31] to open up your hips stretching yeah so [28:33] get against the wall get into that [28:35] butterfly stretch and push your knees [28:36] down into the ground yeah i was watching [28:38] that a video with eddie bravo founder of [28:41] 10th planet and uh he he's sitting there [28:44] he's talking about stretching he's [28:45] talking about flexibility and mobility [28:47] and he's sitting there and he says if [28:49] you're not able to push your knees down [28:50] to the ground you're not getting a black [28:52] belt for me second i heard that i was [28:53] like oh i gotta start playing dude it's [28:55] critical especially rubber guard you [28:56] have to have loose hips so push your [28:59] knees down [29:00] right exhale do like the yoga stuff [29:02] every time every time you exhale you [29:03] push a little bit further [29:05] and then after that you go into the [29:07] what's the glute stretch where you bring [29:09] your your leg over like across your [29:11] other knee and you just pull on your leg [29:13] and you'll stretch your glute out [29:15] and then go into the pigeon stretch so [29:17] hip mobility is huge [29:19] uh another one the endurance you're just [29:21] gonna develop it through long rounds [29:23] right you don't have to go crazy intense [29:25] just go at a steady pace and go ten [29:29] minute rounds certain workouts i mean [29:31] you're a certified personal trainer [29:32] right correct so are there certain types [29:34] of workouts that you could would [29:36] possibly think about or even put [29:38] together that might be specifically [29:40] designed for the endurance that's needed [29:42] for jiu jitsu so maybe i don't know [29:44] circuit training or super sets or would [29:47] it be something like uh [29:49] just running up hill what do you i mean [29:51] maybe i'm sure each person's [29:54] there's different aspects you have you [29:56] have for example strength and then you [29:57] have endurance you have your [29:59] cardiovascular system so you you need to [30:01] train those you know independently but [30:03] you have to need to progress at the same [30:05] time so [30:06] somebody who's never lifted before right [30:08] this happens to a lot of guys that get [30:09] into jiu jitsu they've never lifted [30:11] they've been in a couple sports but [30:13] they're not very familiar with the squad [30:14] in the deadlift [30:16] or the front squat so go on youtube look [30:18] at a few videos on how to do a proper [30:20] squat get a buddy go to the local gym [30:23] and just start squatting and dead [30:25] lifting [30:26] right get get that get that get those [30:29] reps in that's just going to [30:31] increase your strength dramatically just [30:33] with those two lifts [30:34] right don't get the whole body workout [30:36] yeah [30:38] yeah absolutely uh [30:40] the dose response you get from these [30:42] from those two exercises is incredible [30:44] you're going to develop a lot of lean [30:45] tissue do you like uh dumbbell deadlifts [30:48] or do you prefer absolutely absolutely [30:50] and it's just a variation of the [30:51] deadlift uh some people can do a [30:54] straight bar deadlift right if you can't [30:57] stand [30:58] and touch your toes without bending your [30:59] knees you shouldn't be really focusing [31:01] on heavy deadlifts you should be working [31:03] on mobility and stretching when you're [31:04] doing deadlifts do you prefer both [31:06] double down [31:08] one forward one back double double front [31:09] double front it's much harder that way [31:11] right it is harder and it emphasizes [31:13] grip strength and another thing in jiu [31:15] jitsu is grip strength especially key [31:18] absolutely if you're doing ghee no [31:19] absolutely but even in you know in [31:21] regular you know right like wrist [31:23] control you have to be able to grab on [31:24] tight uh anything that's a pulling [31:26] movement pull-ups like anybody that's [31:28] introduced should be doing pull-ups and [31:30] a lot of them mm-hmm [31:32] yeah everything in jiu-jitsu is pulling [31:34] and wrestling i'm pulling you towards me [31:37] or i'm pulling me towards you right [31:39] benching sure but again like how is what [31:42] you're doing functional to what you're [31:43] doing either in sport or fitness yeah it [31:45] isn't benching one of those things [31:47] that's a common mistake for white belts [31:49] as far as trying to push somebody off of [31:51] them and then what they're doing is [31:53] they're exposing their arms to all those [31:55] different arm bars and locks and [31:56] whatever else that's available there's a [31:57] few there's a few movements that that [31:59] warrant that movement [32:01] such as [32:02] you're in lockdown and you're going to [32:03] whoop up to go to the side and go for [32:05] maybe an old school sweep [32:07] that's important you're pressing you're [32:08] pressing musculature has to be good [32:10] right but just in general you should be [32:12] able to do uh three push-ups at tempo so [32:15] with a three second negative [32:17] right if you can't do that you need to [32:19] work on your pushing on on pushing [32:20] movements you need to have a baseline as [32:22] an athlete [32:24] right and that's just gonna help you [32:26] maximally express different areas so [32:30] any anybody that's an athlete should be [32:32] able to squat their weight right they [32:34] should be able to deadlift their body [32:36] weight and you should be able to do [32:37] three pull-ups with a three second [32:39] negative and three push-ups with a [32:40] three-second negative so that shows that [32:42] you you have good postural control and [32:44] you can control your body weight against [32:46] resistance [32:47] right that's just general right and then [32:49] you have a prerequisite uh [32:52] what is it called ranges of motion [32:55] so you like i said you should be able to [32:56] touch your toes [32:58] right if you're laying down you should [32:59] be able to lift one leg straight past [33:02] the other leg's knee [33:03] what is that new class that they're [33:04] doing that 10 planet on saturday morning [33:06] at 10 am it's like functional range [33:07] conditioning that way no joke so you've [33:10] taken it i haven't taken them before [33:11] anything [33:12] is it really yeah what was hard about it [33:14] i consider myself pretty fit pretty [33:16] decently fit no this is different and no [33:19] yeah it was an ass kicker every little [33:20] thing well it's just the hole in the [33:22] positions and so for example one of the [33:24] exercises that stand out in my mind is [33:26] you kind of [33:27] do the splits almost as far as you can [33:28] right you open up a little bit and then [33:30] you lift one of the legs and hold it [33:32] nice and it sounds simple but the fact [33:34] that you're trying to stretch and hold [33:35] that position so it's developing the [33:37] strength and the stretching i think at [33:39] the same time you know it's considered [33:41] it's like i what i think what i'm [33:43] thinking is it's active stretching oh [33:45] it's killer you you have static [33:46] stretching where you like hold like the [33:48] hurdler stretch and you're pulling your [33:50] your toes like you're reaching for your [33:51] toes and you're pulling as like i don't [33:52] know 30 seconds it was harder than yoga [33:55] really because yoga is harder than what [33:56] people think and i've done some in [33:58] intense yoga classes and this thing was [34:00] so hard like there were certain [34:01] exercises i couldn't wait for it to be [34:02] over because i was in so much pain [34:04] trying to hold it or trying to go [34:05] through the rest [34:07] you know and that makes me think about [34:08] something too something i've noticed [34:11] a huge difference from white belts in [34:13] comparison to the higher belt even blue [34:15] belt [34:16] is the ability for the higher belt guys [34:19] to be able to use their legs as well as [34:21] their arms it's an extra limb it's so [34:24] hard though i mean how how long did it [34:26] take you to get to the point because i'm [34:27] still working on it trying to be able to [34:29] use my legs just i mean using them at [34:32] the same time because what happens with [34:33] me is i'll be so focused on let's say [34:35] trying to get a a triangle choke with my [34:38] arms what is that body triangle yeah [34:40] right or whatever or an arm triangle i'm [34:41] trying to yeah so i'll be trying to get [34:42] an arm triangle and then that i i lose [34:45] focus on my legs [34:46] i'm just i'm so focused on my upper body [34:49] but then i see some of these higher belt [34:51] guys while they're working their arms [34:53] their legs are like pummeling their yeah [34:56] yeah belly yeah they don't stop it's [34:58] like the legs have a mind of their own [35:00] it's it's because the body's a complete [35:02] unit you need to work the top at the [35:04] same as the bottom and your legs are the [35:06] strongest part you know you could [35:08] squeeze somebody i can have somebody in [35:09] guard and i could just squeeze really [35:11] tight and like you will tap some like [35:13] people out with that that's i think [35:15] that's what happened with my ribs [35:16] someone put me in a body triangle with [35:17] their legs [35:18] and locked in [35:20] yeah yeah no that sucks it could have [35:21] been an impact too falling but i know [35:23] one time somebody got me in that man [35:25] that hurt the body lock hurts the body [35:27] it's called [35:28] yeah when they had got like a figure [35:30] four around your waist the triangle lock [35:32] or whatever yeah yeah no it's gnarly [35:34] dude it's just close your legs and see [35:36] the space you have in there and now [35:38] imagine somebody's waist around that and [35:40] everything's smashing in there yeah and [35:42] then when you bring your leg down it [35:43] kind of closes that [35:45] space when you hide it behind your leg i [35:47] can't i can't do it on everybody it's [35:49] got to be a smaller guy yeah i was [35:50] trying to watch because i've been really [35:51] trying i i used to get the triangle [35:53] choke on on so many people in the marine [35:55] corps but i haven't been able to get the [35:56] triangle choke on like anybody at 10th [35:58] planet but one of the things that i [36:00] would do is i wouldn't i never locked in [36:02] so i never did that that lock right i [36:05] would just hook my triangle like the [36:07] triangle from guard [36:08] right okay i would just lock my ankles [36:11] okay i squeezed with everything that i [36:12] had yeah that one that that's just [36:14] setting you up for the triangle right so [36:17] like i learned it as wrestling scissors [36:18] so you're just like you know you're just [36:20] locking your ankles and you're just [36:21] using that as a you know as a positional [36:24] uh [36:25] just in a position to start setting up [36:27] the triangle and then after that you can [36:29] either pull your shin down to break [36:31] their posture pull their head down but [36:32] you need to get their arm across their [36:34] chest or across their face and it's hard [36:37] to fit even somebody who's bulkier right [36:39] it's harder to get somebody who's [36:40] bulkier in that triangle [36:44] so yeah i was watching a bunch of videos [36:46] on it because i'm really trying to [36:47] figure it out and i noticed this one guy [36:49] was trying to explain because he has i [36:50] don't [36:51] forget his name but uh he's a black belt [36:53] and he has shorter legs he's a shorter [36:55] guy and he was able to put triangles on [36:57] bigger guys and he would turn his body [37:00] almost entirely at a nice like [37:03] perpendicular perpendicular to their yes [37:06] absolutely getting hit that over but [37:08] then another thing that he did was [37:09] instead of going around the top of the [37:11] shoulder he would lock it in right here [37:14] so more on the the tricep area and he [37:17] would take the shoulder out but that [37:18] would still keep it in tight enough and [37:20] he'd prevent the elbow from coming out [37:22] and he was i could be explaining this [37:24] but that he's like by doing that [37:27] all this extra [37:29] muscle is no longer in your lock and [37:31] you're able to get much tighter by [37:33] squeezing in here so he would turn his [37:34] entire body around and then the way that [37:36] he moved so i i tried it but [37:39] my mechanics just aren't good enough and [37:41] people slip out before i even lock in i [37:43] mean because that kind of sounds like a [37:44] set up for an arm bar right because with [37:46] the arm bar you throw your leg over the [37:48] shoulder so you're isolating the [37:49] shoulder because you don't want them to [37:50] get out and then eventually you hook the [37:52] leg right [37:54] uh deep hook that arm and then you swing [37:56] your other leg around and then you [37:57] finish the arm bar from there yeah but [37:59] you we we'll practice it like we'll get [38:01] those details down one thing that was uh [38:02] an aha moment for me something i've [38:05] always gotten onto people but i never it [38:06] was a technique we learned maybe uh or i [38:08] learned about maybe three weeks ago [38:10] something like that where you grab the [38:12] person's wrist so if i was behind the [38:15] person or on the side and i grabbed [38:18] their wrists like and i'm right i'm like [38:19] turtling or am i in side control or what [38:21] like side control you know i'm still [38:23] working on all the terminology but i [38:24] grab the wrist and i pull it in and kind [38:26] of choke them with their own wrist [38:28] but then just simply bringing your arm [38:30] over their head and then transition into [38:32] the arm bar [38:33] do you know what i'm talking about so if [38:35] the head's right here and i have their [38:36] arm and i have it locked in like this so [38:38] i'm like this yeah and i bring it over [38:41] the head swing my leg around oh yeah [38:43] absolutely i never knew about that [38:45] absolutely when i learned that i was [38:46] like oh my gosh how many armbar [38:48] opportunities yes have i missed just by [38:51] not knowing that one little detail oh [38:53] yeah it's i i think you know where [38:55] you're talking about where you could [38:56] grab i'm i'm really bad at exploring [38:58] yeah don't worry [38:59] uh the way that i'm used to think of it [39:01] i mean i'm in mount right so i'm on top [39:03] of you and then i let's say let's say [39:05] i'm able to bring your arm all the way [39:07] across your face like that and then i [39:09] reach behind your head and then i grab [39:11] your wrist right so so you're going to [39:13] end up like this right with my arm [39:15] around you because from there what i [39:17] would do is i'd go for a figure four and [39:19] then i'd do a ch what is it called uh [39:22] i pretty much just like [39:24] base up on my leg and then i fall to my [39:26] side and now i get your back [39:28] right have they used that to get your [39:29] back before yeah okay so i know i know [39:31] the position that you're talking about [39:33] what's the uh what's your go-to move for [39:35] somebody your size and what's your go-to [39:38] move if you're grappling someone bigger [39:40] like joey [39:42] do you have certain like goats yeah i [39:44] have my game right so as you as you [39:46] progress right so like the white ball is [39:48] all survival the blue belt starts to [39:51] defend now right now now they're not [39:53] surviving now they're defending and [39:56] they're they're able to start playing [39:57] around with different positions and then [39:59] i don't know the purple belt now has [40:01] like okay these are like the tools that [40:02] i have available my body does really [40:05] good with this this this and that and [40:07] then you start to tailor your game to [40:09] your to your mechanical advantages [40:11] and then the brown belt just literally [40:12] is just using those tools and imposing [40:14] his will on [40:16] on everybody else and then black belt is [40:17] just obviously mastery but [40:20] um i definitely have my game right [40:22] everybody else as you'll see everybody [40:24] has different games but for me is like [40:27] i've i've worked a lot of my butterfly [40:28] sweep [40:29] so i'll go a lot into butterfly sweep uh [40:32] i'll pass a guard i'll get into all i'll [40:34] try to look for the far side arm bar [40:36] so if i'm in side control i want your [40:38] arm right on the farthest side because i [40:41] could either go into a kimora from there [40:42] which is my plan a always kimura so i [40:45] throw my leg over your head you like to [40:47] come on inverted trying like i'll get an [40:49] inverted triangle and then i'll go for [40:50] the kimura while i have you in an [40:52] inverted triangle and if that's not [40:54] working then i'll swing my hips all the [40:55] way around for arm bar [40:57] or i like to play twister side control a [41:00] lot and i like to isolate one of the [41:02] legs and then i'll throw the other leg [41:03] over and then i'll scoop the head and go [41:05] for a mounted triangle that's cool but [41:08] that that's that's what i've practiced [41:09] forever you know that's those are some [41:11] of the cool things that i learned that i [41:13] did well right my body's i'm not too [41:15] short and i'm not too tall [41:17] so i could i could play with a little [41:18] bit of everything fortunately [41:20] um i do pretty good with triangles i [41:22] just need some you know i've been doing [41:24] a lot of lifting so my legs have got a [41:25] little bit bigger so i need to work [41:27] better with my angles [41:28] but it doesn't matter if you're smaller [41:30] or bigger than me that's probably what [41:32] i'm going to go for oh yeah and what do [41:34] you think are the [41:36] most common mistakes though that [41:38] somebody who is just getting into jiu [41:39] jitsu so our white belt [41:41] what have you seen are some of the most [41:43] common white belt mistakes and some of [41:45] the best ways new guys can combat those [41:48] mistakes or to just be aware of them for [41:50] i one that comes to my mind because i've [41:53] done it hundreds of times and i've been [41:54] choked out because of this mistake [41:56] trying to pass somebody's guard and [41:58] putting one arm in and one arm out [42:00] also they get you to train yeah yeah and [42:03] that's happened to me a lot because i'll [42:04] try to push down and they'll kick that [42:06] leg up faster than i'm able to adjust or [42:10] block [42:11] right and then i'm placed into a [42:12] triangle so well what i can tell you [42:14] because i i if you're in guard you need [42:16] to open the guard right and a lot of the [42:18] times you have to bait you have to make [42:21] it seem like [42:22] you're doing this on purpose [42:24] right so that they go for that move and [42:26] you just it's just your clock against [42:27] there so you just have to beat him to [42:29] the move and that's what jiu jitsu is a [42:31] lot of the time is here just i'm just be [42:32] i'm just one step ahead ahead of you so [42:35] i'm going to bait here the same if [42:36] somebody's mounted and i can't get them [42:39] off me and i'm and i'm bridging hard and [42:41] i'm trying to switch and maybe catch a [42:43] and escape from alcatraz if i'm trying [42:45] to hook one of your legs and get out and [42:46] i can't i'm just going to start [42:48] releasing my arms a little bit right [42:50] start giving you the idea that you're [42:53] going to go for an arm bar and as soon [42:54] as you go for it i mean i get on my [42:56] knees the next stack what i was telling [42:57] you earlier [42:58] setting up a trap in a sense it's just [43:00] it's just a bait i'm just baiting you [43:02] what are other white belt mistakes um [43:07] i think we both have a tendency to go [43:09] into one thing and then that just leads [43:11] us into something else it's because the [43:12] mistakes are are we are gonna advance [43:14] your game you know i can't really tell [43:16] anybody like try not to make mistakes no [43:18] like try to make as many mistakes as [43:20] possible [43:21] this is actually a good one a lot of [43:23] wipeouts don't want to go for anything [43:25] right let's say they get a positional [43:26] advantage let's say they're a mount and [43:28] then they're like i don't know what to [43:29] do from here just go for something [43:32] just move play with your body go to [43:34] north south go to side control go to [43:35] neon belly go to three quarter guard go [43:37] to quarter guard go to half guard [43:40] right [43:41] go for things a lot of guys they get [43:42] stuck there and and they don't want to [43:44] move they don't want to try anything [43:45] because they're afraid that they're [43:46] going to lose the position [43:47] lose the position who cares [43:50] go for as many things make as many [43:51] mistakes as possible yeah during [43:53] training if you get submitted oh well [43:54] you just back into it and then when you [43:56] compete all you're doing is you're just [43:58] you're just doing what you're doing [43:59] training and competition you don't go [44:00] for anything that you've never tried [44:03] right like a perfect example is like you [44:04] remember in the i think it was the super [44:06] bowl with the patriots when odell [44:08] beckham made that crazy one-handed catch [44:11] do you remember that one it was like the [44:12] poster catcher like the year right it [44:14] was like it was like a hail it was like [44:16] a crazy long pass and he jumped and [44:18] caught it with like one hand while the [44:20] the defensive guys like all over him and [44:22] it was like the craziest catch ever and [44:24] everybody's like dude like how do you do [44:25] that and you see that you're like dude [44:27] that was like the craziest thing but [44:29] they showed a replay of him before the [44:31] game and he was practicing that same [44:33] catch so he didn't do anything that he [44:35] had never tried he had already been [44:37] practicing that same catch so not being [44:39] afraid to try different things even if [44:42] it's going to put you in a position [44:43] absolutely just try it just move just [44:46] feel your body out and exactly and [44:48] really get comfortable with being in [44:50] different positions and even being put [44:52] in i think that's a good point too is [44:55] being comfortable being in positions [44:57] where you could get submitted you need [44:58] to be uncle you need to be especially [45:00] just when you get comfortable being [45:01] uncomfortable yeah because guys are [45:03] gonna do certain things and it's gonna [45:04] make you really uncomfortable and you [45:06] have to be able to keep it together [45:07] because the more that you start like and [45:09] you could tell like i'll get a guy in [45:10] side control and it's really tight and [45:12] i'm just trying to frustrate him and i'm [45:14] doing that on purpose like i'm just [45:15] literally holding the position and he's [45:17] going crazy swinging all over the place [45:19] and i'm just holding it as long as i can [45:21] until he calms down and i could hear his [45:23] frustration sometimes a little like [45:25] grunting like ah and you could tell that [45:27] they're just frustrated trying to get [45:28] out i'm just gonna hold i'm just gonna [45:30] lock down tighter because you're losing [45:32] it up here and in that in those moments [45:34] of just craziness that's where i make my [45:36] move and then eventually now before you [45:38] know you're in a triangle or you're in a [45:39] guillotine well that's something that a [45:41] higher build person is able to do as far [45:43] as knowing a position and knowing when [45:45] to use strength and when not to use [45:47] strength correct right because i've [45:49] noticed that with some of the uh the [45:51] guys that are just starting out like i [45:52] mean i am a white belt right but it's [45:55] i'm not a brand new white belt you know [45:57] what i mean because i have the [45:58] background in the marine corps i trained [45:59] it hey diago's which is a real really [46:01] great school up in l.
document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 242/468,a so i have some [46:03] foundation and i have a little bit [46:05] better of an idea of when to use my [46:06] strength than when not to but i still [46:08] end up using more strength than what i [46:11] probably want to and i've noticed that [46:13] with with higher belt guys gear nogi you [46:16] know it's like there's this one guy who [46:18] who um was one of the instructors at hey [46:21] diago and he would always come down and [46:23] he would roll with all the students and [46:24] work with the students feel them out [46:26] help them with their sweeps and their [46:27] maneuvers and you know just like the guy [46:29] is a tent player i mean really really [46:30] great dude [46:32] and i noticed with him he always had [46:34] it's everyone basically would say that [46:36] this guy had like superman grip but i [46:38] would watch him and he would read the [46:40] person that he's grappling with and of [46:42] course he's going to know his own [46:43] movements so if you watched his hands it [46:45] would only grip when it needed to [46:47] but he would he would hold the key the [46:49] whole time but it would be a loose grip [46:52] and he would know exactly when he needs [46:53] to apply pressure and when to play [46:55] tension yeah but it seemed like when you [46:56] were grappling up against him he was [46:58] always always holding it as strong as [46:59] possible yeah that's what he felt it was [47:01] such a a mind almost because you're [47:03] trying to get on positions and you just [47:05] and every time you move [47:06] all your movement almost made it tighter [47:09] you know what i mean like that's what [47:11] it'd feel like going up against this guy [47:13] but and he was he was a black belt so he [47:14] wouldn't be [47:16] you know he would he would teach yeah he [47:17] would teach i mean he was he was great [47:19] uh but yeah noticing or knowing when to [47:22] use the energy and when not to [47:24] absolutely and i've been trying every [47:25] time that we we train i always try to [47:28] stay in there especially when it's the [47:29] open mat or when it's time to roll or [47:31] whatever to always always roll no matter [47:33] how tired you are no dude another thing [47:35] that i could tell the white people not [47:37] to do do not sit out [47:40] right i see that a lot and i see that [47:41] everywhere there's people like they're [47:43] tired and they're just going to sit and [47:44] just go and watch dude don't watch [47:46] like go home and watch youtube if you [47:48] want to watch right before you go [47:50] to bed that's when you're watching all [47:51] those videos of marcelo that's when you [47:53] watch when you're in class that's when [47:55] you want to roll that's when you want to [47:56] get the reps in because when you're in [47:58] bed guess what you can't just get up and [47:59] start grappling with somebody but take [48:01] advantage if you have an hour use that [48:03] hour and grapple with as many people as [48:05] possible if you're injured well dude [48:07] let's practice this hey i've been [48:09] wanting to practice this like you with [48:10] your ribs hey dude you know the same [48:12] thing with me for seven weeks right i [48:14] was out for a while hey like let's go 30 [48:17] or hey you know what like let's let's go [48:19] at it but just just fyi [48:21] the this side of my wrist is kind of [48:22] messed up just don't go for like a neon [48:24] belly or a body lock and everybody's and [48:26] people will be cool with that yeah i i [48:28] like doing those rounds too where we are [48:30] grappling at a higher uh level of [48:33] intensity but even the ones where it's [48:35] the low intensity i was doing one of [48:36] ronnie's classes and he had to start out [48:39] and he said ten percent just move around [48:40] get that feeling about jiu-jitsu yeah [48:42] yeah and that was such that was such a [48:44] cool experience of just moving at that [48:47] level so we weren't worried about [48:49] a tendency that i have an issue with [48:51] which you you may do it as well because [48:53] you're more of a built guy you have some [48:54] more muscle than a lot of other people [48:56] that do some of the guys are skinnier [48:57] right they just focus on jiu jitsu and [48:59] they don't do any any uh bodybuilding [49:01] type workouts and i used to want to be a [49:03] bodybuilder so i really put a lot into [49:04] trying to get built up [49:06] um [49:07] not as big as i once was right but [49:09] i have to i have to mentally focus on [49:12] not using strength the strength all the [49:15] time right because i don't want to fall [49:17] i mean if i need to fall back on that if [49:19] it's a competition great right but [49:21] trying to focus on okay i want to do the [49:23] technique and i don't want to rely just [49:25] on muscle correct right i want to learn [49:27] how to use my body weight i want to [49:28] learn how to take advantage of that to [49:30] where i'm limiting the amount of energy [49:32] that i'm using but i'm still being [49:34] effective in the movement [49:36] and that's what i really liked about [49:37] doing it because he said ten percent so [49:38] when we were doing the 10 i was able to [49:40] move from one position he got to a [49:41] position right you're just [49:45] it was such a cool little experience and [49:47] so there's a lot of value in both it's [49:49] funny i was listening i was watching a [49:50] bunch of jiu jitsu videos last night and [49:53] i came across one with joe rogan talking [49:55] about getting better and he says a lot [49:57] of people think that if you want to get [49:59] better you always want to go up against [50:00] the biggest dude and he said that's not [50:02] always necessarily the case now he's a [50:04] higher belt he says what you want to do [50:06] is you want to choke out the blue belt [50:08] now i'm a white belt so the blue belt's [50:09] choking me out but what you're saying is [50:11] true you get good at practicing your [50:13] technique almost on [50:15] people who are not as skilled and he [50:16] says it sounds like bullying in a sense [50:18] it's not no i see where it's coming from [50:19] and it's it's true because like who else [50:22] is like if i just roll against brown [50:24] belts and purple belts they're really [50:26] good and there's something new that i [50:27] want to learn [50:29] it's not going to work on them because [50:30] they already know what what i'm going [50:32] for like they're already experienced [50:33] enough but a wipeout and a blue belt no [50:35] but it's cool because they're giving you [50:37] resistance but at the same time you [50:39] could still practice the technique and [50:40] and get really good at it yeah i i agree [50:42] with that that's why i love [50:44] rolling with the higher belts too when a [50:46] higher belt is like nick come on let's [50:48] roll i love that though because they are [50:50] so good and they always give you [50:52] opportunities as a new belt to try [50:54] things correct [50:56] like they they intentionally put their [50:58] arm out they're like are you going to [50:58] take my house here's an opportunity [51:01] right or they'll turn presenting their [51:03] back correct and i love that because [51:05] it's like i can do this but then they [51:06] can defend against it nicely so it [51:08] increases my ability to recognize [51:10] positions and poor movements that a [51:12] lower belt player might do while i'm [51:14] learning and while i'm growing and [51:15] progressing but then also once i'm [51:17] trying to put the position on them their [51:19] defense kicks up a little bit higher [51:21] because they're not just gonna give it [51:22] yeah like i'm practicing my defense too [51:24] like i'm gonna let you get side control [51:25] or the weak positions because i need to [51:27] practice my defense from the back like [51:28] just in case they ever get my back [51:30] martial arts dojo jiu jitsu etiquettes [51:34] right so for example certain etiquettes [51:36] in the gym drives me crazy probably [51:38] drives you crazy right for example i [51:40] hate when somebody grabs 50 dumbbells [51:42] and puts it around their one bench as if [51:43] they own the gym [51:45] i hate when people lean up on the [51:47] dumbbell rack to do their bend over rows [51:49] when somebody puts all their junk on a [51:51] bench and claiming that they that it's [51:52] like oh it's my bench it's like dude [51:53] you're not doing you're not working on [51:55] it right now we can rotate less share [51:57] there's certain things that just drive [51:59] me crazy when it comes to etiquette [52:00] because people are just so and i work at [52:02] a gym so i know yeah or they don't wipe [52:04] down the material right like leaving the [52:06] hundred pound dumbbells in the middle of [52:07] the hallway is the least of like the [52:10] shitty that people do there's [52:11] there's still it's bad [52:13] so many things well that one thing [52:16] there's there's got to be certain [52:17] etiquettes at [52:19] there is like one of course is [52:21] um [52:22] respecting all the teammates right [52:24] another one is making sure your feet are [52:25] clean before coming into the dojo [52:27] another one is making sure you're not [52:28] stinky and disgusting you know like [52:30] every time i go if i'm working here all [52:32] day and i'm working with dogs and [52:34] my dog trying to invest i gotta clean i [52:36] haven't cleaned it in like a week you [52:38] know because i just put it on the train [52:39] and i have my the food in the pouches [52:41] but that thing starts to stink you know [52:43] what i mean so [52:44] if i every time i go to class i wash [52:47] before i go because i just don't want to [52:49] be that stinky dude don't use soap don't [52:50] use soap [52:52] just rinse with water [52:54] you have a layer over your skin like a [52:56] protective film and when you use soapy [52:58] you wash that off and then you're [52:59] getting into the mats with bacteria [53:01] so so after [53:03] grappling that's when you use soap okay [53:06] defense soap yeah exactly [53:08] so just rinse okay so for me these are [53:11] the things i know let me know if there's [53:13] certain things that maybe i'm missing is [53:15] you know of course keeping yourself [53:16] clean correct right making sure hygiene [53:19] nails nails is probably one of the [53:20] biggest ones for dudes keeping the nails [53:22] short toenails as well yes yeah a lot of [53:26] places expect you to bow before entering [53:28] the dojo matt you know that respect [53:30] there um [53:32] we're having sandals so you're not [53:34] walking around barefoot everywhere yeah [53:36] that's disgusting [53:37] and now at temp planet they also do muay [53:39] thai and they do boxing now i know more [53:41] about the jiu jitsu even though i'm [53:43] still a white belt than i do of the muay [53:45] thai and the boxing are there certain [53:46] things that [53:48] could be you know certain etiquettes [53:49] that might come into play in those two [53:51] fields or departments um i'm trying to [53:53] think of like other things that like [53:54] unwritten rules right that applied [53:56] exactly yeah um so a new guy you know [53:59] like i'm a new guy i want to go train a [54:01] tent planet jiu jitsu never been there [54:03] before [54:04] what do i need to go and expecting [54:05] because when somebody goes to a place [54:07] like that for the first time they're [54:08] nervous i mean super intimidating my [54:10] niece when she went i was like you're [54:12] rolling today you know you're going to [54:13] get in there and she almost had a panic [54:14] attack you know her anxiety was through [54:16] the roof she's like oh my gosh i gotta [54:18] i'm like relax everybody's nice no one's [54:20] gonna just [54:21] start kicking your ass let you it's an [54:23] mma gym and people have these ideas of [54:25] of what to expect like a cage and oh my [54:29] god like these guys without shirts and [54:30] sweaty with like crazy ears and blood [54:33] and just testosterone pouring [54:36] monsters it's like not the case at all [54:38] it's so funny [54:40] um yeah everyone that's a funny thing [54:42] too is everybody's so so friendly [54:45] andy for example even um [54:47] uh smalls right [54:49] tiger smalls the the older gentleman [54:51] right the guy who's like he worked with [54:53] muhammad ali and everything him and andy [54:56] both like they're they both won it at [54:58] such high levels they've done amazing [55:00] things in their careers uh what is it 13 [55:02] in bellator that he's won andy he's he's [55:05] two and two and so he's he's a four-time [55:07] bellator veteran so he's i believe he's [55:09] two and two i mean it's it's it's [55:10] incredible but to make it to bellators [55:13] yeah and both of them when i was trying [55:15] to figure out my wraps i'm like i don't [55:16] know how to do it and they both they're [55:17] like they wrapped it for me i'm like i'm [55:19] getting my hands [55:20] when i started there i didn't i mean i [55:21] did muay thai like very little of theory [55:24] muay thai in 2013 but i i rarely get to [55:27] use wraps so now that i'm here like [55:30] we're giving intros to all these kinds [55:31] of people into boxing muay thai and i'm [55:33] expected to wrap them up and like i had [55:35] never wrapped hands so like i had to [55:37] learn how to do it right and chris bruno [55:39] he's like a certified cut man like he's [55:41] gone to like the cutting course like he [55:44] will wrap your hand so fast and so [55:46] freaking good what's what's that cut man [55:48] certified so like when like whenever [55:50] there's a sanctioned fight and you go [55:51] like there's a certain way that you have [55:53] to wrap the hands or there's like [55:54] certain things you can do and there's [55:56] somebody from the commission i believe [55:58] it's somebody from the commission [55:59] looking at the way you're wrapping the [56:00] hands and then they have to initial and [56:02] sign it off no kidding yeah and then [56:04] they put the gloves on and then they [56:05] wrap the gloves and then it's got to be [56:07] wrapped right to make sure that nothing [56:09] funny is happening with the gloves [56:12] so but he's he's he's certified to do [56:14] that like he like if you i've seen him [56:16] rap and it's it's freaking beautiful [56:18] have you have you done any uh mma fights [56:21] i mean i've looked up all of uh pj's [56:24] stuff pj bart's old school stuff i can't [56:26] i didn't know that when i first started [56:28] looking him up i knew he did jiu jitsu [56:29] but i was so blown away when i saw him [56:31] fighting in the cage and yeah that dude [56:32] has like won every single match [56:35] every match i was like holy the [56:37] only one i saw him lose was the one when [56:40] it was i don't know what it's called but [56:41] it was the five against five the quinn [56:43] right quintet or quentin he beat the [56:46] first guy who was who hadn't been [56:48] submitted for what 10 years or something [56:49] like that yeah and then he went on to go [56:52] against the next guy immediately after [56:55] yeah it's like and then he was beat so [56:57] he's going up against somebody who's [56:58] fresh [56:59] it's because it's cool because you set [57:00] the order of the teammates okay who's [57:02] fight who fights first second third [57:04] fourth and like who's anchor they picked [57:05] the order and yeah and so it it's like [57:08] five on five and they they strategize [57:10] like who like who are they gonna pick [57:11] and then whoever you get is whoever you [57:13] get and it could be a tiny dude like [57:15] that video of geo going against that big [57:17] black dude and like it could be whoever [57:19] and so and it happened like you know [57:22] how did he get the nickname uh butter [57:24] panther so i asked this recently like [57:27] why is it butter panther so [57:29] you know he was a high school wrestler [57:30] he was a division 1 wrestler and [57:33] from from what i hear because i i like i [57:35] said i haven't grappled against which [57:36] eats me right because it was like one of [57:38] the coolest things that i started [57:39] working here like i have access to pj [57:41] now um but he's recovering like he's [57:44] gonna be back really soon [57:46] uh so a panther ride like panthers are [57:48] like smooth right like they're they're [57:50] supple right like the book like the [57:52] supple leopard they move really well [57:54] they like move with like grace and [57:55] they're just like there's a confidence [57:57] in everything they do and then butter [58:00] because it's just smooth so the butter [58:02] panther because it's like like he [58:04] overpowers you but he does it in a very [58:06] smooth and like progressive way like you [58:09] can't see that he's like [58:11] ah like trying to muscle everything out [58:13] it's just like a progressive pressure [58:14] pressure just breaking just smashing [58:17] through you but yeah [58:19] i don't [58:21] i don't think so no says that thing [58:23] about nicknames somebody has to give the [58:25] nickname to you [58:26] that's absolutely right you're not [58:27] supposed to how did you know how uh [58:29] what's it boogeyman is that his nickname [58:31] yeah how did he get that nickname [58:34] i should know this i don't know why they [58:36] call him the boogeyman maybe because he [58:38] looks like the freaking boogeyman and [58:39] he'll like [58:40] tear your neck out right with this [58:42] darces i have i don't know [58:44] but but him and his brother are the [58:46] freak bros [58:47] um i know that geo's known free froze [58:49] yeah i mean like uh you know how they [58:52] use the circus as the logo yeah it's [58:54] because it's part of the freak show so [58:56] if you go to mission gorge it'll say [58:58] when you walk into the mat area it'll [58:59] say at the top welcome to the freak show [59:01] so they used to be [59:03] like b-boys like break dancers so they [59:05] they were known to have freak strength [59:06] like i know that geo is known like [59:08] anybody who's grappled against him knows [59:10] that he has freak strength like crazy [59:12] strength and he's not a very big dude [59:14] i haven't grappled against him so i i [59:16] don't know but i have like these are the [59:17] things that i've i've just heard from [59:19] the community yeah i was asking him too [59:21] i said um you know i looked up a bunch [59:22] of your videos as well i've watched his [59:24] different matches that he's had and he's [59:25] done some in the cage [59:27] and they're super impressive to watch [59:29] and i asked him if he still did it he [59:30] said you know everybody kind of started [59:32] to realize that i was really good at jiu [59:35] jitsu and it just became muay thai [59:37] fights [59:38] oh she was just people avoiding the [59:40] takedowns [59:41] absolutely i mean i saw him taking i [59:43] didn't know that he had fought in the [59:44] cage before yeah he's done a few i mean [59:46] you watch you're like holy is this [59:48] jill or boogie boogie oh i don't think [59:51] i've ever met no yeah but boogie yes i [59:53] know i know that boogie a long time ago [59:54] yeah but geo [59:56] that's his brother yeah i don't think i [59:57] met him yeah [60:00] well boogie's got a beard well both of [60:02] them have crazy cool beards boogies [60:05] obviously he's bald but geo's got he's [60:07] got hair on him but [60:08] i guess they do they talk yeah they're [60:10] like vocal tonality is almost the same [60:13] but joe's a little bit smaller boogie's [60:14] like big and wide he's got like a [60:16] swimmer frame he does yeah he's huge his [60:19] legs are like tree trunks i remember the [60:21] first time i grabbed against boogie i [60:23] was a purple and i like i pulled his leg [60:25] and it was like pulling a tree trunk [60:26] like it didn't like he didn't budge it [60:28] was it was crazy [60:29] i was like like this is gonna suck [60:32] and then you just proceeded to like rip [60:33] me apart but [60:36] geo's a little bit smaller [60:38] sometimes still [60:39] another thing in some of the higher [60:41] levels which just made me think about [60:42] you talking about trying to grab his leg [60:44] uh [60:46] it seems like in the higher belts [60:48] in competition or even in rolling a lot [60:50] of times it almost all seems like a leg [60:53] leg game meaning who can who can put the [60:55] heel hook in who could put the knee bar [60:57] in who could put whatever other correct [60:59] techniques why does it seem like it ends [61:01] up going in that route like the lower [61:03] belts they're not even allowed to do it [61:05] in the competition right because they [61:07] might they don't know what to do it's [61:08] very risky business [61:11] when i started the leg game to be honest [61:14] we we [61:16] we never we never touched on it um [61:18] you know the tenants of transplanted are [61:21] you know rubber guard the truck the [61:23] lockdown the twister [61:25] the truck is pretty much like a couple [61:27] steps before you get the twister [61:29] but [61:30] it's kind of hard to explain but [61:33] yeah i'm going to try to explain [61:35] like how to set it up [61:36] so think of you think of yourself being [61:38] in the turtle position and i'm going to [61:40] hook one of my legs inside your quad and [61:42] i'm going to reach over i'm going to [61:43] grab your other foot and i'm going to [61:45] pull you onto my back so i have [61:48] i have one leg here so i'm holding on to [61:50] or i could go for the banana split so i [61:52] have one leg and um i have your other [61:54] leg in a lock down so you're like [61:57] like the electric chair yeah it's almost [61:58] the electric chair but i'm i'm [62:00] underneath your hips and you're facing [62:02] up and your hips are on top of mine [62:05] and so the truck is [62:06] you know i can i'll grab onto the foot [62:09] so your your leg is your knees is is uh [62:12] it is fl it's not ext it's flexed [62:15] i'm just holding you while you're on [62:17] your back but i'm underneath you and [62:19] i've pretty much got like a [62:21] lock down on one leg and i'm just [62:22] holding your other leg [62:24] you know in just in that position and it [62:26] creates i'm pretty much you know [62:28] splitting your legs apart and you go for [62:30] the banana split where i escaped behind [62:33] your leg and i just stretch out my legs [62:34] and i'm just pulling your legs apart [62:36] you're talking about the banana splitter [62:38] but before that what led to that [62:40] what led to that was [62:42] um [62:43] how a lot of the techniques at the [62:45] higher level a lot of the the [62:47] competitors they go for leg attacks [62:49] there's a lot of leg attachments [62:51] defending the leg attacks why does it [62:53] get to that point oh so like i was [62:55] saying uh when i started we never really [62:57] touched on the legs like we never really [62:58] and then i got into the the tenants of [63:00] ten planning right the truck the twister [63:02] easier to get to or is it because [63:03] they're harder to defend yes [63:05] i was gonna get to that so [63:08] the leg game is kind of recent okay it's [63:10] not it hasn't always been [63:12] so researched um [63:15] it all i could really say that one of [63:17] the guys that what was always about the [63:18] leg game was dean lister [63:20] you know who dean lister is [63:22] he's he's a black belt he's crazy strong [63:25] he's one of the head instructors at [63:26] victory mma [63:28] and so he had always been about the [63:30] twister and so [63:32] are you familiar with the death squad of [63:34] the den her death squad no so it's a [63:36] group of guys that train in new york at [63:39] the henzo gracie academy under john [63:41] danaher who's a hens of gracie black [63:43] belt and [63:45] he he had an interaction he talks about [63:46] this there's an episode of joe rogan he [63:48] talks about this but he was having a [63:49] conversation with dean lester and dean [63:51] this is always going for heel hooks and [63:52] knee bars and ankle locks and that kind [63:54] of stuff he's like well why are you [63:56] always going for that and d lister told [63:57] him you know like why would you know [63:59] it's part of the body like why would you [64:01] ignore the other 50 of the body yeah [64:03] that's a good point and so since then it [64:05] kind of like [64:06] lit this fire into him and he's got a [64:08] degree in philosophy from the columbia i [64:10] think so he just applied all this crazy [64:12] you know philosophical material to jiu [64:15] jitsu and he investigated the like log [64:18] game like crazy and he developed a crazy [64:20] system for leglocks and his death squad [64:23] which was like three or four guys [64:25] were experts at this and this is where [64:27] like gordon ryan comes in gary tonin [64:29] eddie cummins and nikki ryan they [64:31] started crushing people yeah [64:33] exactly [64:34] so they [64:35] they brought this to the table and they [64:37] just started killing everybody with it [64:39] and then ebi you know came up right the [64:42] eddie bravo invitational [64:44] and those guys started winning multiple [64:46] ebi championships so everybody obviously [64:48] has to adapt to the game so what's [64:50] beautiful about this game is that it [64:51] adapts and it goes in so many different [64:53] ways it's so fascinating it's crazy dude [64:56] so now [64:57] i like i remember barely touching [64:59] leglocks in 2013 2014 like we knew how [65:02] to get it and how to roll out of it but [65:04] we weren't actively going for it because [65:06] again we weren't so experienced we were [65:08] you know purple and blue and white we [65:11] couldn't even go for those moves in [65:12] tournaments so like what was the point [65:13] of going into them [65:14] but now these guys brought that to the [65:16] table they destroyed started destroying [65:17] everybody i love that it's taught even [65:19] to the white belts [65:22] correct [65:22] it's important but it's very dangerous [65:25] because it doesn't take much for your [65:28] your lcl and your mcl and your lcl to [65:30] suffer an injury you know it's not like [65:32] an armbar where you feel like it's [65:34] hyperextending right i'm externally road [65:37] externally rotating your heel or [65:39] internally rotating your heel against [65:41] your tibia so i'm literally turning your [65:42] tibia against your femur [65:44] and all those rubber bands you know the [65:46] the ligaments that hold the knee [65:48] together are getting stretched and like [65:50] i've got in mind popped a couple times [65:52] fortunately there weren't tears [65:54] but like if you hear a poppet that's the [65:56] ligament stretching you know you're [65:57] you're creating macro tears in the [65:59] ligaments yeah i've had that so that [66:01] that game is new so once these guys [66:03] started killing everybody obviously you [66:04] know 10th planet's response was well [66:06] let's figure out let's see what they're [66:08] doing and then they announced and kind [66:10] of got on board with it you know the [66:11] honey hole and all these different [66:13] positions are now a big area of focus [66:15] and you see you see him going you know [66:17] all the time but you got to be really [66:19] careful with him this is why that's what [66:20] i love just about competition in general [66:22] for any sport it doesn't matter what it [66:24] is competition breeds growth within the [66:26] sport you know for example uh [66:28] i love the sport of french ring now [66:30] french ring is a protection dog sport [66:32] it's man vs dog you know what i mean and [66:34] when you are competing in this sport the [66:37] decoy the man in the bite suit his job [66:39] and if we were to do belt levels for for [66:42] uh these guys in the bite suit i'm a [66:44] white belt in the bite suit right [66:46] because i watched these guys who've been [66:47] doing it for 10 years 15 years 20 years [66:50] and they move in the bite suit the way [66:51] that you watch a black belt competing up [66:53] against them but you're like it's [66:54] amazing how they're able to do it yeah [66:55] it's unbelievable there's this one guy [66:57] who [66:58] you watch them and you go oh i could do [66:59] that and you try to do it and the dog [67:01] kicks your ass right so the job though [67:03] of these decoys at the top level [67:05] especially like ring three is that's the [67:07] top level the dog will be on the field [67:08] for 45 minutes no collar so they can't [67:10] be corrected they can't be rewarded and [67:12] have to do everything for 45 minutes [67:14] and when they do the attacks up against [67:16] the decoys it's the decoys job to test [67:19] the dog's will to push through the fight [67:21] to push through the clatter stick to [67:22] push the resistance and strikes and all [67:24] this stuff [67:25] right and one of the um [67:28] one of the events or one of the [67:30] requirements for the dog at that level [67:32] is called an uh it's it's i believe it's [67:33] called object guard [67:35] and the handler comes out with a basket [67:36] he sets the basket down and the dog has [67:38] to protect the basket [67:40] so the handler will leave and then the [67:42] decoy comes in the decoys job is to [67:44] steal the basket from the dog what [67:46] without getting bitten it's the dog's [67:48] job to prevent the decoy from taking it [67:50] right there's a lot to do with this [67:51] place called french french ring french [67:53] fries it's amazing i mean the guys [67:58] so uh there's a funny video though with [68:00] the dog so [68:01] the closer the decoy gets to the basket [68:03] is when the dog can bite so if the dog [68:05] comes off the basket and runs after the [68:07] decoy they're gonna lose a lot of points [68:09] because they have to stay next to the [68:10] basket and there's this funny video [68:12] where the dog picks up the basket and [68:13] walks the decoy sets the basket down and [68:15] bites him no because he knew he had to [68:18] be with right but anyway so what some of [68:20] the decoys started to do at the higher [68:22] level because it's a mind game can the [68:24] can the decoy mind the dog so much [68:26] to be able to take the basket without [68:28] being bit so the decoy will act like [68:30] he's training he'll make it he'll make [68:32] the dog think it's a training session [68:33] and if the dog comes at him he'll act [68:35] like like oh you shouldn't bite right [68:36] now and the dog's like oh wait am i not [68:38] supposed to bite is this right so [68:39] they're they're trying to mind the [68:40] dog that's what they're doing yeah and [68:42] the dog has to know and see all these [68:43] pictures and what some of the decoys [68:45] started to do was they started to come [68:46] at the dog and they would open their [68:47] hand out so they would expose their [68:50] hands to the dog and they would [68:51] literally walk the dog off the basket [68:53] while exposing their open hands [68:56] and they would push the dog off and the [68:57] dog was like what the heck why are these [68:59] hands in my face i'm not and it threw [69:01] the dogs off and these decoys started [69:03] taking the basket then the trainers had [69:05] to go how do we combat this and and this [69:07] is a dog that i've never dealt with [69:09] right yeah okay that's if you're the [69:11] decoy coming out right same thing if you [69:13] look at [69:14] like look at uh even competitive jiu [69:16] jitsu look at the competitions now in [69:18] comparison to the competitions 20 years [69:20] ago it's a totally different beast [69:22] same thing with dog training right [69:24] because of course i'm a dog trainer [69:25] right you look at [69:26] a french ring now or ipo now or any of [69:29] these these high level dog sports look [69:31] at the top guys now in comparison to 30 [69:34] years ago [69:35] the top guys now are way better which [69:38]  on the guys back then but that and [69:39] that's because of the the competition [69:41] right what i was going to say to it [69:43] which i found really interesting about [69:44] the leg locks that you said that is [69:45] think about ufc one ken shamrock correct [69:49] was going for what was he going for [69:50] he'll hook or he was going for that [69:51] really i think so because he beat the [69:54] first guy with it i believe and then [69:56] when he was going up against twice [69:57] gracie hoyce gracie knew that that was [69:59] probably going to be the attack so when [70:01] he dropped back like he got into hoists [70:02] uh guard i believe and then he went back [70:04] to go grab his ankle and hoist just [70:06] flipped up because he knew what he was [70:07] going to do because he's like i know [70:09] this dude if he watched it i'm sure or [70:11] maybe he didn't watch it he just knew [70:13] how he was going to move and maneuver [70:14] and he got up and then he ended up [70:15] submitting him and of course winning [70:16] right uh but yeah i mean you would think [70:19] that from that that that first ufc one [70:21] where [70:22] an ankle lock or heel hook whichever one [70:24] it is i'd have to look it up to know [70:26] that it would have been something people [70:27] would invest in more time and they [70:29] really didn't and then you started [70:30] getting these crazy wrestlers [70:33] who were able to neutralize the jiu [70:34] jitsu game and just ground and pound [70:37] yeah and then and then the jiu-jitsu [70:38] game started suffering because they you [70:40] know [70:41] now the wrestlers are neutralizing your [70:42] game and now they're beating the [70:44] out of you well not so that's why it's [70:45] everything so now when you know jiu [70:46] jitsu you got to start working on your [70:48] wrestling you got to work on your muay [70:49] thai you got to work it's just evolved [70:51] but i mean that's a good thing though [70:52] because if you're training you're [70:53] working with people who understand the [70:55] evolution of the sport and how to teach [70:57] it effectively [70:58] and [70:59] you know you enjoy jiu jitsu that's why [71:00] you've been doing it for so long i enjoy [71:02] it i'm there's no doubt i'm going to get [71:04] a black belt it's just a matter of time [71:06] how many years is it going to take [71:07] because i'm obsessed with it and it [71:08] shouldn't matter yeah like people ask me [71:10] all the times i did okay i wasn't [71:12] thinking i never would have known that i [71:13] would have been training for almost a [71:14] decade when i barely started and it's so [71:17] funny because one of my best friends [71:18] back in el paso had taken me to a jiu [71:20] jitsu academy back in like 2005.
document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 243/468,[71:23] right and i tried it and it was i i just [71:26] wasn't about it like i was just into [71:27] other things i had other priorities like [71:29] video games i was a nerd i had braces i [71:31] had glasses like i just just wasn't my [71:33] thing and he got into wrestling since [71:35] middle school and he would practice the [71:37] fireman carry i mean he would on carpet [71:39] dude so he's like beating you know you [71:41] know kicking my ass in the freaking [71:43] living room but i just never got around [71:45] to it until my cousin brought me back [71:47] into it back in 2009 [71:49] and i was just like how the hell did i [71:51] not get back into this [71:52] you know back then so now my buddy who [71:54] had been training [71:55] you know five years prior had five years [71:58] on us so he and he stole the freaking [71:59] monster he was like 135 pounds he's like [72:02] five five moves like a beast yeah dude [72:04] he's a freaking monster he was a [72:06] four-time wrestling high school uh [72:08] wrestling champion that's what kind of [72:10] woke me up the 135 pound thing are you [72:12] talking about like a smaller dude when i [72:14] first did you just hey diago's i went [72:16] against 135 pound blue belt and i swear [72:19] he submitted me like eight times yeah [72:20] dude they have it's crazy it's like how [72:21] is this tiny dude able to put so much [72:24] weight on me like if this is insane this [72:27] is a sport too i say this to anybody [72:29] that i talk to that has kids [72:31] i think if you have kids especially if [72:34] you have young girls you should have [72:35] them do absolutely i mean it's such a [72:37] good sport because last thing if if i [72:40] have kids you better believe they're [72:41] doing jiu jitsu yeah absolutely i mean i [72:43] don't care if they want to or not [72:44] they're gonna do it because i want them [72:46] to have that ability to be able to [72:47] defend themselves and you think about [72:50] it's all body manipulation it's ground [72:52] attacks it's movements and how are most [72:54] women attacked [72:55] they're attacked because somebody's [72:56] trying to rape them exactly it's such a [72:58] terrible thing and if your daughter [73:00] knows jujitsu [73:02] right if she's a black belt [73:04] nobody no one's going to come like if [73:06] she sings a triangle it doesn't matter [73:08] how big this dude is [73:09] man there's different like the gracie [73:11] university or like the gracies they have [73:12] these cool segments where they teach [73:15] like there's like a girl like i remember [73:16] this one where there's this girl [73:18] demonstrating this move where there's a [73:20] let's say there's a guy on top of her in [73:21] the back of a car [73:22] and she can't get him off [73:25] she would grab but she would reach [73:26] behind his back grab the shirt [73:29] pull up the shirt all the way up [73:31] right so like ride the shirt all the way [73:33] up and then grab the collar right so [73:35] you're grabbing a whole bunch of shirt [73:37] right so you have a lot of grip from [73:39] this [73:40] and then she would grab [73:42] the same side and then loop her forearm [73:44] around your neck and get you into like a [73:47] collar choke it was crazy [73:49] and like like a girl it doesn't take a [73:51] lot of force for a girl to put somebody [73:52] out it's just leverage and that's what's [73:54] so amazing about the even though we call [73:56] it a sport i mean [73:58] in the end if you're in a in a situation [74:00] like that you know again if i have [74:03] eventually i may have kids but there is [74:05] no doubt in my mind so if you're if [74:07] you're listening to this and you have [74:08] kids take your kids down to sign them up [74:10] for you [74:11] haven't tried a class yeah yeah i mean [74:13] it's so valuable and there are so many [74:16] it's it's as unfortunate as as it is [74:18] there's so many women who have been [74:19] attacked and you think about it had [74:21] these women known [74:23] jujitsu [74:24] like who knows what could have happened [74:26] right we can't promise that something [74:27] would have happened but [74:29] finding chances is really all you need [74:31] and believe it or not we are out of time [74:34] and this has been an awesome [74:35] conversation man the time flew by so [74:38] fast [74:39] uh anything you want as far as let me [74:41] rephrase it any information you want to [74:43]

I felt terrible that I wasn’t able to help everyone in need. — After a few thousand emails, I decided I needed to create an online training program that could provide the clear guidance so many people needed. I had three main goals in mind: A program that was easy to understand, easy to implement, and affordable! After countless hours of filming and editing, the Nate Schoemer Online Dog Training Course was born at a price everyone can afford. — The beauty of the program is that it teaches the student the science of dog training. During my career, I have trained service dogs, search and rescue dogs, agility dogs, protection dogs, therapy dogs, competition dogs, and pet dogs.

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 246/468,=== TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] about 15 years ago I adopted my first [00:02] dog and I ran into every single problem [00:03] in the book my dog was going to the [00:05] bathroom inside the house chewing on [00:06] furniture pulling on the leash barking [00:08] at people as they walked by and I didn't [00:10] know how to fix these issues and [00:11] everybody I asked seemed to be an expert [00:13] but nobody had the answers and all the [00:15] information was completely so I ended up [00:17] developing a passion I want to really [00:19] learn how to train dogs and I attended [00:20] the Tom Rose school for professional dog [00:22] trainers and became a certified master [00:23] dog trainer and was invited back to [00:25] being an instructor while I was really [00:27] able to hone in on my skills and to be [00:29] able to transfer that information over [00:30] to my students in an effective manner [00:32] where they can implement the techniques [00:33] and get results when I came back to [00:35] California Animal Planet reached out [00:37] asked me if I wanted to host their show [00:39] rescue dog - Superdog it was a huge [00:41] success there were 34 million viewers [00:43] emails started coming in and people [00:45] needed help with their dogs long story [00:47] short I developed the need show where [00:49] online dog training program based on [00:51] science to deliver results by using the [00:54] same technique [00:55] that I used in Animal Planet's rescue [00:58] dog - Superdog ================================================== CONTENU DE: 2019-05-17_How_to_Introducing_Leash_Pressure_to_Your_Dog_.txt ================================================== === INFORMATIONS DE LA VIDÉO === Titre: How to Introducing Leash Pressure to Your Dog.

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 249/468,com/nateschoemer/ === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] okay in this video I'm gonna be [00:01] demonstrating introducing leash pressure [00:04] to a dog so what we want to do is we [00:06] want to make sure we first have our [00:08] communication channels so we've worked [00:10] our yes and we worked our free or [00:12] whatever your markers are going to be [00:13] the condition reinforces then what we [00:16] want to do is we also want to make sure [00:17] our dog understands the concept of [00:19] boring [00:20] Lorena's where we take the food and we [00:21] guide our dogs into the position we want [00:23] them to be in once we have all that in [00:25] place then we can start teaching our dog [00:27] leash pressure now the way that we do [00:29] this is first we apply the pressure the [00:31] dog is going to resist a little bit [00:33] after the pressure is applied then we're [00:34] going to introduce the food lure the dog [00:37] into the position releasing the pressure [00:39] after that then delivering the reward [00:40] now what this does is it shows our dog [00:44] that the pressure will predict a reward [00:48] if you think about predictability when [00:51] working with your dog it can make [00:52] everything much easier because what [00:54] things predict end up equaling that [00:56] value if it always predicts it meaning [00:58] if leash pressure always predicts food [01:00] in the beginning and that's what the dog [01:01] becomes accustomed to then the pressure [01:04] becomes something pleasant because it [01:06] predicts the food and the dog will end [01:08] up beating us into the position because [01:10] they understand it at that point so well [01:12] so it makes it much easier alright so [01:14] I'm gonna be demonstrating with this [01:16] sweet little dog I have right here and [01:19] again pay attention to how I'm doing [01:21] this I'm gonna explain as I'm doing it [01:23] so you can see it shouldn't be really [01:25] too stressful for the dog if you do this [01:26] correctly okay [01:50] and when doing this I like to use a [01:55] martingale so all the martingale is it's [01:57] a flat nylon collar that has a chain on [02:00] it and what this does is it prevents a [02:03] dog from slipping their head out so [02:05] it'll tighten up if they try to resist [02:07] and a lot of dogs they'll learn to do [02:09] that turning motion to get their head [02:11] out of the collar so again these [02:12] martingales [02:17] [Music] [02:34] apply pressure [02:37] release the pressure [02:38] [Music] [02:41] I'm not using commands you [02:50] yes yes as well so I'm gonna do pressure [02:58] and good she went right on it so she's [03:01] making it easy [03:04] yes pressure goes up [03:09] pressures turned off then I reward foot [03:12] comes up nice and slow there's the [03:17] pressure then the food then we release [03:21] the pressure leg comes up [03:24] pressure goes down now what's important [03:35] when you guys are doing this any time [03:38] we're using negative reinforcement [03:40] that's what this is so it's negative [03:42] reinforcement out of the four quadrants [03:44] we have positive reinforcement negative [03:46] reinforcement positive punishment [03:47] negative punishment easy way to remember [03:51] this positive means adding negative [03:53] means taken away reinforcement is [03:56] encouraging a behavior to be repeated [03:58] punishment is trying to prevent that [04:00] behavior from being repeated so if I'm [04:02] using positive reinforcement I'm adding [04:04] to the equation I'm given the dog of [04:06] food encouraging or trying to get the [04:08] dog to do that behavior again negative [04:10] reinforcement taking something away I [04:12] turn pressure on when the dog complies I [04:14] turn it off this would be the same as [04:16] telling a young child you can go outside [04:18] and play but you have to do your [04:19] homework first not a punishment but it's [04:21] showing the child you have to accomplish [04:22] your homework then you can go do what it [04:25] is that you want to do establishing [04:26] those good habits now what's important [04:29] when we're using negative reinforcement [04:31] is once the pressure is turned on it [04:33] cannot be turned off until the dog [04:35] complies once the dog complies the [04:38] pressure must immediately be turned off [04:40] so this is very important when doing [04:42] this and again this is just one more [04:44] tool to add to our repertoire when it [04:47] comes to communicating effectively with [04:48] our dog so I'm gonna do a little bit [04:50] more with her I'm gonna use a terminal [04:52] marker also notice I'm not saying the [04:55] command because I don't want to have to [04:57] reinforce the state at this point I'm [04:58] only teaching the dog the concept of [05:00] least pressure follow the leash [05:02] and you will be follow the leash and you [05:04] will be rewarded okay someone do a [05:06] little bit more goodness me [05:10] so again we've lift up three and now I [05:14] can reward lift up three so then he [05:18] would I'm staying free when her butt [05:19] hits the ground [05:20] free free very nice so she's doing this [05:27] one really well and I'm gonna bring her [05:29] back and now I'm going to do the same [05:30] thing again with the downward pressure [05:33] so again foot comes up pressure goes [05:37] down and she's starting to do it on her [05:39] own so I'm just gonna let her figure it [05:40] out Oh almost have it free good girl [05:49] we're gonna yes [05:52] give her a reward foot comes up nice and [05:56] slow [05:57] what I like is I like the dog to get to [05:58] the point where they lay down just when [06:00] I start to bring the foot up very light [06:02] pressure she's thinking you can see it [06:06] and free very nice Jim brings it up free [06:13] and lifts up [06:20] yes here's my yes on that one leg comes [06:25] up foot goes down slow steady pressure [06:37] free and then we really award again we [06:40] look what leg comes up pressure goes [06:47] down waiting for her to figure it out if [06:54] you need to you can go back and help [06:56] with the food free good girl [07:00] you can even use this to teach fun [07:03] little tricks like the spin again lift [07:08] up yes leg comes up pressure goes down [07:14] nice and slow you can use your hand as [07:16] well if you have a hard time balancing [07:18] so we're adding that pressure [07:34] quite there yet [07:39] wink that elbow freak [07:41] good girl [07:45] very nice [08:34] Emily comes up nice and slow is that [08:39] pressure [09:23] good girl time late comes up and I'll do [09:31] this until I bring my leg up and the dog [09:35] goes down on their own yes sir there's [09:43] some reward around place yes down and I [10:02] said the command which I shouldn't have [10:19] comes up [10:41] and here we go [11:04] bring your back up yes things down [11:21] yes yes very nice [11:41] yes [12:10] yes [12:27] so there's a good session I'm gonna want [12:29] to do this a few more times with her I [12:31] want to get it to the point where I go [12:33] to lift my leg and she lays down because [12:35] then that becomes the physical cue and [12:37] the main difference between using [12:40] negative reinforcement in a combination [12:43] with positive reinforcement is number [12:45] one it's much stronger it's gonna get [12:47] results way faster and it's way more [12:50] clear to the dog what it is that you [12:52] want but what's also important is that [12:54] if you're only using positive [12:58] reinforcement getting a dog to do a [13:00] behavior for a reward then the dog has [13:03] the option whether or not they want to [13:05] do the behavior so the dog doesn't want [13:08] the treat or doesn't want the toy then [13:10] they may not do the behavior that you're [13:12] asking them to perform so with negative [13:15] reinforcement it removes that it lets [13:17] them know it doesn't matter whether or [13:19] not you want to do the behavior you have [13:21] to do it but once you do it I'm gonna [13:23] reward you for doing that behavior what [13:25] ends up developing a way more confident [13:27] and reliable dog within the obedience so [13:30] I hope this video is helpful and I'll [13:32] see you guys on the next one ================================================== CONTENU DE: 2019-06-04_Nate_Schoemer_s_Online_Dog_Training_School.

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 255/468,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] you're gonna want to use certain tools [00:01] to help you with the training let me go [00:03] through a quick list that I put together [00:05] one you either want to have a four foot [00:06] leash or it's six foot leash this is [00:08] gonna help with all the leash pressure [00:10] exercises that we're going to be doing [00:12] as well as walking on a loose leash now [00:15] ideally when it comes to using a leash I [00:17] like to use just basic nylon it's easier [00:20] to fold up it's simple it's light it's [00:23] cheaper you can get leather if you like [00:25] but in my opinion the leather just [00:27] doesn't work as well as an easy nylon [00:30] and sometimes I'll even get the ones [00:31] that are even a little bit thinner than [00:33] this one but I do like this quite a bit [00:36] this is a four foot leash and it works [00:38] beautifully [00:38] so nylon is usually my go-to and again [00:41] it's easier to fold up and put in your [00:43] pocket or you know if you're at the dog [00:45] park you can wrap it around yourself so [00:48] I like this we're also going to want a [00:50] 30 foot long line the 30 foot long line [00:52] is going to help us teach fetch you can [00:54] also use it for the stay command and it [00:57] can also come into play when you're [00:58] teaching a recall so that's something [00:59] you're probably going to want to be able [01:01] to use in your training so pick one of [01:03] those up as well [01:04] another collar that I like to recommend [01:06] for somebody to use is a martingale [01:09] collar flat collar works great what I [01:11] like about the martingale collar is it [01:13] really prevents the dog from slipping [01:15] their head out in the videos I'm gonna [01:17] be using just a normal flat collar with [01:20] the puppy so the flat collar can work [01:22] martingales are great colors to use and [01:25] I do highly recommend them another great [01:27] tool is going to be a harness a harness [01:29] is something that I use when I want my [01:31] dog to pull sometimes people say I put a [01:34] harness on my dog and my dog pulls [01:36] everywhere [01:36] well yeah cuz that's what a harness is [01:38] for it's designed for the dog to be able [01:40] to pull so I want to use that as far as [01:44] building my dogs confidence or [01:46] exercising my dogs when my dogs get [01:48] older a lot of times I'll rollerblade [01:49] them when they have the harness on when [01:51] they're young puppy I'm gonna use this [01:53] for confidence-building exercises I'm [01:55] gonna take the puppy out and I'm gonna [01:56] let him explore and I'm gonna let him [01:57] pull me around and control the entire [01:59] situation it's perfectly fine dogs are [02:02] able to separate walking on a harness in [02:04] comparison to walking on their flat [02:06] collar or their martingale and they're [02:08] gonna know the difference between the [02:09] two so harness is great for building a [02:12] little bit of confidence [02:13] getting the dog to explore and have some [02:15] fun you're gonna want to crate now when [02:17] it comes to crate training we want the [02:20] crate to be just big enough for the dog [02:21] to stand up turn around and lay down [02:23] this is only for potty training because [02:26] we don't want the dog to be able to go [02:28] on one side of the crate go to the [02:30] bathroom and then sleep on the other [02:31] side dogs don't like to go to the [02:33] bathroom where they eat or where they [02:35] sleep so if you have the crate just big [02:37] enough for them to tan stand up turn [02:39] around and lay down they're gonna be [02:41] less likely to go to the bathroom in the [02:42] crate and it's gonna teach them to hold [02:44] their bladder if they're already potty [02:46] trained then you can have a crate the [02:48] sizer house doesn't really matter at [02:49] that point but we want to make sure when [02:51] we're potty training them the crate is [02:53] just big enough for them to do those [02:54] things next you're gonna want to have [02:56] some toys the power of plane with your [02:58] dog is incredibly huge and it's [03:02] something you want to do you want to [03:03] play with your dog that's going to build [03:04] the relationship it's going to build [03:06] their confidence and its really gonna [03:08] make their life more enjoyable and more [03:09] balanced we always want that balanced [03:11] dog so go out there get a bunch of toys [03:13] and play with these toys with your dog I [03:15] don't recommend leaving the toys [03:16] scattered throughout the house though [03:18] because what ends up happening is the [03:20] toys no longer had the value because the [03:22] dogs can get access to it whenever they [03:24] want I like to use toys as a training [03:26] opportunity so it gives me an [03:28] opportunity to train with my dog there's [03:29] more value because they don't have it [03:31] all the time and that's going to [03:32] increase the speed in which my dog is [03:34] going to learn but toys are super [03:35] important you're also going to want to [03:37] climb bed or some sort of elevated [03:39] position for your dog to be able to go [03:41] on - this is one of those commands that [03:44] if you teach your dog the climb command [03:46] the climb stay you can use in so many [03:48] opportunities I use it when we're [03:50] sitting down to eat dinner out put the [03:52] dogs on a climb use it when you're [03:54] watching TV and maybe you don't want the [03:55] dogs on the couch if you let your dogs [03:57] on the couch or if you don't let your [03:59] dogs in the couch they have a place that [04:01] they can go to and they can sleep and [04:02] relax there's so many different [04:04] opportunities for the climb command so [04:06] it's good to pick up your dog a little [04:08] dog bed that you can use for this [04:09] training and it's also a great spot for [04:11] them to go to and relax and if you have [04:13] young kids I always recommend let the [04:16] dog know that the climb bed is their [04:17] safe space that's their place that [04:19] nobody will bother them so if you have [04:21] kids that sometimes have a tendency to [04:23] get a little excited and sometimes it [04:25] can create some stress on the dog the [04:27] knows that they can go over to their bed [04:29] that is a release or a relief for them [04:31] and they're gonna go there if they feel [04:32] a little overwhelmed and it's a just a [04:34] great way to keep the dog balanced so [04:36] highly recommend giving the climb bed [04:37] and then lastly you're gonna want a [04:39] training vest so this right here is my [04:41] training vest [04:42] it has pouches where I can put my food [04:44] my treats my toys you can also get so [04:47] these are a little bit more expensive if [04:49] you want it to order them online but we [04:51] also have just basic training pouches [04:55] that you can find at any pet store they [04:57] hook around your waist you could put it [04:59] behind your back so your dog doesn't see [05:00] it and that's somewhere where you can [05:02] put the food so you're not having to [05:03] always put it into your pocket and [05:04] that's gonna help with your training as [05:05] well so get this equipment and let's get [05:08] ready to train [05:10] [Music] ================================================== CONTENU DE:

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 260/468,to/2O20zJN === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] it's been scientifically proven that we [00:02] have approximately one second to [00:03] influence a dog's behavior that means we [00:05] have one second to reward a dog for a [00:08] behavior we would like them to repeat [00:09] and once I interact a dog for behavior [00:12] we would not like them to repeat and if [00:14] the reward of the correction doesn't [00:15] come within that one second the dog [00:17] won't make the connection so it's very [00:19] important to be able to deliver that [00:21] reward within that first second if we're [00:23] trying to teach our dog a new behavior [00:25] we have what's called primary [00:27] reinforcers and conditioned reinforcers [00:30] when our dog does a behavior within that [00:32] first second we have to either deliver a [00:34] primary reinforcer or conditioned [00:36] reinforcer and I'm gonna explain the two [00:39] a primary reinforcer is exactly that [00:41] it's the primary its food toy or [00:43] affection a conditioned reinforcer [00:45] simply predicts the primary an example [00:49] of a conditioned reinforcer for a human [00:51] would be money or paycheck because it [00:53] has been conditioned by society to be [00:55] reinforcing because it predicts the [00:57] primary now this comes from the studies [01:00] that were conducted by Yvonne Pavlov [01:01] some of you have heard about the dinner [01:03] bell theory basically he had a tone that [01:06] would go off prior to his dogs being fed [01:08] and after a certain amount of [01:10] repetitions when the dogs heard the tone [01:12] they would begin to salivate because [01:14] they knew at that point the food was on [01:16] its way and again he called this [01:18] classical conditioning well if you think [01:21] about it all he did was he renamed a [01:23] word and the word that he renamed was [01:24] predictability because he's a scientist [01:27] he has to make it sound all scientific [01:28] right but if you think about him he did [01:31] further studies and if the sound went [01:33] off while the food was being delivered [01:35] to the dogs or the sound went off while [01:38] the dogs were eating they never became [01:40] classically conditioned to the sound [01:42] because at that point it is no longer [01:44] predictable the sound must precede the [01:48] delivery of the reward by a split-second [01:50] here's an easy way to remember this [01:52] imagine I put a blindfold on you and I [01:54] took a stick and I said I'm gonna take [01:55] the stick and I'm gonna swing it at your [01:57] head but before I do I'm gonna say duck [01:59] so I say duck then I swing the stick [02:02] give you just enough time to duck before [02:03] I hit you with the stick but what if I [02:05] did this duck you would get hit every [02:09] single time and you would never be able [02:10] to learn and it's the same with our dogs [02:13] when we are using a sound as a [02:16] conditioned reinforcer because it [02:17] predicts the reward it has to do just [02:20] that it must predict it so the sound [02:22] must precede the delivery of the reward [02:25] by a split-second here's an exercise I [02:27] want you guys to practice before working [02:29] with your dog or puppy and this is going [02:32] to add a lot of value to your training [02:34] and it's going to increase the speed and [02:36] what your dog learns I guarantee it [02:38] what I want you to do is I want you to [02:40] figure out what sound you want to use as [02:42] a conditioned reinforcer this is the [02:43] concept of clicker training but it's [02:46] just a sound it doesn't have to be a [02:47] clicker if you want to use a clicker [02:49] excellent go grab yourself a clicker and [02:51] you can use that if you want to use your [02:54] voice a lot of trainers will use the [02:56] word yes for example now before starting [02:59] this training understand two things that [03:03] made clickers so successful one the [03:06] click always sounds the same click click [03:09] click [03:10] it doesn't change if you're gonna use [03:12] your voice try your best to be [03:14] consistent at the way you make your yes [03:17] sound or whatever sound it is that you [03:19] decide to use so for me I use yes and I [03:22] say just like this yes yes yes you have [03:27] to sound like a broken record we have a [03:29] tendency to let our emotions get [03:31] involved when we're training so your yes [03:33] may go from yes to yes and we don't want [03:38] to do that we want our yes to be [03:39] consistent cuz at that point it's no [03:42] longer a conditioned reinforcer now [03:44] you're praising the dog so again make [03:47] sure the sound is very consistent the [03:49] second reason why clickers were so [03:51] successful is because it's much easier [03:53] to separate to physicals than it is to [03:56] separate a physical from a verbal so [04:00] click reward [04:01] click reward is much easier than yes [04:05] reward your mind and your body want to [04:08] move the same time you're gonna want to [04:10] do this yes but that's incorrect and yes [04:14] is correct [04:16] so this is what I want you to practice [04:18] if you're using a clicker practice click [04:20] reward [04:21] click reward click reward get yourself [04:24] used to doing that if you're going to [04:26] use your voice [04:27] yes reward yes yes making sure that the [04:34] yes comes before you start to move and I [04:37] also recommend filming this a lot of [04:40] times we may start pairing our physical [04:42] with our verbal and we won't even [04:43] realize it and physical paired with [04:47] verbal physical overrides the verbal [04:49] becomes the only cue for the behavior so [04:52] make sure you separate it yes and then [04:54] reward and when we're conditioning our [04:56] dogs to the sound we want to make sure [05:00] that we start to move or we start to [05:02] deliver the reward within a second after [05:05] we make the yes sound or the clicker so [05:07] it has to go just like this yes then you [05:09] have to start to move immediately after [05:11] you can't have too long of a pause it [05:12] cannot be yes and then deliver that's [05:17] too long and also you want to change the [05:20] way you're doing it so what I mean by [05:21] that is you don't want to be so [05:22] consistent with yes reward yes [05:25] reward you might do yes reward yes [05:30] reward yes reward yes reward so you're [05:37] gonna space it out a little bit so the [05:39] dog doesn't just figure out this pattern [05:41] and no longer pay attention to the yes [05:43] or whatever sound it is that you're [05:44] using because they realize that the food [05:46] is just going to come every second okay [05:49] now once your dog is conditioned to the [05:51] sound then it becomes a very powerful [05:54] tool because you no longer have to [05:57] reward your dog within a second of them [05:59] doing a behavior trying to capture all [06:01] you have to do is mark it with your [06:04] marker okay so this is also called [06:06] loading the marker that's what some [06:08] people call it loading the marker [06:10] getting the dog conditioned to the [06:12] marker and it's also known as engagement [06:14] training which is what I like to call it [06:16] we get our dog engaged and we teach them [06:18] the marker so once they're conditioned [06:20] to the marker this is a question I ask [06:21] everybody how long do you have to [06:24] deliver the primary reinforcement to the [06:26] dog after you make the marker sound so [06:29] after you say yes and the dogs [06:31] conditioned to it so they know that [06:32] they're gonna get a reward how long do [06:34] you have to get the reward to the dog [06:36] before we lose that connection and a lot [06:39] of people will say once [06:41] and it's not the case you have as long [06:43] as a dog is paying attention our dogs [06:46] are not goldfish they don't forget [06:47] things every single second they remember [06:51] places they remember people they [06:53] remember where they bury their bone it's [06:54] just that we can't sit down with a dog [06:57] five minutes after doing a behavior and [06:59] say you know that's it you did earlier I [07:01] really like that behavior here's a [07:03] reward the dog is going to think they're [07:04] getting a reward for what they were [07:05] doing right they're not for the sit they [07:07] did five minutes prior and this is the [07:10] same four things that they do that you [07:12] may not like if you come into the house [07:14] and you see that your dog went to the [07:16] bathroom by the front door and you start [07:18] to yell at them for going to the [07:20] bathroom by the front door [07:21] whatever your dog is doing in that [07:23] moment in time is what they're going to [07:24] think they're being corrected for now [07:27] they're gonna remember that they went to [07:28] the bathroom by the front door but [07:30] they're not going to know that's why [07:31] they're being punished another great way [07:33] to see this from a human perspective is [07:35] imagine that you're a prisoner in a [07:38] different country and you don't speak [07:40] the language you have your little prison [07:42] cell and you have your bathroom in that [07:43] prison cell and you use that bathroom [07:45] every single day and one day you're [07:47] bored and you start to carve on the wall [07:49] and the guards see you carving on the [07:51] wall and they've run in yelling in some [07:53] language you don't understand and they [07:55] grab you and they put your face into the [07:57] toilet are you going to think that [07:59] they're putting your face into the [08:00] toilet because you used the toilet or [08:02] are you going to think that they're [08:04] putting your face into the toilet [08:05] because you're carving on the wall [08:07] you're gonna think it's because you were [08:09] carving on the wall and it's the same [08:10] with the dog so we just want to be clear [08:12] with how we communicate with our dogs [08:15] this is very important so final note [08:18] make sure we make the sound before we [08:20] deliver the reward once the dog is [08:23] conditioned to the sound this is a tool [08:25] that we're going to be able to use [08:26] throughout the dog's training and we [08:29] have as long as it takes to deliver the [08:31] reward to the dog after we use the [08:33] marker as long as a dog is paying [08:35] attention to what's going on so continue [08:38] to practice this get it down make sure [08:39] it's muscle memory and it's gonna

[00:04] marker well both of them are pinpointing [00:07] a moment in time when your dog is [00:09] correct so your dog does a sit you have [00:12] the continuation marker or your dog does [00:15] a sit and you use the terminal marker [00:17] well the continuation marker is letting [00:20] our dog know you're correct but I'm [00:23] gonna bring the reward to you this is [00:25] when we're working on our stays this is [00:27] what when we're working on stability or [00:29] this is also when we're working on [00:30] duration in a position the terminal [00:33] marker lets a dog know you are correct [00:36] you are done with the exercise some [00:39] people also call this a release marker [00:41] and you can come and get your reward if [00:44] I have my dog 10 feet away from me and I [00:47] tell my dog to sit and my dog's butt [00:49] hits the ground and I use my [00:51] continuation marker my dog is gonna get [00:53] excited because my dog knows that they [00:56] did the behavior correctly and now I [00:57] have to walk over to my dog and give my [01:00] dog a piece of food in that position [01:02] because they are continuing the exercise [01:05] they are continuing the sit then we have [01:08] the terminal marker if I had my dog 10 [01:11] feet away 20 feet away 30 feet away I [01:13] tell my dog to sit the moment my dog's [01:16] butt hits the ground I use the terminal [01:18] marker my dog is gonna jump up come [01:20] running over to me and say where is my [01:22] reward [01:23] so it is terminating the sit and the dog [01:26] is coming to get access to their reward [01:28] and it's important to develop both of [01:30] these it's because it's going to speed [01:31] up the training and it's gonna make the [01:33] communication way more clear to your dog [01:36] instead of saying the word stay when we [01:40] put a dog in a position the stay is [01:42] implied and I'm gonna teach you how to [01:44] do this so if I tell my dog down and my [01:47] dog lays down my dog is in a down stay I [01:50] don't have to walk away from my dog [01:52] saying stay stay as you see a lot of [01:55] people do or you may have done it [01:57] yourself we put the dog in a position [01:58] and they have to stay there but when do [02:01] we know when we can use the continuation [02:03] marker and when do we know when we [02:05] should use the terminal marker there's a [02:07] couple ways that I like to use this in [02:09] the very beginning when I'm working with [02:10] my dog I will use the [02:12] terminal marker more often than not but [02:14] it does depend on the dog if I have a [02:16] really really amped up excited crazy dog [02:19] I might use the continuation marker a [02:22] little bit more just to mellow him down [02:24] a slight bit but if I'm trying to make [02:26] the training really fun really engaging [02:28] and more exciting I'm gonna be using my [02:31] terminal marker a little bit more in the [02:33] beginning and there's a couple reasons [02:34] why one if my dog learns the faster I [02:38] get into my position the faster I get to [02:40] jump up and get my reward they're gonna [02:42] do the behavior more quickly and speed [02:45] is based on motivation the more [02:48] motivated our dog is the faster they're [02:50] gonna perform the behavior think about [02:52] playing fetch with your dog you throw [02:54] the ball your dog is really excited and [02:56] motivated to play fetch so they run [02:58] after the ball very quickly they're not [02:59] walking because they're excited and [03:01] they're motivated so more motivation [03:03] increases the speed and it works on the [03:05] other side too if a dog is really afraid [03:07] so let's say you're really heavy-handed [03:09] trainer and I've seen trainers like this [03:11] they're so heavy-handed with their dog [03:13] I'm not recommending that you do this [03:15] but the dog is moving very quickly [03:17] because they're afraid of the handler so [03:19] they can move very fast based on how [03:21] motivated they are whether they're [03:22] really motivated to get something they [03:24] want are really motivated to prevent [03:26] something they don't want and we're [03:27] gonna try to get them motivated to [03:29] access something that they want so we're [03:30] speeding them up based on that [03:32] motivation that positive reinforcement [03:34] so the dog learns a faster I get in the [03:36] position the faster I get to jump up and [03:38] get my reward well there's another [03:40] reason why I like to use my terminal [03:42] marker in the beginning because I don't [03:44] want to reinforce the stay just yet if [03:46] I'm not ready to reinforce this day if [03:48] I'm not ready to teach this day and I'm [03:50] just teaching behaviors then using the [03:53] terminal marker is a really great way to [03:55] do this so those are going to be the two [03:58] things that really separate the [04:00] continuation marker and the terminal [04:02] marker just remember continuation you [04:04] have to bring the reward to your dog [04:06] terminal marker your dog can come and [04:09] get the reward and this is only if you [04:11] are giving your dog a command so if I [04:14] give my dog the verbal command sit my [04:16] dog sits and I say yes I have to bring [04:18] it to them but if my dog sits just [04:21] because my dog wants to sit or maybe I [04:24] lifted my hand up [04:25] but I did not say the sit command and I [04:29] say yes the dog is not in ass its day I [04:31] only reinforced the stay command when I [04:35] give the dog a verbal command if my dog [04:38] goes to their bed and I say yes they [04:41] went to the bed on their own they're not [04:43] on a bed stay but if I told my dog to go [04:46] to the bed and I said yes now they're on [04:48] a bed stay so that's something to keep [04:50] in mind it's only when we give our dog [04:51] the verbal command that they are in a [04:54] stay if we use our continuation marker [04:57] and the terminal marker always releases [04:59] them and they're able to get that reward [05:01] [Music]

motivation [00:06] they're either motivated to access [00:09] something pleasant or they're motivated [00:10] to prevent something unpleasant and the [00:13] nice thing is we get to determine what [00:15] motivating factors can get our dogs to [00:19] do the behaviors that we like so we have [00:22] food as a primary reinforcement we [00:25] talked about this a little bit before [00:26] toys and affection these are gonna be [00:28] positive motivating factors but not all [00:31] food is equal not all toys are equal and [00:34] every dog has different levels of [00:36] motivation now they have different [00:38] levels of motivation for rewards and [00:40] they have different levels of motivation [00:42] for Corrections this is a great analogy [00:45] I'd love to tell people imagine you're [00:46] speeding on the highway and a police [00:48] officer pulls you over and he writes you [00:49] a 25 cent speeding ticket at the moment [00:52] he turns a corner you're running late [00:54] off you go [00:55] right the correction was not high enough [00:58] to curve the behavior but let's say on [01:01] the other extreme end of the spectrum he [01:03] pulls you over and he writes you a [01:05] $500,000 speeding ticket [01:07] you're never gonna drive again you're [01:09] gonna avoid the behavior completely this [01:11] is an avoidance level correction this is [01:12] a correction so high you avoid the [01:15] behavior entirely now let's say he pulls [01:17] you over and writes you a $200 speeding [01:19] ticket that's enough to get you to slow [01:21] down without getting you to avoid the [01:23] behavior of driving and it's the same [01:25] when we're working with our dogs now it [01:27] goes on the positive side as well let's [01:30] say I told you that I wanted you to dig [01:32] a swimming pool and it's gonna take you [01:35] five days and I want you to dig it by [01:36] hand and I told you I'm gonna pay you 20 [01:38] bucks you're probably not going to do it [01:41] but let's say for those five days I'm [01:44] gonna pay you $2,000 you might be a [01:47] little bit more motivated to do the [01:48] behavior it's the same with the dogs [01:50] right everything that they do is based [01:53] on these factors so if I want my dog to [01:55] sit and my dog has a really full belly [01:58] and I'm trying to get him to work for [02:00] his kibble he's probably not going to [02:02] want to sit here he has a full stomach [02:04] he doesn't want the kibble so our pure [02:07] positive or reward based training is [02:09] based on how much does the dog [02:12] the reward right we also have [02:15] perseverance each dog has their own [02:17] level of perseverance this is why dogs [02:20] such as the Malinois or the Dutch [02:22] Shepherd have become such a popular dog [02:25] breed because a lot of these dogs have [02:27] really really high levels of [02:29] perseverance meaning they will continue [02:31] to work for something even if they don't [02:33] get the reward some dogs may quit early [02:36] if I'm working with a dog that may not [02:39] have that high of perseverance I'm gonna [02:41] reward the dog throughout the process I [02:43] want them to get all these little wins [02:45] in order to increase their likelihood to [02:48] try to get that reward because they've [02:50] been successful if I'm trying to get a [02:52] dog for example to spin an entire circle [02:54] very first time and that dog doesn't [02:56] have a lot of perseverance and I go to [02:58] guide the dog in a circle and the dog [02:59] goes a little bit they don't get the [03:01] treat so they give up and they go back [03:02] to facing forward that dog I might have [03:04] to reward multiple times to get them to [03:07] do the full circle so they know there is [03:09] that possibility to get the reward so [03:11] you're gonna have to read your dog how [03:13] much perseverance does your dog have and [03:15] how much do they like the reward that [03:17] you're using to get them to perform the [03:19] behavior so if you're using toys now in [03:22] the very beginning if I'm teaching a dog [03:23] new behaviors I like to use food to get [03:26] them to do those behaviors because I can [03:28] use food as a technique to lure them [03:30] into a sit lure them into a down lure [03:32] them into these different positions that [03:34] I want them to perform once the dog [03:37] knows the behavior then I can start [03:39] using toys to get them to perform these [03:42] behaviors because I've already taught it [03:44] now I'm just reinforcing it we have [03:47] what's called proactive dogs and we have [03:50] what's called reactive dogs when I first [03:53] started working with somebody they [03:54] always ask do I always have to reward my [03:56] dog do I always have to give them a [03:58] treat and then I say do you always have [04:01] to be paid a paycheck to go to work do [04:03] you always expect money when you provide [04:05] labor for something or someone they say [04:07] yes I'm like it's the same with the dogs [04:09] but in the beginning just like when [04:11] we're working with a young kid if you [04:13] have a child that you're working with [04:14] you may give him or her a dollar for [04:17] taking out the trash you may give them a [04:19] dollar for doing the dishes you're [04:22] adding that positive reinforcement to [04:24] get them to do those behaviors [04:25] and you're rewarding them on each one [04:27] because they're still so young but as [04:29] they get older now they start to get a [04:31] weekly allowance and then when they move [04:33] on to the corporate world now they're [04:35] getting paid once every two weeks or [04:37] some of my friends they get paid once [04:39] every three months right they're still [04:41] getting paid but the reward becomes [04:42] spaced out and it's the same with our [04:44] dogs and there's a very simple way to do [04:47] this when I first start working with a [04:50] dog I'm going to reward them for every [04:52] single behavior that they perform so [04:54] this is called continual reinforcement [04:56] sit yes reward down yes reward come yes [04:59] reward I'm rewarding every behavior but [05:01] I want to start spacing it out in the [05:03] beginning you are a vending machine [05:05] every single dollar that your dog puts [05:08] into that vending machine they're [05:09] getting their bag of chips but [05:11] eventually you want to transition into [05:13] that slot machine every time they put [05:15] money in they may not win but they have [05:18] to believe that there's a possibility [05:19] that they're going to win and the way [05:23] that we do this more spacing out the [05:24] rewards is in the very beginning we [05:27] reward every behavior once the dog [05:30] starts to perform the behavior without [05:32] our physical cue so if I tell the dog to [05:34] sit in the dog sits I don't have to lift [05:36] my hand or do anything like that I can [05:38] stand with my arms crossed I could tell [05:39] the dog to sit boom the dog sits I tell [05:42] the dog go down no physical cue I don't [05:44] have to point to the ground or anything [05:45] like that and the dog lays down right [05:47] then I'm gonna start spacing out the [05:49] rewards but I'm still going to give my [05:51] dog some verbal feedback so I might say [05:54] sit good boy [05:56] nice job very good down good come yes [06:00] reward all right and I'm gonna reward [06:03] the dog every now and then and I'm [06:05] giving them feedback so it doesn't go [06:07] from getting a reward after every single [06:09] behavior and now I'm telling them sit [06:11] down and they're not getting anything [06:13] they're gonna shut down really quickly [06:14] they have to know that you're happy [06:15] you're giving them that verbal praise [06:17] but then you're still going to reward [06:19] them and I'll usually do this for a few [06:21] weeks then what I want to do is I want [06:24] to start removing the verbal praise on [06:26] some of the commands what I mean by that [06:29] is I tell the dog to sit no verbal [06:32] praise and that's a very easy command [06:34] then I tell the dog to down good nice [06:37] job good girl [06:38] I tell the dog to climb [06:39] she goes on her climb good girl very [06:41] nice I tell the dog to down again no [06:45] verbal praise I tell the dog to come yes [06:47] reward right so on some of them I'm [06:49] giving them verbal praise and on some [06:51] I'm not and then on some I'm giving the [06:53] actual reward and I'll do that for a [06:55] little while and then eventually it gets [06:57] to the point where I can say sit down [06:59] come heel spin roll over play dead [07:02] yes reward and that way we're really [07:04] spacing it out and this is because our [07:06] dogs don't do things just to please us [07:09] they do things for the possibility of [07:12] getting a reward or preventing something [07:14] unpleasant and it's the same reason why [07:18] most people choose not to rob the bank [07:21] the motivation not to go to jail [07:24] overrides the motivation to make a quick [07:28] buck right [07:29] so if our dog is doing certain behaviors [07:32] we always have to think about what is [07:34] motivating them are they more motivated [07:36] to access something pleasant or are they [07:39] more motivated to prevent something [07:41] unpleasant and understanding this is [07:43] gonna make your training much easier hey [07:46] guys I just want

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 275/468,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] a self rewarding or self-reinforcing [00:01] behavior is something that the dog [00:03] enjoys and depending on what it is is [00:07] going to depend on how you treat this [00:09] behavior whether you're trying to reward [00:10] it and encourage the dog to repeat the [00:13] behavior or you want to stop them from [00:15] performing the behavior for example [00:17] chasing squirrels or chasing rabbits [00:19] could be a self-reinforcing behavior the [00:21] act of chasing a rabbit feels good so [00:24] the dog repeats it jumping up on the [00:26] counter jumping up on people digging [00:28] these are all self reinforcing self [00:30] rewarding behaviors so the dog enjoys [00:32] doing these behaviors they're going to [00:33] continue to do it the only way you can [00:36] remove these behaviors from the dog's [00:38] repertoire is to tell them no you may [00:40] not do that behavior but you can do this [00:42] instead no you may not chase the [00:45] squirrel or the rabbit but you can play [00:47] fetch no you may not jump on the [00:49] countertop but you can go to your bed so [00:52] we have to redirect them to the behavior [00:54] we want them to perform we cannot stop [00:57] self rewarding behaviors by simply [00:59] ignoring them so again self rewarding [01:01] behaviors the behavior itself is [01:03] reinforcing [01:05] [Music] [01:10] throughout this training series I'm [01:12] gonna be talking about what to do to get [01:14] a dog to perform behaviors and how to [01:16] get a dog to stop a behavior but what [01:18] you need to think about is what is going [01:21] through the dog's mind so you have your [01:23] dog your dog performs a behavior [01:26] whatever that behavior is it's going to [01:28] predict an outcome and you as the owner [01:31] of the dog get to determine what that [01:34] outcome is and whether it's an outcome [01:36] that the dog likes or it's an outcome [01:38] that the dog will try to avoid and [01:40] whichever that outcome is is going to [01:42] determine how the dog feels and whether [01:45] or not the dog will repeat this behavior [01:47] and it's very simple let's say for [01:49] example you have a dog that jumps up on [01:52] the countertop and you don't want the [01:54] dog to jump up on the countertop and you [01:56] can't reward the dog for jumping up on [01:58] the countertop so you have to correct [02:00] the dog you have to show the dog that [02:03] that's not an okay behavior it's going [02:05] to predict something unpleasant and then [02:07] hopefully it'll stop them from [02:08] performing that behavior again for [02:10] example something I know people have [02:12] done is they take a jar they fill it up [02:14] with pennies the dog will go to jump up [02:16] on the counter and they shake it the dog [02:18] doesn't like the noise so the dog [02:20] doesn't do the behavior again that will [02:23] work on some dogs just like if a dog [02:27] likes to jump up on people if the dog is [02:29] jumping up on people because they want [02:31] to be petted and they want to be [02:33] rewarded and the human crosses their arm [02:35] and turns away and ignores the dog and [02:38] the moment all four paws are back on the [02:40] ground they turn around and pet the dog [02:41] that's going to work on some dogs and [02:44] it's not going to work on others and the [02:47] reason why is some dogs they want to be [02:49] petted so if they learn oh I just don't [02:51] jump up on the human and that's how I'm [02:53] able to be pet then then I just won't [02:56] jump up I'll sit politely and then I'm [02:57] rewarded for that behavior but if the [02:59] dog enjoys jumping up if that is a self [03:02] rewarding or self reinforcing behavior [03:05] you have to prevent them from doing it [03:07] so the way that I like to do it is by [03:09] implementing leash pressure which you'll [03:11] see in some of the future videos but [03:13] always think about how it works [03:14] dog thinks are doing something they do [03:16] the behavior what is the result from [03:19] that behavior how does it make the dog [03:20] feel and that's going to determine what [03:23] they're not our dog repeats the behavior [03:25] [Music] [03:30] something I'm often asked is how long [03:33] should my training sessions be well [03:36] that's really gonna come down to the [03:37] individual dog a great way to look at [03:40] this is some dogs can work during [03:44] different speeds than other dogs and [03:47] this is what I mean a golden retriever [03:49] can work from ten miles an hour to 150 [03:51] miles an hour they could just continue [03:53] to work in so training sessions with a [03:55] golden retriever can tend to be a little [03:57] bit longer and they'll still stay [03:58] focused and they'll still continue to [04:00] learn let's say another dog can only [04:02] work between 60 miles an hour and 80 [04:05] miles an hour so you have to make sure [04:06] you're right in that perfect time for [04:08] the dog to work to be able to learn the [04:10] information if you train them too long [04:12] they'll start to shut down or that adv [04:14] will start to kick in and they're not [04:16] gonna be as focused what I want you to [04:18] do is pay attention to your dog you [04:20] don't want to stop when your dog is [04:22] losing interest that's not a good way to [04:24] end the training session I like to end [04:27] my training sessions when my dog is [04:29] still pumped up my dog is still [04:31] motivated and my dog still wants to [04:32] learn because that's going to add a [04:34] little bit of frustration and it's gonna [04:35] add more value to our training so a lot [04:38] of times if I'm getting in with my own [04:40] personal dogs let's say to 10-minute [04:42] sessions a day it's pretty good to [04:44] 10-minute sessions a day is going to do [04:46] a lot it doesn't have to be these one [04:48] hour or two hour long training sessions [04:50] really quick really fun really engaging [04:53] and stop when your dog is having fun and [04:56] they want to continue to train because [04:58] that's gonna build that desire more and [05:00] more and your dog will continue to learn [05:02] faster so as I said read your dog pay [05:04] attention to their body language and [05:06] make sure you're stopping before they [05:08] start to get bored I hope you guys [05:10] enjoyed this video so far we have a lot [05:12] still to come everything from the [05:14] science of teaching that dog any [05:15] behavior step by step proven process [05:17] techniques known as luring leash [05:20] pressure leash pressure is a simple idea [05:22] that gets a dog to understand how to [05:24] turn out pressure by compliant which [05:26] increases the dog's confidence teaching [05:28] your dog how to play fetch come when [05:30] called of course all the basics sit down [05:32] come heel stay of course which is very [05:35] important all these things you've always [05:37] wondered or wanted [05:39] be able to train your dog is

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 280/468,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] when working with your dog I recommend [00:01] that you teach your dog formal commands [00:03] and informal commands a formal command [00:06] is going to be your sit down [00:08] come heel they're very formal and you [00:10] want your dog to perform those behaviors [00:12] a very specific way but your informal [00:15] commands are gonna be your more relaxed [00:17] commands for example come on guys [00:19] let's go that's gonna be more of an [00:22] informal command and the reason why it's [00:24] good to have an informal command for [00:26] certain things such as come on let's go [00:27] guys in comparison to a formal is the [00:30] formal you always always should [00:34] reinforce if you are giving your dog a [00:36] formal command you better be ready to [00:38] reinforce that command if you tell your [00:40] dog to sit your dog better sit you [00:43] better make sure that if your dog [00:45] doesn't sit with the food that you use [00:47] the leash pressure whatever the case may [00:48] be but you make your dog do the command [00:51] formal commands must always be [00:53] accomplished by the dog or completed by [00:55] the dog informal commands are way more [00:58] relaxed and if your dog doesn't perform [01:00] it it's not that big of a deal and I do [01:02] this with all my dogs if I give them a [01:04] formal command they know it's time to [01:06] work I'm serious and they need to [01:08] perform the behavior informal we're [01:10] having fun we're playing and it's way [01:12] more relaxed even though we always make [01:14] training fun and we always make it a [01:15] play the informal again if they don't do [01:18] the informal command it's not a big deal [01:20] so it's good to teach the formal and [01:22] informal version of your different [01:24] commands you'll be working with them [01:30] preparing your training environment when [01:33] you're getting ready to train and work [01:34] with your dog you want to work in an [01:36] environment that's going to help the [01:38] training process in the very beginning I [01:41] want to work in an environment that has [01:43] minimal distractions the more exciting [01:45] or the more interesting you are to the [01:47] dog the faster they're gonna learn [01:49] because they're going to be more engaged [01:51] the very first time I work with a dog [01:53] I'm not gonna work in an environment [01:56] with other dogs running around with [01:58] other animals with all these different [02:00] distractions that's going to get my dog [02:02] to veer off from the training but as our [02:05] dogs get better and as they progress in [02:08] the training then we're going to start [02:10] adding new training environments very [02:12] beginning I might work inside to where [02:15] there's less distractions or in one room [02:17] and then I might move to the next room [02:19] and train then maybe the backyard and [02:21] then maybe the front yard and then maybe [02:23] a training field somewhere else so I'm [02:25] gonna keep adding different locations to [02:27] train my dog to really solidify the [02:29] training but I want to set it up so the [02:32] training is conducive to a learning [02:33] process and the dogs learn very [02:35] effectively and very quickly because we [02:37] set it up properly [02:43] if you have a big family and everybody's [02:46] given the dog a little bit of food and [02:48] you're worried about your dog getting [02:49] fat or maybe you're doing a lot of [02:51] training and you want to make sure that [02:53] you're not over feeding your dog or [02:54] under feeding your dog what I recommend [02:57] for this is each morning take out all [02:59] the food that you want your dog to eat [03:01] for the day this includes treats and [03:03] everything else and you place it at one [03:05] spot usually I'll have the bowl with the [03:07] dog's food now place that off to the [03:09] side and everybody knows if they want to [03:11] give the dog any treats or any food or [03:13] anything like that or they're doing some [03:14] training they go to the dogs daily set [03:17] up right and this is really going to [03:18] help control how much our dogs are [03:20] eating because everything that they're [03:21] supposed to get for the day is in that [03:23] bowl and once that bowl is empty they're [03:26] done for the day until the next day [03:27] comes and this is really important [03:29] because we don't want our dogs to get [03:30] overweight and by really managing what [03:33] they're consuming is gonna help keep [03:35] them nice and healthy and fit [03:41] before training our dogs I want you guys [03:44] to know exactly how you should be [03:46] holding the food a lot of times what [03:48] you're gonna see people doing is they [03:50] hold the food like this at their [03:52] fingertips and then the dog comes in and [03:54] the dogs grabbing your fingertips it [03:56] really doesn't feel good and it's harder [03:57] to control the dogs position and it's [04:00] much harder to do some of the [04:01] power-steering exercises that we're [04:03] going to be using in our training so [04:05] what I like to do is I simply cup the [04:07] food in my hand just like this that's [04:09] going to create the valley for your dog [04:11] to come in and take the food and if you [04:13] don't want your dog to take the food you [04:15] can keep it in position pretty easily by [04:18] using your thumb to hold it down so I [04:20] can hold it there the dogs trying to get [04:22] the food when I think they've done the [04:24] behavior correctly or when they have [04:25] done the behavior correctly yes I [04:27] release it and then they're able to get [04:29] access to it so get used to holding your [04:31] food in the left and right hand by [04:34] cupping it just like I'm showing you [04:36] right here and then what you also want [04:38] to do is you also want to practice your [04:40] food handling we're going to have two [04:42] different types of hands while we're [04:44] training our dogs we're going to have [04:45] our supply hand and we're going to have [04:47] our distribution hand and we want to be [04:50] able to switch these hands back and [04:51] forth so then we have the supply hand on [04:53] one side and the distribution hand on [04:55] the other side and you want to also be [04:57] able to do this behind your back so you [04:58] want to be able to switch behind your [05:00] back without dropping the food so this [05:05] is a skill set that's going to be [05:07] important for you to practice this way [05:10] when you're working with your dog you're [05:11] able to switch hands you can have a hand [05:14] that has some supply so you're not [05:15] constantly having to reach into your [05:17] bait bag and it's just gonna make the [05:19] training much easier and much more [05:20] smooth so remember we cut our hand get [05:23] good at transferring your supply hand [05:25] and your distribution hand and this is [05:27] going to make your training much easier [05:29] I hope you guys enjoyed today's video [05:32] this Friday I'm gonna be posting a video [05:33] on engagement training how to load the [05:35] markers so we're going

This is also known as marker training or loading the markers. The two markers we will be the continuation marker and the terminal marker. Continuation Marker: This sound lets your dog know they are correct, and you will be delivering a reward to them. Terminal Marker: This lets your dog know they are correct, and they may come to you to get the reward. It is a release word that always predicts that a reward is about to be given.

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 284/468,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] one of the first things you want to do [00:01] with any dog that you're working with it [00:03] doesn't matter if you're working with [00:04] basic obedience pet training or you're [00:07] doing competitive obedience [00:08] search-and-rescue protection dog [00:10] training you always want to start with [00:12] engagement the way that we teach this is [00:14] we say the marker then we deliver the [00:16] reward and when I'm starting out I'm [00:18] gonna hold my hand next to my face I [00:21] want to get my dog or my puppy used to [00:24] looking up at me and in the very [00:25] beginning they're gonna be looking at [00:27] our hand because they know that our hand [00:29] is holding the treats so we're gonna [00:31] start off simply by holding our hand by [00:33] our face getting our dog or a puppy to [00:35] look up at us and when they look up at [00:37] us all we're asking for is that [00:39] engagement I want the dog to be looking [00:41] at me when the dog looks at me I'm gonna [00:42] make my marker sound then I'm going to [00:45] deliver the reward and then when the [00:47] puppy eats it and looks at me again I'm [00:48] gonna use my other marker the terminal [00:51] marker and I'm gonna move back [00:52] encouraging my dog to come to me to get [00:55] the reward now the two that I like to [00:58] use is yes for my continuation marker [01:00] and I like to use free for my terminal [01:03] marker now don't get confused by the [01:05] words these are markers they let the dog [01:07] know that something's going to happen [01:09] I'm using the word free because I don't [01:11] use it in normal conversation a lot of [01:14] people will use the word okay but we use [01:17] okay too frequently in normal [01:18] conversations and you might accidentally [01:20] release your dog from a stay position [01:22] without realizing it so I use the word [01:25] free and every dog that I work with when [01:27] I say free that dog knows they did the [01:29] behavior correctly and they're going to [01:31] get a reward so I'm gonna be [01:33] demonstrating with Derby here Derby is a [01:35] Golden Retriever puppy and this is gonna [01:37] be the first step I'm gonna start with [01:38] my hands by my face making it fun and [01:40] trying to stay really engaged with Derby [01:43] okay so here we go Derby come on buddy [01:46] all right so I'm gonna give them a treat [01:48] let them know I have some food good job [01:50] and whatever you need to do to get your [01:51] dog's attention and get them looking up [01:53] at you a lot of times people will just [01:55] stand the dog is distracted by [01:57] everything else going on and they don't [01:59] know why the dogs not looking if I need [02:00] to I'll let the dog know I have some [02:02] food then I will bring my hands up to my [02:04] face yes then I'm gonna reward he looks [02:08] at me again free then I'm gonna move [02:10] back good [02:12] jongup I'm gonna bring him back over to [02:15] me yes reward making sure I say the [02:18] marker son when he's looking at me free [02:21] and then movement good boy very nice [02:25] everybody good man good boy again show [02:29] my have the food yes then reward notice [02:33] there's a pause between free and the [02:35] movement this is very important [02:37] pause between yes and the movement free [02:43] movement another detail is I'm changing [02:47] my hands when we work with a dog we want [02:49] to change yes our delivery hand because [02:52] we don't want our dog to focus free on [02:57] one single hand a lot of dogs that they [03:00] learn that the food always comes from [03:02] the right hand they're gonna focus on [03:04] the right hand come here buddy yes [03:09] reward free movement very nice now when [03:16] we're doing this exercise we want to [03:18] continue doing this exercise until our [03:20] dog becomes conditioned to the sound [03:22] meaning they know that when they hear [03:24] you say yes so they hear you say free or [03:26] whatever sound it is you decide to use [03:28] that your dog becomes excited simply [03:31] because they know that a reward is [03:33] coming good boy and when I'm working on [03:37] getting them conditioned yes the food [03:39] comes immediately after I say the marker [03:41] but when I'm testing to see if the dog [03:42] is conditioned yes and I'll wait to see [03:47] a change of behavior now he's not [03:48] conditioned yet so he actually just [03:51] coughed yes see no change of behavior [03:54] that shows me he's not conditioned yet [03:57] when a dog is conditioned we will see a [04:00] change of behavior okay so this is gonna [04:02] be our first step for engagement [04:03] training remember we hold our hand by [04:06] our face we make sure we say the sound [04:08] when the dog is looking at us and then [04:10] we move after we say the sound the sound [04:13] must completely be out of our mouth [04:15] before we deliver the reward same with [04:17] the free or the terminal marker when we [04:19] make that sound remember we're moving [04:21] back encouraging our dog or a puppy [04:24] to come get the reward from us this is [04:27] going to teach the dog yes means I'm [04:29] bringing it to you free means you come [04:30] and get the reward [04:33] yes good girl [04:36] free good very nice excellent come let's [04:42] be peace yes [04:48] reward make sure you're switching hands [04:51] free movement so I'm gonna use the right [04:54] hand come on baby and then go back to [04:57] the left yes reward remember to make [05:00] sure there's always that pause don't [05:01] pair your physical with your verbal so [05:03] don't do this yes even though it looks [05:06] very similar free right there I paired [05:13] it so that's the incorrect way you want [05:15] to make sure the word completely leaves [05:17] your mouth yes before you deliver the [05:19] reward and before you move free and then [05:23] good girl [05:25] excellent yes reward good girl [05:32] free very nice good must be yes reward [05:42] good girl free yes good boy free very [05:51] nice yes I'll get it buddy [05:56] free good yes free yes free yes so he [06:19] does the paws he moves the paws and that [06:21] shows me that he understands that yes [06:23] means he's going to get a reward and [06:24] he's getting excited because he's [06:26] anticipating the tree same thing with [06:28] his terminal marker free so you can see [06:32] a change of behavior when I give him [06:34] that marker sound and that shows me that [06:36] he's conditioned yes good boy [06:39] excellent oops dropped it [06:42] everybody free good very nice so he's [06:47] conditioned to it and I'm gonna bring [06:49] out Ari next again yes reward free yes [06:58] reward free good girl come on [07:05] yes reward free so now I want you to get [07:12] close-up of Charlie or not Charlie Ari [07:14] rather and you can see her change of [07:16] behavior she's also conditioned to the [07:18] markers but hers is a little bit more [07:19] subtle than Charlie's yes so you see she [07:24] does a little bit of a movement free and [07:28] what free she jumps up because she's [07:30] ready to get the reward and I often [07:32] reward her free well I'll have her jump [07:34] up so it's however you condition your [07:36] dog but we want to make sure before we [07:39] move on to the next step yes that our [07:42] dog is conditioned to the sound you can [07:43] see on that when she kind of closed her [07:44] mouth a little bit yes [07:47] she's so cute free excellent yes reward [07:56] good boy [07:58] free come on and I messed up there cuz [08:02] he wasn't looking at me when I said it [08:04] yes good free yes free excellent job [08:16] buddy [08:16] they're big a hero yes free and that's [08:26] him offering of behaviors yes free very [08:33] good buddy [08:34] yeah yes free yes free [08:51] if you want to take your markers to the [08:53] next level you want to start teaching [08:55] your dog to look directly at your face [08:57] and not your hands [08:58] in the beginning we keep our hands by [09:00] our face because we know our dogs are [09:02] looking at the food that's in our hands [09:03] but we want them to understand it's [09:05] looking up at our face the way that [09:07] we're gonna do that is we're gonna hold [09:08] the food by our face and we're gonna [09:09] slowly move one hand away from our face [09:11] and if our dog follows the hand we're [09:14] not gonna reward them but you can see [09:15] she's still looking at my face [09:16] yes I'm mark and then I reward and I'm [09:19] gonna do the other the same thing with [09:21] my other hand I bring it outwards she [09:24] looked at it for a second but she's [09:25] still looking at my face yes and then [09:26] reward and lastly we're gonna bring both [09:30] hands out yes again wanting or trying to [09:35] get them to continue looking up now what [09:37] a lot of your dogs will do is they will [09:39] follow one of the hands yes she's [09:43] already been thought on this behavior so [09:44] she knows it but we can add more we can [09:47] start moving our hands around shaking [09:49] them by their face and we want them to [09:51] continue looking up at our face making [09:53] eye contact yes yes good girl and the [10:01] final picture for this is being able to [10:03] walk backwards with your dog in front of [10:05] you come looking up at you so you can [10:08] see she's walking in front of me and [10:10] she's looking up at my face and that's [10:12] gonna be the final picture that I want [10:14] with this exercise for more of our [10:16] advanced obedience free good girl so [10:21] again we have our hands by our face move [10:23] it away you see he's following it but he [10:25] looked back in my face yes yes that time [10:36] you saw how I waited for him to look [10:38] back at my face [10:40] yes and that's probably what most of you [10:44] will see yes good boy yes you just have [10:53] to make sure you time it correctly so [10:54] you're not saying yes when he's looking [10:55] at your hand yes good very nice buddy [11:00] he's a very high-energy very excited pup [11:05] yes good nice job buddy all right and [11:09] that's going to be our marker training [11:14] all right are we ready to start training [11:17] and working with our pups we're gonna [11:19] start developing the markers we're gonna [11:21] do what's called engagement training or [11:23] it's also known as loading the markers [11:25] again different dog trainers and [11:28] different groups of dog trainers will [11:30] use different types of terminology but [11:32] both of these really mean the same thing [11:33] engagement training loading the marker [11:36] remember the marker is the conditioned [11:38] reinforcer it's the word or sound that [11:39] predicts the reward some people also [11:41] call this a bridge but the reason why a [11:43] lot of people call it a marker I like to [11:45] call it a marker is because it is [11:47] signifying that we are marking a moment [11:49] in time when our dog is right or wrong [11:50] verbally or with our clicker and that's [11:53] going to mark those behaviors and that [11:55] means the dog is going to want to repeat [11:57] the behavior so if somebody ever tells [11:58] you did you mark that behavior what they [12:00] mean is did you use your marker or your [12:03] bridge or your condition reinforce so [12:04] again all three those are the same thing [12:06] so let's say we're using the word yes [12:07] the moment your dog's butt hits the [12:09] ground yes I just marked that behavior [12:12] now the dog knows that that's a behavior [12:15] I want them to repeat I can reach in to [12:16] my best and I can give the dog a piece [12:18] of food for doing that behavior and even [12:21] though the food came several seconds [12:23] after the dog did the sit behavior I was [12:25] asking for they know whatever they were [12:26] doing when they heard that sound is what [12:29] they're being rewarded for and the [12:31] reason why I like to call this exercise [12:33] engagement training is during the step [12:36] I'm not asking the dog to perform a sit [12:38] or down or come I'm not asking any that [12:40] all I want my dog to do is look at me so [12:44] when my dog looks up at me I'm going to [12:46] use my sound yes and then I'm going to [12:48] deliver a piece of food and the way that [12:52] I like to do it is I'm going to be [12:54] teaching both markers I'm gonna be [12:56] teaching my continuation marker as well [12:58] as my terminal marker I'm gonna do these [13:00] together and I'm gonna demonstrate with [13:02] a couple different dogs so you can see [13:04] how it looks how do we know the dog is [13:07] conditioned well the way that I like to [13:09] test this out if I say yes and then I [13:12] give the dog a piece of food and I've [13:14] been doing this for a little while and I [13:15] feel like my dog is conditioned to the [13:17] sound now meaning the dog knows that [13:18] when they hear me say yes they're going [13:20] to get a reward I'm gonna test out to [13:22] see if they're conditioned the way that [13:23] I do that is I hold the food I get the [13:25] dog to look at me once the dog looks at [13:27] me I say yes [13:28] and I don't move I don't reward the dog [13:31] and I watch my dog to see if there's a [13:33] change of behavior right easy way to do [13:36] this is imagine you're saying yes and [13:38] you're giving someone a dollar yes and [13:40] you give them a dollar they're gonna [13:41] reach out they're gonna take the dollar [13:42] you say yes they're gonna reach out [13:44] they're gonna take the dollar you say [13:45] yes they're gonna reach out they're [13:46] gonna take the dollar you say yes you [13:49] don't give them the dollar they're still [13:50] gonna reach their hand out they're gonna [13:52] say where's the dollar every single time [13:54] you say yes you give me a dollar and [13:55] that right there will show you that [13:57] they're conditioned to the sound I mean [13:59] they know that when you say yes you're [14:00] gonna give them a dollar it's the same [14:02] with our dogs when our dog is looking up [14:04] at us and we say yes the four most [14:08] common behaviors that I will see from a [14:09] dog when they're conditioned to the [14:11] sound one they open their mouths so you [14:13] say yes and they open their mouths [14:14] anticipating the food they start to [14:17] salivate they move their paws or they [14:21] lick their lips those are the four most [14:23] common some of you may have a dog that [14:25] barks or jumps up a little bit but the [14:28] key point that you want to take away [14:30] from this is that you see a change of [14:31] behavior and that's gonna let you know [14:33] that your dog is now conditioned to the [14:35] sound what is the difference between a [14:37] continuation marker and a terminal [14:39] marker well both of them are pinpointing [14:42] a moment in time when your dog is [14:45] correct so your dog does a sit you have [14:48] the continuation marker or your dog does [14:50] a sit and you use the terminal marker [14:52] well the continuation marker is letting [14:55] our dog know you're correct but I'm [14:58] gonna bring the reward to you this is [15:01] when we're working on our stays this is [15:03] what when we're working on stability or [15:05] this is also when we're working on [15:06] duration in a position the terminal [15:09] marker lets a dog know you are correct [15:11] you are done with the exercise some [15:15] people also call this a release marker [15:16] and you can come and get your reward if [15:19] I have my dog 10 feet away from me and I [15:23] tell my dog to sit and my dog's butt [15:25] hits the ground and I use my [15:26] continuation marker my dog is gonna get [15:29] excited because my dog knows that they [15:31] did the behavior correctly and now I [15:33] have to walk over to my dog and give my [15:35] dog a piece of food in that position [15:38] because they are continuing the exercise [15:40] they are continuing [15:42] sit then we have the terminal marker if [15:45] I had my dog 10 feet away 20 feet away [15:48] 30 feet away I tell my dog to sit the [15:50] moment my dog's butt hits the ground [15:53] I used the terminal marker my dog is [15:55] gonna jump up come running over to me [15:56] and say where is my reward so it is [15:59] terminating the sit and the dog is [16:02] coming to get access to their reward and [16:04] it's important to develop both of these [16:06] it's because it's going to speed up the [16:07] training and it's going to make the [16:09] communication way more clear to your dog [16:12] instead of saying the word stay when we [16:16] put a dog in a position the stay is [16:18] implied and I'm gonna teach you how to [16:20] do this [16:20] so if I tell my dog down and my dog lays [16:23] down my dog is in a down stay I don't [16:26] have to walk away from my dog saying [16:28] stay stay as you see a lot of people do [16:31] or you may have done it yourself [16:33] we put the dog in a position and they [16:35] have to stay there but when do we know [16:37] when we can use the continuation marker [16:39] and when do we know when we should use [16:40] the terminal marker there's a couple [16:43] ways that I like to use this in the very [16:45] beginning when I'm working with my dog I [16:47] will use the terminal marker more often [16:49] than not but it does depend on the dog [16:51] if I have a really really amped up [16:53] excited crazy dog I might use the [16:56] continuation marker a little bit more [16:58] just to mellow him down a slight bit but [17:01] if I'm trying to make the training [17:02] really fun really engaging and more [17:04] exciting I'm gonna be using my terminal [17:07] marker a little bit more in the [17:09] beginning and there's a couple reasons [17:10] why one if my dog learns the faster I [17:14] get into my position the faster I get to [17:16] jump up and get my reward they're gonna [17:18] do the behavior more quickly and speed [17:21] is based on motivation the more [17:23] motivated our dog is the faster they're [17:26] gonna perform the behavior think about [17:28] playing fetch with your dog you throw [17:29] the ball your dog is really excited and [17:32] motivated to play fetch so they run [17:33] after the ball very quickly they're not [17:35] walking because they're excited and [17:36] they're motivated so more motivation [17:39] increases the speed and it works on the [17:40] other side too [17:41] if a dog is really afraid so let's say [17:43] you're really heavy-handed trainer and [17:46] I've seen trainers like this they're so [17:48] heavy-handed with their dog I'm not [17:49] recommending that you do this but the [17:51] dog is moving very quickly because [17:53] they're afraid of the handler so they [17:55] can move very fast [17:56] based on how motivated they are whether [17:57] they're really motivated to get [17:59] something they want or really motivated [18:01] to prevent something they don't want and [18:03] we're gonna try to get them motivated to [18:04] access something that they want so we're [18:06] speeding them up based on that [18:08] motivation that positive reinforcement [18:10] so the dog learns a faster I get in the [18:12] position the faster I get to jump up and [18:14] get my reward well there's another [18:16] reason why I like to use my terminal [18:17] marker in the beginning because I don't [18:19] want to reinforce the stay just yet if [18:21] I'm not ready to reinforce the stay if [18:24] I'm not ready to teach this day and I'm [18:26] just teaching behaviors then using the [18:29] terminal marker is a really great way to [18:31] do this so those are gonna be the two [18:34] things that really separate the [18:36] continuation marker and the terminal [18:38] marker just remember continuation you [18:40] have to bring the reward to your dog [18:42] terminal marker your dog can come and [18:44] get the reward and this is only if you [18:47] are giving your dog a command so if I [18:49] give my dog the verbal command sit my [18:52] dog sits and I say yes I have to bring [18:54] it to them but if my dog sits just [18:57] because my dog wants to sit or maybe I [19:00] lifted my hand up but I did not say the [19:03] sit command and I say yes the dog is not [19:06] in a sit stay [19:07] I only reinforce the stay command when I [19:10] give the dog a verbal command if my dog [19:14] goes to their bed and I say yes they [19:17] went to the bed on their own they're not [19:18] on a bed stay but if I told my dog to go [19:21] to the bed and I said yes now they're on [19:24] a bed stay so that's something to keep [19:25] in mind it's only when we give our dog [19:27] the verbal command that they are in a [19:29] stay if we use our continuation marker [19:32] and the terminal marker always releases [19:35] them and they're able to get that reward [19:37] [Music] ================================================== CONTENU DE:

This is how you will teach your dog to turn off pressure by complying: Put a leash and collar on your dog and start to pull the dog in one direction, when your dog puts on the breaks, continue to pull, until the dog moves with the pressure of the leash. Once he moves with the pressure, you immediately release the pressure and then reward. You will place your dog in all the obedience positions using leash-pressure only. For a sit, you will apply slow, steady pressure upwards until your dog sits. For a down, you will apply slow, steady pressure downwards until your dog lays down (elbows touching the ground). For the heel, you will use leash-pressure to guide your dog into the heel position. Anytime you use leash-pressure; it is imperative to turn off the pressure once your dog makes the decision to go into the position.

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 287/468,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] okay in today's video I'm gonna be [00:01] working with Elvis Elvis is a rescue [00:03] that came from a local shelter and I'm [00:06] working with him on leash pressure this [00:08] is the introduction to leash pressure [00:09] this is probably my fourth session that [00:12] I've had with this dog so what I'm going [00:14] to do in this video is I'm gonna break [00:15] down exactly what I'm doing and why I'm [00:18] doing it so you guys can have a really [00:20] good understanding of how you can start [00:22] implementing some of these techniques on [00:23] your own dogs [00:24] now keep in mind I'm not going to be [00:27] using any verbal commands during this [00:29] exercise or during this training session [00:30] all I'm going to be doing is I'm going [00:33] to be showing him a physical cue that's [00:34] going to get him to perform a behavior [00:36] once he performs that behavior I'm going [00:38] to mark it with either a continuation [00:40] marker or a terminal marker and then I'm [00:43] going to reward him so you're gonna see [00:45] he's going to start picking up on this [00:47] information pretty quickly dogs learn [00:49] first through physical communication [00:51] before they learn verbal commands so if [00:53] you want to teach your dog any sort of [00:55] verbal command they have to know the [00:56] physical cue that can get them to [00:58] perform that behavior before you start [01:00] to introduce the verbal command so let's [01:02] jump right into it [01:07] okay so what I'm doing first every dog [01:10] has what's known as a classical [01:11] opposition reflex me meme you pull one [01:13] way on the leash they're gonna hunker [01:14] back into position the other way we [01:16] teach the dogs to go with the pressure [01:18] on the leash so what I do is I start to [01:21] apply pressure if the dog resists I [01:22] continue to apply a little bit of [01:24] pressure until the dog decides to go [01:26] with that pressure once they move in the [01:28] direction of the pressure it is [01:29] immediately turned off and they are [01:31] given a reward so I always like to start [01:33] in a straight line I'm simply going back [01:35] and forth and the moment he chooses to [01:37] follow the leash I use my terminal [01:39] marker and then I reward him and you're [01:41] gonna see that he's going to start to [01:43] understand what I expect him to perform [01:44] in a very short timeframe [02:03] okay so on that last one I transition [02:06] into the sit so the cue while using [02:08] leash pressure force it is to slightly [02:10] lift up on the leash the dog will feel a [02:12] little bit of tension from the collar as [02:14] you're pulling up on the leash now that [02:16] pressure needs to maintain until the dog [02:18] goes into the sit command the moment the [02:21] dog goes into the sit we release the [02:23] pressure we mark the behavior and we [02:25] deliver a reward now you can learn more [02:27] about the markers and some of the basics [02:29] for the science of dog training in my [02:31] manual that is available on Amazon I'll [02:33] make sure I put a link in the [02:34] description below okay so I'm going to [02:37] lift up again on the leash once he goes [02:38] into the sit once he decides to start [02:40] going into the sit that's when we [02:42] release the pressure and again I'm using [02:44] my terminal marker in this exercise [02:46] right now [02:51] [Music] [03:01] now I'm also incorporating verbal praise [03:05] now verbal praise is going to be [03:07] different from a marker a marker let the [03:10] dog know they did the desired behavior [03:12] correctly and they're going to be given [03:13] a reward a verbal praises let him know [03:15] they're doing a good job they're on the [03:17] right track it's the same as if your [03:19] boss told you hey great work today [03:20] everybody keep it up a marker so my yes [03:24] and my free in these training videos [03:25] also known as a bridge or a conditioned [03:28] reinforcer would be equivalent to money [03:31] or paycheck for a human because that [03:33] predicts a primary a primary is going to [03:35] be food to our affection a conditioned [03:37] reinforcer in this case the markers [03:39] simply predicts the primary [03:51] okay now I'm using it to guide him onto [03:54] the climb bed this exercise I call a [03:56] climb some people call it a place but [03:58] what I'm doing is I'm using the leash to [04:00] guide him onto the bed once he's on the [04:02] bed again I use my marker and then I [04:04] deliver a reward [04:15] [Music] [04:35] free free sorry [04:57] okay so now this is going to be the [04:59] tougher one okay what I'm doing there is [05:03] first I introduced the pressure now dogs [05:05] learn through patterns they're very good [05:07] at pattern recognition you've probably [05:09] already noticed this with your own dog [05:10] if you have a certain routine that you [05:12] do every day they start to learn the [05:14] routine and they expect you to do [05:15] certain things before you even do it so [05:17] what I'm doing right here is I apply the [05:19] least pressure and having a dog go into [05:21] it down from using leash pressure can be [05:23] difficult for most dogs so what I like [05:25] to do is I first apply the pressure [05:27] then after the dog feels the pressure I [05:29] use food and I lure the dog into the [05:32] position while maintaining the pressure [05:33] on the leash [05:34] once a dog goes into the position just [05:36] like any other position with the leash [05:38] pressure I turn the pressure off I mark [05:41] the behavior and I deliver the reward to [05:42] the dog so he needed a little bit of [05:49] extra help and since it's still the [06:00] early stages I'm rewarding him for [06:02] almost every single behavior this is [06:04] continual reinforcement okay so here we [06:07] go with the pressure you see the [06:08] pressure came first and then the food [06:11] came to help try your best not to pair [06:14] the pressure with the food you want the [06:16] pressure to predict the other room then [06:19] the position so then what ends up [06:21] happening is the dog feels the pressure [06:23] or they see her about to apply the [06:24] pressure and then go into the position [06:26] before anything else disappears and [06:29] that's ideally what we want I also like [06:34] to lift my leg up slowly when I'm using [06:36] my foot to apply that leash pressure you [06:38] don't want to do it quickly because it [06:40] could startle dogs but I also want to [06:42] give them time to see what it is that [06:44] I'm doing I want them to be able to [06:46] figure out this pattern and what happens [06:48] is it'll turn into I just start to lift [06:51] my leg and the dog will go into the down [06:53] position before even having to apply any [06:55] pressure on the leash so it's good to do [06:58] these movements nice and slow in the [06:59] beginning to help the dogs figure out [07:01] what it is that you're doing [07:04] so again I help him with the food and [07:14] releasing the pressure once he completes [07:16] the task so this dog was in a shelter or [07:24] over a year and he spent most of his [07:27] days jumping constantly in his run that [07:30] he had which gave him very strong back [07:33] legs now this is something to keep in [07:35] mind if you do have a dog that has very [07:37] strong back legs or if maybe you have [07:40] adopted a retired racing dog it's more [07:43] difficult for these dogs to go into the [07:45] down position so often because of their [07:47] muscles they will go into that side down [07:50] position where they sit down on their [07:51] hip and he ends up doing that in this [07:56] video because his muscles are so tight [07:58] from spending so much time jumping in [08:00] the kennels at the shelter and again [08:05] once he's in the position I allow him to [08:07] immediately jump up we're not worried [08:09] about retaining or maintaining rather a [08:11] position or the stay all we're doing is [08:13] we're trying to teach him the cue you go [08:14] into the down the pressure is released [08:16] and you will receive a reward so right [08:21] here he's thinking about it and I'm not [08:22] too worried with him moving around there [08:25] we go release the pressure words that [08:28] was one relayed on his right head so [08:31] that's going to be again common some [08:33] dogs that have really tight muscles [08:37] [Music] [08:50] also notice when you're implementing [08:52] leash pressure you shouldn't be pulling [08:54] so hard that you're physically pulling [08:56] the dog into the position it should be a [08:59] bit of tension that they feel that only [09:01] gets turned off when they go into the [09:03] desired position you should not be [09:05] physically only numb into the position [09:07] stand with the cygnus shouldn't be [09:08] holding up so hard that it's choking the [09:11] dog or it's lifting their paws off the [09:12] ground it's just enough for them to feel [09:14] again this is a cue to get them to do [09:16] certain behavior when we're implementing [09:18] negative reinforcement it should not be [09:20] seen as a punishment to a dog so you got [09:27] a little too excited there and when the [09:29] dogs start to go away shunned using just [09:32] the leash pressure I give them a bunch [09:34] of praise cuz I want them to know that [09:36] that was with the behavior as we were [09:38] going for and I want them to want to [09:40] repeat that behavior in the future so [09:41] lots of praise when they start to do it [09:43] on their own without the help of that [09:44] food or the luring and that's what he's [09:48] starting to do he doesn't need the food [09:50] so much at this point as far as guiding [09:52] him into the down he's thinking about it [10:03] again plenty of plays you want the [10:06] training to be fun for the dog you want [10:08] them to enjoy it so then they want to [10:10] train again [10:50] again just waiting them out when you [10:54] first introduced leash pressure you have [10:55] to be patient very good [11:20] and again when they are walking back and [11:23] forth when you're trying to implement [11:24] the least pressure I'm not doing often [11:27] dogs will try certain things to see if [11:30] that turns off the pressure and once [11:32] they realize the only option is to do [11:34] the desired behavior then that becomes [11:36] their default and they don't try [11:38] anything else so I don't worry about the [11:40] dog moving back and forth or trying [11:41] different ways to remove that leash [11:43] pressure that's just the dog problem [11:45] solving [11:54] breathe very nice good job yes okay and [12:02] on that last one when I said free he [12:04] didn't jump up to get the reward so if [12:06] you notice I slightly started to lift up [12:08] on the leash I started to walk my hand [12:10] up the leash and I started to walk [12:12] towards the dog and often this is a [12:13] simple cue to get the dog to come up [12:15] into his sit from the down position and [12:27] again still not worried about any [12:28] commands just communicating him [12:31] communicating with him by implementing a [12:34] physical and he's starting to get [12:40] distracted the neighbor's dogs were [12:41] barking so I figured it'd be a good time [12:44] to end the session get one more nice [12:46] good win and that would be good until [12:48] the next session three good and there we [12:55] go [12:57] all right I hope you guys liked this [13:00] video let me know what you think about [13:02] it in the comments below please be sure [13:04] to click that

want your dog to perform and free [00:15] shaping is you don't necessarily have [00:17] something you want your dog to perform [00:19] but you're gonna reward them when they [00:20] do behaviors that you like you have to [00:23] make sure before you do either one of [00:24] these that your dog is conditioned to [00:26] your markers so it fixed shaping this is [00:29] how a lot of trainers will get a dog to [00:31] ride a skateboard they don't have to [00:33] make the dog to the skateboard they can [00:34] have their training room where they work [00:36] with their dog every single day one day [00:38] the dog goes into the training room and [00:39] there's a skateboard in the center of [00:41] the floor the dog walks over to [00:43] naturally investigate the skateboard and [00:45] once they touch it the trainer uses a [00:47] terminal marker and the dog runs over [00:48] and gets a reward and then the dog goes [00:51] back to the skateboard and says what did [00:53] I do that made you reward me like that [00:56] and they touch the skateboard again and [00:57] the trainer uses a terminal marker again [00:59] the dog comes back they get another [01:00] reward and then the dog goes back to the [01:03] skateboard now they have both paws on [01:04] the skateboard the trainer marks they [01:07] come get the reward they go back they [01:08] have both paws and they slide the [01:10] skateboard a little bit the trainer [01:12] marks the behavior the dog comes back [01:14] and gets the reward and before you know [01:16] it now you have a dog riding a [01:17] skateboard this is the technique that I [01:20] use when I'm teaching a dog scent [01:21] detection I'll have a climb command or a [01:24] climb rather that I'll reward the dog [01:26] for jumping up on that climb and they'll [01:27] do that every single day and then one [01:29] day they'll jump up on there and I'll [01:31] have an empty paint bucket or maybe an [01:33] empty cinder block or something that I'm [01:35] using for scent detection the dog goes [01:37] over and they naturally investigate the [01:39] bucket by placing their nose into it [01:41] once they do that I use the terminal [01:42] marker they come back and get the reward [01:44] then they go back and they put their [01:45] nose in it again and they get the reward [01:47] now they know that sticking their nose [01:49] into the can is something I want them to [01:51] do without actually having to force them [01:53] into the can I just used something that [01:55] they were naturally going to investigate [01:57] as a way to teach it behavior and then [01:59] that would continue on to more advanced [02:01] scent detection work that's using fixed [02:03] shaping to get my dog to do certain [02:05] behaviors now free shaping you don't [02:07] have anything in mind you want your dog [02:09] to perform but you're going to reward [02:10] them for behaviors that you like and [02:12] this is something [02:13] I highly recommend to every single pet [02:15] person out there this will pay dividends [02:17] later on what you're gonna do is you're [02:19] gonna have food in your pocket you're [02:21] not gonna let your dog know that you [02:23] have rewards on you and when your dog [02:25] does a behavior that you like you're [02:26] going to reward them so in the morning [02:28] you have your dog your dog looks up at [02:30] you yes you give them a piece of food [02:33] your dog sits yes you give them a piece [02:35] of food your dog goes over to their bed [02:37] yes you give them a piece of food [02:40] you're being very clear what you like [02:42] that your dog does what behaviors does [02:45] your dog perform that you like and [02:47] they're gonna start to learn this and [02:48] they're gonna start to actively seek out [02:50] these behaviors in order to get a reward [02:52] and this is really what separates a [02:54] proactive dog from a reactive dog but we [02:57] want our dog to understand that their [02:59] behavior can drive the production of the [03:01] reward and by doing free shaping [03:03] you're really going to place your dog in [03:04] a position to understand this and this [03:06] is gonna be one of those ways in order [03:08] to get your dog to do a behavior when [03:10] you don't have food on you so you're [03:11] telling you tell your dog to sit your [03:13] dog goes you might have a reward and [03:15] they sit and boom out pops a treat so I [03:18] recommend doing free shaping thick [03:20] shaping is something you can do if you [03:21] like but free shaping is something you [03:24] definitely should do to help create that [03:27] proactive dog [03:28] [Music] ================================================== CONTENU DE:

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 297/468,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] if you're worried about your precision [00:01] in your obedience you want to be focused [00:04] on reward placement sit and what I mean [00:07] by that let's say we're working our sit [00:09] front position if I want my dog to be [00:11] nice and close to me I want to reward [00:13] her in that position especially when I [00:17] start doing my recall command because if [00:19] I'm standing away and I call my dog to [00:22] me come and she comes in and I reward [00:27] her here she's going to seek out this [00:30] position but if I call her to me and she [00:33] stops there and I reached out and I [00:36] reward her then she's going to seek out [00:38] that position and then I'm not gonna [00:40] have the nice sit front that I'm looking [00:43] for this also comes into play if I'm [00:45] doing my focused heeling are you so if I [00:49] have my dog in heel position what some [00:52] people will do is they will be walking [00:54] with their dog and I'm using food for [00:57] this as an example but a lot of people [00:58] will be using toys she just gets so [01:00] amped for the toy I'm gonna use food [01:02] heel so as they're walking they'll have [01:04] a toy on the right side they'll say free [01:06] and they'll reward the dog like this [01:09] right so what's going to end up [01:11] happening is your dog is going to start [01:13] to anticipate that the reward is going [01:15] to be coming from the right side and [01:17] their body will start to change as [01:20] they're doing the focused heel so [01:22] instead of walking nice and straight [01:23] your dog is going to start to do a walk [01:26] like this so now it's kind of like a [01:27] little bit of a crab walk just because [01:30] your dog is going to be anticipating the [01:32] reward coming from that right side so [01:35] what a lot of trainers will do is if [01:39] they have the toy on the right side they [01:41] may be walking with their dog and [01:44] they'll take the toy and they'll bring [01:47] it in front [01:49] they'll bring it in front and say free [01:52] and let the dog jump directly up and [01:55] towards the reward and what that'll do [01:58] it'll it'll create more of a forward [02:00] momentum in your dog a lot of dogs at [02:03] this point will start to prance because [02:05] they're anticipating the reward is going [02:06] to be in front of them in an upward [02:08] angle so they're thinking about that as [02:10] they're walking because they want to [02:12] jump forward in order to get that reward [02:15] another thing a lot of trainers will do [02:17] is if they want their dog's head set to [02:21] start leaning back more all right sit [02:24] they want their dog's head to start [02:26] really leaning up then what they'll do [02:29] is they'll reward the dog behind their [02:31] back so they'll take a tug toy or [02:34] anything like that and they'll hold it [02:36] behind their back and they'll say free [02:37] and the dog will go behind their back in [02:39] order to get the reward and now the dogs [02:42] gonna be thinking here's my human I'm [02:45] doing my focused heel when they release [02:47] me I have to go back and around to get [02:50] the toy and it'll naturally start to [02:52] bring their head up a little bit more [02:54] same thing if I'm doing let's say for [02:56] example sit I'm doing my recall command [03:01] okay if this even Falls in basic [03:04] obedience if you call your dog to you if [03:06] you say come and you reward your dog [03:08] like this then your dog is going to come [03:11] to your right side sit come same thing [03:17] if I bring my hand to the left side then [03:19] my dog is going to start to come to my [03:21] left side when I call them to me that's [03:24] why every time I do a recall I bring my [03:26] hand Center and I lift up because I want [03:29] my dog to be nice and center on me if we [03:33] are using toys are a crime we can use a [03:36] toy part of the reward placement as well [03:39] so if my dog is starting to come to me I [03:41] could have my toy behind my back and I [03:44] did say come there so you have to be [03:46] aware of what you say our ego Clark [03:52] and then when she starts to move in my [03:55] direction I can release the toy behind [03:58] my back which should speed up her recall [04:00] if I'm doing something like this I want [04:02] to use my terminal marker so I'm [04:03] releasing her from the come one called [04:06] command and I'm allowing her to go and [04:08] get her toy come free and then she's [04:14] able to run and get the toy right and so [04:16] that's gonna get my dog to speed up she [04:19] wants me to play tug but I don't have a [04:21] rope to grab re so that's gonna speed up [04:24] our dogs come when call command and any [04:27] time we think about this we really want [04:32] to think about that reward placement so [04:34] when you're giving your dog reward think [04:36] about where they are thinking in their [04:39] mindset and how that's going to change [04:41] their positioning so I'll give you one [04:44] more example oh okay so what I can do is [04:52] I can bring my dog in to heel some [04:57] people will put a toy in their armpit [04:59] like this now you want to be careful [05:02] that your dog doesn't try to bite it out [05:05] of your armpit because that'll not feel [05:06] good down no down okay [05:10] so what we can do is we can take the toy [05:13] and we can set it down somewhere as well [05:15] and then as we walk so for example if I [05:19] taught my dog to crab walk and I'm [05:23] trying to fix that then I can start [05:25] rewarding my dog off to the left to try [05:27] to get my dog to straighten back up so [05:30] we can place a reward and we can start [05:32] to walk around that item our heel so [05:36] she's thinking about that so as I'm [05:42] walking she's anticipating the reward [05:45] being off to her left free and then I [05:47] can release her and she's gonna peel off [05:49] to get that reward and that can start [05:52] shaping or changing the way that her [05:54] focus here will look so again think [05:56] about that think about your reward [05:58] placement whether you're doing basic [05:59] obedient or advanced obedience [06:01] is going to be very important and it's [06:03] going to play a part in every single [06:05] training exercise [06:06] [Music]

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 300/468,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] hey guys nate shomer here and i have [00:02] this amazing german shepherd puppy named [00:04] harley we're going to be training her to [00:06] be a service dog this is going to be [00:08] approximately a six to nine month [00:09] program so one of the first things you [00:11] want to keep in mind is having the [00:13] proper training equipment the basics [00:15] that you want to have as a collar you [00:17] can have a flat nylon collar like this [00:19] one that she has on or you can also use [00:21] a martingale collar those are very good [00:23] tools to use for training as well and [00:25] then a basic leash i like to use a [00:27] simple nylon thin leash it's light easy [00:31] to use very effective you don't need one [00:33] of those big heavy chains or something [00:35] like that just something very light and [00:37] very simple and then also some sort of [00:40] training vest or maybe [00:42] one of those training pouches that you [00:43] can wear on your waist to use to hold [00:46] your training treats when working with [00:48] your young pup [00:49] so the first thing that i like to do [00:51] when i start the training with a puppy [00:54] is what is known as [00:56] marker training or loading the dog to [00:58] the marker also known as engagement [01:00] training what this is we're going to [01:02] teach her that a certain sound means [01:04] she's going to get a reward there's [01:06] going to be two sounds that i'm going to [01:07] be using one is going to be yes and the [01:10] other one is going to be free so when i [01:12] say yes [01:14] that means she's correct [01:16] and she's going to get a reward but i [01:17] have to bring it to her in place this is [01:19] what's known as a continuation marker [01:22] then we also have what's known as a [01:23] terminal marker the word i'm going to be [01:26] using is the word free now don't get [01:28] confused by the dictionary definition of [01:30] the word free when i tell her free it [01:32] doesn't mean free go do whatever you [01:34] want it means you're correct [01:37] come get your reward the technical [01:39] terminology for this is known as a [01:42] condition reinforcer so primary [01:44] reinforcer is food toy or affection a [01:47] condition reinforcer predicts the [01:49] primary this comes from the studies that [01:51] were conducted by evon pavlov the [01:52] russian psychologist [01:54] basically he had a sound that would go [01:56] off prior to the food being delivered to [01:58] the dogs and after a certain amount of [02:00] repetitions when the dogs heard the [02:02] click they would begin to salivate and [02:04] that's what he called classical [02:05] conditioning but if you think about it [02:07] all he really did was he renamed a word [02:09] and the word that he renamed was [02:11] predictability because he did further [02:13] studies if the sound went off while the [02:15] food was being delivered or the sound [02:17] went off while the dogs were eating they [02:20] never became classically conditioned to [02:21] the sound the sound had to precede the [02:24] delivery of the reward by a split second [02:27] so you're going to see all i'm going to [02:28] do in this exercise is i'm going to get [02:30] her attention when she looks at me i'm [02:32] going to use my marker the yes or the [02:34] free and i'm gonna deliver the reward so [02:37] she can become conditioned to the sound [02:39] so let's go ahead and jump right into it [02:41] i'm gonna set her down [02:43] and i'm gonna let her know i have the [02:44] food [02:45] right now i don't need the leash i'm [02:47] just gonna be using the food [02:49] and i'm gonna get her to look up [02:51] yes then i reward notice there is a [02:54] slight pause between yes and the [02:56] delivery of the reward [02:59] same thing with the other word free [03:01] then i move back encouraging her to come [03:04] and get the treat when she looks at me [03:06] again [03:07] yes i reward i don't have to wait for [03:10] her to look at me for a long free [03:12] for a long period of time i want her to [03:14] look up at me [03:15] yes boom and get the reward this should [03:17] be fun and it should be engaging [03:21] free [03:22] then i move back again notice how i'm [03:24] saying yes [03:26] before i move and i'm saying free [03:29] before i move [03:31] so this is how it looks yes [03:34] if i'm training a young puppy free [03:36] without explaining what i'm doing so i'm [03:39] just gonna start training her good girl [03:41] yes [03:42] very nice [03:44] free good girl that's very good [03:49] this way [03:52] that's a toy [03:54] yes [03:55] good girl [03:58] free very nice so right there she wasn't [04:01] looking i messed up but it's okay [04:03] she didn't mess up i did [04:05] yes [04:06] good girl [04:09] free [04:10] very nice good job [04:14] yes [04:15] excellent [04:17] free also notice i'm switching hands [04:20] good girl [04:21] yes [04:25] free [04:26] very nice [04:29] and i will continue to do this exercise [04:32] until she becomes conditioned to the [04:34] sound [04:36] now it's very simple to find out if the [04:37] dog is conditioned to the sound meaning [04:39] they know that the sound is going to [04:41] predict a reward [04:42] the way that i test this out is i get [04:44] the dog in front of me i say the marker [04:47] sound in this case the yes or the free [04:49] and i wait to see if there's a change of [04:51] behavior [04:52] if the dog gives me a blank stare then [04:54] they're not conditioned but if the dog [04:56] looks at me and does one of four things [04:59] licking their lips [05:00] salivating opening their mouth or moving [05:02] their paws that shows me that they know [05:05] they are about to get a reward and they [05:06] are conditioned to that sound and we can [05:08] now use this sound within our training [05:11] to help communicate more clearly what it [05:14] is that what we want and what we expect [05:16] from our dog and this would be the same [05:18] as clicker training so if you want to [05:20] use a clicker you can use a clicker all [05:22] it is is simply a sound that you're [05:23] going to use [05:24] to pinpoint a moment in time [05:27] when your dog is correct and it's that [05:30] simple [05:31] today i'm going to introduce you guys to [05:32] my second step of dog training but i'm [05:34] going to start with simple behaviors [05:36] we're going to teach the puppy how to [05:38] lure so we're going to teach her how to [05:39] follow the food in my hand then we're [05:41] going to use that to start showing her [05:43] the sick command the down command come [05:46] when called even our stand command maybe [05:49] heel position but what we're going to do [05:51] is we're going to use the food to [05:52] manipulate her into the positions we [05:54] want her to perform [05:56] once she performs the behavior we're [05:57] going to mark that behavior with our yes [06:00] or our free and then we're going to give [06:02] her a piece of food encouraging her to [06:04] repeat this behavior when i'm doing this [06:06] step in the training i'm not saying the [06:09] name of the command i'm simply giving [06:11] her a physical cue that's going to get [06:13] her to perform the behavior once she [06:15] performs the behavior i'm going to mark [06:17] and reward so it should look something [06:19] like this all right so what i want to do [06:21] is i want to get her to understand the [06:22] concept of luring and that's getting her [06:24] to follow the food that's in my hand in [06:27] order to get access to the reward so yes [06:30] when she pushes into my hand i'm saying [06:33] yes and then i'm rewarding her [06:35] yes and then i release the food [06:37] good girl fix her ear yes [06:40] very nice good job sweetie i can switch [06:43] hands yes [06:45] excellent [06:47] yes good girl very nice [06:52] yes [06:53] good [06:55] and then as they get better at it you [06:58] can make them [06:59] work a little bit harder in order to get [07:01] the reward and again this is what i like [07:03] to call power steering because we can [07:06] guide the dome into any position that we [07:08] want simply by using this concept [07:12] of luring i can lure her into the down [07:14] position i can lure her up into the sit [07:17] position i can get her to come towards [07:19] me [07:21] and sit down [07:22] i can get her to spin in the circle [07:25] or to go in between my legs [07:30] and walk there and all i'm doing [07:32] is i'm giving her a physical cue [07:35] by using luring [07:37] getting her to get into the positions [07:39] that i want her to perform [07:41] and once she's in the position [07:43] i mark and reward [07:45] now i'm going to go over each position [07:47] in a little bit more detail but this is [07:49] the basic concept of luring get them to [07:51] understand that pushing into the hand [07:53] and moving forward is going to get them [07:56] access to the reward build up their [07:58] confidence so then when they are trying [08:00] to do behaviors that are a little bit [08:01] more complicated it ends up being easy [08:04] for them because they're willing to work [08:06] in order to get access to that reward [08:09] all right guys so what i want to go over [08:10] in this video is how i'm going to be [08:12] teaching her the sick command using the [08:14] luring and we're going to use both [08:16] markers so i want you to see [08:18] how [08:19] i use the continuation marker during [08:22] this step and how i use the terminal [08:24] marker the terminal marker adds a lot of [08:26] value when we're doing this because it [08:28] teaches our puppy or our dog the faster [08:31] they do the behavior the faster they're [08:32] going to be released and they're going [08:34] to get the reward when we're working [08:36] with a dog [08:37] speed is based on motivation [08:39] the more motivated the dog is the faster [08:42] they move [08:44] if you think about a dog playing fetch [08:46] they always run to get the ball because [08:48] they're motivated and they're excited so [08:50] we want to make sure the training is fun [08:52] and you're going to see that the [08:52] terminal marker is really going to help [08:55] speed up the command [08:57] and it's going to make the training [08:58] enjoyable so let me show you how we're [09:00] gonna do that [09:02] come here fluffy [09:04] good girl harley so i'm gonna take the [09:06] food and i'm gonna lift up [09:09] yes [09:09] the moment her butt hits the ground i'm [09:11] gonna give her the food [09:14] yes [09:15] good girl and i'm not worried about her [09:17] staying in the position yes [09:20] very nice so you see when i say yes [09:23] i bring it to her let's see how it looks [09:25] when i use the terminal marker [09:27] free [09:28] good girl very good [09:31] free [09:32] excellent very nice [09:38] free good girl so watch her butt when [09:40] her butt hits the ground that's when i'm [09:42] staying my [09:44] marker [09:45] free [09:46] excellent good girl [09:48] again making sure you switch hands you [09:50] don't always want to use three [09:52] the same hand because then your dog will [09:54] focus just on that one hand [09:58] free and even though she's getting the [10:00] reward when she gets up it's the act of [10:03] free sitting [10:05] that is getting her axes [10:07] free to that reward good girl very nice [10:12] and we can even mix it up we can go yes [10:14] we can do yes [10:16] bad handling with the food there comes [10:18] me [10:19] very nice [10:21] yes [10:25] yes [10:27] come on baby [10:33] yes [10:34] good girl [10:36] and that's going to be [10:38] step two [10:39] when i'm teaching my dog or teaching her [10:42] the sick command [10:44] i'm simply lifting up my hand [10:46] her nose goes up [10:48] her butt goes down [10:49] when her butt hits the ground i say yes [10:52] then i give her the food and that's [10:54] going to be how we're going to shape the [10:56] sick command again using gloria [11:00] today i'm going to be showing you guys [11:01] how we're going to teach the down [11:03] command using luring it's going to be [11:05] very similar to how we started teaching [11:07] the sick command but one of the things [11:09] you want to be aware of is how you bring [11:11] your hand to the ground one of the [11:13] common mistakes that people make is [11:14] they'll bring their hand down to the [11:15] ground the dog is trying to get the food [11:17] and they move their hand away as the dog [11:20] is trying to get the food you want to [11:22] move it straight down and what else i do [11:25] is i create a little cave with my hand [11:28] by how i hold the food so i bring it [11:30] down you see how i'm creating a cave [11:32] by turning my hand the dog's nose has to [11:36] go underneath the palm of my hand in [11:38] order to get to the food which makes him [11:41] lay down just like she's doing so again [11:44] we go straight down yes [11:45] once she gets into position we mark and [11:47] we reward and right now since she's [11:49] coming back up into the set i can reward [11:51] that as well yes good girl so let's see [11:53] how it looks when i get her moving [11:55] around and i like to to bring my hands [11:57] straight down [11:58] yes [11:59] good girl very nice [12:04] yes [12:05] excellent good [12:07] and i could also say [12:09] free [12:10] very good good job come on baby [12:13] very good excellent [12:16] for this one i prefer to use yes [12:20] yes [12:21] because she can jump right up anyways if [12:23] she wants to [12:25] yes [12:26] or i can bring her again back up into [12:28] the yes the sit position and go right [12:30] back into the down [12:32] yes [12:33] when i'm working with a puppy yes [12:36] i like to use meal time yes [12:39] as an opportunity to train [12:41] the key things you want to keep in mind [12:43] is [12:43] once she gets in a position yes [12:46] that's what we mark the behavior i'm [12:48] watching her elbows touch the ground if [12:50] for some reason the dog's back end goes [12:52] up i'm going to wait till that butt goes [12:54] down yes [12:55] mark and reward now as i was saying [12:57] before in the previous video some dogs [13:00] will go down like this [13:02] yes but their butt won't go down right [13:04] away so what i'll do is i will reward [13:06] them for attempting until that butt goes [13:09] down then i'll give them [13:10] whatever's left in my hand so i'm [13:12] showing them i'm going to reward you [13:14] here put in the effort but what we [13:15] really want is we want you to lay all [13:17] the way down if you have a dog with a [13:19] lower level of perseverance you don't [13:20] want them to quit because they're not [13:22] getting access to that reward [13:26] yes and she's figuring this out very [13:28] very quickly she's a smart little dog [13:31] yes [13:32] you're going to see though the way that [13:33] you handle the food is going to make a [13:36] really big difference [13:37] on how easy [13:39] or how difficult it is for your dog to [13:41] figure out what it is you want them to [13:43] perform but this is going to be [13:46] using our luring cube to get our dog to [13:49] go into the down command without using [13:51] the verbal command down we're simply [13:53] giving a physical cue [13:54] once she performs a behavior mark [13:57] [Music] [14:05] all right today we're going to be going [14:07] over three commands that i'm going to be [14:09] showing her they're really simple so [14:11] that's why we're going to put all three [14:12] in one video one's going to be the climb [14:14] command it's a place that we want our [14:16] dog to go i call it climb some people [14:18] call it place some people call it up [14:20] really doesn't matter what you call it [14:22] but it's just going to be an elevated [14:24] position where we want our dog to go and [14:25] we want them to maintain that position [14:27] then i'm going to teach her spin so it's [14:29] a simple command they spin in a circle [14:31] some of you may have seen my dog ari [14:33] perform this it's a fun command they [14:35] usually enjoy it and then the last one [14:38] is going to be center where she goes [14:40] between my legs and maintains that [14:42] position so let me show you how it's [14:44] done again we're still in the early [14:45] stages so we're marking every behavior [14:48] we're rewarding every behavior and we're [14:49] not worried about the command just yet [14:51] we want her to have fun and make it a [14:53] good time all right here we go [14:56] and she's going no not going to the [14:57] camera all right come here harley [14:59] harley good girl so for the climb we're [15:02] going to guide her on yes [15:04] mark and reward and we could also use [15:06] this as an opportunity to teach the off [15:07] command so we guide her off yes [15:10] we give her a reward now we're going to [15:11] throw on the spin we bring their head [15:13] around making a full rotation now some [15:16] of you guys if you have a dog that [15:17] doesn't have as much perseverance [15:19] meaning they give up quickly [15:22] you may have to reward them when they're [15:24] partially [15:25] uh through the exercise so you might [15:27] have to go yes and reward there you [15:29] might have to go a little farther yes [15:31] and reward there because you build on [15:33] success and then she goes all the way [15:35] around yes and then we reward her again [15:37] we want to build on success if you're [15:39] trying if you do this and the dog gives [15:41] up [15:42] then you need to give them those wins so [15:44] they know that if they continue to [15:46] persevere they'll be able to get access [15:48] to the reward [15:50] so again these are all very simple i'm [15:52] cupping the food in my hand i'm guiding [15:54] her to the position that i want her to [15:55] be in once she's in that position we [15:58] mark and we reward [16:00] at the completion of the behavior and [16:02] then for the center command [16:05] this one i want you to know what i'm [16:07] doing with my hands i have food in each [16:10] hand but she's not gonna get the food [16:13] that's in the right hand i'm simply [16:14] gonna use that to guide her around into [16:16] position and i'm gonna transfer her over [16:19] to the left hand so here we go i'm gonna [16:22] show her the food [16:24] come here you right here she's [16:26] distracted she's got something in her [16:28] mouth what you got in your mouth [16:31] there there you go she dropped it a [16:33] piece of grass or something okay so [16:36] she's going for this food [16:37] come on add puffy all right i got her [16:40] around boom transfer her over the food's [16:42] still in this hand and i got her in the [16:45] center where i want her giving her those [16:47] rewards so now let's see what it looks [16:50] like [16:51] if i were to just be training [16:53] and not i'm not going to be explaining [16:55] what i'm doing right now i'm just going [16:56] to train her so you can see what it [16:57] looks like [16:58] each time she doesn't get access to the [17:00] reward until after i say the marker [17:03] sound so here we go [17:04] come on baby yes good girl very nice [17:08] yes excellent way to go [17:12] yes good girl that's my good girl [17:17] yes good girl maybe make her walk a [17:20] little bit [17:21] very nice that's a good girl [17:24] get her to come back [17:25] we'll do another little [17:28] here we go i'm right here i got the food [17:29] there we go do another spin [17:33] yes good girl [17:35] very nice [17:37] yes excellent [17:42] yes good girl [17:45] that's very nice [17:46] yes [17:47] excellent and [17:50] it's something that i can incorporate [17:51] later when we start doing the heel [17:52] position we can throw in that little [17:54] spin [17:55] it's really cute the dogs like it it's a [17:58] good release from you know an obedience [18:00] routine that might be more strict and [18:02] not as engaging if you're training or [18:04] you're working with a puppy really young [18:06] like she is ten [18:07] ten and a half weeks somewhere around [18:09] there you wanna make it as fun as [18:11] possible you want them to have a good [18:12] time and you want to end the session [18:15] when they're still having fun you don't [18:17] want to end the session when they're [18:18] getting bored you want them when the [18:20] session's over you want them excited [18:22] about it you want them motivated the [18:24] next time you bring them out so when you [18:25] bring them out the train they're ready [18:27] to rock and roll if they're ready to [18:28] have a good time and they're going to [18:30] learn much faster because of that all [18:32] right i'll talk to you guys later [18:34] [Music] [18:44] okay guys today i'm going to be [18:45] introducing [18:47] the place command [18:49] and for me the place command is a bowl [18:52] you can see in the back [18:54] a bowl that i place upside down and my [18:56] goal or my intentions are to get her to [18:58] place her front paws [19:00] on the bowl [19:01] and what i'm going to do after that when [19:03] she understands it a little bit more [19:05] she's never done it so we'll see how she [19:07] responds [19:08] and i'm gonna guide her and do the best [19:10] i can to lure her with the food to get [19:12] her onto the position [19:13] some dogs this may be a little bit more [19:15] difficult some it's easier we'll see how [19:17] she is and then once she understands [19:19] that concept some of the future goals is [19:21] to get her to pivot her back end while [19:24] maintaining her paws on the bowl this [19:27] helps a dog with that rear end awareness [19:29] so they know that their back end is [19:31] something that they can manipulate [19:32] without moving the front end and this [19:34] will help help when we're teaching her [19:36] to flip into heel position and really [19:38] again have that awareness of her own [19:40] body so let's go ahead and do that we [19:42] can also use this as a target for [19:44] different exercises later on so i'm [19:47] going to bring it over [19:49] and let's see we can get her to put her [19:52] paws on the front of the bowl [19:54] yes good girl [19:56] very nice yes so she's an easy one [19:59] that's good [20:01] and i'm going to keep rewarding her for [20:03] keeping her paws on there [20:05] very good that's good good girl [20:09] very good you're such a smart girl [20:12] aren't you now i'm gonna have her come [20:14] off because i want her to get those paws [20:15] back on so we can repeat the exercise [20:17] yes [20:18] very nice so she's a very easy [20:21] dog to teach this to i've had some other [20:23] dogs where they do everything in their [20:25] power to avoid the bull and that could [20:27] be a little bit of a struggle [20:30] but she just places her paws right on it [20:32] which is very cool let's go back this [20:33] way sweetie and back this way let's get [20:36] those paws on there yes [20:37] good girl yes [20:39] see if i can get her to maintain it yes [20:41] by spacing out the markers yes [20:44] very good yes excellent and if the [20:47] bowl's too small that's gonna make it [20:49] more difficult so i like to use a bowl [20:51] like this one this is a basic metal bowl [20:55] made by kong so it has the rubber on the [20:57] top and that makes it easier for the [20:59] dogs to have a little bit of traction [21:01] with their paws [21:03] the full metal bowls are a little bit [21:04] more difficult for them [21:06] i know trainers that will also use horse [21:08] bowls big horse bowls to start out again [21:11] a bigger target's going to be a little [21:12] bit easier and the horse bowls are made [21:15] out of rubber as well so it's easier for [21:17] the dogs to maintain that position with [21:19] their paws so let's bring her around and [21:20] get her to put her paws back on it [21:23] since she's doing so well i'm gonna see [21:24] if i can get her to pivot that back end [21:27] so i'm gonna get her paws on there good [21:30] girl very nice [21:31] cupping the food in my hand and i'm [21:33] gonna turn yes good girl so she's [21:34] turning her back in already [21:36] very nice [21:37] yes good you see that that is awesome [21:40] that's exactly what i want good girl [21:43] let's see if we can get that back in the [21:44] pivot yes good girl [21:46] and we're gonna take her back the other [21:48] way all right here we go you ready [21:49] harley let's see if we can go the other [21:51] way don't get too bored [21:53] come on here we go here we go [21:55] come on [21:56] you can do it yes good girl [21:59] very good [22:01] come on can we get another step yes [22:03] excellent [22:05] so that's exactly what i want that's a [22:07] good session for there and you can see [22:09] how this is going to [22:11] advance later on to where she [22:13] understands [22:14] that when she's in a sit-front position [22:17] i can say heal and she'll be able to [22:19] flip her back end right in the heel [22:21] position with very nice beautiful [22:23] precision even though i'm training her [22:25] to be a service dog that precision is [22:27] still really nice [22:29] and it will help with the training and [22:31] lastly a lot of the stuff that i'm going [22:33] to be teaching her [22:34] it's for instructional purposes only i [22:36] want you guys to know how to teach it so [22:37] for example we're going to be teaching [22:39] her scent detection as well [22:40] she's not going to be a diabetic alert [22:42] dog but it is something that you would [22:44] need to know how to do if you were to [22:46] train a diabetic alert dog so we're [22:48] going to be throwing in some really cool [22:50] things to help teach you guys a little [22:52] bit more how to train your own service [22:53] dogs or how to train a service dog for [22:56] somebody that you know alright guys i'll [22:58] talk to you later see in the next video [23:00] [Music] [23:09] hey guys nate schumer here in today's [23:10] video we're going to be going over the [23:12] hand touch it's a very simple exercise [23:14] all i want her to do is to understand [23:16] that when i tell her to touch that she's [23:18] going to touch my hand with her muzzle [23:20] the way that i'm going to start this is [23:21] i'm going to take a piece of food and [23:22] i'm going to put it between my two [23:24] middle fingers on my hand that's where [23:26] i'm going to hold it i'm going to give [23:27] her the picture let her see it and then [23:29] let her gain access to the food once she [23:31] understands that concept [23:33] then i'm going to add the command the [23:35] command is going to be touch [23:37] i know you're excited [23:39] so [23:40] when we start adding the command [23:43] when we're trying to let a dog know that [23:44] they're doing the behavior correctly we [23:47] have to give them a reward within a [23:48] second of them doing that behavior at [23:50] least when we're teaching them [23:52] so we have the primary reinforcers and [23:54] we have the condition reinforces the [23:55] primary is the food toy or the affection [23:58] the condition reinforcer is going to be [23:59] our markers [24:01] since she is getting access to the food [24:03] right away i don't have to use the [24:04] marker for this step but once i remove [24:07] the food and i want her to touch my hand [24:09] without the food being there then i will [24:11] be using the marker so you're gonna see [24:14] each step it's pretty simple all right [24:15] so let's get started [24:18] she's pretty excited to be out here [24:20] so we're gonna take a piece of food [24:22] place it between the two middle fingers [24:23] of my hand [24:25] and then let her get access to it so i'm [24:27] gonna do it again show her the picture [24:29] boom [24:30] very easy ever come back the other way [24:32] excellent [24:34] and then back the other way [24:36] good girl very nice [24:39] very good [24:40] so like i said it's a very simple [24:42] concept [24:43] so now that she's taking the food from [24:44] the hand i'm going to start naming it so [24:46] i'm going to say [24:48] touch [24:49] then i'm going to present and she gets [24:50] the food [24:51] put it in my other hand [24:54] touch [24:55] then i present making sure we say the [24:58] verbal before the physical [25:01] touch [25:02] then the cue [25:05] good girl [25:07] touch then the cue [25:09] very nice excellent [25:12] so this is what i was talking about [25:13] before touch where she's getting instant [25:16] access to the reward for doing the [25:17] behavior so i don't have to use the [25:19] marker during the step [25:21] harley [25:22] touch [25:24] good girl very nice and i can add verbal [25:27] praise [25:29] touch [25:30] so now that she's going back and forth [25:32] and she's doing this pretty easily i can [25:34] now remove the food from the hand and [25:36] then reward her from the opposite hand [25:39] after i mark the behavior so i'm trying [25:41] to get her to understand the picture of [25:42] touching my hand whether or not there's [25:44] food there so let's get started touch [25:47] yes [25:48] good and then i reward her right away [25:50] with my other hand touch [25:52] yes good very nice excellent [25:56] touch [25:58] yes good girl so you see now she's [26:00] touching my hand with her muzzle [26:02] touch [26:04] yes and then i give her the food so now [26:07] again there is no boost [26:10] there is no food in my hand [26:13] touch [26:14] yes very good [26:17] excellent [26:18] touch [26:20] yes good girl [26:25] yes [26:26] very good so there's going to be a few [26:28] applications that we're going to use [26:30] this in future training it's fun for the [26:33] dog i like to use it as a release this [26:35] is also known as a power up but it's [26:36] something that we can use to help teach [26:38] other behaviors such as turning on and [26:41] off the light switch so you guys will [26:43] see in future videos how we're going to [26:45] do that but again very simple concept [26:48] start with the physical cue have the [26:50] food in your hand get your dog to get [26:52] access to it have them understand that [26:54] behavior name the behavior and then last [26:57] get them to do it without the food in [26:59] your hand again very simple technique [27:01] but it adds a lot of value later on in [27:03] our training alright i hope you guys [27:05] enjoyed this video make sure you click [27:07] that like button leave a comment and [27:08] we'll see you in the next one [27:09] [Music] [27:18] okay guys today i'm going to be [27:19] introducing the stand command it's [27:21] really simple we're still going to be [27:23] using luring i'm going to take the food [27:24] and i'm going to tuck it underneath [27:26] towards her chest hoping that will get [27:28] her to spring her back end up once she [27:30] gets in position i'm going to mark and [27:32] reward again during this step i'm not [27:34] worried about naming the command i just [27:36] want to be able to present a physical [27:37] cue that's going to get her to perform [27:39] the behavior every single time if she [27:41] doesn't pop up the back end then i'm [27:42] simply going to help with my hand to [27:44] show her that i want her backing to pop [27:45] up and you'll see exactly what i mean [27:47] it's pretty simple so i'm going to get [27:49] the food and i'm going to get her over [27:51] here come here sweetie [27:53] very good so she's sitting right now [27:56] oops i dropped the food no big deal and [27:58] now i'm going to take the food again [28:00] tucking it towards her chest hoping to [28:02] get her back in the pop-up [28:05] yes [28:06] just like that very good [28:08] very good yes [28:10] and i'll reward her for the si as well [28:14] it's still early in her training yes [28:16] so i'm rewarding every single behavior [28:19] yeah oh [28:20] yes [28:22] we'll throw it down in there as well and [28:24] we'll see if we can get her to pop back [28:25] up using the food [28:27] the luring [28:29] oh there was a noise no big deal [28:32] yes good girl it's not gonna be perfect [28:35] in the beginning but we're not worried [28:37] about perfection just yet [28:39] yes good girl [28:43] come on baby [28:44] you can do it yes [28:46] good very nice so i'm not having to help [28:48] her which is really good but if i was to [28:50] help her [28:51] if she was having a hard time and the [28:53] back end wasn't popping up i would just [28:55] use my hand and just provide that little [28:58] extra bit of assistance to give her more [29:00] of a clear path [29:02] of what i want her to do [29:04] and she's very food motivated which [29:06] helps a lot [29:09] yes [29:10] good girl [29:11] so again you see how i'm marking the [29:13] behavior once the back end pops up [29:16] and if you've seen my other two videos [29:18] for the sit what we're doing is we're [29:20] lifting up to get the dog to sit [29:22] remember where the nose goes the butt [29:24] does the opposite and for the down we're [29:26] simply bringing our hands straight down [29:28] creating a little cave for the dog's [29:30] nose to go underneath which in turn will [29:32] bring the back and down since they have [29:34] to stick their nose underneath the [29:36] little cave that you're making with your [29:37] hand [29:38] so now since we have [29:40] the [29:41] stand added into the dog's repertoire we [29:43] can start using all three [29:46] so while i'm training her i could throw [29:48] in the sit yes [29:51] i could throw in the stand [29:59] yes [30:00] throwing the down [30:02] yes [30:03] good girl [30:04] and that's going to be something that [30:06] i'm going to add when i'm doing the [30:07] training when i'm training a dog [30:10] i don't just do one session and do one [30:12] simple command over and over again i try [30:14] to teach him everything in the very [30:15] beginning especially this is her [30:17] imprinting stage where [30:19] what she learns during this time she [30:21] will hold for the rest of her life so i [30:23] want to make sure she enjoys the [30:24] training we're having a lot of fun it's [30:27] very engaging so when she's older and [30:29] she enjoys the training it's going to [30:31] make it much easier to teach her new [30:33] behaviors and more complex behaviors so [30:36] again one more time [30:39] bring it to her chest kind of guide her [30:42] move her around a little bit till we get [30:44] that back in to pop up yes [30:46] oh went back down no big deal yes [30:48] once it gets back up we mark we reward [30:52] we give her a treat and when it's really [30:53] good and she knows that this is the cue [30:55] to pop that back end up then we'll go [30:57] ahead and we'll name the command but [30:59] this is all we're gonna do for now [31:01] alright so i hope you guys like the [31:02] video make sure you leave a comment [31:03] below [31:04] and i'll see you on the next one [31:05] [Music] [31:14] all right in this video i want to start [31:16] introducing her to the heel position i'm [31:19] just going to guide her over to the heel [31:20] position as well as introducing her to [31:23] the sit front position [31:24] i want to get some precision it doesn't [31:26] have to be perfect but i want to get it [31:28] in the general area if you're doing [31:30] competition obedience a perfect sip [31:32] front is going to be directly in front [31:34] of you center the dog as close to you as [31:36] possible without touching you and then [31:38] heel position depending on what sport [31:40] you would be doing [31:42] for example akc they want the dog as [31:44] close to you as possible and they want [31:46] the [31:47] paws aligned with the balls of your feet [31:50] and again some sports might vary a [31:51] little bit i don't need it to be perfect [31:53] with her but we're going to get pretty [31:55] close and i'm going to show you the body [31:57] language that i'm going to be using and [31:59] how i'm going to be luring her to each [32:01] position again the sit front and then [32:02] the heel position all right so let's get [32:05] started [32:06] i'm going to get the food out show her [32:08] that i have the food [32:10] so for the sit front all i'm doing is [32:12] i'm bringing my hand down directly [32:13] centered to my body and then when she [32:15] gets close i lift up [32:18] and then i reward so she's a little [32:20] crooked there again i'm not too worried [32:22] about it being completely straight for [32:24] for a service dog but [32:26] that's not too bad and then for the heel [32:28] what i want to do is i want to step back [32:30] with my left leg guide her around [32:33] circle her head inward [32:35] and then reward her now [32:37] having your dog circle their head inward [32:40] is very important for this exercise [32:42] because if you circle their head [32:44] outwards [32:46] then that's going to become the default [32:47] movement that they do and you're not [32:49] going to have that really pretty [32:52] rotation of the back end coming into [32:54] heel position like that because we want [32:57] when they fully understand the heel [32:58] position we want them to flip their body [33:01] it's called a flip finish into the heel [33:03] position so again their head comes [33:05] inward i step back giving her some room [33:09] and i can even reinforce the position a [33:11] little bit more by walking forward and [33:13] rewarding her now for the sit front when [33:16] she's in heel position i'm stepping [33:18] forward now with the left leg [33:21] guiding her around my leg and back into [33:24] the sit front position [33:25] there she was a little bit too crooked [33:27] that's a little better all right let's [33:29] guide her again stepping back with that [33:31] left leg circling her around in the [33:32] position [33:34] yes mark and reward got her let's walk a [33:37] little bit forward yes good girl a [33:40] little bit more [33:41] yes very nice i said that marker a [33:43] little early and she's way crooked there [33:45] but that's okay [33:46] if you make one mistake it's not gonna [33:48] ruin the dog i've had people stress out [33:51] because they reward the dog when the dog [33:54] wasn't doing it correctly and they're [33:56] concerned that they're gonna mess up the [33:58] training [33:59] one mistake is not gonna mess it up so [34:01] don't stress out too much have fun with [34:03] it yes like there she's a little crooked [34:05] again i'm not too concerned stepping [34:07] back with that left leg circling her [34:08] around back forward into heel position [34:11] marking and rewarding and now since we [34:14] taught her a lot of those other [34:15] behaviors we can incorporate those as [34:17] well [34:18] in with this exercise so we can throw [34:20] that spin in there [34:21] we can throw the sit we can bring her [34:23] into the down we can pop her back up [34:25] into the stand position [34:27] bring her to the sit front over here [34:32] a little crooked i want to reward here's [34:34] another detail [34:35] when you are doing the sit front [34:37] position i like to keep my hand [34:39] really close to my body and then i drop [34:42] my hand down to reward them reward [34:44] placement is something you want to keep [34:46] in mind if i have my dog sit and i'm [34:49] trying to do a sit front and i reward [34:51] her [34:51] this far away then there's no reason for [34:54] her to come nice and close into position [34:56] so i want to bring my hand up and then [34:59] reward her [35:01] closer [35:02] to my body [35:03] same thing with the heel position i like [35:05] to reward them when their head is upward [35:08] so they get used to keeping their head [35:10] up [35:11] looking up at me if i wanted to start [35:14] working on a focused heel to where she [35:16] walks and she looks at me the whole time [35:19] and maintains that eye contact that's [35:21] going to be something you'll see in a [35:22] lot of competition obedience again not [35:25] really necessary for a service dog i [35:27] enjoy teaching it though so we're going [35:29] to work on a focus here with her it may [35:31] not be perfect but we're going to have [35:32] some fun with it alright i hope you guys [35:34] like this video [35:36] make sure you leave a comment make sure [35:37] you share the video and thanks again [35:41] [Music] [35:49] hey guys nate shomer here in today's [35:51] video we're gonna start teaching our [35:52] puppies how to walk backwards [35:54] so it's a very simple concept what i do [35:57] is when i want the dog to come towards [35:58] me i open my hand encouraging them to [36:00] come to me to get the reward when i want [36:02] them to walk backwards i close my hand [36:04] into a fist and i walk towards a dog [36:07] when we're first starting this we don't [36:08] expect the dog to just completely walk [36:10] backwards all we want to do is we want [36:12] to be able to get one step and then as [36:15] the dog gets better we're going to add [36:17] more steps [36:18] to the backwards walk this helps them [36:20] with their rear end awareness but it's [36:22] also going to help her as far as [36:24] understanding how to use her body when [36:27] we start doing more complicated service [36:29] dog tasks so let's go ahead and jump [36:31] right in so i'm going to grab the food [36:33] get her attention i'll go ahead and [36:35] reward her [36:37] and so now all i'm going to do is i'm [36:38] going to close my hand i will walk [36:40] towards her yes and when i see her take [36:42] those steps backwards yes i mark and i [36:44] reward [36:46] yes good girl so i can get her to come [36:49] back to me and then let's go ahead and [36:51] get her to walk backwards again yes very [36:53] nice good job harley [36:56] yes [36:57] good [36:59] yes a common issue that people run into [37:02] when they're trying to do this exercise [37:04] is the dog may try to sit down [37:06] yes what she is not doing it's making it [37:09] much easier but if your dog does sit [37:11] down just be patient with it and try to [37:14] move your hand manipulate your hand to [37:16] get the dog to do the behavior remember [37:18] this is our power steering we get the [37:21] dog to really understand the concept of [37:23] following our hand we can use that to [37:25] manipulate the position wherever we want [37:28] the dog to be it's no different for this [37:30] so if i'm trying to get just like the [37:31] stan commando i'm bringing the food down [37:34] i'm trying to get her to pop her back [37:35] end up at first if she doesn't do it [37:37] right away we just really have to work [37:39] it to get the dog to understand it and [37:41] then we mark and reward so again we [37:43] close our hands we walk towards our dog [37:45] we get those backwards steps yes we [37:47] reward [37:49] good girl get those backwards steps yes [37:52] reward [37:54] yes [37:55] reward very nice [37:58] yes [37:58] good girl [38:01] so [38:01] once we get the dog doing it every [38:03] single time and you get them presenting [38:06] the picture or they're doing it exactly [38:08] the way you would like them to do it [38:09] then you go ahead and you name the [38:10] command [38:12] just like every other command we make [38:14] sure that we say the verbal command [38:16] before the physical cue so if i wanted [38:19] to tell her back up or walk backwards [38:21] whatever we want the command to be i can [38:23] say back up [38:25] then i do the cue [38:26] so there she's sitting there [38:29] yes reward [38:30] good girl back up then the queue [38:34] yes reward [38:35] excellent very nice [38:37] back up [38:40] yes good girl [38:45] try one more [38:48] back up [38:49] [Music] [38:50] we got sirens in the background look so [38:52] now she's really walking a nice distance [38:55] backwards and we'll continue to say the [38:57] name of the command before the physical [38:59] cue [39:00] up into the point where our dog beats us [39:03] to the behavior so you say back up boom [39:06] my dog's walking backwards now without [39:09] the help of the physical cue this is [39:10] definitely an exercise i recommend [39:12] teaching your dogs [39:14] even if your dog is not a service dog [39:16] it's still a good exercise it's really [39:18] fun and you'll definitely be able to [39:20] impress your friends when you tell your [39:22] dog to back up and your dog walks [39:24] backwards alright i hope you guys enjoy [39:26] this video i hope the background noise [39:27] isn't too distracting and i'll see you [39:29] all in the next one [39:34] [Music] [39:39] okay in today's video we're going to be [39:40] introducing the verbal command so up [39:43] until this point we've taught our dog [39:44] the marker is known as loading the [39:45] markers i call it engagement training [39:47] where we get them conditioned to the [39:48] sound that predicts the reward the [39:50] condition reinforcer then we start [39:52] showing our dog what behaviors we want [39:54] them to perform by using the luring [39:56] technique so teaching her how to sit by [39:59] lifting up the down by luring her to the [40:01] ground the place command all these [40:03] different exercises that we want our [40:05] dogs to perform once we know we can get [40:07] them to do the behavior every single [40:08] time on the physical cue then we go to [40:11] my step number three where we name the [40:13] command so when we name the command the [40:15] name of the command must precede the [40:17] physical cue it has to come before it [40:20] must be predictable to the dog this is [40:22] an analogy i tell everybody and should [40:24] help you remember this imagine you have [40:26] a blindfold on and i have a stick and i [40:28] take that stick and i say i'm going to [40:29] swing the stick at your head but before [40:31] i do i'm going to say duck so i say duck [40:34] then i swing the stick giving you just [40:36] enough time to duck before i hit you [40:38] with the stick but what if i did this [40:40] duck [40:41] you get it every single time and you [40:43] would never be able to learn so it's the [40:45] same when we're teaching our dog basic [40:46] behaviors or any command really we want [40:49] to say the verbal [40:51] and then we want it [40:53] come here baby [40:54] come on come on getting excited for the [40:56] camera so we want to say the verbal [40:58] command and then we're going to show our [41:00] dog the physical cue so it becomes a [41:02] pattern that they can learn they can [41:03] predict and then we do that until our [41:06] dog beats us into the behavior so for [41:08] example i say down then i lure my dog [41:10] into the down position i mark and reward [41:13] i say down [41:14] look the dog went into the down position [41:16] before i lured them into that position [41:18] now we know we have it on the verbal [41:20] command another thing you want to keep [41:22] in mind is when we start naming the [41:25] command we want to use the terminal [41:27] marker [41:28] so when i teach stay i don't say stay if [41:31] i place a dog into a commanding position [41:33] so for example i tell the dog to sit and [41:35] that dog sits down and i use my [41:37] continuation marker so for her as yes [41:40] then she will be in a sit stay if you're [41:43] not ready to enforce the stay use the [41:45] terminal marker this way we can pinpoint [41:47] the completion of the behavior we can [41:49] reward the dog and we can release them [41:51] at the same time so during this exercise [41:53] i'm going to be using my terminal marker [41:56] which is free letting her know that [41:58] she's done with the exercise and we're [41:59] going to move on to the next one again [42:01] this is because we're not ready to [42:02] enforce the stay command so here we go [42:05] we're going to be doing all the [42:06] different commands that we've worked on [42:07] so far [42:09] and remember it goes command motivate [42:12] mark reward and each one has to be [42:14] separated by a split second on the [42:16] timeline [42:17] they can't be together [42:19] so we say [42:21] down [42:22] then we cue our dog free and then we [42:24] reward [42:27] climb [42:28] then the q [42:29] free then the reward [42:33] off [42:34] then the q free reward [42:37] spin [42:38] then the q free reward [42:42] center then the queue [42:45] free reward [42:47] heal [42:48] then the queue [42:51] free [42:52] a little early on the free there then [42:53] reward [42:54] down [42:55] then the queue free reward stand [42:59] on the queue free reward [43:01] sit then the queue [43:03] free reward [43:05] sit [43:06] q [43:07] three reward you see how it's separated [43:11] if you had a timeline you'd see the [43:13] command down [43:15] then you'd see the physical key would be [43:16] next then the marker free and then the [43:19] reward so each one is separated what [43:22] most people do the most common mistake [43:24] is people pair they're physical with [43:26] their verbal they pair the command and [43:28] motivate they go [43:29] down [43:30] right [43:31] and then they say free and they reward [43:33] at the exact same time we want to make [43:35] sure that we separate it because if we [43:37] do it incorrectly it still almost looks [43:39] like we're doing it correct so for [43:41] example this is incorrect [43:44] climb [43:45] free [43:48] off [43:49] free and that's what most people do [43:52] b [43:53] all right [43:54] so i'm going to go back to doing it [43:56] correctly [43:57] down two three reward [44:00] set [44:01] cue free reward [44:04] spin cue [44:06] free reward [44:08] sit cue [44:11] heel [44:11] cue [44:15] free reward [44:16] climb [44:17] q and remember i'm not worried about [44:19] perfect precision since it's service dog [44:21] training not competition obedience off [44:24] cue [44:25] free reward [44:27] center cue [44:30] free reward [44:31] down [44:32] cue free reward [44:38] set [44:39] cue [44:40] free reward good girl [44:43] spin cue [44:45] free reward [44:47] climb [44:48] cue [44:52] and that's [44:54] how i do a basic obedience training [44:56] exercise with my dog once i get it to [44:59] the point where they know the markers [45:01] they know the behaviors we want them to [45:02] perform off of the physical cue [45:05] and then we're ready to name the command [45:06] and again command motivate mark reward i [45:09] can't stress that enough it has to go in [45:10] that order all right so that's going to [45:12] be what you guys want to do and again [45:14] you want to continue doing this until it [45:16] gets to the point where we say the [45:17] command climb look the dog went to the [45:20] climb command without having to guide [45:22] them to that position then we know we [45:24] have that behavior on the verbal command [45:27] and that's very important if you want to [45:28] get your dogs if you want to get your [45:29] dogs to perform the behavior on the [45:32] verbal command alone so i hope you guys [45:34] like the video make sure you leave a [45:35] comment and i'll see you guys on the [45:37] next one [45:38] [Music] ================================================== CONTENU DE:

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 304/468,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] there's different skills that you want [00:02] to develop before getting into the real [00:04] training with your dog what I mean is [00:06] really teaching them their SID they're [00:08] down there come a lot of those basic [00:09] obedience commands that you want your [00:11] dog to know there are certain skill sets [00:12] we want to develop one is going to be [00:14] luring luring is where the dog will [00:17] follow food that you have in your hand [00:19] and you can use that to guide them into [00:22] different positions [00:24] wherever the nose goes the butt does the [00:26] opposite so if you lift up and the dog's [00:28] nose goes up but goes down you got the [00:31] dog to do a sit you bring your food to [00:33] the ground the dog lays down you bring [00:36] the food to the dog's chest the nose [00:37] goes to the chest the butt pops up you [00:40] guide the dog in a circle you can [00:42] manipulate the dog into almost any [00:44] position using this technique using [00:46] Laurine and when we first start off [00:49] doing this all I want the dog to do is [00:51] to push into my hand so if I'm holding [00:53] food the dog is pushing into my hand in [00:55] order to get the reward once I feel them [00:57] push I say yes and I release the food [00:59] they push it in my hand yes release [01:02] making sure that the food or my hand [01:04] doesn't release the food or the food [01:06] isn't rewarded to the dog until after I [01:08] say yes so it's yes then I release yes [01:11] then I release so dog is pushing into my [01:13] hand yes release dog is pushing it in my [01:15] hand yes [01:16] release okay that's gonna be the first [01:18] step and then I can use Lorene again to [01:20] teach behaviors I want them to perform [01:21] and chasing chasing is using food so [01:25] we're gonna use our food drive and we're [01:28] gonna use our prey drive to make the [01:30] training more fun and more engaging if [01:32] my dog doesn't behave that I like and [01:35] they're coming for the food if I cut [01:36] back very quickly a lot of praise and [01:38] encouragement the dog runs back to get [01:40] the food it's gonna make it more fun [01:42] more entertaining so I really make them [01:43] chase that food and I'll throw that in [01:45] there to kind of get them more amped up [01:47] and more excited about the training and [01:50] I'm gonna show you exactly how to teach [01:51] both of these Laurine all we're gonna do [01:54] for that is we're gonna take the food [01:56] we're gonna place it in our hand and [01:58] when I place food in my hand I like to [02:00] use my thumb to hold it in position [02:02] instead of holding it at my fingertips [02:04] and the reason for this is it creates a [02:08] little valley for my puppy if he's [02:10] interested in my [02:11] instead of the sticks on the ground so [02:16] creates a little valley for him to stick [02:18] his muzzle in to grab the food without [02:21] biting my hands go boy okay so that's [02:25] how we're gonna want to hold the food [02:26] and all Laureen is when we're teaching [02:28] our dog how to lure we let them push [02:30] into our hand yes and when he pushes [02:32] into our hand nicely yes good yes I'm [02:39] gonna mark the behavior and I'm gonna [02:41] reward yes good job buddy [02:44] all I want him to do during the step yes [02:48] is push into my hand yes good now he's [02:53] actually it's hard to tell in the video [02:54] but he's actually pushing my hand and [02:58] when my hand moves I'm marking and [03:00] rewarding yes good boy nice job my [03:05] little Mia all right we'll do a couple [03:08] more yes very good [03:11] yes excellent yes very nice okay so [03:17] that's gonna be luring and this is gonna [03:19] be a tool that we're gonna use to help [03:21] us teach many of the other behaviors [03:23] we're gonna be showing our dog the next [03:26] thing I like to do is teach the dog the [03:28] concept of chasing all we're doing is [03:30] we're getting our dog or puppy to chase [03:32] the toy so we're gonna be using a couple [03:34] different drives we're gonna be using [03:35] prey drive by creating that movement [03:38] we're also going to be using food drive [03:41] since the dog is going for food derby [03:44] buddy come on buddy buddy buddy good boy [03:47] so for this I'm gonna use my terminal [03:49] marker and I'm gonna play a little [03:51] chasing game free nice job you see I [03:56] picks up a little bit of the energy good [03:57] boy and then again if he comes for it I [04:01] cut back really quick good boy nice job [04:05] any way that I can move it away very [04:09] quick to get him bouncy get him a little [04:12] bit more playful and get him more [04:14] engaged so he's not as focused on all [04:16] these sticks on the ground good boy [04:19] nicely done so chasing again I'm just [04:22] cutting it boom really quick getting the [04:25] dog to run towards me in order to get [04:28] that toy and this is where we're gonna [04:30] use to make the training more fun to [04:32] make it more playful the more your dog [04:35] enjoys training the faster they're gonna [04:37] learn so we want to make it as fun as [04:38] possible especially when you're working [04:41] with a young puppy like Derby [04:42] [Music] ================================================== CONTENU DE:

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 309/468,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] we always want to make sure when we're [00:01] working with our dog that we keep it fun [00:03] and we make it really exciting for them [00:05] and a great way to do this is by [00:07] implementing what's called power ups [00:08] power ups are exercises that the dog [00:11] enjoys and you kind of use it to [00:13] separate some of the exercises that may [00:15] not be as fun for the dog there's three [00:17] that I like to use one is going to be [00:19] called hand touch the other one is the [00:21] spin command and lastly as the through [00:24] command and I'm going to show you each [00:26] one so the first one will keep it simple [00:27] to start off with the hand touch is [00:30] where your dog is going to jump up and [00:31] it's gonna touch your hand or your dog's [00:33] gonna touch your hand and what you want [00:35] to do is you want to take a piece of [00:36] your food and I'll just place it in [00:38] between my fingers basically wherever [00:41] you want it to be for your dog to jump [00:43] up and get it when I first do it I'm [00:45] just gonna show my dog where it is and [00:47] I'm gonna reload and let my dog take the [00:50] food whoa do that one more time I'm [00:53] gonna reload let my dog take the food [00:56] reload let my dog take the food and I [01:00] want my dog to know where that food is [01:02] and then what I'm gonna do is I'm simply [01:05] gonna use my terminal marker free and [01:08] let her come grab the food and we can [01:10] switch our hands to so I can place it in [01:11] this one free she comes over and grabs [01:14] it free and I'm using free because [01:18] sherry knows that word she knows that [01:20] that means to come get her reward so I'm [01:23] using something she already knows free [01:25] to teach her something new free so you [01:31] can see now she's starting to go and get [01:32] the reward from my hand the next step is [01:34] I'm gonna want to start naming this [01:36] command and this goes pretty quickly [01:38] because it's a simple command if you [01:40] want you can add a little bit more so [01:42] often what I like to do as well is I [01:43] like to teach the dog to jump up free [01:45] good girl so she tried getting it she [01:48] didn't quite get it but she put in the [01:50] effort I'm gonna do it again right here [01:56] so you can see this is gonna get her to [01:58] jump up to get the food out of my hand [02:01] good girl she's starting to get the game [02:04] I'm not even having to use the terminal [02:06] marker anymore she's just jumping up for [02:08] the reward good girl [02:12] and you want your dog to touch the hand [02:14] that's the main thing here you can see [02:16] she started to get she's getting a [02:18] little sloppy and going for my arm but [02:19] I'm not gonna give her the reward until [02:21] she gets to the hand then I'm gonna give [02:23] her the reward now that I have her [02:24] jumping up to get the food from my hand [02:26] now I'm gonna take the food out of my [02:28] hand what she touches my hand that's [02:30] what I'm gonna use my terminal marker [02:32] and then I'm gonna reward her from the [02:33] opposite hand so just like this free so [02:41] she didn't touch it there free free good [02:46] girl free very nice free good and since [02:56] she's doing it so nicely now I can go [02:58] ahead and I can name that command so I'm [03:00] gonna say touch and then I'm gonna bring [03:03] my hand out presenting the same picture [03:05] that she saw before [03:06] touch touch free good girl touch free [03:13] very nice touch free so it's almost like [03:18] you're high-fiving your dog touch so [03:23] that's gonna be the hand touch again [03:24] it's a fun exercise that you can use to [03:27] break up some of the commands that may [03:29] not be as exciting for the dog the next [03:32] one's gonna be the spin command and what [03:34] we want to do with that is we want to [03:36] take it guide the dog in a circle I [03:37] always go counterclockwise and the [03:40] reason why I go counterclockwise is [03:42] because when I have my dog in heel [03:44] position I can spin them outwards from [03:47] heel position spin it gives them an [03:50] opportunity to spin outwards and that's [03:53] really if I'm using this let's say I'm [03:55] doing some focused healing I can say [03:57] spin my dog spins jumps back into [04:00] position touch my dog can jump up and [04:03] touch my hand and go right back in the [04:05] heel and it makes the training a little [04:07] bit more fun and we always want to make [04:09] sure [04:09] that our training is fun for our dog so [04:12] spin is pretty simple we get the cue [04:14] once our dog starts to do that behavior [04:17] then we're gonna go ahead and we're [04:18] gonna name it so we say spin then we [04:22] give our dog the physical cue and you [04:23] can see she's doing the behavior before [04:26] I give her the physical cue and that's [04:27] because she understands the spin command [04:30] and if anybody is ever wondering when do [04:33] we know when to stop giving the dog the [04:34] physical cue well you know when your dog [04:37] is beating you to the behavior so I say [04:39] spin and before I even am able to give [04:42] her the physical cue she's already [04:44] performing the behavior so that's gonna [04:45] be the spin and you can use that if you [04:47] have your dog doing a sit or a down or [04:48] something like that you might throw a [04:50] spin in there your dog does a spin and [04:52] then you're able to release her and have [04:54] some fun makes it a little bit more [04:55] engaging now the next one is gonna be [04:58] the through command so when I do the [05:00] through command I like to get my dog in [05:02] front of me and then I have food in both [05:04] hand both hands and then what I'm gonna [05:07] do is I'm gonna guide my dog through my [05:08] legs and then I'm gonna reward with the [05:10] opposite hand on the other side so I'm [05:13] just using food in the hand that I'm [05:15] guiding my dog through just a guider she [05:18] didn't get the food that was in my right [05:19] hand there so I'm using the food in each [05:23] hand as a guide so if I'm gonna take my [05:25] left hand I wanna guide her through my [05:27] legs and then I bring her to my right [05:29] hand she only had the food or she only [05:30] received the food that was in my right [05:33] hand if I'm using my right hand to guide [05:35] her through and then I take her to my [05:37] left hand then she only received the [05:38] food that was in my left hand so we have [05:41] food in both hands but our dog is only [05:43] receiving the reward in the last hand [05:46] that we use so a guy we reward him a [05:49] guide and then we reward okay and this [05:52] is gonna be the through command so then [05:54] when we go to name it I like to call it [05:55] through we say through and then we got [05:57] our dog through what I like to do is I [05:59] like to save through that I step my leg [06:01] out as I guide so the leg becomes part [06:04] of that cue as well through good girl [06:08] very nice [06:09] through so whichever side I'm going [06:12] through that one was sloppy I messed up [06:16] it's okay it's not always gonna be [06:18] perfect through good so now she's [06:21] starting to get it and let's see if I [06:24] can do without guiding her with the food [06:25] through brief good through free good [06:34] spin touch through free and it's a great [06:42] way to have fun with your dog and to use [06:44] those to make sure that your training is [06:46] always interesting and exciting and that [06:48] will ensure that your dog learns faster [06:53] the power-ups remember these are going [06:55] to be fun exercises to break away from [06:59] some of the more basic obedience [07:02] behaviors that we ask our dog to do to [07:04] set it down that's cool but it's not as [07:06] fun as these power-ups as power-ups are [07:08] supposed to get the dog motivated and [07:10] it's supposed to make the training a [07:11] little bit more exciting so the first [07:13] one's gonna be a spin when we teach the [07:16] spin we want the dog to go [07:17] counterclockwise and the reason for this [07:20] is eventually it's gonna transition when [07:23] the dog is in heel positions and if you [07:26] have a dog spinning inwards that's gonna [07:29] be more difficult all right so we want [07:32] the dog to spin counterclockwise so we [07:35] show the dog our physical cue and once [07:38] we know we can get them to do the [07:40] behavior we're gonna go ahead and name [07:42] it spin and you can see he already knows [07:45] this one spin then the cube yes spin yes [07:52] so you can see he knows it I can start [07:54] to incorporate this in the trunk all [07:56] right so he knows a spin and now the [07:58] next one he just did it again [08:01] the next one's gonna be the hand touch [08:03] when teaching the hand touch all I'm [08:05] gonna do is I'm gonna place food in my [08:06] hand so I usually place it on the center [08:09] and I'm just gonna show the dog how to [08:11] get access to that food freebie yes once [08:20] the dog knows that there's usually food [08:23] in my hand then I'm gonna reward the dog [08:25] with my opposite E so I'm gonna bring my [08:27] hand out yes yes yes yes what so he's [08:38] not getting food anymore there's no food [08:40] here yes he just knows I touch and it [08:43] makes me say yes which means he's going [08:44] to get a piece of food yes and as they [08:47] get better you can add height to it yes [08:49] good boy yes yes [08:56] nice that's gonna be the hand touch the [08:58] next one is the through command so with [09:01] the through I'm gonna keep food in both [09:02] hands and I'm gonna guide the dog [09:04] through my legs to the other side yes [09:06] and I'm gonna reward with the secondary [09:09] hand so if I'm using my right hand to [09:11] guide my dog through even though there's [09:13] food there he doesn't get any from that [09:14] he gets it from the hand that he [09:16] finishes on same thing if I guide this [09:18] way he's not getting any of the left [09:19] hand then he gets the right hand okay so [09:22] what I like to do is I like to step my [09:24] leg over to the side as I guide the dog [09:27] through to give the dog a little bit of [09:28] a physical cue even if I'm not using [09:30] food so again yes yes yes yes and then [09:43] when I know the dog can do that I can go [09:44] ahead and I can aim it through yes good [09:50] job through yes through yes very nice [09:59] through yes through yes sir yes and [10:11] you're gonna keep doing this until you [10:12] can say through and your dog runs [10:15] through he's not there yet but that's [10:18] okay [10:19] so your dogs not gonna be there right [10:21] away either all right so the power ups [10:23] yes yes again that's how I can do in the [10:31] heel position yes [10:35] spin then the cube yes spin yes [10:42] spin spin [10:48] yes very nice and then let's do the [10:52] touch as well good boy [11:02] so now that he has the pattern yes yes [11:09] good you see how simple it is a huge dog [11:13] yes yes yes yeah yes yes good job I can [11:30] work a little more for it [11:31] yes yes and then touch yes touch yes [11:45] Hiro touch yes good boy everybody got [11:56] him through yes through yes very nice [12:04] through yes yes [12:15] [Music] ================================================== CONTENU DE:

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 312/468,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] today I'm working with Elvis this is [00:01] episode two of his basic obedience you [00:04] can see how much he's progressed from [00:05] episode 1 and how our training is going [00:08] to adjust to keep up with his [00:10] progression so let's go ahead and jump [00:12] right into it all right so we start with [00:16] the climb command and you can see I said [00:18] climb and he ran ahead of me in order to [00:20] jump on that platform that shows us that [00:22] he's starting to understand the verbal [00:24] command of climb and he doesn't need the [00:26] physical cue as much as he needed before [00:28] this is also going to give us the [00:29] opportunity to start spacing out our [00:32] rewards remember in the beginning when [00:34] you start training your dog you're using [00:35] continual reinforcement you're rewarding [00:38] every single behavior but as your dog [00:40] gets better then you can start to space [00:42] out the rewards and you're gonna see me [00:44] do that in this video also when we're [00:46] spacing out our rewards we like to give [00:48] the dog verbal feedback in the earliest [00:50] stages [00:51] meaning when I start to no longer give [00:54] them a reward for every behavior I'm not [00:55] just going to start telling him commands [00:57] and not rewarding him him at all I'm [00:59] gonna give him some sort of verbal [01:00] feedback I'm a little know a good job [01:02] you're on the right track keep it up and [01:03] then after he does a couple commands [01:05] then I'm going to mark and reward come [01:11] so right there he was doing a nice climb [01:13] stay and then we're jumping right into a [01:16] cone one called I like to wait till the [01:18] dog is sitting directly in front of me [01:20] in order to mark and reward that [01:22] behavior but you can't call a dog to you [01:24] and jump right into a new command if you [01:26] like [01:32] down there we go another great example [01:36] of Elvis showing us he's starting to [01:39] learn these commands I told him down I [01:42] did not have to give him a physical cue [01:44] I did not have to lure him into the down [01:45] position I did not have to use a leash [01:47] pressure he laid right down on his own [01:49] again showing us that he's studying to [01:51] understand the commands on the verbal [01:53] alone and that's really what we want [01:56] free so we use it on the marker their [02:00] spit free right there I did a spin [02:04] command spin command doesn't really have [02:06] too much to do with obedience but what [02:08] it does do is it kind of breaks up the [02:10] training a little bit and it makes it [02:11] more fun this is known as a powerup I [02:14] posted a video about these the other day [02:15] this is one out of three that I like to [02:18] use and it's very easy to teach a dog [02:20] and again most dogs enjoy it most dogs [02:22] have fun with it and it makes the [02:24] training more enjoyable for the dog [02:26] which again makes the dog more engaged [02:28] and therefore they learn more quickly [02:40] okay right there this is a perfect [02:43] example of what you need to do if you [02:44] give your dog a command and they don't [02:46] do the behavior right away notice a [02:48] couple things what I did not repeat the [02:51] command I said sit [02:52] he didn't sit right away and I went [02:54] right into applying leash pressure which [02:56] is one of his physical cues to get him [02:58] to sit and I simply waited till he did [03:00] the behavior once he did the behavior I [03:02] let him know that he was correct I [03:04] released the pressure on the leash and [03:06] we go right back into training try not [03:08] to get into the bad habit of repeating [03:10] the command so saying it multiple times [03:11] or not following through if you're using [03:15] formal command sit down come heel any [03:18] one of those if you give your dog a [03:19] command make sure you follow through [03:21] remember dogs are creatures of habit if [03:23] you make them perform the behavior every [03:25] single time you give them the the [03:27] command then that's going to become [03:29] their default you peel them a command [03:30] and they do it so make sure you always [03:32] follow through if you give your dog a [03:33] formal command yes I'm also starting to [03:44] incorporate the heel command for Elvis [03:46] not just walking in heel position but [03:49] finding the heel position heel is a [03:52] position in which the dog needs to [03:55] maintain if I'm not moving the dog needs [03:57] to be on my left side sitting next to me [04:00] if I'm walk-in the dog must walk and [04:02] maintain that same position it's always [04:04] important to define what commands we are [04:06] asking our dogs to do and when we have a [04:08] clear definition it makes it easier for [04:10] us to get the dog to understand what we [04:12] want so when I'm teaching a dog to find [04:14] a position I give them the command and [04:16] then I use my luring with the food and I [04:19] guide them into that position once [04:20] they're in the position I mark and I [04:22] reward yes yes [04:29] okay what I'm doing right now is I'm [04:32] having him maintain heel position [04:33] looking up at me because this is now a [04:35] heel stay and I'm using my continuation [04:38] marker marking the behavior rewarding [04:40] him letting him know this is correct [04:42] hold this position and I'm gonna keep [04:44] paying you for that down okay you notice [04:51] right there I said down and then I lured [04:54] him into the down position I didn't wait [04:56] for him to do it on his own and the [04:59] reason for this is because Elvis likes [05:01] to turn and face me when I give him the [05:03] down command so if I was just to give [05:05] him the down command and I did not help [05:07] him with the luring he probably would [05:09] have turned his body laid down and [05:10] looked up at me which really isn't that [05:12] big of a deal when it comes to basic [05:14] obedience but I do like a dog to go [05:16] straight into the down position when I [05:18] give him the command so that's why I'm [05:20] still using Lorene to help him when he [05:23] is in heel position going into the down [05:25] command dogs are very situational if [05:28] your dog learns to lay down only when [05:30] he's directly in front of you then [05:32] that's where he's going to want to be [05:34] when you ask him to down if you're far [05:36] away and you tell him down he's gonna [05:37] come close to you if he's in heel [05:39] position you tell him down he might turn [05:41] and face you to lay down so we have to [05:43] show him the commands in each position [05:45] we want the dog to perform [05:52] okay right there he broke the position I [05:55] said one no and I placed him back into [05:57] the position remember this is how we [05:58] start teaching our dog stay we give him [06:01] the command once they're in the position [06:02] we can use the continuation marker yes [06:04] Lydia no they did it correctly and [06:05] they're going to get a reward or we [06:07] don't have to say anything or we give [06:08] them verbal feedback verbal praise like [06:10] good job that's what I wanted you to do [06:12] but you're gonna have to stay in that [06:13] position without having to stay stay if [06:16] the dog breaks the position we say one [06:18] no then we take the leash we use the [06:20] leash pressure and we place the dog back [06:22] into the position what this does is it [06:24] teaches our dogs what they need to do [06:26] when we say no often we say no and we [06:29] want our dogs to either stop what [06:31] they're doing or to go back into the [06:32] previous position but we don't teach [06:34] them how to do that and when we use this [06:37] technique we say no when we use the [06:38] leash pressure to put them back in that [06:40] position it teaches them exactly that so [06:43] when we say no our dogs will [06:44] self-correct [06:45] by either stopping what they're doing or [06:47] going back into that previous position [06:49] and again that's exactly what we want [06:51] them to do so that's what I did right [06:53] there [06:54] [Music] [06:57] yes [07:01] okay right here I'm having him maintain [07:04] the down-stay and I'm using the [07:06] continuation marker to give him feedback [07:08] without releasing him from the position [07:10] so instead of walking away and saying [07:12] stay stay a bunch of times I simply walk [07:14] away if he breaks just like earlier we [07:16] would say one no and put him back in the [07:18] position but right now I want to give [07:20] him feedback let him know he's doing it [07:21] correctly by walking around saying yes [07:23] coming back and rewarding him another [07:25] important note is that I say yes before [07:28] I start to walk back to the dog any time [07:31] we're using verbal remember the power of [07:32] the verbal comes from what it predicts [07:35] so the yes means I'm going to come [07:37] reward him if I start walking towards [07:39] him he's gonna start thinking here comes [07:41] the reward and if I say yes as I'm [07:43] walking towards him then he's not really [07:45] going to pick up that yes or that marker [07:47] so look at it the same as changing lands [07:49] while you're driving you turn on your [07:52] signal then you change lanes we say yes [07:55] then we go and reward our dog [07:59] yes [08:03] you can also tell that these condition [08:05] to the marketers because when I used the [08:07] marker he gets excited you can see his [08:09] tail starting to wag he knows he's about [08:10] to receive a reward and again this helps [08:13] us with that communication to clearly [08:15] and effectively let our dogs know what [08:16] it is we want [08:17] remember dog training is really about [08:19] being able to communicate with our dogs [08:21] in a timely manner when they're right [08:23] and when they're wrong and giving them a [08:24] clear path to success [08:28] No okay right there another great [08:32] example of him making a mistake and [08:34] jumping off of the climb I asked him to [08:36] go into the climb I did not use the [08:38] terminal marker so I did not say free [08:39] and I did not release him from the [08:40] position so he broke the climb state by [08:43] jumping off and you can see I say one [08:44] note and I place him back onto the climb [08:57] yes [08:59] and there we go I said yes and then I [09:01] turn to walk back to them and I gave him [09:03] a reward [09:03] oh all right here we go I gave him the [09:08] off command off command is something [09:11] really important to teach especially if [09:12] you're teaching your dog a climb or a [09:14] place and I highly recommend teaching a [09:16] climber place command it's a command [09:18] you'll love once you really get it down [09:20] in your dog is able to perform at any [09:21] time because it gives you a place to put [09:23] your dog without having to worry about [09:25] them maybe if you're in the kitchen and [09:27] you're cooking a meal or something like [09:28] that [09:29] you don't want your dog on in the [09:31] kitchen while you're cooking so you can [09:32] put them on a climb command and when we [09:34] teach them the climb command we always [09:36] want to teach them the opposite so [09:37] coming off of the climb command and this [09:39] is something that I also use for my own [09:41] dogs if maybe they jump on some [09:43] furniture that I don't want them to jump [09:44] on I have a clear command that tells [09:46] them I don't want you on here go ahead [09:48] and jump off go to your bed or something [09:50] like that so it's really important to [09:52] teach an off commander yes [10:04] come great okay with the come one called [10:10] you notice how I bring my hands to the [10:12] center of my body because I want the dog [10:14] to come in center I talked about this [10:16] before on one of my other videos reward [10:18] placement if I brought my hand down to [10:21] either side to reward on my right side [10:22] of my left side then that's going to [10:24] become the default position that he goes [10:25] to so by making sure my hands come [10:28] Center that gets him to come and center [10:30] and sit directly in front of me [10:45] you [10:50] right there we're doing another heel [10:52] command also notice with the heel [10:56] command I am guiding the dog by stepping [10:58] back with my left foot [10:59] using the luring or that power steering [11:02] guiding him around in the heel position [11:03] once he gets into heel position that's [11:05] when I'm marking reward he doesn't get [11:07] any of the food when I'm luring him into [11:09] the position until he finishes what it [11:11] is that I'm asking for or until after I [11:14] say yes sometimes I will mark and reward [11:17] a behavior for the dog putting in effort [11:19] sometimes if we have dogs that have [11:21] lower levels of perseverance then they [11:24] might give up before they get to that [11:26] completed position and if that's the [11:27] case I'm gonna reward the dog for [11:29] putting an effort I'm gonna let them [11:30] know if you keep working you're going to [11:32] eventually get the reward and then as [11:35] they get better then we can get it to [11:36] the point where they're getting all the [11:38] way into the actual position we want [11:40] them to perform so keep that in mind yes [11:45] I'm also teaching him to maintain the [11:48] heel position so as he's sitting there [11:50] I'm using the continuation Margaret yes [11:52] reward yes reward letting him know I [11:54] want you to stay in this position this [11:56] is where you need to be and if you [11:58] continue to do this I will pay you for [12:00] it [12:05] No okay you may have noticed that he was [12:09] already in the sick command when I said [12:11] sit the reason why I did that instead of [12:13] staying a new word such as stay I simply [12:16] use a command of the dog our buddy knows [12:18] which is sit so I say sit and then I [12:20] walk away basically letting him know I [12:23] want you to stay in this position even [12:25] though we were just doing heal now I [12:27] want you to do a sit stay now he got a [12:29] little bit confused he got up so I [12:31] placed him back into the sit no big deal [12:34] and we move forward with the training so [12:36] if I am leavin a dog in a position [12:37] instead of saying stay I simply repeat [12:40] the command that I want the dog to be in [12:52] yes again you can see I spin him around [12:55] into heel position once he's in the [12:58] position mark and reward this is an [13:01] exercise that I call solidifying the [13:04] heel position I put the dog in heel [13:06] position I reward him for it I repeat [13:08] the sit command I step away then I [13:11] called them back into heel position [13:12] again from different angles and [13:14] different positions around the dog and [13:18] this gets him to really understanding of [13:20] how to find heal from any given position [13:25] you made a mistake there no big deal say [13:29] one no use the leash pressure to guide [13:30] him back in that up position and there [13:39] we go another heel notice when we're [13:42] giving him the heel command we are [13:44] having his head come around and in we [13:46] want it to come in words not outwards [13:48] because a dog will always find the [13:50] quickest way from point A to point B and [13:52] if we have their head spin inwards then [13:54] what ends up happening is if they're [13:56] sitting directly in front of you and you [13:58] tell them healed their back end will [14:00] simply turn and they will go directly [14:01] into heel position and this is something [14:05] that we want the dog to do this is known [14:06] as a flip finish not as important in [14:09] basic obedience but [14:10] is something that people really like [14:12] their dogs to be able to do in [14:13] competition obedience and it is really [14:15] cool if you get into that point where [14:16] your dog simply flips into heel position [14:18] yeah no okay so you notice he struggled [14:29] a little bit there no big deal we stay [14:31] calm we help him out if we need to once [14:33] he's in the position we mark and reward [14:35] also during the early stages of training [14:37] if you're still in the first month or so [14:40] working with your dog we want to always [14:42] give them that opportunity or the [14:43] ability to make mistakes and try again [14:46] so if they make a mistake we're not [14:47] going to punish them for making a [14:49] mistake but rather we're gonna say that [14:51] was incorrect but let me show you what [14:53] is correct this is going to help [14:55] increase their confidence and it's going [14:58] to speed up their learning process climb [15:03] and again right there I'm using verbal [15:05] praise so I let him know good job this [15:07] is what I want you to do make mistakes [15:09] you came off of the climb so I said one [15:11] no and I use my body language to [15:14] communicate to him that I wanted him to [15:15] go back to the climb oh alright so right [15:21] there I give them the off command he [15:22] didn't come off right away [15:23] so remember anytime we're giving our [15:26] dogs a command we want to follow through [15:27] we don't want to repeat the command a [15:29] bunch of times so now I just walk over [15:31] to him I use the leash pressure right [15:32] get them off of the climb and then I let [15:34] him know good job [15:41] so again he's not going into the sit [15:44] right away so we're going to use that [15:45] physical cue and we're gonna wait till [15:47] he performs it correctly if you are [15:49] using leash pressure remember that two [15:51] important rules when implementing leash [15:53] pressure number one once that pressure [15:55] is turned on it cannot be turned off [15:57] until the dog complies and number two [15:58] once the dog complies the pressure must [16:00] immediately be turned off he'll a little [16:09] bit more of the heel command yes okay [16:13] right there you may have noticed that [16:15] once he came close to heel position I [16:17] stepped into his heel position this is [16:21] something that I'm not really going to [16:22] worry about too much when I'm working [16:23] with a pet pet obedience but if you [16:26] aren't doing competition obedience this [16:28] is not something you want to do you [16:29] don't want to guide the dog in to heel [16:31] the dog doesn't go directly into heel [16:33] and simply adjust yourself into the [16:35] dog's heel position if I was doing this [16:38] with a dog that I wanted to compete with [16:40] precision obedience then I would have [16:42] simply used the food guided the dog into [16:45] my heel position without adjusting into [16:48] the dog's heel position so keep that in [16:49] mind if you do want more precision level [16:52] obedience yeah yes [16:57] heel all right so on that last one and I [17:02] like to do this when I'm really getting [17:04] a dog to understand maintaining the heel [17:06] position also coming into a sit when we [17:08] stop by I like a dog to have an [17:10] automatic sit when halted so what I did [17:12] right there was I said heel then my hand [17:15] came up guiding the dog as I walked [17:17] guiding the dog into a sit and then [17:19] rewarding him for that I want the dog if [17:22] I'm saying heeling the food comes up in [17:24] front of the dog's face what ends up [17:25] happening after enough of these you say [17:27] heel and boom your dog looks up at you [17:29] as you're walking and this can help [17:31] develop a focus heel but it also helps [17:33] the dog really pay attention to the [17:35] position that they're in if you have a [17:37] dog that is one of those dogs that tends [17:40] to get distracted often on a walk what's [17:42] that over there is that a squirrel I [17:44] want to pee on this rock whatever it is [17:45] if you have to the dog focusing on you [17:49] and focusing on maintaining heel [17:50] position they're not able to do all [17:52] those other behaviors you may not want [17:54] them to do such as barking that dog was [17:56] I chasing squirrels things like that so [17:57] dogs cannot multitask so if we make them [18:00] focus on one thing they're not able to [18:01] focus on something else and I like to do [18:03] that when I'm working on the heel [18:04] command yes down now this time instead [18:10] of using the food you can see I tried [18:12] doing the leash pressure and with the [18:14] leash pressure he's starting to curve [18:15] out a little bit as he goes to lay down [18:17] instead of going straight down the way [18:19] that I would prefer again not a big deal [18:22] if they do that if you want to fix [18:24] something like that it's always better [18:25] just to go back a step and rework what [18:28] it is you want them to do come sit down [18:38] good right there I just gave him a few [18:41] commands come sit down he performed all [18:43] of them then I gave him the terminal [18:45] marker releasing him and then giving him [18:47] a reward [19:08] [Music] [19:19] there we go another one commander and [19:21] you can give the dog to heal the man [19:23] from a distance because remember heel is [19:24] a position yes heel yes down right [19:38] they're not started to get up so one no [19:40] play some background position and go [19:42] right back in the drain okay so what [19:50] happened there I gave them a sick [19:52] command but I gave him the command from [19:53] a distance when we start giving our dogs [19:55] commands from different positions it [19:58] changes what it is we're asking them to [20:00] do in the dog's mind if I always teach [20:02] my dog sit and down and stand or [20:05] whatever the commands I want them to [20:06] perform when they're directly in front [20:08] of me when I give them a command they're [20:10] going to want to seek out that same [20:11] position before they perform the command [20:13] or they may even get confused because [20:15] they're not in that position when you [20:16] ask them to do the command so if you [20:18] want to start giving your dog's command [20:20] from a distance you have to start [20:22] teaching them so I can implement my [20:24] physical cue the same way I did before [20:26] by walking towards a dog to give the [20:28] physical cue just like I did right here [20:31] I said six then I started to walk [20:33] towards him I used the Laurine I gave [20:35] him a little bit of coaching like come [20:37] on buddy you can do it he sits up by [20:38] mark and reward if I really want a dog [20:40] to understand commands from a distance [20:42] often I'll use a climb or a place to [20:45] have the dog maintain a position while [20:47] I'm giving them commands or we can also [20:49] have a training partner who helps us [20:52] with it and I have other videos on that [20:54] as well but we have to teach them that [20:57] the commands are implemented from any [21:00] position by showing them how to perform [21:02] those behaviors from those positions by [21:04] implementing the physical cue so don't [21:07] get discouraged if your dog knows [21:08] sitting down when they're directly in [21:10] front of you but you say down from a [21:11] distance and they don't perform it you [21:12] have to teach them that climb [21:21] right there I had him go in a different [21:24] platform for the climb I'd like to get a [21:26] dog generalized to obedience commands [21:28] and what that means is they understand [21:30] it in any position so if I took him to a [21:33] new location and I said climb even [21:35] though his climb vent is not at that new [21:37] location if there was another climb bed [21:39] or some other elevated platform he would [21:41] still jump up on that platform and [21:43] perform that behavior and we have to get [21:45] a dog generalized to commands and each [21:47] dog is going to be a little bit [21:48] different but on average usually around [21:50] 8 or 9 of a given let's say the climb [21:54] command eight or nine different climb [21:56] platforms you teach them to perform on [21:58] all those now he's generalized and [22:00] anytime you tell them to climb on [22:01] elevated platform he's going to go ahead [22:03] and do it same thing with locations [22:05] eight different locations before the dog [22:06] performs perfectly in every single [22:09] location so just keep that in mind when [22:11] you're working with your dog if you only [22:13] train your dog in your living room and [22:15] then you take your dog outside and your [22:17] dogs not performing the behaviors right [22:18] away it's because they're not [22:19] generalized to the training you have to [22:21] work with them in multiple locations for [22:23] the dog to understand ok these commands [22:25] apply everywhere yes [22:35] right there you broke the position when [22:37] I said yes he got excited a no can [22:39] override a yes so if you tell your dog [22:42] yes and you're going to reward them and [22:44] they break the position don't reward [22:46] them because then you'll be rewarding [22:47] them for breaking the position instead [22:49] you say no you fix the mistake and then [22:52] you can go ahead and reward them so [23:13] right there I dropped a piece of food he [23:15] tried going for the food and I did not [23:17] allow him to get access to it if you [23:19] have a leash and you are working with [23:20] your dog and you drop some food and they [23:22] go for it it's good to stop them and not [23:24] allowing them to pick up the food [23:25] because they've become a really big [23:27] distraction you'll have a dog who's [23:29] constantly checking the ground to see if [23:30] they can find some free food now there's [23:32] going to be times where you drop food [23:34] and you don't have a leash in your hand [23:35] and the dog picks it up off the ground [23:37] it's not the end of the world but it is [23:38] a really good practice to do your best [23:41] not to allow your dog to pick up food [23:43] from the ground yes [23:52] yes sit down come on down [24:10] right there was something very subtle [24:12] you may have caught it or you may not [24:14] have caught it he did a bunch of [24:15] commands without any help with the [24:17] physical cue he's doing it really nicely [24:18] then I tell him down and I noticed that [24:21] he wasn't picking it up really the way [24:24] that I wanted him to so I used a [24:26] physical cue to help give him a little [24:29] bit of guidance and I did that simply by [24:32] step in my left leg forward towards his [24:35] leash because one of the things I'll do [24:36] if the leash is dragging on the ground [24:37] and I tell the dog to down I'll step on [24:40] the leash and I'll slide my foot back [24:41] which will give the dog a little bit of [24:43] a cue and they'll go into the down [24:45] command and that's what I did right [24:46] there in order to help him out a little [24:47] bit yes [25:11] and there we go there's a great training [25:14] session if you can shoot for one or two [25:17] training sessions every day with your [25:18] dog you'll be ahead of most people and [25:20] the sessions don't have to be long 10 to [25:23] 15 minutes is perfect and even if you're [25:25] only getting one session a day or even [25:27] one session every other day if you stay [25:29] consistent you're going to get really [25:31] nice results and you're going to have a [25:32] really nice obedient dog I hope you guys [25:35] enjoyed this video please subscribe to [25:37] my channel and if you want to see this

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 317/468,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] I want to take a moment and quickly [00:01] explain my dominoes analogy and this is [00:04] gonna help you with all your training a [00:07] lot of times when somebody gives our dog [00:09] command if the dog isn't doing the [00:11] command right away they end up repeating [00:13] the command so they'll say sit there [00:15] trying to cue the dog to go into the sit [00:17] position the dog is not going into the [00:19] sit position and they say sit again that [00:21] extra sit really isn't necessary and [00:24] this is the easiest way to know how this [00:27] works imagine you have a line of [00:28] dominoes and the command comes before we [00:32] hit the first Domino so we say sit then [00:35] we bump the Domino's or we push them [00:37] over right after we say sit now the [00:39] Domino's falling is what's representing [00:42] the physical cue whether you were using [00:44] luring or we are using leash pressure [00:46] and we know that the very last Domino is [00:49] going to fall over which is going to be [00:51] the dog completing the behavior as long [00:54] as nothing or no one interferes with the [00:56] Domino's as they're falling over very [00:59] last one falls over that's the dog doing [01:01] the behavior we made the connection okay [01:04] so it doesn't matter how long it takes [01:05] because it's a sequence of events and [01:07] the dogs able to put that together so if [01:09] I say sit and I go to lift the leash and [01:12] for some reason my dog decides to be [01:14] stubborn it doesn't matter if I sit [01:16] there for three minutes as long as [01:17] there's still tension on the leash then [01:19] the dog sits I turned the pressure off [01:21] they know that once it predicted the [01:23] entire sequence so we don't have to [01:25] repeat commands one command then the [01:28] physical cue okay and we're gonna do [01:30] this throughout the entire training so [01:31] really try your best not to give [01:34] multiple commands for your dog to [01:35] perform one behavior [01:37] [Music] ================================================== CONTENU DE: 2020-01-17_The_Power_of_Training_Your_Dog_with_FOOD__Episode_15.

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 321/468,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] once we have our dog's condition to our [00:02] markers we want to start showing them [00:03] the behaviors we want them to perform [00:05] far too often somebody gets a dog and [00:08] before they even have an opportunity to [00:10] start communicating with their dog they [00:12] start asking their dog to sit you [00:14] probably done it yourself you have your [00:15] dog in front of you and what do you do [00:16] you go sit sit sit sit sit sit sit sit [00:19] sit sit sit sit and finally because your [00:22] dog is looking up at you they sit down [00:24] and you think you taught your dog the [00:26] command sit what you really did was you [00:29] got your dog to look at you because you [00:31] made a bunch of sound one of the things [00:32] we want to do is we want to make sure we [00:34] are communicating as clearly as possible [00:36] dog training is being able to [00:38] effectively communicate with our dogs in [00:40] a timely manner verbally so now that I [00:43] have the dog condition to the markers I [00:45] want to start teaching the behaviors [00:47] I want our dog to perform or the puppy [00:49] that we're working with we're gonna do a [00:51] couple basic ones right now and then I'm [00:53] gonna show you a couple fun little [00:54] exercises that you can do that'll [00:56] encourage your dog to want to perform [00:57] the behaviors but also do them with a [01:00] little bit of speed so I'm gonna [01:02] demonstrate with Derby here Derby what [01:06] I'm gonna use the technique that I'm [01:08] gonna use to start showing Derby the [01:10] behaviors I want him to perform is the [01:12] lowering technique so remember where the [01:14] head goes the body will follow what I'm [01:17] gonna do is I'm gonna take the food I'm [01:19] gonna lift up free once his butt hits [01:23] the ground I'm gonna say his terminal [01:25] marker free so notice imagine there's a [01:29] button on your dog's button when it hits [01:31] the ground deliver the reward when I'm [01:36] first showing a dog behavior I like to [01:38] use a terminal marker more often than [01:41] the continuation marker for two very [01:43] important reasons one right now we're [01:45] not ready to start teaching this day and [01:47] number two if the dog learns the faster [01:50] I get into the position the faster I get [01:52] to jump up and get my reward our dogs [01:54] are going to perform the behaviors more [01:56] quickly and it becomes fun for the dog [01:58] so again I'm gonna take him show him the [02:00] food he's getting a little distracted [02:02] which is gonna happen with a puppy and [02:04] we're gonna lift up free and then reward [02:07] good boy and I'm gonna do the same thing [02:09] with the [02:09] down I'm gonna use my terminal marker [02:12] free but I'm not gonna have him jump up [02:15] for it I'm just gonna have him going to [02:17] the position free deliver the reward [02:20] good boy nice job buddy position free [02:25] and then reward now during this step or [02:29] this portion of the training we're not [02:31] giving the dog any commands free all I'm [02:34] doing is I'm simply showing him a [02:37] physical cue that gets him to perform [02:40] the behavior free and then I'm [02:42] delivering a reward and it doesn't [02:44] matter what it is that I'm teaching my [02:46] dog free I often like to teach my dogs [02:51] how to come into heel position free free [02:59] so you see I'm helping him get in the [03:03] positions I wanted to be in free by [03:07] using our luring technique free boy and [03:14] when you're working with your dog - [03:15] don't be afraid to give him a bunch of [03:16] verbal praise let him know he's doing a [03:19] good job and in the very beginning [03:20] remember we're using continual [03:22] reinforcement we're rewarding every [03:25] correct behavior that our dog performs [03:31] we want to make sure we switch our [03:33] hands-free very nice I don't recommend [03:39] naming a command until you love it when [03:44] your dog is performing it the way [03:45] exactly the way you want them to perform [03:47] it free that's when you're gonna start [03:52] naming it so right now the spin for [03:56] example free is still a little slow very [03:59] puppyish though the same thing with the [04:01] down kind of free it's getting better [04:08] free thus it still takes them a second [04:15] free well you didn't want the reward I'm [04:31] gonna go over in more detail exactly how [04:32] to teach each behavior but the key point [04:35] of this particular video is noting that [04:38] when you're teaching your dog a behavior [04:40] for the first time it doesn't matter [04:42] what it is whatever behavior you're [04:44] trying to teach your dog you want to [04:45] first give them some sort of physical [04:47] cue so let's say for example I wanted to [04:50] teach a dog to ring a bell in order to [04:52] go outside well I have to be able to get [04:55] the dog do that behavior now there are [04:58] certain techniques such as free shaping [04:59] and kick shaping which we're going to [05:01] talk about later in this series but if [05:03] I'm trying to present the physical cue I [05:04] have to think of what do I need to do to [05:07] get my dog or my puppy to ring that Bell [05:10] and I'm gonna give you the answer [05:12] they're hollow so the bells that are on [05:14] the reception's desks at a hotel the [05:17] ones that you ring if we take food and [05:19] we put it underneath that Bell and we [05:21] set that down our dog's gonna pawn it [05:23] once they ring the bell we lift it up [05:25] and we let them get the reward this is [05:27] gonna teach the dog the behavior we want [05:30] them to perform while showing them a [05:32] physical cue quick recap we want to make [05:34] sure that we have a physical cue that [05:36] will get our dog to do the behavior the [05:38] exact way we want them to perform it [05:39] every single time and we want to use our [05:42] terminal marker more often than our [05:44] continuation marker during this step [05:46] since we're not working on our stay yet [05:48] and we want our dogs to learn the faster [05:50] we perform the behavior the fact that we [05:52] get to jump up and get our reward which [05:54] will speed up those commands [05:59] power-steering is going to be a [06:01] technique that we're going to use [06:02] throughout the training when we have our [06:04] food cups in our hand just when we start [06:07] to turn our hand the dog will start to [06:09] pivot if we teach them this concept the [06:12] way that I like to teach this at first [06:13] is I'll get the dog or the young puppy [06:15] directly in front of me I'm gonna hold [06:17] the food in my hand and I'm going to [06:18] start to pivot my body and I want my [06:20] dog's back in to shift over to the side [06:22] the moment my dog shifts over to the [06:24] side I'm gonna say yes and give them a [06:26] piece of food and I'm gonna continue to [06:27] turn and I want to be able to pivot in [06:29] place while my dog circles around really [06:32] kind of developing that rear-end [06:33] awareness and getting them to go into [06:35] these positions this is going to help [06:38] because then I'm gonna be able to use [06:39] this power steering to guide my dog in [06:41] to heal to guide my dog into the center [06:43] position to guide my dog into all the [06:46] different positions that I want them to [06:47] be in it's easy to teach super important [06:51] and it's gonna play a big role in our [06:52] training throughout this entire series [06:54] let me show you how to teach this want [06:55] to start developing our power steering [06:57] so what I'm gonna do and my puppies [07:00] starting to get a little tired but [07:02] that's okay we can still work with it [07:03] first go back into just the lure and get [07:05] him to follow the food and getting his [07:07] head to turn back and forth to his left [07:11] side as well as to his right side all [07:14] right once we have that what we're gonna [07:16] do is we're gonna grab the food and [07:18] we're gonna cut it in both our hands and [07:19] all I'm gonna do is place it up against [07:22] my leg and I'm gonna pivot around yes [07:24] and when he steps in the direction that [07:26] I want him to go yes I'm gonna mark and [07:30] reward and I'm gonna go back the other [07:31] way yes good so you see by turning it [07:39] makes it easier for him to pivot around [07:42] his back end in order to get access to [07:44] the food and this is all I'm really [07:46] doing I'm just holding the food and I'm [07:48] spinning yes in a circle to get him to [07:53] follow the food and this is gonna help [07:55] when I start using this to go around the [07:58] cones to guide them into different [08:00] positions [08:01] it's just that power steering same thing [08:04] if I have them over in the heel position [08:05] I'm gonna cut my hand and then I'm gonna [08:09] pivot around with him right there [08:11] and this is gonna help yes with our left [08:15] about turns are right about turns and [08:18] I'm giving them food pretty much the [08:20] whole time but it's just getting him [08:23] used to really pushing into that hand [08:25] getting that lawyering technique down [08:28] but developing it so well that you can [08:30] literally guide your dog into any [08:33] position using that power steering [08:40] technique [08:43] power steering wheel Charlie here [08:44] remember we want a guide first get their [08:47] head kind of moving back and forth good [08:56] very nice and when I say yes is when I'm [09:00] giving him the reward so you guys know [09:02] when yes yes and then we're gonna get [09:11] him to pivot in place yes yes yes very [09:19] nice yes excellent yes good now that [09:31] he's doing that nicely I want to start [09:32] getting him to pivot in position just [09:35] using the one hand yes good boy and I [09:38] can also use that pivoting in place come [09:41] buddy very nice good boy pivoting to the [09:48] right as well when we're doing this [09:55] power steering is gonna help us later [09:57] with our right about turn our left about [10:01] turns and our flip finishing by finish [10:04] okay so he did great that was a nice [10:06] nice little session [10:37] [Music] ================================================== CONTENU DE:

pressures [00:04] probably one of the most effective tools [00:06] you can use when training your dog not [00:09] only will it speed up the train but [00:11] it'll also make you communicate more [00:13] clearly and effectively with your dog [00:15] believe it or not most people actually [00:17] teach their dogs to pull on the leash [00:19] and they reward their dogs for that we [00:21] reward our dogs often for things we [00:23] don't want them to do but we don't [00:25] realize that we're rewarding the dog for [00:27] those bad behaviors and I'm gonna give [00:29] you example let's say you take your dog [00:31] out on a walk and your dog wants to move [00:33] in a certain direction so your dog pulls [00:34] in that direction and what do you do you [00:37] follow behind your dog and you allow [00:39] your dog to pull you in that direction [00:40] you have just rewarded the dog for [00:42] pulling on the leash and then we wonder [00:44] why it's difficult to stop the dog from [00:46] pulling on the leash in this video I'm [00:48] going to show you guys how you're gonna [00:49] teach leash pressure and how you're [00:51] going to implement it we're going to use [00:52] leash pressure to teach multiple [00:54] behaviors such as sit down calmed he'll [00:56] go to your bed we're gonna use this to [00:59] teach stay and we're also going to use [01:01] this to teach our dogs to walk nicely on [01:03] a loose leash so let's go ahead and jump [01:06] right into it so I'm gonna take a little [01:08] Derby here I have the leash and again [01:11] you're gonna see that I'm gonna pull in [01:12] a straight line and I have food in my [01:14] hand as well so I'm gonna start to pull [01:16] free and then I'm gonna reward I'm gonna [01:19] pull free [01:20] see how he's starting to follow the [01:22] leash free good boy excellent work my [01:25] man freak and now I'm not even applying [01:28] pressure he's just following it free [01:30] good boy this is a smart dog golden [01:32] retrievers free are usually really smart [01:35] so you see him applying pressure free [01:37] and he's just falling it so he's doing [01:39] great [01:40] free that's what I want and you also [01:42] when you're implementing this technique [01:44] you want your dog if they're paying [01:47] attention to be able to avoid the [01:48] pressure entirely I don't want to just [01:50] pull really quick not giving him an [01:52] opportunity to avoid the pressure I want [01:54] to start slow free so if he follows it [01:57] he's able free to avoid that pressure [02:01] and that's very important so now I'm [02:03] gonna do this sit so what I want to do [02:04] is I want to help him with the food but [02:06] I'm gonna lift up a little bit so [02:08] there's the pressure and that pressure [02:09] needs to stay until he puts his butt [02:11] down [02:12] shouldn't be so hard that you're choking [02:15] the dog it should be just enough that he [02:16] feels it so you can see he's still able [02:18] to smell the ground and kind of look [02:20] around I just wanted to feel a little [02:22] bit of pressure so now I'm gonna help [02:23] him with the food by lifting up he puts [02:26] his butt down I turn the pressure off [02:27] and I give him a piece of food I'm gonna [02:29] encourage him to come forward free and [02:31] I'm gonna reward take the pressure lift [02:33] up then help with the food he puts his [02:36] butt down free and then I reward good [02:42] boy [02:43] nice job if you do this correctly free [02:46] it shouldn't be that stressful of an [02:49] exercise for your dog it's a mildly [02:50] stressful but it shouldn't be a very [02:53] stressful at all so here's the pressure [02:54] then the food pressures turned off food [02:58] is delivered [02:59] remember pressure must come first [03:01] pressure first then the food free then [03:05] the reward [03:06] so you see pressures turned off oops I [03:09] mean pressures turned on and then once [03:12] he complies the pressures turned off so [03:15] here we go again I lift up and he's [03:17] starting to get it already free good boy [03:20] just a good job on you me that's a good [03:23] job so again I'm gonna lift up I'm gonna [03:27] help him with the food free good boy [03:32] good boy and if I want I can even throw [03:35] in some of that chasing that we talked [03:37] about before everybody so again pressure [03:41] freak good good job get a little bit of [03:46] that bounce some of that puppy energy [03:48] there's the pressure let's lift up free [03:52] good boy and I want to continue to do [03:55] this until it's almost impossible for me [03:59] to make that leash tight because my dog [04:01] is so engaged and so focused right now [04:02] he's distracted and that's gonna happen [04:04] with puppies but you're gonna see as [04:06] they become more involved with the [04:07] training they start to enjoy it a little [04:09] bit more they start to understand it [04:10] more you're gonna get more and more [04:12] engagement so here's the pressure here's [04:15] the food free reward good job buddy [04:20] pressure [04:23] food-free nice work little man nice [04:29] pressure food-free good boy that's a go [04:38] boy again pressure free so that one I [04:42] didn't even need to use the food [04:44] pressure food free haha so he's starting [04:50] to get it there's the pressure free very [04:54] nice give him a little kiss he's doing [04:57] good [04:58] free boy so you see he's really starting [05:02] free he's really starting to get it now [05:05] once I have him at that point then I [05:07] want to start doing the pressure into [05:09] the down but I want to make it [05:10] comfortable so what I'm gonna do is I'm [05:12] gonna place him on the climb bed here [05:14] guiding him with the leash and I'm gonna [05:17] get down at his level when I first do [05:19] this exercise with a dog I like to be at [05:21] their level because I want to I want to [05:24] alleviate as much pressure as possible [05:26] contrary to popular belief it's not [05:29] about being the alpha it's not about [05:31] dominating your dog take all that stuff [05:34] that you've heard before throw it out [05:36] the window we're working with our dog [05:38] together on the same team we're on a [05:41] team right now and I'm helping him and [05:43] I'm trying to communicate with him as [05:44] effectively as possible I'm not trying [05:46] to dominate him so what I'm gonna do we [05:49] got a helicopter in the background so [05:52] what I'm gonna do here I lay down I'm [05:55] gonna bring them back up right so I'm [05:56] gonna use the technique to bring them up [05:58] good he came up so I'm gonna reward him [06:00] now I'm gonna do the pressure downwards [06:02] so there's the pressure downwards same [06:04] thing as the sit it's slow steady [06:06] pressure I can help him with the food [06:08] free and then reward okay I'm gonna [06:12] bring him back up help him with the food [06:14] free reward pressure goes down free so [06:18] he's starting to do it he's doing really [06:20] well we can even get a little bit of a [06:21] close-up so you can guys can see what's [06:23] going on here [06:24] and all I'm doing is I'm slowly gonna [06:26] bring up the leash he feels the pressure [06:28] then the food comes remember [06:30] predictability pressure is predicting [06:32] food so then pressure is not stressful [06:35] pressure become something the dog enjoys [06:37] pressure goes down food goes down and [06:40] then we'll be reward again pressure goes [06:42] up food goes up he does the behavior he [06:47] gets the treatment pressure goes down Oh [06:50] big man he lays down I'm gonna give him [06:53] that reward the next one and that's [06:56] gonna happen when you train your puppy [06:57] sometimes puppies and dogs rather get [07:00] the food in their stomach then chew it [07:02] properly before swallowing so that [07:03] happens so to get a little pressure [07:05] going up [07:06] pay attention big man and then the food [07:09] goes up free then reward again pressure [07:14] goes down nice and slow free and then [07:17] reward good boy pressure goes up free [07:20] he's doing really well [07:21] pressure goes down I'm gonna see if you [07:25] can do this one without the help of the [07:26] food free good boy [07:30] let's try the sit without the help of [07:31] the food sometimes when I'm doing the [07:34] sit he coughed up another piece [07:35] sometimes when I'm doing the sit without [07:37] the help of the food I'm gonna help with [07:38] my body language a little bit so I'm [07:40] gonna stand up I could even do a little [07:43] bit of encouragement come on come in [07:51] free good job very nice very nice he's a [07:57] really good smart puppy again pressure [07:59] down nice and slowly free good boy and [08:03] then we're gonna take them back up nice [08:05] slow steady pressure come on buddy come [08:08] on [08:09] I'm helping them with the food this time [08:11] free good now I'm gonna do a little bit [08:15] more but kind of all over the place I'm [08:16] gonna guide them off free reward him [08:19] there I'm gonna guide them into the sit [08:21] again free reward him there guide him [08:24] back onto the bed free reward him there [08:28] and something I'd like to get them [08:30] comfortable with as well is using my [08:33] foot to apply pressure on the leash and [08:35] this is so I don't have to bend over so [08:37] much if I'm working larger dogs or older [08:39] dogs so I'm gonna take my foot and I'm [08:41] gonna do slow pressure nice and easy [08:43] same as if I was using my hand [08:45] and then I'm gonna help with the food [08:47] once they lay down free reward I'm gonna [08:51] bring him back up she did it on his own [08:52] beautiful bring my foot up again nice [08:54] and slow slow steady pressure and doing [08:59] slow movements in the beginning with any [09:02] sort of exercise that involves all [09:04] free with any sort of exercise that [09:07] involves pressure it's gonna help the [09:09] dog out because again we want to [09:10] minimize the stress come on buddy [09:13] and help him back up and be patient with [09:19] this exercise [09:20] don't rush if we want to take our time [09:22] we want to make sure he's getting tired [09:25] let's bring them back up good and then [09:28] again I'm gonna do my foot bring the [09:30] foot up slow steady pressure and then [09:34] reward very nice good boy [09:37] so we're gonna keep working on this and [09:38] again we want to get it to the point [09:40] where we can guide our dog into any [09:42] position with using basically no [09:44] pressure on the leash because the dog [09:46] understands the concept of following the [09:49] leash into each position whether you're [09:51] guiding them into a sit a down come heel [09:54] you can use a leash to help guide your [09:56] dog communicate with them as clearly as [09:58] possible and make the training very [10:00] smooth and easy for them to understand [10:02] [Music] ==================================================

Below is a simple step-by-step process, involving a crate that's just big enough for the dog to stand up, spin around, and lay down (and not any larger). This will allow the dog to learn to hold their bladder. Depending on the age of the dog, we have to consider how long they can hold their bladders. A young pup at a couple of months old should stay crated for a couple of hours. This time frame can become longer the older the dog is. After the time in the crate, the puppy is taken out and given a chance to go potty. If they successfully go potty, the dog should be rewarded, perhaps taken on a walk. We try to reinforce that the bathroom break leads to more fun activities. If the puppy doesn't go, then he or she is brought back to the crate. We wait 20 minutes, then repeat the process. The important factor is to make the dog associate going outside with going potty, and that it's something to look forward to. If the puppy happens to go inside the house, you don't need to rush at it with punishment behavior. You simply say ""no,"" take the pup outside, and reward with positive reinforcement after they go potty correctly. If the puppy has gone potty in the house, but you did not catch them in the act, then do NOT correct them."

Note: if your puppy goes potty inside their potty-training crate, then it's your fault. Dogs do not go potty where they sleep or eat unless they simply can't hold it.

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 329/468,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] a question that I'm commonly asked is [00:01] how do I buy a train my dog and it's [00:03] much easier than you may think if you [00:05] follow these proven steps step number [00:07] one you're going to have to create train [00:09] your dog [00:10] now crate training a dog is not just [00:12] about getting a dog comfortable in a [00:13] crate but rather using it as a tool to [00:16] teach the dog what behaviors are [00:18] acceptable inside the house and what [00:20] behaviors are not acceptable inside the [00:22] house when we create train our dogs we [00:24] do want to keep in mind predictability [00:26] and pattern recognition often people [00:29] will create anxiety and their dogs by [00:32] placing their dog in the crate only when [00:34] they leave the house and if you do that [00:36] your dog is going to start to learn and [00:38] recognize this pattern and when you put [00:40] them in the crate they're going to [00:42] become anxious and stressed out with [00:44] that being said you want to put your dog [00:46] in and out of the crate randomly [00:48] throughout the day even when you're at [00:50] the house so you don't create that [00:52] anxiety through that recognised pattern [00:54] that your dog will certainly pick up [00:56] next you want to make sure that the [00:58] crate is just big enough for the dog to [01:00] stand up turn around and lay down the [01:02] reason for this is dogs do not like to [01:04] go to the bathroom where they eat or [01:06] where they sleep when I'm potty training [01:08] a dog I teach the dog that I'm going to [01:10] feed them whether I'm giving them a bone [01:12] or an actual meal inside their crate and [01:14] that's where they're going to sleep in [01:15] the beginning we do this because it [01:17] teaches the dogs to hold their bladder [01:19] now a simple rule of thumb to follow [01:21] when it comes to keeping a dog in a [01:24] crate or puppy in a crate for a certain [01:26] period of time if the puppy is three [01:29] months of age I do not keep them in the [01:31] crate for longer than three hours yes [01:33] that means you have to get up at night [01:34] to potty your puppy if there are four [01:36] months of age four hours five months [01:38] five hours up until eight months of age [01:40] and I do not like to exceed eight hours [01:43] of a dog being in a crate and that's [01:44] going to be at night when you're [01:46] sleeping if you still have to create [01:47] your dog at night lastly when your dog [01:50] is fully potty trained the crate can be [01:53] as big as you like in fact the crate [01:55] could be as big as your house meaning [01:57] you no longer need a crate it is just [01:59] there in the beginning to teach the dog [02:01] how to hold their bladder now once we [02:04] have the dog comfortable going in and [02:06] out of the crate then the next thing [02:08] you're going to want to do is show the [02:09] dog or the puppy [02:11] exactly where you would like them to go [02:12] to the bathroom and this is the process [02:14] you're going to want to follow what [02:16] you're going to do is you're going to [02:18] take your puppy or your dog out of the [02:19] crate and you're going to put them on a [02:21] leash and then you're going to take them [02:22] outside exactly where you would like [02:24] them to go to the bathroom you're going [02:26] to say if you would like a command to go [02:28] to the bathroom such as go potty or do [02:30] your business then you're going to set [02:32] the puppy down or you're going to give [02:34] your dog an opportunity to go to the [02:35] bathroom [02:36] you wait three minutes if your dog or [02:38] puppy goes to the bathroom within those [02:40] three minutes you praise them you let [02:42] them know great work and then you do [02:44] something that the dog enjoys again this [02:47] goes back to pattern recognition if you [02:50] take your puppy or your dog outside and [02:51] go to the bathroom and the moment they [02:53] go to the bathroom you take them inside [02:54] then they learn when they go to the [02:56] bathroom they go inside so they will [02:58] hold it when they're outside and this is [03:00] when you have a dog that stays outside [03:02] for a long time because it knows once it [03:05] goes to the bathroom you're going to [03:06] take them inside so in order to make [03:09] sure you don't make this mistake when [03:11] they go to the bathroom you do something [03:13] that the puppy or the dog enjoys such as [03:15] playing fetch taking the dog on a walk [03:18] whatever it is that that dog enjoys [03:20] statue you're going to do and it doesn't [03:21] have to be for a long time [03:22] five minutes will be just fine then you [03:25] take the puppy back inside or the dog [03:27] now they can run around and play inside [03:28] the house as long as you have eyes on [03:30] now if the dog does not go to the [03:32] bathroom within those three minutes if [03:34] it's a puppy you pick them up you walk [03:37] them back inside you place them back in [03:39] the crate if it's a dog you simply walk [03:41] them in and you put them in the crate [03:42] and you wait 20 minutes after 20 minutes [03:45] you repeat the process if they go to the [03:47] bathroom you go back to what I said [03:49] earlier if they do not you take them [03:51] back inside you put them in the crate [03:53] and you repeat the process until they go [03:55] to the bathroom this is going to show [03:57] them first of all a command go to the [04:00] bathroom or go potty and it's gonna [04:02] teach them the faster they go to the [04:03] bathroom the faster they get to have fun [04:05] and play outside and it's going to speed [04:08] up the process now what we want to do is [04:10] we want to set the dog up for failure [04:12] I said dogs up for success so I can [04:15] reward them the exact moment there [04:17] doing it correctly but I also set them [04:19] up for failure so I can correct them the [04:21] exact moment they make the mistake and I [04:23] can show them exactly what it is that I [04:26] would like them to do every time i [04:28] potty-trained a dog my own personal dogs [04:30] are other people's dogs they go inside [04:32] the house one time and the reason for [04:35] this is because I set them up to fail [04:37] the way that I do that in the morning [04:39] when I know they have to go to the [04:40] bathroom I take them out of the crate [04:42] and I set them somewhere where it's [04:44] going to be an easy cleanup some sort of [04:46] hard surface and I wait till they go to [04:48] the bathroom inside the house the moment [04:50] they go to the bathroom I say one note [04:52] and I take the dog outside once the dog [04:54] goes to the bathroom outside I praise I [04:57] reward them and then we go back into our [04:59] normal routine doing this is going to [05:02] clearly show your dog that you do not [05:04] want them going to the bathroom inside [05:06] the house and your dog will quickly [05:08] learn that the best place to go to the [05:09] bathroom is going to be outside if you [05:12] do this correctly you will quickly find [05:14] out that potty training your dog is much [05:17] easier than you ever thought and it's [05:20] really not a secret you just follow the [05:21] process and you'll get the results thank [05:24] you guys for watching please subscribe [05:26] to

Remember, you must say the name of the command and then show your dog the physical signal. A common mistake that most people make is when they decide to name the command, they will say the command while they are giving the dog the physical cue. If you pair your physical with your verbal, the physical will override the verbal and become the cue for the behavior.

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 339/468,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] all right in today's video we're gonna [00:01] be teaching our dogs to sit command I [00:03] know this is a very simple command but [00:06] I'm gonna show you how you can teach it [00:07] to where it's going to be very easy for [00:09] your dog to understand and to learn [00:11] we're gonna be using two different [00:13] techniques to teach our dogs this [00:14] command one is going to be using the [00:17] concept of Lori remember whatever the [00:19] nose goes the butt does the opposite so [00:21] if you take food and you lift that food [00:23] up and your dog looks at that food their [00:26] butt will naturally go down and we can [00:28] use this to teach our dog the behavior [00:30] another technique we're gonna be using [00:32] is leaf pressure [00:33] I do recommend using both techniques [00:36] because we are going to use leash [00:37] pressure down the road when we start [00:40] teaching the stay command now step one [00:43] when we're teaching a command is we want [00:45] to make sure our dogs know the markers [00:46] the continuation and the terminal marker [00:49] my continuation marker is yes my [00:51] terminal marker is free you can use any [00:53] words you like for yours then we want to [00:56] make sure that we have shaped the [00:57] behaviors that we want them to perform [00:59] remember before we name a command we [01:01] want to make sure we can get the dog to [01:02] do the behavior every single time off of [01:05] a physical cue so for the lauren that's [01:07] gonna be lifting up dog's nose goes up [01:09] butt goes down for the least pressure [01:11] when we lift up ever so slightly and the [01:13] dog sees that tension as your hand lifts [01:15] up or they feel that tension they go [01:17] into the sit then we can go ahead and [01:19] name it now another thing you want to [01:21] keep in mind when you're not saying the [01:23] name of the command you don't have to [01:25] worry about reinforcing the stay as [01:28] they're gonna see when we start teaching [01:29] the stay I don't use the word stay but [01:33] rather when I place a dog in a commanded [01:35] position so if I tell the dog sit and I [01:38] use either the continuation marker so [01:40] for me yes or I don't say anything at [01:43] all or I use verbal praise good job then [01:46] the dog is in a stay it is implied when [01:49] I say sit so if I don't want to worry [01:51] about the stay when I start naming the [01:53] command then I'm gonna use the terminal [01:55] marker so if I say sit and I'm not ready [01:58] for the stay yet I'll use my terminal [02:00] marker free and the dog could jump up [02:02] and get the reward also keep in mind [02:04] when we use the terminal marker the dog [02:06] will learn the faster they do the [02:07] the faster they get to jump up and get [02:10] the reward and they're gonna enjoy the [02:12] training way more and because of that [02:14] they're gonna sit very very quickly [02:17] speed is based on motivation so the more [02:20] motivated your dog is the faster they're [02:22] going to perform these behaviors we're [02:24] gonna use that to speed up the commands [02:26] when we first start teaching the dog the [02:27] behaviors alright so let's go ahead jump [02:30] right into it and I'm gonna show you [02:31] guys how I'm going to do this okay here [02:33] we go teaching the sick command we take [02:35] some food in our hand we lift up free [02:38] but hit the ground we use that terminal [02:40] marker and we reward the puppy free okay [02:44] we can use the terminal marker if we [02:46] like and now remember during this step [02:48] when we're shaping the behavior we don't [02:50] have to always use a terminal free if we [02:54] don't want to because we're not giving [02:56] the dog a verbal command [02:57] there's no verbal command so that means [02:59] we're not reinforcing the state so if I [03:02] want I can lift up yes and bring it to [03:06] the puppy if I choose rewarding him in [03:09] position yes and he's allowed to get up [03:14] from that position because I have not [03:15] said sit okay so now I'm gonna go ahead [03:19] and I'm gonna name it sit free good I [03:24] want to use the terminal marker now [03:25] though because I'm naming the command [03:27] free right good boy come on buddy [03:33] sit free again command sit then lift [03:39] free then movement and then eventually [03:42] sit up if you don't drop the food don't [03:46] want to pick it up off the ground I'd [03:49] rather pick it up for them and give it [03:51] to them so they don't think they could [03:52] just get it off the ground whenever they [03:53] want sit free and he's starting to show [03:58] me that he knows the command sit free [04:01] perfect excellent now we're gonna do it [04:05] with the leash pressure okay so all I'm [04:07] gonna do is lift up free then reward [04:10] again when we're not saying the name of [04:12] the command if we want we can use our [04:14] continuation marker yes and bring it to [04:17] the dog [04:19] try not to drop too much food Oh [04:22] pressure up free then reward pressure up [04:27] free and reward pressure up free then [04:31] reward good boy and then we can go ahead [04:33] and name it sit then lift free then [04:36] movement sit [04:38] then lift free then move sit free [04:44] excellent so now we have them performing [04:47] the set using reward base and pressure [04:51] based training [04:55] remember what we want to do is we lift [04:56] up when the butt hits the ground we're [04:57] gonna use our terminal marker free free [05:04] free free and I'm just shaping the [05:14] behavior right now I'm not naming it [05:16] free [05:16] all right now that I know you perform [05:19] the behavior every single time with the [05:20] physical cue now I'm gonna name it [05:22] remember it goes command motivate mark [05:24] reward sit [05:26] then lift free then move them sit then [05:29] lift free free free sit free I'm giving [05:45] them food after I say free free now you [05:50] can see sit free so he's sitting without [05:56] me having to lift and that shows me that [05:59] he knows the behavior sit sit free when [06:05] I teach a command I like to do a bunch [06:06] foam in a row because it makes it easier [06:08] for the dog to learn sit free free [06:19] pretty simple easy way to teach your dog [06:22] just remember you say the verbal sick [06:24] then you lift free so I'm rewarding him [06:29] say free free [06:38] sit free free free [06:56] okay so she's doing it nice and with the [06:59] physical view and now we're gonna name [07:01] it sit free sit free swishing hands [07:07] free free so you can see sit free she's [07:18] doing it sit free without the physical [07:20] cue free so that shows me that she knows [07:24] that command sit free free very good [07:36] he's doing really nice so I'm gonna go [07:38] ahead sit sit free [08:09] sit sit free so now he's doing it [08:21] without the physical cue sit free very [08:25] nice free need

Remember, you must say the name of the command and then show your dog the physical signal. A common mistake that most people make is when they decide to name the command, they will say the command while they are giving the dog the physical cue. If you pair your physical with your verbal, the physical will override the verbal and become the cue for the behavior. An example of this could be as simple as saying “Good boy” (or the marker that trainers would prefer, “yes”) simultaneously to feeding the dog the reward. By mixing these two actions together, the verbal cue no longer has relevance in the dog’s mind. If we want the dog to learn the verbal command, then it is important to make sure that the verbal precedes the physical by a split second. It must be predictable to the dog. So the process becomes: command, motivate, mark, and reward, in that order. So you say sit, then you lift your hand. Once the dog's butt hits the ground, you mark and then reward."

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 346/468,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] today I'm gonna be showing you guys how [00:01] we're going to teach the down command [00:03] using luring it's gonna be very similar [00:06] to how we started teaching the sick [00:07] command but one of the things you want [00:09] to be aware of is how you bring your [00:11] hand to the ground one of the common [00:13] mistakes that people make is they'll [00:14] bring their hand down to the ground the [00:16] dog is trying to get the food and they [00:18] move their hand away as the dog is [00:20] trying to get the food you want to move [00:22] it straight down and what else I do is I [00:25] create a little cave with my hand by how [00:28] I hold the food so I bring it down to [00:31] see how I'm creating a cave by turning [00:33] my hand the dog's nose has to go [00:36] underneath the palm of my hand in order [00:39] to get to the food which makes him lay [00:41] down just like she's doing so again we [00:44] go straight down yes once she gets into [00:46] position we mark and we reward and right [00:48] now since she's coming back up into the [00:50] scent I could reward that as well yes [00:52] good girl so let's see how it looks like [00:54] get her moving around and I'd like to [00:56] bring my hand straight down yes yes [01:10] [Music] [01:15] for this one I prefer to use yes yes [01:21] because she could jump right up anyways [01:23] if she wants to yes or I can bring her [01:27] get back up into the yes the sit [01:29] position and go right back into the down [01:31] yes when I'm working with a puppy yes I [01:35] like to use mealtime yes as an [01:39] opportunity to train the key things you [01:42] want to keep in mind is once she gets [01:44] into position yes that's what we marked [01:47] the behavior [01:47] I'm watching her elbows touch the ground [01:49] if for some reason the dog's back end [01:52] goes up I'm going to wait to that but [01:53] goes down yes mark and reward now as I [01:57] was saying before the previous video yes [02:02] but the butt won't go down right away [02:04] so what I'll do is I will reward them [02:07] for attempting until that butt goes down [02:09] then I'll give them was left in my hand [02:25] yes and she's figuring this out very [02:28] very quickly smart dog yes you know what [02:32] you're gonna see though the way that you [02:33] handle the food is going to make a [02:35] really big difference on how easy or how [02:39] difficult it is for your dog to figure [02:42] out what it is you want them to perform [02:43] but this is going to be using our luring [02:47] cue to get our dog to go into the down [02:49] command without using the verbal [02:52] we're simply given a physical cue once [02:55] she performs a behavior market we can we [03:02] bring it down to the ground once a lay [03:04] down yes reward or once they lay down [03:08] free then reward okay so we're taking [03:12] the per Covenant some dogs are gonna be [03:14] more challenging than others he's very [03:16] easy but some dogs are gonna have to [03:18] free hold it there a little bit longer [03:21] and be patient with it all right so now [03:24] I know I can get him to go into the down [03:25] position he's looking for food everybody [03:27] I can get him to go into the down [03:29] position with my hand then I'm gonna go [03:32] ahead and name this command down then [03:34] the Q free then reward good boy [03:38] down then the Q free and the reward good [03:43] job buddy buddy down then the Q free [03:47] reward down free hey excellent nice job [03:54] buddy [03:56] down free and the reward he's getting it [04:03] it's not perfect yet okay down then the [04:08] Q free then the reward and we'll keep [04:11] doing it until he's really dropping down [04:13] into position without me and that [04:15] physical cue all right now we're gonna [04:17] do it using the leash pressure [04:19] okay first time I do it I like to get [04:21] down at the dogs level pressure down [04:24] free reward we can go right back up into [04:27] the sit free reward back into the down [04:30] free reward I also like to teach them [04:33] the pressure using my foot so I come up [04:36] with the foot free then reward bring it [04:41] back up free then reward and then we can [04:44] go ahead and name it [04:44] down then the Q free and the reward so [04:49] it's always that command motivate mark [04:51] reward down then the Q free from the [04:55] reward you can see he's beating me to it [04:57] down free excellent good job buddy [05:02] very nice [05:04] down from the queue free then the reward [05:09] excellent [05:10] he's a smart little cookie okay so we're [05:12] gonna keep doing that until our dog's [05:14] going into the position without the use [05:16] of the physical cue so that's gonna be [05:18] our down command using reward-based [05:19] training and pressure based training [05:24] but I'm gonna cut the food and I'm gonna [05:26] bring it down to the ground yes and [05:28] reward and remember when we're using [05:31] we're doing step 2 which is the shaping [05:33] before we name the command it's [05:35] completely okay to use yes instead of [05:38] free and even though he's not staying in [05:40] the position he's allowed to get up [05:43] because I haven't said the actual [05:44] command remember the dog only has to [05:47] stay in the position if we use the [05:50] command doesn't want them to be in so if [05:52] I say down and place them into the down [05:54] then he's in a Down State yes yes and [06:03] since he has a tendency to just jump up [06:05] like this I'm gonna see if I can keep [06:07] him in the position by marking the [06:09] behavior a little bit more quickly and [06:10] doing more reps of him in the position [06:12] once he gets there so what I mean is yes [06:14] yes yes yes yes yes Thanks he has to [06:30] jump up every single time yes yes yes [06:44] yes [06:51] yes yes now I'm working on that duration [06:58] without saying stay well without giving [07:02] him a command I'm just she all know that [07:03] if he stays there so he's not getting [07:05] food right now that's because he has a [07:06] tendency to jump up we have to adjust [07:08] for each dog that we're working with so [07:10] I'm putting them in the position and I'm [07:12] moving my hand away yes [07:14] and then rewarding put them in the [07:16] position moving my hand away [07:28] yes yes yes [07:44] yes yes so now what I'd like to do once [07:53] I know if I bring my hand down the dogs [07:55] gonna drop down into position then I [07:57] want to speed it up so what I do is I'll [07:59] drop my body weight free almost like [08:03] it's a race to get into the position [08:05] free good free cuz I like my dogs to [08:11] drop really quickly when they're going [08:13] into position see if we could do a [08:15] little bit down here [08:18] free free so now that I know he's [08:24] dropping into position I'm gonna go [08:26] ahead and start naming that command so [08:28] say the command first then deliver the [08:30] physical cue mark the behavior and [08:32] reward down free reward down free reward [08:39] down free I'm using my terminal marker [08:43] because I don't want to reinforce the [08:45] stage just yet down okay now you can see [08:48] he's starting to beat me into the [08:49] position down good down free down free [08:57] down free good boy [09:02] down see now he's beating me to it not [09:05] showing me that he's starting to learn [09:07] the command he's starting to understand [09:09] that down means to lay down make sure [09:11] you say the verbal before you do the [09:13] physical cue where you're gonna find [09:15] yourself doing this your entire puppy or [09:18] dog's life down down [09:21] how many of you have done that I'm sure [09:23] a lot of you have you pair your physical [09:25] with your verbal you say down as you [09:27] point point team to get your dog to go [09:30] into it down is completely acceptable [09:31] just make sure you say down before you [09:35] plank so it can become predictable for [09:37] our dog free [09:42] free good free I like the way she drops [09:48] down she just drops her body weight free [09:51] straight into the down position it's [09:53] exactly the way that I wanted to look so [09:55] remember we try to make it like a little [09:56] race down and you see she totally beat [10:00] me to it down free down free down freak [10:09] girl down yes sit free Dan show from [10:22] different angle good girl [10:26] three very nice again that looks the way [10:29] I wanted to look down and then you can [10:32] see she's clearly beating me it speed me [10:34] into the position and that shows me that [10:36] she knows the command down on verbal [10:38] alone don't free very much free [10:57] free very good you go buddy down free [11:04] good [11:05] he's already beating me to it down free [11:12] down free very nice down free weight [11:21] down free down free everybody here oh [11:31] don't worry big guy down free [11:41] [Music]

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 349/468,com/NateSchoemer Thumbnail Photo Credit: Vickey Dickey === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] in today's video we're gonna be teaching [00:01] our dogs that come on called command [00:02] this isn't that difficult of a command [00:04] to teach however it is one of the most [00:06] important commands you want to teach you [00:07] dog before jumping into the actual [00:09] training process I want to cover a [00:11] couple common mistakes that people make [00:13] that can slow down the training process [00:15] remember that concept of predictability [00:17] and pattern recognition this is very [00:20] important to always keep in mind when [00:21] you're training your dogs because [00:23] they're very good at recognizing [00:24] patterns and they're also very [00:26] situational let's say for example you're [00:29] running late for work you call your dog [00:31] to you they're in the backyard and [00:32] you're trying to get them inside and [00:33] your dog chooses not to come to you so [00:35] you find yourself chasing your dog you [00:37] finally catch them you correct them and [00:39] you put them in the crate in that [00:41] situation you taught your dog not to [00:43] come to you because when they finally [00:45] did get to you whether you chase them or [00:47] they came to you it predicted a [00:49] correction again they are very [00:51] situational so in that situation they go [00:54] oh if I come to you I'm gonna get a [00:56] correction so I need to avoid that and [00:58] they will do their best to stay away [00:59] from you [01:00] so remember any time your dog comes to [01:02] you needs to be a good experience but [01:04] here's another situation where you don't [01:07] correct your dog for coming to you [01:08] however it could create avoidance let's [01:11] say you take your dog to the dog park [01:12] for the first time and they're having a [01:14] blast to run around or playing with [01:16] other dogs you call your dog to you your [01:18] dog runs over you hook the leash on them [01:21] and you leave well you just showed your [01:23] dog in that situation if they're running [01:25] around playing having a good time and [01:26] you call them to you you're going to end [01:29] the fun and you're going to leave so [01:31] rather than calling them only when [01:33] you're ready to leave the dog park call [01:35] them randomly while you're there and [01:36] reward them every single time that they [01:38] come to you make it a game so then when [01:40] you do call them they run over and you [01:42] can hook the leash on them and leave and [01:44] it's not going to create that [01:46] recognizable pattern for when they're at [01:48] the dog park that you're only gonna call [01:50] them when it's time to go all right so [01:52] now we're going to jump into the actual [01:53] training there's a step by step process [01:55] that I like to follow when I'm teaching [01:57] a dog to come when called first we're [01:59] gonna start with the backwards follow [02:01] exercise it's a very simple exercise but [02:03] it's gonna help solidify the calm one [02:05] called as well as what's known as this [02:08] from position you could teach your dogs [02:10] a formal as well as an informal version [02:13] of come when called I like to teach my [02:15] dogs both because there's gonna be [02:17] situations where you want to be more [02:18] informal and other situations we are [02:21] going to be worn formal all right so [02:23] let's go ahead and jump right into the [02:25] training ok the backwards follow [02:27] exercise we're first gonna want to do [02:29] come on buddy he's already starting to [02:31] get a little tired I've been working him [02:33] today come on big guy [02:34] good boy there's my informal come when [02:37] called we talked about formal versus [02:39] informal I'm gonna place them into a sit [02:41] directly in front of me so this is gonna [02:44] be yes that sit front position that [02:47] we're gonna work on when we reward we [02:49] want to reward so I'm gonna fix some of [02:52] these bouncing around no big deal yes I [02:55] want to get use that picture looking up [02:57] at me yes and then bring it down so the [03:00] backwards follow exercise if you're [03:02] doing the advanced obedience make sure [03:05] you really get the dog to understand to [03:07] look up at your face but for the basic [03:10] obedience as long as he's looking up in [03:12] my direction I'm pretty happy with that [03:14] so then I'm gonna walk backwards when I [03:16] walk backwards I'm just gonna reward him [03:19] up against my body so I'm just gonna [03:22] walk backwards he's gonna follow me and [03:25] as he takes the steps I'm gonna reward [03:28] him along the way [03:29] good boy come on buddy nice job we could [03:33] pivot around and go back and forth and [03:35] then as we stop we lift up yes so they [03:40] sit and then we go back into the [03:42] backwards follow exercise make sure you [03:44] don't trip over your climb bed good so [03:50] we continue to walk backwards continue [03:53] to walk backwards we rewarding our dog [03:54] and then again when we stop we try to [03:57] keep them nice straight and centered [03:58] slowly lift up and then reward this is [04:01] going to be the start of our come when [04:04] called now when we first want to start [04:07] naming it we put our dog in the sit [04:09] position and we say come and then we go [04:12] right back into the backwards follow [04:14] exercise and always stopping the [04:16] backwards follow exercise by bringing [04:18] our dog back into a sit [04:20] so then we can take a little step back [04:22] hands down come cue the dog good nice [04:26] job getting used to walking with the [04:28] leash attached to unless you're training [04:30] inside but a lot of times I like to have [04:32] the lease just in case I need it again [04:35] we stop we lift up yes [04:38] reward a little a little bit more [04:41] distance come then the cue so that's [04:45] very nice [04:46] excellent my little man come up what he [04:48] don't get distracted [04:49] none of that adt kicking in and then [04:52] again we stop [04:53] lift up yes reward build a little more [04:56] distance come then the cute go ahead so [05:01] you see everything has the exact same [05:03] process right we teach the physical then [05:07] we name it build a little more distance [05:09] come then the cue good boy and if you're [05:15] doing competitive obedience this is [05:18] gonna be the same so if you're working [05:19] with a young German Shepherd or Dutch [05:21] Shepherd or Malinois or something like [05:23] that we can place them into the position [05:26] call them to us come sometimes I might [05:29] move a little faster if I want to [05:31] increase the dog speed free good nice [05:35] job buddy [05:37] nice job place them back into the sit [05:40] build a little bit of distance I notice [05:43] I'm not using the actual sit command [05:46] we're just using physical cues at this [05:48] part but then the command for the cone [05:49] so any break said it's not a big deal [05:51] come down the cute good boy and you're [05:55] gonna quickly see that you will say calm [05:57] and your dog is gonna start running [05:59] directly to you to get into that sit [06:02] front position in order to get that [06:04] reward and we just keep doing and we [06:06] start to make our physical cue less and [06:08] less as we call the dog when they start [06:10] to understand it then I start I may use [06:13] the physical cue if I think the dog [06:14] needs it so if I'm walking backwards or [06:17] rather if I'm standing there and I say [06:19] come and my dog starts to come to me and [06:21] I noticed my dog looks like she or he is [06:23] gonna go to the right side of the left [06:24] side I might adjust and help them right [06:27] or I might call them and just do a [06:29] little bit of a cue but we want to get [06:31] to the point where we can call our dog [06:32] just [06:33] and there and they'll come directly into [06:35] the sit front position if you do this [06:37] correctly you'll be able to get to that [06:39] point in your training now let me show [06:42] you how to do this with the leash [06:44] pressure so very similar we're gonna [06:46] take our dog and swing our dog around [06:48] place our dog into the sit get at the [06:51] end of our leash come and then we're [06:54] gonna guide our dog with the leash good [06:55] boy that and where we want them yes and [06:58] then reward and you can determine you [07:01] get to determine the level of precision [07:05] with your obedience if you're just doing [07:07] basic pet training so again come I can [07:10] guide him with the leash and I can [07:11] reward him come my buddy chew your food [07:14] little man I could just reward him when [07:16] he comes to me whatever you want the end [07:18] picture to look like some people are ok [07:20] with the dog just running into their [07:22] area so you match whatever it is that [07:24] you want from your dog okay so again we [07:27] place them into this sit and I'm just [07:29] using the leash very similar to how we [07:31] did it using the reward based training [07:33] keep my hands down come then I got my [07:37] dog good boy yes [07:41] I'm then reward sit as I step away come [07:50] [Music] [07:52] yes that's gonna be how we're going to [07:57] teach the come when called climb using [08:01] reward-based training or pressure based [08:04] training both of them work use the one [08:07] that works best for you and your dog [08:11] yes yes yes yes and then stop rift yes [08:22] and then once we know that we have the [08:25] dog doing that behavior and again I like [08:26] to get it to where I can walk backwards [08:29] and my dog is just walking directly in [08:31] front of me yes [08:33] sit repeat the sit command take a step [08:36] away build a little bit of distance come [08:39] and then use the cube yes [08:44] come and then right back so she's going [08:47] to my hand so I'm not gonna reward her [08:48] there bring my hands behind my back if I [08:51] need to [08:52] yes sit come yes good girl build a [09:12] little more distance come come yes and [09:23] each time break we're trying to place [09:25] our dog in the best position possible [09:26] and every time I'm doing this I'm [09:29] looking more towards competitive [09:31] obedience you're not competing with your [09:33] dog you don't need them to be in perfect [09:35] position that I'm demonstrating here if [09:38] you want if you're happy with your dog [09:40] simply coming to you to get a reward [09:42] then just do that gum job then you can [09:46] give them the reward you can make it as [09:48] formal or as informal as you would like [09:51] it to be free good girl that's gonna be [09:55] how we're gonna teach to come it's my [09:56] body as I guide it downwards so it's [10:00] staying up against my body and that's [10:02] gonna keep my dog nice and close to me [10:04] and I keep it Center so I can switch [10:06] hands to and I start with walking [10:10] backwards again this is the backwards [10:12] follow exercise [10:13] this is going to lead into the come when [10:17] called so now that I have my dog [10:19] understanding this exercise I'm gonna [10:22] name the command and I'm just gonna do [10:24] it from right here come then come come [10:42] once my dog gets better at that what I [10:46] want to do is I want to start building [10:51] distance I like to use to climb again if [10:53] you want to use your commands to [10:55] reinforce the stay so just to make it [10:58] easier on the dog and easier on the [11:00] training process the more successful [11:02] your dog is the faster they're gonna [11:03] learn so now I just create a little bit [11:05] of distance and I do the exact same [11:07] thing hands down on my side to kind of [11:10] give them that normal picture come then [11:12] the cute yes climb back on the same [11:27] thing hands down and decide come yes [11:46] don't bring in my hands to help him out [11:55] yes so we can help we think that they [11:59] need help or you can see that they need [12:00] help but you can see all we're doing fun [12:06] by showing the dog the picture they [12:09] already understand come yes that's a [12:18] really easy way to teach the common cold [12:20] and you're just gonna want to keep [12:21] building on the distance building on the [12:23] repetition and making it to where you [12:26] can go from having to help them as [12:29] you're walking backwards rewarding the [12:30] whole way to where you're just stand-in [12:32] there and if you see again you need help [12:34] it's okay to help your dog out but get [12:36] back into this position yes and then [12:39] reward so they know what the final [12:40] picture looks like and that's gonna be [12:42] the position that your dog will seek out [12:49] yes come yes come yes [13:33] it's not always gonna be perfect make [13:35] sure you adjust if your dog makes [13:36] mistakes it's no big deal come free [13:45] there's also a couple fun exercises that [13:48] you can do to speed up your dog's [13:49] training one is you call your dog to you [13:52] when they make the decision to come to [13:54] you you use your terminal marker [13:56] releasing them from the exercise and you [13:58] take their favorite toy and you throw it [14:00] behind you some people will throw it [14:01] between their legs encouraging their dog [14:03] to run between their legs to maintain [14:05] that Center position when you don't [14:08] throw it toy but nonetheless what it's [14:10] doing is its showing the dog that when [14:12] they make the right decision you may [14:14] release them and you may throw a toy [14:16] behind you and they're gonna run past [14:17] you to get that toy so then when you do [14:20] call them to you they're running and [14:22] excitement for the possibility of being [14:24] released and chasing their favorite toy [14:26] another great way to speed up your dog's [14:28] recall command is to have a training [14:30] partner at the training partner hold the [14:32] dog either by their chest or they could [14:35] put a harness on them and we want to [14:37] build frustration so you're gonna run [14:39] away from your dog calling them you're [14:41] gonna get really excited and then your [14:43] training partner will release your dog [14:45] and your dog should run at you very [14:46] quickly because of that frustration it's [14:48] a lot of fun and I'm sure you'll enjoy [14:50] it all right now in this exercise this [14:53] is how we're going to increase the speed [14:54] of our dogs recall we're gonna be using [14:56] frustration in order to do this what I'm [14:59] gonna do is I'm gonna go over I'm gonna [15:01] play with Derby for a second I'm gonna [15:02] run away I'm gonna be really excited [15:05] high energy encouraging Derby to come to [15:07] me Erica is gonna hold Derby in place [15:10] until there's enough frustration and [15:12] then she's gonna let him go and he's [15:14] gonna come cruising over to me and I'm [15:15] gonna praise and reward him when he gets [15:17] to me this is a great way to increase [15:19] your dog's recall as far as the speed [15:21] and the motivation that they're gonna [15:23] have while doing this exercise [15:44] and then praise and reward when he gets [15:47] you good boy [15:48] we're gonna do the same thing with [15:50] Charlie here and then praise and reward [16:02] when he gets to all right we're gonna do [16:04] it again one more time with Charlie and [16:05] the farther away you get from your dog [16:08] the faster they usually go this is a [16:11] pretty short distance and we're still [16:13] getting a good amount of speed all right [16:14] Johnny good and then lots of praise [16:26] lots of reward when your puppy comes to [16:29] you this is a phenomenal exercise to do [16:31] your dog's I highly recommend [16:34] [Music] ================================================== CONTENU DE: 2020-02-07_Introducing_a_New_Puppy_to_Your_Home__Expert_Tips_and_Tricks.

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 352/468,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] one of the first things we want to do [00:01] and we get our new puppy is introduce [00:03] our puppy into the household dogs are [00:06] creatures of habit it's very important [00:08] that when we bring a dog into a new [00:10] environment that we introduce it [00:12] properly and we show the dog exactly how [00:14] we want them to act if we show them [00:16] right from the beginning what they can [00:18] and can't do it's gonna make the process [00:20] way easier far too often people bring [00:23] their new puppy home and they let their [00:25] puppy run through the entire house [00:26] without showing the puppy exactly what [00:28] the puppy can and can't do and then they [00:30] wonder why they have chewed up furniture [00:32] or the dog has eaten some of the [00:34] Christmas tree ornaments or has [00:36] swallowed a sock or done something else [00:38] that we don't want our dog or a puppy to [00:41] do and this is gonna make it much easier [00:43] when you have a young puppy remember [00:44] this is the imprinting stage from I [00:46] believe from when they're born to 16 [00:49] weeks but you're usually going to get [00:50] your puppy at around 8 weeks so you have [00:52] 8 weeks to really show them how you want [00:54] them to be for the rest of their life so [00:55] this is a very very important time now I [00:58] strategically have placed things [01:00] throughout the house that could be a [01:01] normal distraction for a dog we have [01:03] some socks laying around we have a [01:05] slipper on the ground we have the dogs [01:06] little bed and we have toys and things [01:09] like that this is something that's [01:11] really common in a household and we [01:12] don't want our puppy to chew up the toys [01:14] or to chew up certain things that may [01:16] not be there for the puppy you don't [01:19] want your puppy chewing up all your kids [01:20] toys they're not gonna be too happy with [01:22] that so we want to set the dog up so we [01:24] can reward them the exact moment that [01:26] they do it correctly but we also want to [01:28] set them up for failure so we can show [01:30] them what they can't do and then reward [01:32] them for doing the correct behavior so [01:35] I'm gonna bring the puppy in and when I [01:36] first introduce a puppy to a new [01:38] household I want to have that puppy on a [01:40] leash this way I can show the puppy [01:42] everything that they're supposed to do [01:44] and in the very beginning I like to keep [01:45] the puppy close to me I want them to get [01:48] into that habit of being next to me [01:49] because remember when you have a puppy [01:51] running throughout your house you better [01:52] have eyes on because if that puppy goes [01:55] through the bathroom and you don't see [01:56] them go to the bathroom you can't [01:58] correct them for that and every single [02:00] time that your puppy goes to the [02:01] bathroom inside the house they're [02:03] starting to think that that's an okay [02:05] behavior and it's gonna be much harder [02:06] to break so in the very beginning I like [02:08] to keep the puppy close to me now we're [02:10] going to bring the puppy inside and [02:12] we want to keep him on a leash so we can [02:15] show him exactly what they can and [02:16] cannot do he's behaving very nicely [02:18] outside waiting come on buddy [02:21] good boy so first thing I want to do is [02:23] I want to hook the leash on to him and [02:25] I'm just gonna stand here at the doorway [02:27] yes [02:28] and he's looking up at me which I like [02:30] and during the introduction into the [02:32] household we're gonna be using our free [02:34] shaping yes I don't have anything in [02:36] mind [02:37] that I want him to do necessarily except [02:39] for maybe go on a little dog bed right [02:41] there [02:41] but if he's looking up at me if he's [02:43] sitting politely if he's acting the way [02:44] I want him to act then I'm gonna reward [02:46] him for that and I'm keeping the leash [02:47] loose yes and I want him to stay close [02:50] to me I don't want him to start [02:51] exploring on his own okay so now I'm [02:54] gonna walk this way and I'm actually [02:56] gonna use Lorene and guide him onto his [02:58] bed shown that this is a little area for [03:01] him to hang out if he wants yes good boy [03:06] and again no commands and now we're [03:08] gonna walk over here where we have all [03:09] the toys laid out and I'm gonna let him [03:11] explore the toys but I want him to know [03:13] that he cannot just pick a toy up on his [03:15] own so again let him kind of explore but [03:20] not letting him pick up any bad habits [03:22] or any bad behavior so he's trying to [03:23] get that toy I'm gonna stop him I'm [03:24] gonna stop him from doing that we're [03:26] gonna walk him around I have a couple [03:28] socks over here something that a lot of [03:30] people end up running into especially [03:32] with golden retrievers and Labrador [03:34] retrievers is they'll get a hold of [03:35] somebody socks in the house they'll eat [03:37] that sock and then you have a dog that [03:39] has a ruptured bowel or a blockage and [03:41] that can be very costly but it also can [03:45] be very dangerous for the dog and we [03:48] don't want our dog to have a shorter [03:51] life than what they should have because [03:53] of negligence so he's right next to [03:56] socks right now he's tried picking them [03:57] up a couple times and you can see all [03:59] I'm doing is I'm lifting up on the leash [04:01] preventing him from playing with the [04:03] socks yes good boy very nice and then [04:06] rewarding him when he's doing what I [04:08] want which right now it's just simply [04:10] sitting there nicely not playing with [04:12] the sock I'm also gonna sit down on the [04:13] couch I don't want him jumping up on the [04:15] furniture so if he jumps up on the [04:17] furniture yes good boy again he's still [04:20] doing really nice I'm gonna give him [04:21] another treat good job buddy [04:25] very nice giving them some feedback [04:27] let's see if he wants to kind of lean [04:31] back a little bit see if he's gonna jump [04:33] up so he tried taking off I stopped him [04:36] from taking off [04:37] pull him back a little bit and then keep [04:38] the leash loose I'm okay with him being [04:40] underneath the table a lot of dogs [04:43] you'll find out they'll actually go [04:44] underneath the table because it's almost [04:45] a little den alright so we're gonna take [04:49] him we're gonna walk them back this way [04:50] a little bit at least leash pressure [04:52] it's good and then we're gonna start [04:54] walking we're gonna start to explore the [04:56] rest of the house come on buddy not let [04:58] him take the toys good excellent and I [05:03] don't want him walking faster than me so [05:04] again pull back and then loose leash and [05:06] then we're gonna start to walk so we [05:08] have our little slipper over here let's [05:09] see if he goes for the slipper yes he's [05:15] not even looking at the slipper that's [05:16] excellent [05:17] maybe if I move it a little bit so again [05:23] yes very nice good job he's starting to [05:27] understand how the leash works he feels [05:29] a little bit of tension he knows that [05:30] that means stop doing what you're doing [05:32] and then you noticed that time he looked [05:35] right up at me yes and then I was able [05:37] to give him a piece of food so we're [05:39] gonna start walking around again and [05:40] this is just developing those manners [05:42] that we want our puppy to have as they [05:45] grow up inside of our house so again a [05:48] little bit of tension preventing him [05:49] from going too far ahead of me I want [05:51] him to stay within a six-foot kind of [05:53] circle around me he's going fast again [05:55] so I'm gonna stop moving good boy very [05:57] nice yes he looks up at me I'm gonna [06:00] reward that again so we're gonna come [06:03] over here I want to see if he's gonna [06:05] try to jump up on the couch [06:07] my niece over here is taking a little [06:10] nap ease so let's see if he comes over [06:13] so he's trying to pick up a piece of [06:14] paper so I stopped him from that [06:16] [Music] [06:18] and I guide him over let's see if he [06:20] tries jumping up on the couch nope and [06:23] he's doing great excellent we're gonna [06:25] walk around the kitchen as well yes okay [06:30] boy good job buddy [06:36] good I'm gonna give him another treat [06:38] he's doing really nice yes very good my [06:41] little buddy now we're gonna start [06:43] walking this way he's doing really well [06:54] he's staying yes he's staying with my [06:56] pace good job and we're gonna want to do [07:04] this throughout the entire house or [07:06] wherever you're gonna have your puppy [07:08] inside the house some people will close [07:09] off certain parts of their house to [07:12] prevent the puppy from going in those [07:13] areas or you might put gates up but [07:16] wherever you're gonna have your puppy [07:17] you want to make sure you do exactly [07:19] what I'm doing right now and I'll [07:20] usually do this for a couple weeks [07:23] before I even take the leash off I [07:25] really want to show the puppy how to [07:26] behave properly now we can take the [07:29] leash off and play with the puppy and [07:30] have some fun if we want to do that but [07:32] we're not gonna let the puppy explore [07:34] the house on their own because the [07:36] moment they run around the corner that's [07:38] when you find a little stain on the [07:39] carpet or you might find a surprise you [07:41] don't want so this is gonna be a really [07:43] good way to do that another thing that [07:45] you might run into is a puppy that could [07:47] be a little cautious or uncomfortable [07:49] going up the stairs and we're gonna help [07:51] him along the way I have some really [07:52] nice high-value treats and I'm gonna use [07:55] the treats to get him to come up the [07:56] stairs so it's gonna be very slow easy [07:59] patient process oh never mind he's going [08:02] up really nicely before I started to [08:05] film this he was frozen at the bottom of [08:08] the stairs and he didn't want to come up [08:09] so I don't like to force them I can just [08:12] guide them nicely and make it a positive [08:14] experience the entire thing about [08:16] confidence building so he's getting a [08:18] little cautious now so we're still gonna [08:20] help him and I'm gonna give him some [08:21] rewards he's putting in the effort we [08:24] want to reward them throughout the [08:25] journey the more pleasant of an [08:28] experience your puppy has the more [08:30] confidence they're going to have and the [08:33] overall better well-rounded dog you'll [08:37] have as they get older [08:42] good boy ye now he's already going up [08:45] the stairs way faster than before [08:49] good job little man yes excellent [08:56] alright so you went to the bathroom we [08:59] played a little bit outside and now I [09:01] want to introduce him to where he's [09:03] gonna be sleeping at night so what I'm [09:05] gonna do I want to make this a pleasant [09:06] experience and when your creature aining [09:09] the dog the crate should be just big [09:11] enough for the dog to stand up turn [09:14] around and lay down you don't want to [09:16] create that so big that your puppy can [09:18] go to the bathroom on one side and then [09:20] sleep on the other side so what I'm [09:22] going to do is I'm going to take some of [09:23] the food and I'm going to throw it [09:24] inside the crate you didn't see it so [09:27] I'm gonna take a little bit more and [09:29] throw it in you got to be patient [09:33] [Music] [09:39] nobody [09:42] [Music] [09:47] come on come on BJ come on good boy I'm [09:54] trying to throw it so you can hear it [09:55] hit the inside and we're gonna let them [10:00] go in and we're not gonna close the door [10:02] on them we're gonna have them go in and [10:04] then he can come right back out this is [10:08] how I like to introduce puppies to their [10:10] new crate or any crate and I want to [10:11] make it as comfortable as possible [10:13] a lot of times when I'm putting a puppy [10:15] to bed at night I might give them a [10:16] little bone to chew on something that's [10:19] gonna make them associate really nice [10:21] feelings with their crate we don't want [10:23] to make the create a punishment we don't [10:25] want to make it a bad place we wanted to [10:27] be a really nice comfortable place so he [10:29] comes back out I'm gonna give him [10:30] another piece of food good job buddy and [10:32] I'm gonna take the food and throw it [10:33] back in and just let him go back in this [10:38] is a really simple way to introduce your [10:41] puppy nicely to their crate and to make [10:43] it a pleasant experience and to also not [10:46] be closing the door on them right away [10:47] and if he lays down in there and he gets [10:49] comfortable it looks like he's looking [10:51] for some of the treats that are tucked [10:54] into the back so I'm gonna wait for him [10:58] to turn around and when he turns around [10:59] I'm gonna give him some peace from some [11:02] some food from my hand good job buddy [11:05] good boy so he's gonna get a couple [11:08] right there and he's kind of relaxing [11:10] right now he's already had a long day so [11:12] he's just sitting back relaxingg still [11:17] digging for some food looks like he's [11:18] coming back out good boy very nice very [11:22] nice mailman you want some work again [11:25] throw some more in there and allow him [11:27] to go in get the treats and come back [11:31] out and this is also a really good [11:33] opportunity to start teaching your dog [11:35] or your puppy the crate command so when [11:37] I have the puppy going in and out the [11:40] puppies really starting to trust me I [11:41] can start introducing the command [11:44] whether you want to be crate or get into [11:47] your house or whatever it is you want to [11:48] call it all we're gonna do is we're [11:51] gonna say the name of the command and [11:53] then we're gonna throw the food inside [11:55] of the crate once the puppy goes inside [11:57] of the crate or the kennel then we can [12:00] mark that if [12:01] we choose to the puppy will get the food [12:03] inside and then when the puppy comes [12:05] back out if you are marking it I want [12:08] you to use your terminal marker because [12:11] we're gonna start working on a crate [12:13] stay later where the dog or the puppy [12:16] has to stay inside of the crate with the [12:17] crate door open so for now if you're [12:20] gonna mark it let's use the terminal [12:21] marker so we'll use fre that way he can [12:24] come back out he can get some more food [12:26] and we can do the step or the process [12:28] again you can see I got some blankets in [12:30] there I want to be nice and comfortable [12:32] for him and another common thing that a [12:35] lot of people will do when they get [12:36] their new puppy is they'll put the puppy [12:38] in the crate and the puppy might cry or [12:40] whine or do something like that and what [12:42] they do is they put the puppy in a [12:44] separate room away from them they'll put [12:46] their ear ear plugs in to try to not [12:48] hear the puppy and just ignore it [12:50] everyone thinks that you're supposed to [12:52] ignore that whining when you have a [12:53] really young puppy like Derby here he's [12:56] not crying or whining when he's [12:58] separated from everybody because he's [13:00] trying to manipulate us what he's doing [13:02] is he's acting out a natural animal [13:04] behavior if a puppy is separated from [13:06] their pack they're gonna cry so the mom [13:09] can find them and bring them back so [13:11] what I like to do is I always have the [13:12] puppy right next to the bed at night so [13:15] that way the puppy feels comfortable [13:16] they're not alone and see now he's [13:19] starting to go back in on his own this [13:21] is a great that's what we want we wanted [13:23] to be really comfortable and happy in [13:24] his environment good job buddy [13:26] this is really important and then if he [13:29] is whining at night all I usually do if [13:32] I'm the one so like I said he's staying [13:34] in my niece's room and if the puppy [13:38] starts to whine all I do is I put my [13:40] fingers into the crate and I let the [13:42] puppy know that I'm still there a lot of [13:44] puppies might lick your fingers or do [13:46] something like that but we want to make [13:47] it again really Pleasant and we want our [13:50] puppy to trust us so I'm gonna do a [13:51] couple more reps of this and this is [13:53] gonna be a really nice introduction and [13:55] we'll be able to move on with more [13:56] training so I'm gonna add the command [13:59] now I'm gonna go I'm gonna use crate for [14:00] him let them know that I have the food [14:02] get his attention and then I'm just [14:04] gonna say crate and then I'm gonna throw [14:07] the food in it's really that easy and [14:09] every single time I put them in the [14:10] crate I'm gonna say crate and I'm gonna [14:12] throw the food in before you know it [14:14] he'll be [14:14] inside of the crate on command just like [14:17] that and it's gonna be a nice pleasant [14:18] experience for him all right [14:21] our puppy made it up the stairs with no [14:23] problem now we're gonna bring him back [14:24] down the stairs so we're gonna take our [14:27] time just like we did last time and I'm [14:28] gonna walk him down each death and this [14:31] is a little harder hi a little meum come [14:35] on buddy good boy and even if they crawl [14:38] again we want every experience to be a [14:40] nice positive experience come on little [14:42] buddy leave my little Mia luan plus is [14:45] really cute good boy [14:49] excellent and right now I know you can't [14:52] see it's difficult to see but he's [14:53] getting little pieces of food with every [14:55] step and remember when you're working [14:58] with your dog success builds success [15:02] come on buddy come on buddy good boy [15:06] that's very nice and what I like to do [15:09] if they're struggling is all I'm gonna [15:11] do is I'm gonna reach underneath him and [15:12] I'm gonna help him out so I'm gonna [15:14] provide some 'some comfort right there [15:16] and I'm gonna walk him down good boy [15:19] giving him little bites very nice good [15:23] that's my good little meaning [15:25] give him some more treats too all right [15:28] so this is gonna be a little bit more [15:29] difficult so I'm not gonna rush him at [15:32] all on this and I'm running out of [15:37] treats so all I want him to do is get [15:42] the first step one at a time [15:44] good boy good [15:49] good job buddy good boy come on and then [15:56] now what I'm going to do is I'm going to [15:57] use the leash pressure that we taught [15:59] earlier so there's a little bit of [16:01] pressure and I'm gonna wait them out [16:03] come on buddy [16:05] and remember when you use a leash [16:07] pressure number one rule once you start [16:10] the pressure you can't turn it off until [16:11] they comply come on buddy [16:14] good so I'm waiting good he step down [16:17] one step and I'm going to turn the [16:18] pressure off and I'll let him go back [16:19] down a step or go back if he wants there [16:21] he goes good boy good boy buddy who's my [16:28] good boy who's my good boy good job [16:32] buddy [16:32] and I'm right here just in case so he [16:34] doesn't fall he doesn't have a bad [16:35] experience good boy that's my good [16:38] little man he's doing great good boy [16:41] buddy good job there he goes he's a [16:46] little pro you're a little brittle Dan [16:49] you go excellent and that's how we're [16:51] gonna introduce our dog going down the [16:52] stairs [16:53] [Music] ==================================================

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 355/468,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] season the great command if you've [00:01] already watched the introduction to the [00:02] house who saw stood a little bit in that [00:04] video but I want to go a little bit more [00:06] into detail on it we're gonna use the [00:08] reward base and then we're also gonna do [00:10] the pressure based so again first thing [00:12] we want to do take the food throat into [00:14] the creek [00:14] here's it he goes inside free once all [00:17] four paws go inside the crate and now he [00:20] knows that he has been released from the [00:22] behavior he can get the food that's in [00:24] here there and he can come back out and [00:26] get more food good job buddy buddy so [00:29] again we throw some in free verbal [00:33] praise nice job bud [00:36] see he's starting to go in there now on [00:38] his own and that's really what we want [00:40] to start to see we make it a fun little [00:42] game free using the terminal marker so I [00:46] use the terminal marker when you [00:47] sniffing so I kind of rewarded him [00:49] sniffing inside the crate but that's [00:51] okay it happens sometimes come on buddy [00:54] crate oops [00:56] don't want to drop it then we throw it [00:58] in the puppy goes in free good great [01:05] throw he goes inside free and then we [01:12] reward now we can also do this using the [01:17] leash pressure so what I want to do with [01:19] that place them into a sit guide him [01:21] into the crate free let them come back [01:25] out get a piece of food good job buddy [01:27] guide him into the creep [01:37] see trying to resist a little bit we [01:39] wait him out [01:40] free good boy nice job buddy [01:45] come in free very nice good job good job [02:06] my man and if you're struggling a little [02:08] bit if they are resisting you can do the [02:11] pressure followed by food and then the [02:15] pressures turned off when they go inside [02:17] the creek come on big guy [02:19] good boy so pressure just like doing any [02:22] other pressure exercise pressure than [02:24] food good boy very nice he comes back [02:28] out good pressure then food keeping the [02:36] pressure on until he goes into the crate [02:39] we don't want to give him food while [02:42] he's resisting because then you will be [02:43] rewarding the resisting he gets the food [02:45] when the pressure is released so this [02:48] time I'm gonna do it without the food to [02:50] get him to go in so this was good he [02:54] needs to know that resisting doesn't [02:55] work so this is something you might run [02:57] into we're just gonna wait [03:03] [Music] [03:20] yes very nice boy yes good do it again [03:31] yes you see the resisting is becoming [03:38] less and less and this you can use this [03:41] same technique for getting your dog into [03:43] the car if they don't want to go into [03:45] the car yes good boy very nice I could [03:52] use a terminal marker if I want free [03:55] good boy bunny [04:04] free free so now you can see he's [04:16] resisting less and less because he's [04:18] learning that resisting doesn't work so [04:19] why continue to do it free good boy you [04:23] just have to get past that in the very [04:25] beginning when they're resisting and you [04:27] feel bad you knows what I want free keys [04:31] no knucklehead good boy come on buddy [04:36] free very good my man let's go back free [04:44] so now he's going in the way that I like [04:46] using the leash pressure so I can go [04:48] ahead and name it [04:48] crate and the pressure free then the [04:54] reward crate then the pressure spin them [04:59] around a little bit free then every ward [05:03] good boy crate then the pressure [05:12] free yeah nice job buddy [05:16] crate done the pressure free then the [05:22] reward excellent now we're gonna do a [05:24] crate stay okay so when I command him to [05:27] go in there I'm gonna use a continuation [05:28] marker so he stays in the position and [05:30] then I'm gonna start closing the door a [05:32] little bit and we want to start building [05:33] the duration of the dog stayin in the [05:35] crate whether the doors open - the doors [05:37] closed this will help with some of those [05:39] anxiety issues that a lot of people run [05:42] into when they only put their dog into [05:44] the crate when they're leaving for eight [05:45] hours so we want to put them in and out [05:47] of the crate randomly throughout the day [05:49] so I'm gonna say crate I'm gonna guide [05:51] them in yes now I'm gonna reward them in [05:55] there and I'm not gonna let him come out [05:57] I could use the door to prevent it and [05:59] if he comes out we just push it back in [06:02] no big deal [06:08] yes um piece of food yes nope so he [06:17] tries to get out we just put them back [06:19] no big deal good stick his head [06:24] out so I'm gonna wait till he breaks it [06:25] yes no and then we're gonna guide them [06:30] back yes no just like any other stay you [06:36] say one note and place them back in no [06:39] well place them back in uh yes watch his [06:45] paws no spin him around put him back in [06:49] yes no spin him around and put him back [06:56] in again [06:58] good no good boy no so now he's starting [07:08] to stop his movement when she's showing [07:10] me he's figuring it out go ahead yes [07:15] remember it's always one no to pinpoint [07:17] the mistake and then we help the dog by [07:20] putting them back into the crate so they [07:22] know exactly what they're supposed to be [07:24] doing when we say no yes good job little [07:27] buddy and I'm gonna reward them for [07:29] staying in there I'm gonna close the [07:30] door yes [07:32] then open it no guide on back in close [07:37] the door yes [07:39] open it and reward cause the door yes [07:44] open reward don't be afraid of your dog [07:49] making a mistake they're going to yes [07:54] and then as every other state command we [07:58] could build distance yes come back and [08:01] reward build distance no that's why we [08:08] had the leash calmly bring them back [08:11] good boy yes no no [08:36] yes yes very nice my little buddy good [08:45] boy yes excellent and then as I said [08:51] before we can close a door walk a little [08:54] bit away yes come back and you see I [08:57] didn't even lock it I just closed the [09:00] door in front of them build some [09:02] distance yes then come back and reward [09:05] and then I can release him if I want [09:07] using our release word all done good boy [09:12] and that's gonna be how we will teach [09:14] our crate command using reward-based [09:17] training pressure based training and [09:19] developing reliability in the position [09:21] by reinforcing it using our know and [09:25] directing them back in implementing the [09:27] leash pressure [09:31] okay so we're gonna demonstrate the [09:33] crate command with a couple other dogs [09:34] this is an outside crate so it is a [09:38] little dusty but that's okay it's good [09:40] for instructional purposes all right now [09:42] remember we throw the food dog goes in [09:45] free they get the food and they come [09:48] back out we reward them again and when [09:52] we know we have our dog before minute [09:54] we'll go ahead and name it [09:55] crate free and so you can see sherry [09:58] knows it great yes nope great yes no yes [10:08] good so I want her to stay inside and [10:11] she was excited to run back out and I [10:14] was using the continuation marker so [10:16] when she came back out I said no she [10:18] tried to fix it by jumping on top of the [10:20] crate that was incorrect she went back [10:22] inside said yes she tried to step out [10:24] again and I told her no and she went [10:27] back in so being clear with our [10:29] communication so she's doing nicely I'm [10:31] gonna go like I'm gonna close it yes [10:33] reward build distance yes come back and [10:40] reward and break we can have our dog go [10:45] into the crate from a distance as well [10:47] great free good girl good come crate

threw in there comes back out [11:34] gets another reward good boy crate ten [11:37] throw free reward good job buddy [11:43] crate yes good yes yes I'm rewarding [11:52] them a few times for going in there yes [11:55] build a little bit of distance yes no [11:59] yes [12:03] free good what are you doing over here [12:08] come on good boy [12:13] crate free very nice crate free good boy [12:23] very nice very simple exercise to teach [12:27] and I highly recommend teaching it this [12:29] way [12:30] great free good boy [12:34] lastly how long do I need to use a crate [12:38] for this is really gonna depend on the [12:40] individual dog remember a crate is just [12:42] to help potty train them and help them [12:44] teach or help them learn how to behave [12:47] in the house appropriately if your dog [12:50] gets to a point where they're no longer [12:52] doing any bad behaviors and the way that [12:54] I kind of read that is if I can have my [12:56] dog inside the house for a 24-hour [12:58] period and I don't have to tell them no [13:00] once they just know how to act in the [13:02] house then I'm going to start giving [13:04] them more freedom I might leave them in [13:06] the living room when I go off to the [13:08] grocery store or I might allow them to [13:10] stay in my bedroom I'm going to slowly [13:12] build that trust and as long as my dog [13:15] continues to prove that they can stay in [13:17] the house without getting into trouble [13:19] then eventually the crate can go way [13:22] we no longer need to create anymore cuz [13:24] remember crate is just there to help [13:26] potty train help them hold that bladder [13:28] and then help them or prevent them [13:30] rather from doing any behaviors we don't [13:33] want them to own for life so if your dog [13:34] can hang out in the house and they're [13:35] not going to the bathroom they're not [13:36] getting into the trashcan they're not [13:38] chewing up your furniture great at that [13:40] point you no longer need the crate but a [13:43] lot of times I recommend keeping the [13:44] crate because our dogs our den animals [13:46] so you can have the crate and kind of [13:48] decorate it nicely and just take the [13:50] door off give them that space to go in [13:52] and out and relax whenever they want [13:55] [Music] ==================================================

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 361/468,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] for the stand I like to use the climb [00:02] bit so I'm gonna guide my little puppy [00:04] up on the climb here and then place them [00:08] into a sit and remember the hand is [00:10] gonna go from being upwards to inwards [00:13] and towards the chest okay so he's [00:15] flopping down what you're gonna see what [00:17] some dogs we want to bring them back up [00:21] and I can even help a little bit with [00:23] the leash come on buddy [00:24] yes and then reward good so we're gonna [00:29] bring them back up into the sit okay [00:33] rotate the hand towards the chest help [00:36] him out with the leash if I need to come [00:38] on buddy come on come on come on get [00:41] that back in then yes then reward good [00:47] job buddy [00:52] yes reward okay so rotate the hand [00:58] towards the chest I can help by bringing [00:59] my hand under there as well so I'm not [01:02] using the leash pressure then at that [01:03] point bring him back up help him with [01:07] the leash [01:08] he's trying to find freebies rotate the [01:11] hand towards a chest how about yes [01:13] reward so you can see I'm bringing my [01:15] hand underneath guiding pushing his legs [01:18] back to get him to stand up yes reward [01:21] good job buddy [01:24] so sometimes it'll even help please [01:28] you're doing sideways in front of you so [01:30] then you can do a sit you could bring [01:32] the dog back into it down and then you [01:36] can guide them right back up into the [01:37] stand and all I'm doing is teaching them [01:41] what each thing means and just giving [01:43] them a little extra help using my left [01:45] hand yes good job bring him back into [01:49] the down yes and then back up into the [01:52] stand and each time I say yes he's [01:54] getting a piece of food cuz I had a [01:55] handful of food there back into the down [01:59] and this one takes a little bit of [02:00] repetition especially if you're working [02:01] with a young puppy a stand is a more [02:04] difficult behavior to teach so you see [02:06] he did that one really nice and easily [02:08] just after a couple of them he's already [02:10] starting to get it but again he's a [02:12] smart little guy [02:13] so we're gonna take another handful [02:14] guide it towards the chest help them out [02:16] a little bit see if he stands yes reward [02:18] good job buddy let's bring them into [02:20] that sit help them out yes [02:23] reward and got them back into the stand [02:26] yes reward beautiful so then when we [02:29] have it and we know we can get them to [02:30] perform it we can start naming it again [02:33] I like to use the word post now if this [02:35] was actually the training that I was [02:37] doing I wouldn't start naming the stand [02:39] just yet he still needs a little bit of [02:41] work but for instructional purposes only [02:43] I'm gonna say post then the cue yes then [02:48] the reward sit [02:50] then the cue yes then the reward post [02:57] then the cue yes then the reward [03:01] remember command motivate mark reward [03:04] all right now let's do this using leash [03:06] pressure so what I want to do is I want [03:09] the pressure to be forward so I'm gonna [03:11] apply a little bit of pressure yes and [03:14] then reward so you see he came up pretty [03:15] easily cue them back into the sit and [03:18] let's get a little bit more pressure [03:19] forward getting that back in to come up [03:21] yes and then reward excellent ice job [03:23] little buddy [03:24] pressure goes up yes reward shaping [03:27] these behaviors pressure forward nice [03:29] and slow get that back into pop up help [03:31] with the food if I need to yes good good [03:35] job buddy [03:36] a little bit of pressure yes nice and as [03:41] he gets better and I feel comfortable [03:43] then I'll go ahead and name it [03:45] so let's try it right now and again [03:48] instructional purposes only it's not as [03:49] pretty as I would like it to be but it's [03:52] good for the video so post then the cue [03:55] see these wanted to lay down free then [03:59] the reward sit when the cute free [04:01] rewarding he just did that on his own [04:03] post then the Q free then the reward [04:08] excellent [04:09] nice job buddy [04:13] and when I'm doing the stand what I want [04:16] to do is I want to bring the food I cup [04:20] it again I rotate in my hand and I bring [04:23] the food to the chest see how his butt [04:24] popped up so cup to the chest good once [04:30] I get the dog to understand each [04:32] position this is what I do stand last [04:34] because I can go from a stand or I can [04:37] go from a sit rather into a stand and I [04:40] can go from a down into a stand by doing [04:44] the same cue so tuck it in yes reward [04:50] under yes yes reward yes reward and just [05:00] like every other command when I know I [05:02] can get him to do the behavior with the [05:05] physical cue exactly how I like it I'm [05:06] gonna start naming it and since he knows [05:10] sit down and stand this is actually a [05:12] great way to work all three so I can go [05:15] down yes reward post and then the cue [05:20] yes reward down find the cute yes [05:23] reward post then the cute yes reward [05:27] down yes really [05:30] post yes reward sit yes reward post yes [05:37] great work and you see how I'm spacing [05:39] out each one I'm making sure sit comes [05:42] before the lift down comes before the [05:46] cue down then the cute yes then I give [05:49] the food sit then the cute yes send the [05:53] food down then the cue yes from the food [05:58] and you can see he's beating me to each [06:00] command now post then the cue yes then [06:03] the reward down then the cue yes then [06:08] the reward post then the cue yes down [06:14] cue [06:15] post cute yes we were all done [06:20] what's anybody remember it to the chest [06:23] free free free free free so I'm trying [06:36] to get them to do the stand from a sit [06:39] good boy [06:41] and also stand from the down free very [06:44] nice [06:45] he's doing it really well so post in the [06:48] cute free post and the cute free post [06:56] then the cute freak reward post then the [07:03] Q free just a simple movement with the [07:07] wrist in the hand post free post free [07:15] big boy post free excellent post free [07:26] post [07:29] and then you want to keep doing it until [07:31] your dog is jumping up into the position [07:33] before giving the physical cue so it's [07:35] still gonna take a little bit of time [07:36] for him their hand to the dog's chest [07:38] yes yes yes [07:45] I'm waiting for that but to pop up yes [07:50] yes yes yes good so we know we can get [07:59] her to spring that back end up so we're [08:01] gonna go ahead and name it [08:02] post yes good girl sit yes post yes sit [08:13] yes post yes sit yes post yes good girl [08:25] sit we're gonna keep doing it until the [08:28] dog beats us into the position now she [08:29] actually knows that command off of the [08:31] word stand and that's why I told you [08:33] guys earlier it's good to switch it to a [08:35] different word because that's what I [08:36] noticed with her stan was so similar [08:38] from sit and spin that she would confuse [08:41] them sometimes stand she went to it down [08:46] try it again [08:47] stand yes sit [08:51] yes Stan yes [08:58] that's it [09:01] stamp yes good sit stand yes very nice [09:09]

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 364/468,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] hey everybody in today's video we're [00:01] going to be teaching our dogs how to get [00:03] in and out of the vehicle on command in [00:05] the video I'm gonna be demonstrating [00:07] using just the least pressure technique [00:09] but if you go back and you watch my [00:11] video on how to teach the climb command [00:12] I treat the vehicle the exact same way [00:15] so you can use the option of food or you [00:18] can use leash pressure but you still [00:20] want to reward your dog when they do the [00:21] behavior the reason why I'm [00:22] demonstrating with leash pressure is [00:24] because most people that wanted to teach [00:26] their dogs to get in and out of the [00:27] vehicle it's because they're having [00:29] issues getting their dog in and out of [00:30] the vehicle the dog doesn't want to go [00:32] in even if you offer up food the dog [00:34] would rather stay on the vehicle for [00:36] whatever reason so we're gonna use that [00:38] leash pressure when we do this it also [00:39] helps if our dog understands and knows [00:41] the markers as well as teaching them the [00:44] climb command before doing this exercise [00:46] because it'll make it a little bit [00:48] easier and will make the process [00:49] smoother for you and for your dog when [00:52] you're doing this remember anytime or [00:53] implementing leash pressure once the [00:55] pressure is turned on it cannot be [00:57] turned off until our dog complies so you [00:59] turn that pressure on it has to stay on [01:01] until the dog goes in and out of the [01:03] vehicle and just like everything else [01:04] that we teach our dogs once we get the [01:06] dog doing it on the physical cues of [01:08] this case it's going to be the leash [01:09] pressure then we can go ahead and name [01:11] the command the name the command [01:13] precedes the physical cue so it could [01:15] become a predictable pattern for our [01:16] dogs all right let's go ahead and jump [01:18] right into it giving our dogs in and out [01:21] of the vehicle we're gonna use the leash [01:22] pressure we're gonna make it very simple [01:25] we'll open the door and we're going to [01:26] show our dog our physical cube guide [01:28] them into the vehicle yes and then [01:30] reward Omari and then we'll guide them [01:37] back out of the vehicle yes and guide [01:41] them back in yes yes very nice and once [01:51] we know we can get them in now some of [01:53] your dogs may resist a little bit more [01:55] you're just gonna keep the pressure [01:57] until your dog goes into the vehicle [01:58] again you're not gonna yell you're not [02:00] gonna make any noise you're just gonna [02:01] wait them out till eventually see even [02:04] though she's resisting I'm gonna keep [02:05] going until she jumps in alright once we [02:09] have them coming in and out of the [02:11] vehicle pretty easily we can go ahead [02:12] and name it [02:13] sometimes I tell my dog climb to get [02:16] into the vehicle sometimes I say crate [02:18] because it's a little container whatever [02:20] you want to do you can use that word so [02:22] we're gonna say climb and then I'm going [02:24] to cue her yes and then reward and then [02:28] same thing with getting them out I'm [02:30] just gonna use a command my dog already [02:31] knows oh yes good a girl won yes very [02:41] nice oh yes climb yes and we'll treat [02:53] this the same we would teach or treat [02:56] any other stay so right now she is in a [03:00] climb stay inside of the truck very easy [03:03] to teach just make sure you follow [03:05] through and you get your dog inside the [03:07] vehicle reward them for it and again [03:09] every time we take our dog into the [03:10] vehicle it doesn't mean that you have to [03:12] go on a ride sometimes just work the [03:15] exercise work the behavior do this [03:17] correctly work your dog and you won't [03:18] have any problem [03:20] [Music] ================================================== CONTENU DE: 2020-02-28_Train_Your_Dog_To_Automatically_Sit_When_Halted__Episode_29.

The three techniques we'll be using to teach this behavior will be luring, leash pressure, and the verbal command sit.

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 367/468,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] today we're gonna be teaching our dogs [00:01] how to automatically sit when we halt [00:03] during a walk there's going to be three [00:05] different techniques that we're going to [00:07] be using in order to teach this behavior [00:09] one is going to be luring two is going [00:11] to be leash pressure three is going to [00:12] be giving the dog the command the verbal [00:14] command when we come to a stop remember [00:17] dogs learn through predictability and [00:19] pattern recognition some you may have a [00:21] dog that has done this in the past or [00:23] you know somebody who has a dog that [00:24] does this you tell the dog to sit and [00:26] the dog sits lays down and rolls over [00:28] the reason for this is because every [00:30] time the human has told the dog to sit [00:33] they followed it with down and roll over [00:35] so then the dog just goes through all of [00:37] them hoping that's going to get them to [00:39] the reward more quickly so we're going [00:41] to be using that concept of pattern [00:43] training in order to teach our dogs this [00:45] automatic sit when we come to a halt all [00:48] we're going to do is when we come to a [00:50] halt we're going to either use a leash [00:52] pressure to cue the dog into the sit [00:54] we're going to lure the dog into the sit [00:56] or we're going to simply tell our dogs [00:58] to sit and if you do this every single [01:01] time you come to a halt you won't find [01:03] eventually that when you come to a halt [01:05] your dog will sit automatically without [01:08] any sort of cue or guidance all right [01:11] let's jump right into it [01:12] I'm gonna use the luring technique so [01:15] heel as we're walking I got the food I [01:18] go ahead and slow down then I lift yes [01:23] reward heel then I step as I'm coming [01:28] guide them back slow down [01:33] lift yes reward okay if your dog really [01:39] knows the sit command then we can say [01:41] sit as we're coming to the stop as well [01:44] he'll the only step good boy slow down [01:48] sit [01:49] then we cue the dog yes then reward so I [01:53] was helping him with the leash pressure [01:54] there simply because his sit is not [01:57] perfect from all these different angles [01:58] so I'm gonna help him out a little bit [02:01] again young puppy here basic obedience [02:03] not too worried about precision with him [02:06] he'll then we step as long as he's [02:08] staying next to me I'm happy with that [02:09] sit [02:11] yes reward good job he'll then we step [02:17] good wait verbal praise slow down sit [02:21] yes [02:22] reward excellent good job come on buddy [02:26] boy boy guide him over to the side using [02:29] the leash to help out again we're [02:32] walking normal bass slowed down sit help [02:36] them on if I need to yes [02:38] reward good we're just gonna keep doing [02:40] this until we come to a stop and he sits [02:42] automatically without the verbal cue or [02:46] even the physical cue so this is [02:47] automatic they just do it because we're [02:49] stopping so stopping really is the [02:52] physical cue for getting him to go into [02:54] the sit position so the other option [02:56] come come buddy the other option is [03:02] going to be using the leash to get them [03:06] to stop so we're gonna say heel off we [03:09] go into healed good job and then I [03:12] slowed down [03:13] no so he's going ahead of me so I'm just [03:16] gonna readjust bring them back no big [03:19] deal [03:20] loose leash no you guys remember this [03:25] from how to teach your dog to walk on a [03:27] loose leash your video if you need to [03:28] fix that go ahead and do that so then we [03:31] slowed down and then we lift up again [03:35] basic pet I'm not too worried about [03:37] precision break come on buddy good boy [03:43] good no come back [03:52] good boy he looks at me I'm gonna reward [03:56] that no so he's zoning out a little bit [04:00] and that's gonna happen good boy come on [04:02] buddy [04:03] good yes very nice that's what I want to [04:07] see I want him to look at me [04:08] slow down sit yes and I meant to do the [04:12] leash pressure on that one come come on [04:15] buddy but that happens good boy guide [04:18] I'm back around and then we slow down [04:22] pressure yes [04:24] he's kind of already starting to beat me [04:27] to that pressure [04:28] he'll don't we step slow down pressure [04:32] yes reward good [04:35] Oh done so that's gonna be how we start [04:41] to teach our dog the sit automatic using [04:45] either Laureen the verbal command if [04:49] your dog already knows it or leash [04:51] pressure [04:53] so we're gonna do the automatic sit one [04:55] halted demonstrate again I'm gonna come [04:59] back this way so as we walk something in [05:06] there and then I stop [05:07] I lift yes you yes how's bad handling [05:18] droppin the food I go to stop yes you [05:30] yes you yes good girl and again we can [05:39] do it with the verbal command as well as [05:42] we walk you're walking a normal pace [05:51] slow down sit yes she's a little back [05:56] there but that's okay for now you good [06:01] girl yeah normal pace slow down sit [06:08] she's not wearing one so I'm just gonna [06:10] adjust her yes I try to get the balls of [06:14] my feet lined up with the paws of my [06:16] dog's feet that's gonna be a proper heel [06:18] position all done and that's gonna be an [06:20] automatic sit when halted while using a [06:22] reward based training when we stop as [06:27] we're walking all we do is we stop and [06:29] then we lift up on the food getting our [06:31] dog to sit yes rewarding and this is [06:34] gonna be for a non verbal automatic sit [06:36] when halted so as we go to walk again we [06:39] stop we lift up yes reward heel we walk [06:44] and we stop we lift up yes do it [06:47] heel [06:51] yes and I messed up I dropped the food [06:56] there yes reward that's gonna be one way [07:04] the other way is gonna be that it's just [07:07] tell him to sit when you come to a stop [07:09] so he's a little bit more towards [07:12] precision obedience although I still [07:14] need to sharpen it a little bit he still [07:16] needs a lot of work but if you have your [07:17] dog on a loose leash he's not gonna be [07:19] as close to you as charlie is right here [07:23] but when you're walking all you're gonna [07:25] do is you're gonna slow down stop and [07:27] say sit [07:28] yes reward he'll and then you're gonna [07:31] slow down stop sit oh you did a spin so [07:35] he's look he's a little motivator we're [07:38] gonna guide him back this way so we're [07:40] walking we slow down sit we just tell [07:43] them to sit yes heel again we're walking [07:47] sit yes break okay so that's what we're [07:53] gonna do and we're getting our dogs to [07:55] stop or automatically sit when halted [07:57] this is gonna be reward-based training [07:59] either we use the food to lure them into [08:02] the position break if your dog already [08:04] knows the seat command slow down the [08:07] reason why we slowed down is because [08:09] it's letting the dog know we're about to [08:10] come to a stop so we slowed down that [08:13] gives the dog thank you okay we're about [08:15] to stop he can prep himself you say sit [08:17] he sets you reward your dog it's really [08:21] that simple and they're gonna learn [08:22] after a certain amount of repetition [08:23] that every time you come to a stop they [08:25] need to automatically sense [08:27] [Music] ================================================== CONTENU DE:

document,2023-10-19_Is_Your_Home_Ready_For_A_Puppy_,,,,Chapters: Part 373/468,com/NateSchoemer === TRANSCRIPTION === [00:00] in today's video we're gonna be teaching [00:01] our dogs how to properly go through a [00:03] doorway and what I mean by that is [00:05] either a tee they have to wait for us to [00:07] go through the doorway first or be they [00:09] have to wait for us to allow them or [00:12] release them to go through the doorway [00:13] if your dog understands this concept [00:16] they're going to be way less likely to [00:18] run out the front door into the street [00:21] if somebody accidentally leaves it open [00:22] when you get to a certain destination [00:25] and you open the door to let them out of [00:26] the vehicle they're also going to wait [00:28] and not jump out of the vehicle and [00:30] accidentally run into traffic this is a [00:33] safety thing it's very important and [00:35] it's also very simple and very easy to [00:38] teach let's go ahead and jump right into [00:40] it every time I take my dog to the [00:42] doorway I want my puppy or my dog to sit [00:45] and wait nicely this has nothing to do [00:48] with being the Alpha or anything like [00:50] that what it does come down to is safety [00:52] any time I'm raising a puppy I want my [00:54] puppy to do behaviors that's going to [00:56] ensure the puppy's safety and if you [00:59] always teach your dog or your puppy to [01:01] wait at the doorway before you go [01:02] through or to wait before being allowed [01:05] to jump out of the car then the [01:06] likelihood of your puppy running out the [01:08] front door into the street is decreased [01:10] substantially because you implement this [01:12] technique so all I'm gonna do is we're [01:14] gonna open the door and I'm just not [01:16] going to allow him to go out I'm gonna [01:18] do this technique involved in times [01:20] throughout the day I'm gonna do it over [01:22] and over and over again to where I bring [01:24] the puppy by the door and all I'm gonna [01:25] do is open it allow him to see the [01:27] outside but I'm not gonna let him go [01:29] outside and I'm gonna do this so often [01:31] that the door being open just becomes a [01:34] normal part of my puppy's routine and he [01:36] doesn't think that he can run out like a [01:38] lot of dogs did because what most people [01:40] do they're going out the doorway and [01:41] they block the dog like this and they're [01:44] blocking so then once they have an [01:46] opportunity they're taking off out the [01:48] back so what I'm gonna do [01:50] and I'm gonna go back using some of that [01:52] reshaping so he sits down or he looks up [01:54] at me actually I'm gonna help me because [01:56] it's getting a little curious with the [01:58] carpet [01:58] yes alright good so now I open the door [02:04] nice and fast yes good job if he wants [02:12] to take off and try to run outside and I [02:15] would just use the leash to prevent him [02:17] from doing that and now I'm gonna walk [02:19] out the door since he's doing really [02:20] well I'm not gonna let him go through [02:23] the doorway yes good job leash making [02:30] sure he doesn't take off No so one no [02:34] I'm gonna bring them back and then [02:36] release the pressure good boy [02:38] nice job buddy good yes that's an [02:43] excellent job yes [02:51] he's doing very well he's making my job [02:53] easy again I'm gonna come back in and [03:00] I'm gonna step back up no one no use the [03:05] pressure bringing back good yes drop the [03:10] Pisan alright let's see if I can get him [03:14] to come on together [03:21] yes [03:30] and since he's doing so well I'm gonna [03:32] drop the leash yes yes [03:50] yes we're gonna back this way [03:58] this boy yes if you can do that exercise [04:10] as many times as possible each day until [04:14] you can open the door and he doesn't [04:17] even think about going now and again [04:19] this will really help you to ensure that [04:21] your dog your puppy doesn't bolt down [04:23] into the street the more doors we can [04:26] show our young pup the better remember [04:28] to keep the leash loose and just open it [04:30] and if they make the mistake then you [04:33] fix it so he can look in he can observe [04:39] I walk in first [04:44] freak good boy good job [04:48] same thing coming back out so I woke up [05:01] No [05:03] they're not allowed through until you [05:05] allow them to come through free good [05:09] nice job buddy [05:15] okay on to the next door [05:20] [Music] [05:42] [Music] [05:46] same thing coming back out free very [05:55] nice I said free right away at that time [05:58] because he looked up at me he stopped he [06:00] made the decision to stop he looked at [06:02] me for approval and then I allowed him [06:04] to come through good job little more [06:47] times alright moving on to the next door [07:06] okay here we go [07:07] another door give him the opportunity [07:15] yes free very nice [07:27] come back this way breathe boy very good [07:53] do it one more time each way freak very [07:57] nice good job you don't have to [08:10] necessarily make them sit you can if you [08:13] want it's completely up to you my main [08:16] focus is I want the dog to look up at me [08:18] and wait for permission to go through [08:21] the doorway and again this is going to [08:24] reduce the likelihood of your dog [08:26] jumping out of your car and running out [08:28] into traffic or doing something that [08:30] could potentially be dangerous for your [08:32] young pup [08:33] so definitely an exercise I highly [08:35] recommend teaching your dog [08:37] [Music] ================================================== CONTENU DE:
