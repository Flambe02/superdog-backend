[00:00] I have had my new 8-week old puppy
[00:02] Reggie for exactly 7 days we are at the
[00:05] end of the seventh day and I want to
[00:07] recap exactly what we've achieved in the
[00:10] first week together to give you a
[00:12] realistic expectation of what you should
[00:14] be able to achieve in the first week
[00:16] with your puppy as well now whenever I
[00:19] train a new puppy and whenever I train
[00:21] the thousands of clients that I've
[00:22] helped to train their new puppies we
[00:25] break the training process down into
[00:27] three pillars of success manners
[00:30] socialization and obedience so I think
[00:32] the best way to approach this video to
[00:34] give you an update of exactly what me
[00:36] and young Reginald here have achieved in
[00:38] the first week is to break it down into
[00:41] each of those categories so we're going
[00:42] to start off with the first category
[00:45] being manners now it does not matter how
[00:47] many tricks your dog knows what
[00:50] obedience it has if they are a bad
[00:52] mannered obnoxious dog they are a misery
[00:55] to be around and by manners I mean a dog
[00:58] that is calm well behaved well mannered
[01:01] will look up to you for guidance and
[01:03] Direction isn't obnoxious isn't barking
[01:05] all the time isn't jumping up everybody
[01:07] at meets has good threshold manners has
[01:10] good toilet training and we have made
[01:12] huge progress in week one with that the
[01:15] first and foremost piece of what I bit
[01:17] into the manners category which can kind
[01:20] of spread across multiple categories is
[01:23] crate training we got his Craig training
[01:25] done on day one he was able on day one
[01:29] to be able to to spend an hour to two
[01:31] hours at a time complete peace and quiet
[01:34] snoozing away in his crate he has not
[01:37] fallen asleep anywhere other than his
[01:40] crate in the entirety of the first week
[01:43] so he has already learned that his crate
[01:45] is where he settles down is where he
[01:47] relaxes and is where he goes to sleep
[01:50] we've then been able to use that and
[01:52] we've been able to get through the
[01:53] nights really successfully the last two
[01:56] nights he has slept through for 7 to 8
[02:00] hours both nights all the way through
[02:02] with no issues whatsoever the first few
[02:05] nights he would sleep for about 3 or 4
[02:07] hours he'd start to cry and bark a
[02:09] little bit we were able to interrupt
[02:11] that get quiet give that a minute or two
[02:14] and then we would let him out and take
[02:16] him to the toilet just to make sure that
[02:17] that's not what he was crying for but
[02:20] like I say the last couple of nights
[02:22] we've been able to get over 7 hours of
[02:24] sleep for me and my entire family and
[02:27] he's been able to settle down he
[02:29] comfortable there mister for over 7
[02:31] hours and go through the night so huge
[02:33] progress with crate training and huge
[02:35] progress on getting through the night I
[02:37] am not exaggerating and I swear on my
[02:40] life and my family's life we have had
[02:42] zero toilet accidents in the house
[02:45] absolutely zero and that comes down to
[02:48] incredible management and anytime he's
[02:51] been out the crate he has had structured
[02:53] free time which we're going to come on
[02:54] to in a minute but his time in the crate
[02:58] helps with toilet training because dogs
[02:59] are Denning animals and he doesn't want
[03:01] to soil inside his crate we've been on
[03:03] it with his toilet training on the hour
[03:05] every hour after he's had something to
[03:06] eat and when he wakes up from asleep and
[03:08] that has set us up for huge amounts of
[03:10] success and zero toilet accidents he has
[03:14] also started working on his place
[03:15] training as you can see and we're up to
[03:17] being able to get him to do an hour to
[03:19] two hours on his place bed when he is
[03:21] awake but we don't want to be outside
[03:23] and this is what I call my supervised
[03:25] structured free time in the home where
[03:28] you can be out with us in the living
[03:29] room environment while we're watching TV
[03:31] or hanging out as a family but you don't
[03:33] get off the place bed you can have stuff
[03:35] to chew which he's got his Yak stick
[03:36] right now and this is how you learn to
[03:39] kind of settle and be with us in the
[03:41] home but do it so in a structured way
[03:43] which means he's not destroying anything
[03:45] we're having no toilet accidents and
[03:47] he's learning how to just be a member of
[03:50] our family and be calm and well-mannered
[03:52] puppy biting is all but gone the first
[03:55] couple of days were very steady he was a
[03:57] bit uh nervous the first couple of days
[04:00] we didn't really see too much of him he
[04:01] was just very kind of I'm just going to
[04:03] sit back and figure this out the last
[04:05] few days he's really come out of shell
[04:07] his confidence has come out and a little
[04:09] bit of puppy biting came with it we knit
[04:11] that in the bud really quickly I
[04:13] practiced what I preach in My Perfect
[04:14] Puppy course and we were able to get
[04:16] puppy biting pretty much nipped in the
[04:19] bud no pun intended we will probably
[04:21] have a few little bouts of it coming
[04:23] back and we'll just continue to use our
[04:25] interruptions that are now really well
[04:27] conditioned with him and he understands
[04:28] what they mean so we can again no pun
[04:30] intended nip it in the buard really
[04:32] quickly no issues and again I can come
[04:35] down give him belly scratches I could
[04:38] tickle him under his chin and we've got
[04:40] no issues here play with his paes under
[04:42] his belly of him wanting to kind of bite
[04:44] me so again really really positive now I
[04:47] think that pretty much covers all of the
[04:49] manners piece of the puzzle let's move
[04:51] on to socialization now socialization
[04:53] again has been wonderful I do socialize
[04:56] my dogs from day one we don't wait for
[04:59] all of the vaccinations to be done he's
[05:01] already had two of his three
[05:02] vaccinations with the breeder and he's
[05:04] got his third one booked in for next
[05:06] week however we've been getting after it
[05:08] it has helped that we've been doing a
[05:09] full renovation here at my house and
[05:12] through that wall is our kitchen which
[05:14] has been completely ripped out smash the
[05:16] pieces and been rebuilt in the last week
[05:18] and they're nearly there the noises and
[05:21] the SES and the people coming and going
[05:23] and the trades people coming and going
[05:24] has just provided tons of opportunity
[05:26] for socialization which has been
[05:28] wonderful we've also had him by traffic
[05:30] loads we do live on a fairly busy street
[05:33] so we can just kind of go out and watch
[05:34] the traffic periodically absolutely
[05:37] perfect we've also have taken him to the
[05:40] gym twice this week where he's come
[05:42] we've taken a place bed and he has
[05:44] placed for 90 minutes in the gym and
[05:47] it's been a strongman gym that we've
[05:49] gone to so there's been Atlas Stones
[05:50] flying there's been log presses going
[05:53] big dead lifts people dropping massive
[05:55] weights and again he's just been hanging
[05:58] out chilling taking it call in learning
[06:00] to be an amazing dog that's not really
[06:02] phased no matter what's going on in life
[06:04] all of that achieved in week one we also
[06:07] took him to what we call a Makers Market
[06:09] here which is kind of like a farmers
[06:10] market and he saw literally hundreds if
[06:13] not probably low thousands of people
[06:15] yesterday selling all different types of
[06:18] stuff with all different types of smells
[06:20] that went brilliantly we then took him
[06:21] into a friend's coffee shop and we hung
[06:23] out in a coffee shop for 15 minutes then
[06:25] today he's been over to work with me
[06:28] he's been to my Paddock Mall multiple
[06:29] times this week that's all gone
[06:31] brilliantly he's met my other dogs
[06:33] that's all gone absolutely beautifully
[06:35] and then tonight me and my wife we went
[06:37] to the pub and we took him with us to
[06:39] the pub he's just spent the last 90
[06:41] minutes took a little bit of his vet bed
[06:43] in to provide a little bit of a place
[06:45] and he's been relaxed on his vet beding
[06:47] in a busy Pub watching waitresses and
[06:49] waiters running coming and going noises
[06:51] from the kitchen it's nice open kitchen
[06:53] Pub bar stuff going on people laughing
[06:56] and drinking and having a great time and
[06:58] again my mate regie has just been an
[07:00] absolute Legend taking it all in so
[07:02] socialization for week one has been
[07:05] superb we're just going to keep that
[07:06] going now and try and find as many
[07:08] different unique opportunities to be
[07:10] able to socialize him so that he remains
[07:12] this calm consistent Perfect k and I
[07:14] companion then it goes on to obedience
[07:17] now of the three areas obedience was the
[07:19] one that especially early on in the week
[07:21] I thought was going to be slower than
[07:23] the other two first couple of days
[07:25] wasn't interested in food whatsoever
[07:27] very common when you bring a puppy home
[07:29] that they can go off their food a little
[07:30] bit it's quite a stressful experience
[07:32] coming away from Mom and the lates to a
[07:34] new environment new people and it's not
[07:36] uncommon for them to go off their food
[07:37] so for the first couple of days we
[07:39] didn't get tons of work done but as his
[07:42] confidence has come up his appetite's
[07:44] come up and his food drives come up so
[07:46] the last few days in particular we've
[07:48] really been able to kind of get stuck
[07:50] into his obedience now for me I
[07:52] personally believe people Rush obedience
[07:54] way too much and they move on to new
[07:56] things way too quickly before they've
[07:58] proofed and generalized the behavior
[08:00] that they're trying to teach so with
[08:01] Reggie I'm breaking it down into smaller
[08:03] chunks and we're taking our time the
[08:06] main focus was on conditioning his
[08:08] marker I've actually been using a
[08:10] clicker in the past I've used a verbal
[08:12] marker of yes for my kind of um terminal
[08:16] marker if you guys want to kind of get
[08:17] really fancy on it but this time I've
[08:19] transitioned over to a clicker it's a
[08:21] really cool clicker it's the clickers
[08:23] that were used in World War II on D-Day
[08:25] the same Factory using the same tools
[08:27] and the same presses still make those EX
[08:29] exact same clickers that single story
[08:32] kind of got me hooked and went you know
[08:33] what I'm going to move over and give
[08:34] clickers another try and this week I've
[08:37] fallen head over heels with clicker
[08:38] training I'm good with verbal markers
[08:41] but I feel like a behavior sniper when
[08:43] it comes to using a clicker I can be so
[08:46] millisecond precise with them I'm really
[08:48] enjoying clicker training with Reggie so
[08:51] that's gone really well we conditioned
[08:52] the clicker then we did loads of work on
[08:54] his engagement which is teaching him his
[08:57] name and that his name actually means
[08:59] look up to me for guidance and Direction
[09:00] because I'm about to ask you to do
[09:01] something else so I need you focus on me
[09:03] now then we moved on to teaching him sit
[09:06] that went really well his a German
[09:07] Shepherd he's very clever he picked it
[09:09] up really quickly but we did have a bit
[09:11] of a problem if he's a very pory puppy
[09:14] he likes to use his paes so for the last
[09:16] couple of days again rather than rushing
[09:18] on we've been really taking our time and
[09:21] trying to bring out that pouring
[09:23] Behavior purely positively just using
[09:25] kind of basic patient principles of
[09:28] marking the sit beh avior as soon as the
[09:30] sit happens but not getting access to
[09:32] the reward until all four are on the
[09:34] floor it took a couple of sessions for
[09:36] him to really start to grasp it we did
[09:38] have a little bit of frustration of him
[09:39] trying to work out what was what but you
[09:41] saw the moment that the penny dropped
[09:42] when he realized oh he gives me the
[09:44] reward when my feet are on the floor and
[09:46] that's about 90% gone now when he's very
[09:49] excited or when we first start a session
[09:51] we might get a little bit of pouring and
[09:53] then as soon as he doesn't get the treat
[09:55] and he get he goes oh yeah I remember
[09:57] and he catches himself so I'm very
[09:58] confident that that's going to phase
[10:00] away and that takes us to the end of The
[10:02] Obedience and that is Reggie's first
[10:05] week here with me and it's gone
[10:08] beautifully successfully I'm incredibly
[10:10] happy chuffed a bits with the progress
[10:12] that we've made my whole family have
[10:13] been super consistent even my young kids
[10:16] who are eight and five have been really
[10:18] trying to focus and pay attention and
[10:20] get involved with the training and and
[10:21] not make the mistakes that a lot of kids
[10:23] make and I've explained to them why
[10:24] we're doing things so that's all been
[10:26] great and he's dropped into the family
[10:28] lovely May May I'll touch on a bit more
[10:30] the around the other dogs and
[10:31] introducing him to the other dogs cuz I
[10:33] maybe take that for granted of how well
[10:35] that went but that was perfect I now
[10:37] have um my English Mastiff e passed away
[10:40] earlier in the year so we have got two
[10:42] dogs Sully my work in line Labrador who
[10:45] is kind of my role model dog as a in my
[10:47] work as a behaviorist but he is right on
[10:49] the cusp of being retired from that now
[10:51] CU he's he's getting on he's a senior
[10:53] dog and a lot of his kind of characters
[10:56] uh we W go into detail that's another
[10:59] video
[10:59] but he's going to be ready for
[11:00] retirement and that's one of the
[11:02] potential roots for Reggie is that he
[11:04] might replace Uncle Sully as my next
[11:06] role model dog um but I introduce them
[11:09] first just cuz Uncle Sully is Uncle
[11:11] Sully for a reason the energy he was so
[11:13] perfect and I wasn't surprised that that
[11:15] went beautifully we did that on the
[11:17] first day we held off introducing puppy
[11:19] until the second day just cuz puppy is a
[11:22] gamebred pretty hardcore uh guarding
[11:25] breed who is hyper skeptical of anything
[11:27] new coming into her environment
[11:29] I knew it'd be fine I know I've got
[11:31] complete control over puppy but just
[11:33] that energy that she brings into any
[11:35] equation um is just a lot and I wanted
[11:38] to kind of not overwhelm him in that
[11:40] first day so I used Uncle su's energy in
[11:43] day one then we brought puppy's energy
[11:45] in in day two and that went beautifully
[11:47] it went exactly as I imagined puppy was
[11:49] quite stiff and she postured and she
[11:50] kind of worked him out um realized he
[11:53] was no threat whatsoever he was
[11:55] beautiful he behaved perfectly as a kind
[11:58] of a a well rounded well-bred dog should
[12:01] Testament to his breeder and the kind of
[12:03] work that he'd done and how mum was with
[12:06] them and how she's been able all of that
[12:08] beautiful really cool early kind of
[12:10] Developmental stuff sha through puppy
[12:13] took to him straight away and they've
[12:15] become really quite nice mates actually
[12:16] this week that's been lovely to see and
[12:18] I expected that because I chose Reggie
[12:20] for the energy that he has and we were
[12:23] very kind of specific of why we chose
[12:25] him and he clearly has a real desire to
[12:28] follow strong leadership which works
[12:30] really nicely for me um but when he
[12:33] encounters other dogs that display
[12:35] strong leadership like puppy does um
[12:38] he's kind of dropped in with her really
[12:39] nicely PLS along behind her um when she
[12:42] stops he stops when she goes he goes
[12:44] really nice little flourishing
[12:46] relationship there so I think they're
[12:48] going to be a lovely little free dog
[12:49] Dynamic um I am expecting just kind of
[12:53] to give you a glimpse into the future
[12:55] Pat Dynamics I know a lot of people
[12:57] worry about it if you haven't got much
[12:58] experience with it um when he kind of
[13:01] goes through puberty or that
[13:02] testosterone kicks in that him and puppy
[13:06] will kind of have to work that out and
[13:08] obviously as the leader of our pack I'm
[13:11] going to help make sure that that's
[13:12] worked out safely and effectively um but
[13:15] that might be a little roadblock in
[13:16] their relationship that has to be
[13:17] addressed at some point but I will help
[13:19] address them and I'll happily share how
[13:22] I do that when I do that um but I think
[13:24] it will go very well uh and I think my
[13:27] mate Reggie here will be an absolute
[13:29] Superstar Ain that right bud you are a
[13:31] good lad and as you can see this whole
[13:33] time here he's just been chilling on his
[13:35] place bed chewing his stick like a good
[13:36] boy um there's not many adult dogs that
[13:39] could have this level of kind of
[13:40] self-control um and impulse control and
[13:43] be able to play Stay this for a amount
[13:44] of time so Tru the bits that's kind of
[13:48] week one done if you liked this video
[13:50] I'm happy to kind of keep these weekly
[13:52] updates coming hopefully drop all the
[13:54] value nuggets that I'm kind of doing

[00:00] if you are the kind of person that can
[00:01] raise and train a border collie to be
[00:03] kind of exactly what you want with them
[00:05] you'll obviously be able to bring
[00:07] another border collie in you could
[00:08] definitely bring a doberman in I think
[00:10] you'd be skilled enough you just have to
[00:11] understand that their drives are going
[00:12] to be very different so the college site
[00:16] Drive working Drive engagement drive
[00:18] that they're intense you're going to get
[00:20] similar levels of intensity from the
[00:22] Doberman but that can be in then more
[00:24] kind of
[00:25] a defensive intensity guarding intensity
[00:29] so you then need to make sure that you
[00:31] how you would harness that intensity
[00:33] from a collie and channel it into
[00:35] certain Avenues with a doberman you need
[00:37] to harness that intensity and channel it
[00:39] into certain Avenues while
[00:40] simultaneously leading both of those
[00:43] dogs from a place of Love kindness and
[00:45] empathy communicating what you do want
[00:47] what you don't want consistently fairly
[00:49] day after day after day and you're
[00:51] absolutely smash it

[00:00] you can't let your dog off in public
[00:01] places anyway which quite frankly I
[00:04] never really recommend people do anyway
[00:05] which is why I'm not kind of Die Hard on
[00:08] remote collars a lot of remote collar
[00:10] Advocates would be like yeah because it
[00:11] stops dogs chasing sheep in fields I'm
[00:14] friends with Farmers don't let your dog
[00:16] off lead in fields where there's
[00:18] livestock just don't do it you don't
[00:20] need to walk them nicely on a lead
[00:21] they're still getting beautiful
[00:22] exercising out in the countryside don't
[00:25] take risks don't set your dog up to fail
[00:28] don't ruin other people's experiences
[00:30] and don't harm livestock and people's
[00:33] ability to make money and provide for
[00:35] their families so that's why kind of
[00:37] like again if he callers were banned in
[00:38] the UK which many people are trying to
[00:40] do so that's a shame because I use that
[00:42] tool to save certain dogs lives in
[00:44] certain cases
[00:46] but cool let's crack on we just have to
[00:48] accept that understand what the reality
[00:51] of that is and now here are the other
[00:52] 100 things that we have in our toolbox
[00:54] that are still left to work with

[00:00] should you allow your dog on the sofa
[00:02] well for me the answer is really easy up
[00:06] goodbye something Riley up up yes
[00:11] can you get your dog to wait patiently
[00:14] until they're invited up and can you get
[00:16] your dog to get down when you ask them
[00:18] to if the answer to that is yes then I
[00:21] have no problem with your dog being on
[00:22] the sofa if the answer to that is no
[00:24] well then they shouldn't be and you need
[00:26] to work on that first rules boundaries
[00:29] and expectations are incredibly
[00:31] important because they further the most
[00:33] important aspect of dog ownership which
[00:35] is leadership because leadership is love

TRANSCRIPTION:

[00:00] one of my pet dog training principles is
[00:03] about eye contact and it's about having
[00:05] the dog look up to you for guidance and
[00:07] direction if I was to say go back and
[00:10] have a new dog I TR for g dog purposes
[00:13] would you steer away from that because
[00:15] you want them out marking I've noticed
[00:17] your look at you beautifully and that
[00:20] for me warms my heart cuz that's
[00:21] something that I teach so much but I
[00:23] wondered in that situation where you're
[00:25] like almost I don't want you to look at
[00:27] me if youve marked that so B yeah so
[00:31] that's actually something that you teach
[00:32] them there there's a cue for it so most
[00:35] of the time if you're just walking about
[00:36] in that I would like a bit of eye
[00:38] contact from them so you'll see that
[00:39] they'll look at me yeah which from my
[00:41] perspective is beautiful yeah so if
[00:43] there's a bird if if I see something
[00:45] coming and I want them to Mark something
[00:46] out there I've got a q for that that's
[00:48] built up so it's just
[00:51] Mark so I point the direction same Mark
[00:54] and they're looking out for something to
[00:56] fall out of the sky yeah

TRANSCRIPTION:

[00:00] flexi leads the big question amongst
[00:03] many trainers one of the most
[00:04] controversial tools I would argue in
[00:06] some training circles flexi leads can be
[00:09] more controversial than like prong
[00:10] collars and e-collars people get really
[00:12] upset about them for me it kind of goes
[00:14] back to what we talked about around
[00:15] prong collars a flex lead is nothing
[00:17] more than at all and it's a tool that
[00:20] when used in the right way can be
[00:21] brilliant and I know trainers that I
[00:23] think are world-class best of the best
[00:25] that use them and when they use them
[00:28] it's they use them beautifully they're
[00:30] great because they don't get all if
[00:31] you're using a long line and they get
[00:33] you're outside and they get wet and
[00:34] clogged up and Tangled and knotted it's
[00:37] a pain so they can be brilliant for
[00:39] stuff like that they can be brilliant
[00:41] for giving kind of structured space for
[00:43] your dog but on the flip side they can
[00:46] be terrible if you've got a reactive dog
[00:48] using a flexi lead and giving them too
[00:50] much space is an absolute Nightmare and
[00:52] a terrible idea so like any tool used in
[00:55] the right way they can be brilliant used
[00:56] in the wrong way they can be absolutely
[00:58] disastrous

[00:00] now how do you make the act of walking
[00:02] your dog go from the chore of your day
[00:04] which is what it is for most people to
[00:07] the joy of your day which it is for me
[00:10] and all of my clients that I help
[00:12] achieve this beautiful loose lead walk
[00:14] and that is the answer it's being able
[00:17] to walk your dog on a loose lead and for
[00:20] them to be by your side this allows me
[00:22] to relax I'm not worrying about the dogs
[00:26] head back chest up and I'm enjoying the
[00:30] Countryside with the dogs that we have
[00:31] in at my center today and my pack of
[00:33] role model dogs it's an absolutely
[00:36] beautiful experience it's not a painful
[00:39] experience it's not a frustrating
[00:40] experience if I see another dog in the
[00:42] distance I don't care I know that I have
[00:44] control over my pack all of those things
[00:48] remove stress make it more positive for
[00:50] both of us and turn the chore of the day
[00:53] into the joy of the day now the lead is
[00:56] the single most important tool that you
[00:58] have at your disposal if you want to
[01:00] have a dog that is under control and the
[01:02] most important thing that you need to
[01:04] remember is that this lead should always
[01:06] be loose unless you are consciously
[01:09] delivering a piece of communication to
[01:11] your dog for a reason now dogs have what
[01:15] we call oppositional reflex so do you if
[01:18] I pushed you your natural inclination
[01:21] would be to lean back into it what we
[01:23] want to teach our dogs is some
[01:25] fundamentals of lead pressure that we
[01:27] can teach them to go with the pressure
[01:29] rather than to dig in against it that
[01:32] allows you to be able to navigate your
[01:34] dog through situations with fractional
[01:36] pieces of pressure what that looks like
[01:38] is if I put a bit of pressure this way
[01:40] for Sully he comes this way this way he
[01:42] doesn't dig in against it he goes that
[01:44] way now if you want a perfectly behaved
[01:46] dog you need to have a dog that walks
[01:48] beautifully on a loose lead by your side
[01:51] is one of my mandatory requirements if
[01:53] you want my help with your dog and if
[01:55] you've watched me for any amount of time
[01:57] you'll know that the tuneup drill is one
[01:59] one of my fundamental pieces of the
[02:02] puzzle now the important thing to
[02:04] remember is that your dog is never
[02:05] trained even my own personal role model
[02:08] dog Uncle Sully every now and again
[02:10] needs tuning up and this morning his
[02:12] loose lead walking wasn't perfect so I
[02:15] thought I'd bring you along as I cheun
[02:17] him up a little bit we've got loads of
[02:19] distractions that you can see he's
[02:20] interested in and we're going to let's
[02:22] go work on tuning him up there perfect
[02:26] he wasn't paying attention to me now
[02:28] Look at the difference from one little
[02:30] inside tuneup I've already made it
[02:33] infinitely better outside tuneup inside
[02:37] tuneup from 15 seconds of just dialing
[02:40] things back up I've taken his loose lead
[02:43] walking from great back to exactly where
[02:46] I need it to be which means our
[02:48] engagement is better which means our
[02:49] obedience is better which means he's
[02:51] more in control once you've built the
[02:54] foundations of loose lead walking it
[02:56] literally takes seconds to stay on top
[02:58] of it do that for the rest of your dog's
[03:01] life and you'll have dream K9 companions
[03:03] like Uncle Sully and a lot of people
[03:05] focus on the lead piece of the equation
[03:08] the tuneup piece of the equation the
[03:09] challenging the piece of the equation
[03:11] but that's only one part of it we can
[03:13] never forget that we do need to teach
[03:15] our dogs what we do want in the form of
[03:16] a heal command and how do we go about
[03:19] doing that well it's very
[03:20] straightforward we take something that
[03:22] the dog enjoys and we start the basic
[03:24] principles of teaching them a heal
[03:25] command so we break and I get Cole's
[03:27] attention here and I lure him yes into
[03:31] the heal position and there are tons of
[03:33] different varieties but all the
[03:35] principle is is that with this piece of
[03:38] food I'm going to keep him luring in
[03:42] this position whenever he stays in this
[03:45] position good boy yes he gets access to
[03:49] the food and obviously there's loads of
[03:51] different steps to that but that's the
[03:52] basic principle of Ling heel just like
[03:55] how we would lure a sit or lure a down
[03:58] we can lure a dog into a heel position
[04:01] that's the foundations and then we build
[04:03] on it from
[04:08] there

[00:00] [Music]
[00:05] so what kind of training should you be
[00:07] doing with your dog every single day if
[00:09] you want an amazing K and I companion
[00:11] well I'm going to let you in for a
[00:12] little secret it doesn't have to be
[00:14] crazy fancy things like coming to
[00:15] agility or Protection work or GG work
[00:18] that can be really fun to do and if you
[00:20] and your dog would enjoy it I actively
[00:23] encourage it but for you to have a
[00:24] perfect K Andi companion the drill that
[00:27] I think you should be doing every day is
[00:28] my Sit Stay break drill think of all the
[00:31] things that your dog loves we're not
[00:33] going to not let them have it but we're
[00:35] simply going to find ways to ask them to
[00:37] sit wait and then to break and they can
[00:41] have access to it meal times is a
[00:43] classic example going outside to play
[00:45] another classic example coming up on the
[00:47] furniture a great example if you do that
[00:50] every single time your dog will start to
[00:52] realize that everything great in its
[00:54] life comes through you and for them to
[00:56] get the amazing things in life they have
[00:58] to sit with good manners and wait
[01:00] patiently because that is the essence of
[01:02] a perfect k&i companion how do you build
[01:05] your dog's confidence if you have a shy
[01:07] nervous or passive dog do you have to
[01:09] bring them to places like this and do
[01:11] amazing agility work should you be doing
[01:13] fancy levels of obedience should it be
[01:15] more socialization well for me it's a
[01:18] two-step process first of all we have to
[01:20] step back and ensure are we being a
[01:22] clear consistent loving leader for our
[01:25] dogs nine times out of 10 dogs are
[01:28] nervous anxious or fearful that's not
[01:30] the case so we start with ourselves once
[01:33] we become our dog's loving leader who
[01:35] can give them clear consistent
[01:37] communication then we want to start
[01:39] slowly pushing them out of their comfort
[01:40] zone and that might be coming and doing
[01:42] agility that might be doing some fun g
[01:45] dog work it might be doing some basic
[01:47] trick training but slowly building their
[01:50] confidence by pushing them out of their
[01:52] comfort zone a little bit at a time you
[01:54] build better relationship better
[01:56] communication and both you and your dog
[01:58] are happier so how do you you socialize
[02:00] your dog most people think that
[02:02] socialization is just taking them to
[02:04] loads of different places to see loads
[02:05] of different people and loads of
[02:07] different things and that's not actually
[02:09] the case when it comes to socialization
[02:11] what we're trying to do is desensitize
[02:13] them to some triggers and we want to
[02:15] habitualized them to others now we can
[02:17] get all fancy clinical behavior on those
[02:20] topics and it doesn't need to be that
[02:22] complicated what we want to have dog to
[02:24] do is to be able to remain calm and
[02:27] engaged with us no matter what's going
[02:29] on around them we don't do that by just
[02:31] chucking them in at the deep end and
[02:33] expecting that to be the case we build
[02:35] amazing engagement with them first by
[02:37] being their loving leader in low
[02:39] distraction and then over time we slowly
[02:42] increase those distraction levels whilst
[02:44] maintaining that kind of Engagement and
[02:46] Leadership and eventually that
[02:48] desensitization and habituation happens
[02:51] for us and you'll have that perfect dog
[02:53] you can take anywhere what is the best
[02:55] way to start your day with your dog well
[02:57] for me it's simple it's taking the for a
[03:00] walk it's no secret that I am a huge
[03:02] advocate for loose lead heel walking for
[03:04] a variety of reasons some for the dog we
[03:07] build amazing leadership with them we
[03:09] build amazing engagement with them we
[03:11] get some exercise and mental stimulation
[03:13] out the way early we can use it as an
[03:15] opportunity to work on our threshhold
[03:17] manners and our six day break drills but
[03:20] also it means that you get out in the
[03:22] morning you get to enjoy some fresh air
[03:24] which is wonderful for your mental
[03:26] health as well so in the morning get up
[03:28] take your dog out for a walk make it a
[03:31] joy of your day not the chore of your
[03:33] day and both you and your dog will be
[03:42] happier

[00:00] now if you want perfect recall with your
[00:02] dog Holcomb there are loads of different
[00:04] games that you can play with your dog
[00:06] and we're working on Cole's recall today
[00:08] doing a game called partner recall every
[00:11] time he recalls over to my partner
[00:13] colcom he comes back to me and we're
[00:15] bouncing him back and forward making the
[00:18] game of recall crazy fun for Cole he
[00:21] starts to understand goldcon not only
[00:24] what the recall means good boy but every
[00:29] time he has a successful rep he earns
[00:32] food for it he earns praise he earns
[00:34] toys Qualcomm and this builds up this
[00:38] concept that recall is amazing
[00:41] and is one of the foundational

[00:00] now although you see me work with lots

[00:03] guarding breeds I do work with little

[00:08] super cute chihuahua mixed breed come
[00:10] into my Center displaying a lot of
[00:12] reactivity and a huge lack of Engagement
[00:14] which was making it really difficult for

[00:18] dog anywhere in public and they live in
[00:20] a busy place so it absolutely like their
[00:22] dog to accompany them in life now this
[00:24] was absolutely a bread and butter case
[00:26] we do the observational sessions to
[00:28] diagnose exactly where these problems
[00:30] are coming from which then informs my
[00:32] training sessions throughout the day we
[00:34] absolutely needed to build engagement we
[00:36] needed to build trust and like 99 of the
[00:39] cases I work with we had to instill
[00:41] leadership once we did that you see the
[00:44] weight of the world to come off the
[00:45] dog's shoulders then they start looking
[00:46] up to you for guidance and Direction
[00:48] those communication Pathways become wide
[00:50] open rather than full of friction when
[00:52] the dog wants to communicate with you
[00:54] it's funny just how easy communicating
[00:56] with them becomes

[00:00] stop letting people pet your dog when
[00:02] you're out and about with your dog
[00:03] people have no right to pet them but
[00:06] it's your job to advocate for your dogs
[00:09] you need to tell people not to
[00:11] especially if your dog's in training or
[00:13] they're suffering from any kind of fear
[00:15] anxiety or reactive behaviors my three
[00:18] top tips to help you achieve this is
[00:20] muzzle train your dog even if you don't
[00:22] think they need it people will not want
[00:25] to come and pet a dog that's got a
[00:26] muzzle on they'll presume that they're
[00:28] aggressive the second option is to get a
[00:30] patch on your dog's lead or harness
[00:32] saying do not pet make it obvious to
[00:36] people that you don't want them to and
[00:38] last but not least you need to step up
[00:40] and be a little bit braver if you're
[00:42] worried that somebody's going to do it
[00:44] simply tell them not to and you could be
[00:46] nice about it tell them sorry my dog's
[00:48] in training oh sorry my dog's reactive
[00:51] oh sorry please just leave them alone
[00:53] but we have to step up and Lead our dogs
[00:56] because remember leadership is love

[00:00] I'm gonna go as far as to say this is
[00:02] the worst puppy biting we've ever seen
[00:03] so we have a young German Shepherd here
[00:06] who although is a pretty lovable Rogue
[00:08] is displaying behaviors that are
[00:10] completely unacceptable right now the
[00:13] dog is literally dragging my cameraman's
[00:15] jeans and boots on but this is the
[00:17] behavior if you try to stop me doing
[00:19] something I get frustrated I bite but
[00:22] for me number one priority right now is
[00:24] to give this dog an off switch and help
[00:26] it understand that no means no stop what
[00:29] you're doing right now then I'm going to
[00:31] give you loads of positive Alternatives
[00:33] and we're going to do loads of fun stuff
[00:35] and you're going to get loads of
[00:36] positive reinforcement and praise but
[00:38] when I tell you you can't do something
[00:40] you stop this is a lovely dog it's
[00:42] hurting me it's biting me and it's
[00:45] unacceptable and it's ruining my lovely
[00:47] boots and these are my favorite boots so
[00:49] let's show you how we fix that and get
[00:50] that stopped right now when it comes to
[00:53] fixing mouthing behaviors I want to be
[00:56] able to turn it off with a verbal so we
[00:57] need to do what is called an empowered
[00:59] verbal mind powered verbal is probably
[01:01] going to be a noise right now it doesn't
[01:04] get the dog to stop doing anything
[01:06] because it doesn't mean anything to the
[01:08] dog so I need to classically condition
[01:10] that to a physical correction so that
[01:12] the dog understands that that means stop
[01:14] doing what you're doing right now then
[01:16] over time the physical correction is no
[01:18] longer needed and the dog understands
[01:20] that when you hear that noise stop doing
[01:22] what it is that you're doing in the live
[01:24] footage that you're about to see you're
[01:26] going to watch me correct this Behavior
[01:28] but so much happens so quickly that I
[01:31] know you're going to have a lot of
[01:32] questions about the correction
[01:33] specifically so it's really important
[01:36] that we talk about it now to explain so
[01:38] that you can get this right yourself at
[01:41] home the correction you're about to see
[01:43] me utilize is something called an active
[01:45] correction that I'm going to pair with
[01:47] my verbal correction as we've just
[01:48] discussed to really get on top of this
[01:50] puppy biting incredibly quickly when it
[01:52] comes to puppy biting I think you can
[01:54] use two different types of active
[01:56] Corrections you can use what you're
[01:58] about to see me do which is a touchdown
[01:59] correction or you can utilize a lead
[02:02] correction if you feel more comfortable
[02:03] with that the touch correction is
[02:05] nothing more than making this kind of
[02:07] shape with my hand and you'll see me
[02:10] utilize this with the dog in the
[02:11] following clip the other option if you
[02:14] don't feel comfortable with that is to
[02:16] use something like my trusty slip lead
[02:18] you would place the slip lead on the dog
[02:19] high right behind the ears as it should
[02:21] be placed anyway and instead of the
[02:24] touch correction you would use a pop on
[02:26] the lead it isn't to pull on the lead
[02:28] it's just a nice quick short sharp pop
[02:30] on the lead now the next question you're
[02:32] going to ask is well how hard are you
[02:35] meant to do it and that is it depends
[02:37] your dog's puppy biting is going to be
[02:40] at a certain level of intensity for this
[02:42] to work you have to meet that level of
[02:44] intensity and go just slightly above it
[02:47] so if your dog's intensity of puppy
[02:49] biting is a level one or a two you only
[02:51] need to go to a level two or a three
[02:53] however if it's a five or a six you
[02:55] might need to go a little bit higher
[02:57] you'll know it's worked because it will
[02:59] get the dog to stop the biting and
[03:01] that's exactly what it is that you're
[03:03] looking for in the clip you're about to
[03:05] see because of my years of experience I
[03:07] do this very quickly and intuitively
[03:09] because I instinctively know what these
[03:12] levels should be however for new people
[03:14] like potentially yourself start low and
[03:17] if it Jacks your dog up if it gets the
[03:19] more excited it means that the level
[03:21] isn't high enough yet and you just need
[03:23] to creep that level up until you get the
[03:25] desired outcome of them understanding
[03:27] that they've made a mistake pair that
[03:29] with your verbal you Empower your verbal
[03:31] you'll have huge success so let's cut
[03:33] back to watch this unfold live in front
[03:35] of your eyes
[03:37] foreign
[03:50] this will address later
[03:52] avoiding me now aim to this space
[03:56] much better
[03:59] testing what is it that happened good
[04:01] girl good good again it's being
[04:05] submitted towards me now made a bad
[04:08] mistake
[04:10] correction happened before we carry on
[04:12] with the live footage of this session I
[04:14] think it's important that we stop here
[04:15] those active corrections I completely
[04:18] understand that some people don't feel
[04:20] comfortable doing themselves whether
[04:23] that is a touch correction or a lead
[04:25] correction but when it comes to puppy
[04:27] biting you do have another option and
[04:29] it's what we call a passive correction I
[04:32] believe a passive correction isn't as
[04:34] effective as an active correction it
[04:36] doesn't have the knock-on benefits of
[04:38] building you up as a more assertive calm
[04:41] loving leader but if that active
[04:44] correction just doesn't gel well with
[04:46] you you can try the passive correction
[04:48] and it will make success with puppy
[04:50] biting as well to do it it's very simple
[04:52] you simply need to make sure that your
[04:54] dog is wearing a normal flat collar when
[04:56] the biting Behavior happens at the time
[04:59] that you would normally administer an
[05:01] active correction where you would use
[05:03] your verbal correction you still use the
[05:05] verbal correction but you hold the dog's
[05:08] collar you go incredibly stiff and
[05:10] assertive strong body posture the verbal
[05:13] correction have gone in and you hold
[05:15] that collar and you hold it until that
[05:18] dog relaxes some dogs they relax
[05:20] instantly some dogs might squirm a
[05:22] little bit and work out what's going on
[05:23] but eventually they'll understand that
[05:26] they need to relax as soon as they relax
[05:28] you let go of the collar if the bite in
[05:31] Behavior happens again verbal correction
[05:33] hold the collar until they relax and
[05:36] it's teaching them that same message of
[05:38] that that's unacceptable and what we're
[05:40] looking for is for them to calm down but
[05:44] like I say I do believe an active
[05:46] correction is much more efficient if
[05:48] you're willing to do so so let's cut
[05:50] back to the live footage and continue on
[05:52] this journey with the German Shepherd
[05:54] we're working with today
[05:55] better lovely submitting to me nice
[05:59] getting belly rubs making good decisions
[06:01] you make good decisions good things
[06:03] happen I'm not a big meanie I just
[06:05] really care about you I want to give you
[06:07] belly rubs I want you to have the best
[06:09] things in life
[06:12] yeah good see the difference now that
[06:15] one was the first time that I used just
[06:16] a verbal correction with no physical
[06:18] attached and that's shown that it's
[06:21] happening already
[06:22] the verbal correction is becoming
[06:24] empowered because I paired it with a
[06:26] physical one so that time I just needed
[06:28] that little noise just a reminder hey no
[06:29] no remember that's not what we do and
[06:31] although yes I'm the guy that's
[06:32] instilled some rules and boundaries I'm
[06:34] also the fun guy that does fun stuff
[06:38] what was this
[06:40] and these herding instincts yeah
[06:42] oh yes
[06:44] but don't put me in your mouth really
[06:46] easy if you do that for me
[06:49] all the lovely things in life are going
[06:51] to happen for you absolutely superb
[06:53] brilliant
[06:54] oh and they're dead now
[06:58] I think
[07:00] again sniff me don't put me in your
[07:02] mouth I'm gonna become a bit more play
[07:04] matey yeah good
[07:08] a bit submissive
[07:10] and she's returning the favor beautiful
[07:12] this is lovely this is absolutely what I
[07:15] like to see this is the dog that I need
[07:17] you to be be this dog and you're gonna
[07:18] have a wonderful life and you're gonna
[07:20] have all the fuss praise food and toys
[07:22] that you've ever wanted be that dog that
[07:24] you were earlier when you first came
[07:26] into me I'm gonna have to say no that's
[07:28] not acceptable because I have a duty of
[07:31] care to keep you safe because not only
[07:33] is leadership rules boundaries and
[07:35] expectations important
[07:37] not only is it better for me it's better
[07:40] for her and that is why I say leadership
[07:42] is love

TRANSCRIPTION:

[00:00] when it comes to puppy training by far
[00:02] the single biggest request that I get is
[00:05] about puppy biting it is something that
[00:08] time and time again nearly every single
[00:11] owner struggles with puppy biting but I
[00:14] promise you you do not need to struggle
[00:16] it's actually a very easy thing to deal
[00:19] with if you know my free steps on how to
[00:22] fix puppy biting which is exactly what
[00:24] I'm going to share with you in today's
[00:25] video guys it's so incredibly important
[00:28] that you understand that you must follow
[00:31] all three steps if you don't it won't
[00:34] work or you'll create problems elsewhere
[00:36] so please make sure that if you're going
[00:39] to get on top of puppy biting which is
[00:41] incredibly easy to be able to do that
[00:43] you follow all three steps first step in
[00:46] the process is that we must challenge
[00:49] the behavior which in this situation is
[00:51] obviously puppy biting now what you must
[00:54] not do is squeal like the dogs hurt you
[00:57] roll away turn your back none of that is
[00:59] productive to the ultimate goal of
[01:01] becoming your dog's loving calm
[01:04] consistent leader so moving forward
[01:06] every time that your puppy demonstrates
[01:09] the wrong Behavior which is putting any
[01:11] part of you in their mouth you must
[01:13] challenge that behavior and you can do
[01:14] it one of two ways you can use an active
[01:17] correction which you can use something
[01:19] like a slip lead and it's just a minor
[01:21] little bit of pressure or you can use a
[01:23] passive correction where you would hold
[01:25] your dog's collar nice and firm until
[01:27] they calm down and relax but either way
[01:30] you have to help the dog understand that
[01:32] they've done something wrong and the way
[01:33] we do that is whilst correcting and
[01:35] challenging the behavior we use a verbal
[01:38] correction but we only use this verbal
[01:40] correction when we're challenging the
[01:41] behavior so what that might look like if
[01:43] we're using something like a slip lead
[01:45] is as we provide a little bit of
[01:47] pressure we might use an at noise it
[01:49] might be at or a no no or a CH noise
[01:54] all of those are verbal Corrections that
[01:57] I will use with the dogs I'm working
[01:58] with which one you choose is completely
[02:00] up to you but it's a minor little bit of
[02:03] pressure it's just enough to help the
[02:04] dog snap out of it we're not trying to
[02:06] hurt them we're not punishing them we're
[02:08] just trying to snap them out of the
[02:10] behavior and communicating to them that
[02:12] they've done something that we don't
[02:13] want them to do now step two is a easier
[02:17] one and step two is to redirect the dog
[02:20] slowly up up
[02:21] yeah good boy once you've challenged the
[02:24] undesirable Behavior now we're going to
[02:27] redirect them to the desirable Behavior
[02:29] we're going to be fair loving leaders
[02:32] say hey you're doing something wrong but
[02:35] as your leader it's my job to teach you
[02:37] what it is that I do want which is to
[02:39] chew on these things so we're going to
[02:41] have access to toys and choose things
[02:44] that your dog can and should be putting
[02:46] in their mouth and when they make the
[02:48] mistake of chewing something that they
[02:50] shouldn't we challenge that behavior but
[02:53] then we quickly redirect them to chewing
[02:55] and biting on something that we do want
[02:57] them to chew you can't just have the
[02:59] first two steps we need the third step
[03:02] to truly master and capture the behavior
[03:05] that we're trying to have our dogs
[03:07] understand ready
[03:10] yeah good girl don't worry I'm not going
[03:13] to ask you to do that one so now we've
[03:15] done step one and step two we can move
[03:17] on to step three Come On Eileen come on
[03:20] yes yes keep going keep going keep going
[03:25] oh you're such a clever girl and that is
[03:28] this it's rewarding the desirable
[03:30] behavior for big old Eileen here getting
[03:33] up on this challenging obstacle is
[03:35] really difficult so when she does it
[03:37] well I'm gonna praise her and tell her
[03:39] how amazing she is and what a good job
[03:41] she's doing that's reinforcement it's
[03:44] rewarding the desirable Behavior now we
[03:47] reward that desirable Behavior so that
[03:50] that desirable behavior is captured and
[03:52] it's clear to the dog that that's what
[03:55] we want that's what we love and because
[03:57] everywhere else in the dog's life we're
[04:00] building a relationship with them based
[04:02] on our loving leadership with a dog that
[04:05] sees us as their loving leaders and
[04:08] because they do they want to please us
[04:11] they want to get it right but it's our
[04:13] job to teach them what right is and what
[04:16] wrong is so remember guys if you want to
[04:19] fix puppy biting today which can be
[04:21] achieved challenge the undesirable
[04:23] Behavior redirect them to the desirable
[04:26] Behavior then reward and praise that
[04:29] desirable Behavior when they display it
[04:31] so the undesirable behavior of biting
[04:33] comes down and down and down because
[04:35] every single time it happens we
[04:37] challenge it then when the desirable
[04:39] Behavior happens because we've
[04:41] redirected them to it or they're just
[04:42] making better decisions we reward it so
[04:44] that behavior happens more and more and
[04:46] more and we go from a dog that's biting
[04:48] all the time and never chewing what we
[04:50] want to a dog that never bites and only
[04:52] choose the things that we do want and
[04:54] that is how you have perfect canine
[04:57] companions

[00:00] is one of the worst pullers we've ever
[00:01] seen it's become a miserable experience
[00:03] for them finding it very difficult to
[00:05] walk it so it's not getting as much
[00:06] exercise or the behavior start to slip
[00:08] in goal of today is to go from a
[00:10] extremely bad puller through to
[00:12] beautiful heel walk and what we're going
[00:13] to do is start just doing some
[00:15] directional change Sandy let's go Sandy
[00:16] let's go good he's starting to engage
[00:20] with me already because he's waiting for
[00:21] me to make my movement now what you're
[00:24] about to see is the power of Engagement
[00:26] in this level of free shaping
[00:29] demeanor I'm in charge of this walk
[00:32] shoulders back head up literally walking
[00:35] in with a finger now the reason this
[00:37] works so well and I didn't have to jump
[00:39] to extreme levels of Correction is
[00:42] because of that engagement because it
[00:43] became responsive through the
[00:46] conditioning work that we did during the
[00:48] directional changes drills and in 20
[00:50] minutes his life has been transformed

[00:00] now having a dog that pulls on the lead
[00:01] is one of the most common problem
[00:03] behaviors and here at my center and
[00:05] online we have helped thousands of
[00:07] people go from terrible pulling all the
[00:09] way through to beautiful loose lead
[00:11] walking which is exactly what it should
[00:13] be now the good thing is that getting
[00:14] your dog to walk on a loose lead is way
[00:16] easier than most people think it is the
[00:19] first thing we have to be able to do is
[00:20] interrupt our dogs Behavior when they
[00:22] are pulling it's incredibly important
[00:24] that we have some way of communicating
[00:27] with them in a language that they
[00:29] understand that they need to bring their
[00:31] focus back to us once we can interrupt
[00:33] them making bad decisions we can
[00:35] redirect them to what it is that we do
[00:37] want which is teaching them a basic heal
[00:39] command a basic loose lead command and
[00:42] with those things we can then interrupt
[00:44] the bad behavior redirect them to the
[00:46] desirable behavior and then heavily
[00:48] praise reward and reinforce that

[00:00] bad behavior light pulling is we have to

[00:13] good George yes
[00:16] Good Boy George
[00:18] good we use these methods just to

[00:29] now going to move forward positively I
[00:31] need to redirect him to the behavior
[00:33] that I do want he's in the right

[00:10] things first you have to build up
[00:12] engagement you need your dog to
[00:14] understand that under all circumstances
[00:15] they look up to you for guidance and
[00:17] direction
[00:18] sneaky fact if they can see you they
[00:21] can't be in front of you so a byproduct
[00:23] of that is that with 90 there already
[00:25] the tune-up drill is beautiful to work
[00:28] on this next up we need to teach the
[00:30] what he or means and that's why we get
[00:31] to do tons of fun reward Based training
[00:34] of heal roaring marking shaping leveling
[00:37] it up bringing it out onto agility
[00:39] equipment and just having tons of fun
[00:41] and last but not least we put those two
[00:42] things together to help the dog
[00:43] understand exactly what it is that we do
[00:45] want with heal and obedience and exactly
[00:48] what it is that we don't want through
[00:49] engagement and communication put the two
[00:52] things together and you have a dog that
[00:54] will walk beautifully on a loose lead
[00:55] and you can absolutely be one of the
[00:57] thousands of people that I've helped
[00:58] achieve that exact thing

[00:00] I accepted the challenge to fix this
[00:02] dog's pulling in just one session when
[00:04] it comes to fixing dogs that pull
[00:05] terribly on a lead I usually like to
[00:07] have an entire day but this dog I only
[00:09] had one session so I had to condense it
[00:12] all down I dived in by teaching the dog
[00:14] that it must look up to me for guidance
[00:15] and Direction and follow my loving
[00:17] leadership then I taught it a new
[00:19] language that we could understand and
[00:20] speak to each other together through
[00:22] high levels of use of a lead but then
[00:24] more importantly after I achieved
[00:27] success with the dog I had to spend the
[00:28] rest of the session ensuring that the
[00:30] owners could do the same thing and teach
[00:32] them the skills that they need to be
[00:34] able to take the dog home and be able to
[00:36] walk it on a beautiful loose lead and
[00:38] turn what was the chore of their day
[00:40] into the joy of their day

[00:00] I'm always talking about the importance
[00:01] of loose lead walking and I make
[00:03] hundreds of different videos teaching
[00:05] you exactly how to do that and a lot of
[00:07] people focus on the lead piece of the
[00:09] equation the tune-up piece of the
[00:11] equation the challenging the piece of
[00:13] the equation but that's only one part of
[00:14] it we can never forget that we do need
[00:16] to teach our dogs what we do want in the
[00:18] form of a heal command and how do we go
[00:20] about doing that well it's very
[00:22] straightforward we take something that
[00:24] the dog enjoys and we start the basic
[00:26] principles of teaching them a heal
[00:27] command so we break and I get Cole's
[00:30] attention here
[00:31] and I lure him yes into the heel
[00:34] position and there are tons of different
[00:36] varieties but all the principle is is
[00:39] that with this piece of food I'm going
[00:41] to keep him
[00:43] luring in this position whenever he
[00:46] stays in this position
[00:48] good boy yes he gets access to the food
[00:51] that's the basic principle of lowering
[00:54] heel

[00:00] this dog training tip will take you from
[00:02] an average owner to an incredibly
[00:04] skilled one and that is making sure that
[00:07] you are prioritizing teaching your dog
[00:09] impulse control now what is impulse
[00:12] control that is when your dog has a
[00:14] desire to go and do something other than
[00:17] what it is that you've asked of them and
[00:19] they know how to control that impulse
[00:21] and remain focused on you this is
[00:25] something that you can teach your dog
[00:26] this is something that you can improve
[00:28] on with your dog and this is something
[00:30] you absolutely should be striving to
[00:33] achieve with your dog so that when
[00:35] you've asked them to do something and
[00:36] they really want to chase that squirrel
[00:38] they can control that impulse and you
[00:41] keep them safe and under control instead

[00:00] having a dog that jumps up people every
[00:01] time they meet someone is an absolute
[00:03] nightmare it might have been cute when
[00:05] they were puppies but as soon as they
[00:06] start to grow it can go from cute to
[00:09] frustrating to downright dangerous and
[00:11] in this video I'm going to explain in
[00:13] detail how you fix jumping instantly but
[00:16] before I show you the how it's really
[00:19] important that we understand the why
[00:21] because without the why the how is
[00:24] irrelevant it won't work if you don't
[00:26] understand why it is that we're doing
[00:28] what I'm going to show you to do now the
[00:31] theory behind what I'm about to show you
[00:33] is underpinned by something called
[00:35] operant conditioning now operant
[00:37] conditioning is just a fancy sciency
[00:39] word that explains how dogs learn how
[00:42] most animals learn humans included and
[00:44] we can break it into two categories the
[00:47] first category is how dogs learn to do
[00:51] something new the second category is how
[00:53] dogs learn not to do things quick
[00:56] humanly example of that would be if
[00:59] every time you brought me a coffee I
[01:02] gave you a hundred dollar bill there's a
[01:04] very good chance that you might want to
[01:06] bring me another coffee and if I give
[01:07] you a hundred dollar bill when you do
[01:09] that there's a very good chance that
[01:11] you're going to try and bring me as many
[01:12] coffees as possible to get as many
[01:15] hundred dollar bills as possible that is
[01:17] something called reinforcement positive
[01:19] reinforcement and that's one of the
[01:22] aspects of operant conditioning that
[01:23] we're going to be talking about later
[01:25] when it comes to stopping dogs from
[01:28] jumping the next human example would be
[01:31] that every time you see a fire if you
[01:33] put your hand into that fire you've got
[01:36] burnt there's a very good chance that
[01:38] you're not going to put your hand in the
[01:40] next fire that you see that's something
[01:43] called positive punishment and again
[01:45] it's the way that all animals learn it's
[01:47] how we learn how dogs learn what things
[01:50] we should do more of because they give
[01:52] us good results and what things we
[01:55] should do less of because they give us
[01:57] bad results but we're going to use those
[01:59] two examples with your new understanding
[02:02] of operant conditioning to really drive
[02:05] home that message of exactly how you can
[02:08] quickly stop your dog from jumping so
[02:11] now we've got that boring sciency Theory
[02:13] out the way we can put it into practice
[02:15] and the way that we're going to put it
[02:16] into practice to deal with jumping is
[02:19] we're going to do a three-step process
[02:21] and like most three-step processes it's
[02:23] really important that you follow all
[02:26] three steps or it won't work properly a
[02:29] three-step process naturally starts with
[02:31] step one which is you must learn how to
[02:35] challenge the undesirable behavior and
[02:38] when it comes to jump in it is the only
[02:40] way that you're truly going to be able
[02:42] to get on top of it this is where we're
[02:44] going to be tapping in to that positive
[02:46] punishment that we talked about we have
[02:48] to let the dogs understand in a language
[02:51] that they speak that they understand
[02:54] that jumping is unacceptable the method
[02:57] that we're going to follow is something
[02:58] called a leash correction paired with a
[03:02] verbal correction now the reason we're
[03:04] going to pair it is because we want to
[03:06] very quickly get to a point where we
[03:08] don't need any leash Corrections we
[03:10] don't need any physical Corrections and
[03:12] we can communicate to our dogs when
[03:14] they're doing something wrong we can use
[03:16] positive punishment with nothing more
[03:18] than our verbal correction when they
[03:20] jump up we're going to provide a slight
[03:22] bit of pressure and that pressure is
[03:24] nothing more than a little pop pop on
[03:27] the lead when we do that we're going to
[03:29] pair it with our verbal correction so
[03:31] that might look like a at or a no
[03:34] orange and a little you see that's a
[03:37] verbal correction that we've used here
[03:39] and Riley unfortunately thought she'd
[03:41] done something wrong but that is
[03:42] brilliant that's proof of the pudding
[03:44] that I didn't need to physically correct
[03:46] her and she looked at me with oh what am
[03:47] I doing wrong I'm sorry I didn't realize
[03:49] now that was a little bit unfair to her
[03:51] but it is a good demonstration of how
[03:53] when you do these things together you
[03:55] don't need physical correction all the
[03:57] time we do it in Little Bits to keep the
[04:00] dog safe to stop them hurting people
[04:02] when they jump up but when we do it in a
[04:04] smart way in a loving way in a balanced
[04:07] way with the other two steps that we're
[04:08] going to talk about in a minute we don't
[04:10] need physical Corrections in the future
[04:12] so after step one we can then move on to
[04:15] step two and step two is to redirect so
[04:20] we've corrected in Step One using a
[04:22] little bit of operant conditioning now
[04:24] we redirect the dog and we redirect them
[04:27] to what it is that we do want them to do
[04:29] instead now that might be different in
[04:32] different situations in some situation
[04:34] it might simply be what we call all four
[04:37] on the floor that might not need a
[04:39] command by simply challenging the
[04:41] behavior of jumping their four feet go
[04:43] back on the floor and then we're happy
[04:45] we have challenged and then redirected
[04:48] them to that behavior however it might
[04:50] end up being something a bit more
[04:51] advanced it might be a sit and stay or
[04:54] it might be a place and stay but we're
[04:55] going to leverage stuff that we've
[04:57] taught the dogs and we're going to
[04:59] redirect them to that because that's
[05:01] fair that's loving leadership then we
[05:04] get to move on to the third step and the
[05:06] third step is is the fun step it's the
[05:08] step that we all want to spend as much
[05:10] time in as possible but this is the step
[05:13] that will not work unless you use step
[05:15] one and two as well that's why it's so
[05:18] important we move on to step three which
[05:21] is going to positive reinforcement again
[05:23] every time you bring me a cup of coffee
[05:25] I give you a hundred dollars you're
[05:26] probably going to bring me more cups of
[05:28] coffee in the future exactly the same
[05:30] principle when the dog is displaying the
[05:32] behavior that we have redirected them to
[05:34] to we reward that behavior now that can
[05:37] be nothing more than this puppy's
[05:39] favorite thing in life is physical
[05:41] attention from me she's not very food
[05:43] driven and she's not very toy driven but
[05:45] she's very motivated by my physical
[05:47] praise so the fact that she's up here
[05:49] I've asked her to sit here and wait
[05:51] nicely because she's doing so she's
[05:54] getting a scratch behind the ear and a
[05:55] cuddle from me I am reinforcing this
[05:57] Behavior if we only did step three and
[06:00] only did the reward piece of the puzzle
[06:02] well if jumping up somebody is more fun
[06:05] to them is more rewarding to them than
[06:07] the reward that I can offer well they're
[06:09] going to choose to do that instead or
[06:10] maybe they just don't know that that's
[06:12] the thing that they shouldn't be doing
[06:13] so they're confused because it's a
[06:15] normal behavior for them to offer but if
[06:17] we only ever punish our dogs then we are
[06:19] going to create fear and anxiety we have
[06:22] to communicate don't do this but please
[06:24] do that please do this stop doing that
[06:27] challenge the Behavior when they do
[06:29] redirect them to what it is that you do
[06:31] want to see and when they're displaying
[06:33] that behavior here then you can praise
[06:36] and reward that behavior heavily you can
[06:38] apply all the food and treats and toys
[06:41] that you've always dreamed of but you
[06:43] can't have one without the other

[00:00] this is exactly how you stop your dog
[00:02] from jumping up people in as quick as
[00:04] just one day now as a Kine behaviorist
[00:06] I've helped literally thousands of
[00:07] people with a variety of behaviors one
[00:09] of the most common being a dog that
[00:11] jumps up people when they meet them yes
[00:13] it might have been cute when there were
[00:15] eight weeks 10 weeks 12 weeks but now
[00:17] you've got a full-size golden retriever
[00:19] or a Labrador or a German Shepherd even
[00:22] Jack Russell can be a nightm if they're
[00:24] jumping up everyone that they meet it
[00:26] means visitors won't want to come to
[00:27] your house it means you shouldn't be
[00:29] taking them out public if they a
[00:30] liability even if it's just getting
[00:32] Muddy Paws up their trousers jumping up
[00:34] can go from Annoying to incredibly
[00:37] dangerous and regardless of where it
[00:38] fits on that Spectrum it is absolutely
[00:41] something that you should be working on
[00:42] immediately now here at my K9 Training
[00:44] Center it is something that people bring
[00:46] their dogs to us for all the time and I
[00:48] want to break down the steps that we
[00:50] follow to help them get on top of
[00:52] jumping which should mean that you can
[00:53] get on top of jumping yourself at home
[00:55] now the first thing we do with all of
[00:56] our Behavior cases is a furer diagnosis
[00:59] of the dog you don't need to go into the
[01:01] detail that we do but we want to know
[01:03] the motivational state of the dog the
[01:05] emotional state of the dog
[01:07] characteristics temperament testing so
[01:09] that we have a thorough understanding of
[01:10] who the dog is and why they're doing the
[01:13] behavior that they're doing the vast
[01:15] majority of dogs however jump up because
[01:18] they love people so much and that they
[01:20] think or have learned that jumping up
[01:22] people gets them attention and get
[01:24] strokes praise and fuss so once we know
[01:27] exactly what's happening and exactly
[01:30] what we're dealing with we can then move
[01:31] into our training program and get to
[01:34] work now again most commonly it is
[01:37] exactly that issue that we're talking
[01:38] about and obviously we don't want to
[01:40] change a dog like that we want that dog
[01:42] to remain loving happy unfearful and
[01:46] excited to see other people however we
[01:48] has to change the behavior of them
[01:50] jumping up people to get that praise and
[01:53] to get that attention this is what we
[01:55] might refer to as operant counter
[01:57] conditioning and we have developed a
[01:59] special system of oper en counter
[02:01] conditioning that allows it to work
[02:02] incredibly well for all of our clients
[02:05] now that is some fancy behavior and
[02:07] training words but essentially what it
[02:09] means is that the dog sees a trigger
[02:11] which is a person that it wants
[02:13] attention from and rather than going
[02:16] there's a person I want attention from
[02:18] if I jump up that person I will get
[02:20] attention we need to switch that to
[02:22] think there is a person I want attention
[02:24] from if I sit wait patiently I will get
[02:28] attention from them that requ Rees a few
[02:30] steps to achieve it but it's very very
[02:32] doable the first step is that we
[02:34] interrupt the jumping Behavior the
[02:36] quickest way to do this is to utilize
[02:38] something like a slip lead which is the
[02:39] most common piece of equipment that we
[02:41] use here at the center for this process
[02:44] it needs to be fitted properly and it
[02:46] needs to be used properly so that we use
[02:49] it in no other terms than just a quick
[02:51] Interruption just a quick tap tap to let
[02:53] them know hey buddy we can't do that
[02:56] then we quickly redirect them to the
[02:58] behavior that we do want from them which
[03:00] is to sit and wait quietly if the dog
[03:03] doesn't know how to sit we have to go
[03:05] back and teach that first but then when
[03:07] they are sitting we make them wait for a
[03:09] second then they get the praise and the
[03:11] attention that they were looking for
[03:13] once that goes well we then move it to a
[03:15] couple of seconds to a few seconds what
[03:18] we usually see through this process is a
[03:20] dog will try to jump it will get quickly
[03:23] interrupted redirected into the sit and
[03:25] then gets rewarded over a few
[03:28] repetitions the dog will go hm I usually
[03:31] jump here but that hasn't worked for me
[03:33] the last few times I might sit instead
[03:36] when they sit they get a big jackpot
[03:38] reward we go in with treats we go in
[03:40] with toys we go in with lots of praise
[03:42] and attention to really drive home that
[03:44] message of that's exactly what we want
[03:47] if you sit you are going to get what you
[03:49] want and we repeat this and we practice
[03:51] this over and over again sometimes the
[03:53] dog will take a little bit of a step
[03:54] back and we have to go back to
[03:56] interrupting the behavior some dogs he
[03:58] learns really quick and you only have a
[04:00] need to interrupt it two or three times
[04:02] and then they sit every time moving
[04:04] forward but once we get them to sitting
[04:07] in that behavior it's incredibly
[04:09] important that that owner and every
[04:11] person in that dog's life is consistent
[04:14] with this moving forward that's what
[04:16] lets us have success long term not just
[04:19] short term when they're with me and my
[04:20] team of trainers who are experts in
[04:22] handling this we build that foundation
[04:25] for people we do the leg work of that
[04:27] operant counter conditioning but then
[04:29] it's incredibly important that the owner
[04:32] you get on board with this process
[04:34] continue the work moving forward and you
[04:37] will get to a point where every time
[04:38] that dog sees somebody that they want
[04:40] praise from they want attention from
[04:42] they want to play with that they will
[04:44] sit and wait patiently for it however if
[04:46] you let them get away with jumping up
[04:48] just once that old Behavior pathway will
[04:51] come right back and they'll go straight
[04:53] back to that easier way of getting what
[04:55] they want so consistency is key

[00:07] and shape it into beautiful heel walking
[00:10] over the space of the week that he's
[00:12] here with me i'm will atherton i'm a
[00:14] canine behaviourist and my goal is to
[00:16] keep all dogs out of shelters and off
[00:18] the euthanasia table this dog has been
[00:20] abused and neglected and has a wide
[00:21] variety of behavior problems because of
[00:24] it i'm going to foster him for seven
[00:25] days and show you exactly what can be
[00:27] achieved with loving leadership
[00:30] now as is always the case and what i
[00:32] always recommend when you're rescuing a
[00:35] dog whether i'm rescuing a dog whether
[00:36] i'm fostering a dog we absolutely start
[00:39] as we mean to go on we have literally
[00:42] just got out the car from picking him up
[00:44] he's been on a long drive we've just got
[00:46] back i've given him a few minutes just
[00:48] to stretch his legs and pace get used to
[00:50] the environment but we are going to jump
[00:52] straight in to one of my most important
[00:54] drills which is my engagement tune-up
[00:56] drill i need to get him looking up to me
[00:58] for guidance and direction which will
[01:00] also start the foundations of me shaping
[01:04] a lovely loose lead walk which i can
[01:06] then shape into some beautiful formal
[01:09] heel over the space of the next week now
[01:11] what's really interesting about my mate
[01:13] here is that he had a very bad job of
[01:17] his ears being docked which has created
[01:20] lots of polyps in his ears which is
[01:23] unfortunately not a very nice sight at
[01:26] all we won't show it you on camera but
[01:27] it's also made him pretty much deaf as
[01:29] well so i'm going to have to use some
[01:32] creative approaches to help him
[01:35] understand that he needs to come back to
[01:36] me because i can't
[01:41] all right he's just cannot hear me right
[01:43] now so we're gonna have to teach him and
[01:46] understand to use lead pressure to be
[01:48] able to communicate with him on a
[01:49] positive and fun way to help him
[01:51] understand that i need him to bring his
[01:53] attention back to me so knowing just how
[01:55] strong he is and when we got him out of
[01:57] the kennel the kennel let me borrow a
[01:59] slippery just to get him out and he
[02:01] pulled straight through it so i'm going
[02:02] to switch straight over to a prong
[02:05] collar with him to help him understand
[02:07] and to help use this as a positive tool
[02:10] i'm going to pair this with tons of fun
[02:12] food and toy work so that we can use it
[02:15] as an ability to communicate through
[02:17] touch and through tactile sensations of
[02:20] the prong collar so without further ado
[02:22] i'm going to go straight into my tune-up
[02:23] drill now my tune-up drill is
[02:24] essentially utilizing
[02:26] lead pressure to help him understand
[02:28] that he has to bring his attention back
[02:31] to me the way we utilize that builds
[02:33] engagement it helps him understand that
[02:36] i'm in charge and that he needs to look
[02:38] up to me for guidance and direction if
[02:40] he does that then i'm going to praise
[02:42] him i'm going to reward him and through
[02:43] the space of one week of training doing
[02:46] tons of food work doing tons of toy work
[02:49] we're going to be able to help him
[02:51] understand all of the commands that we
[02:53] need let's go
[03:01] good boy let's go
[03:06] yes
[03:07] cc is now starting to check in with me
[03:09] he's paying attention to me
[03:12] because he's looking up to me for
[03:13] guidance and direction
[03:18] i'm trying to be a bit more fair with
[03:20] him just because i know he can't hear me
[03:23] so when i do this directional change
[03:26] i'm going to give him more time than i
[03:27] would with a normal dog
[03:29] yeah
[03:30] beautiful good boy and then he's going
[03:33] to get some physical praise and touch a
[03:35] lot of the work we're going to be doing
[03:37] with him he's going to be very tactile
[03:40] to help him understand what it is that
[03:42] we do want and what it is that we don't
[03:44] want because we can't communicate that
[03:46] to him verbally but straight away there
[03:48] we're already making massive progress so
[03:51] i'm really happy with that tune up it's
[03:54] gone exactly as planned and now i've got
[03:57] that loose lead walking dialed in we're
[03:59] now going to go on our first walk
[04:02] [Music]
[04:07] [Applause]
[04:10] now as you can see in just five to ten
[04:13] minutes we've made
[04:14] huge monumental progress and for most of
[04:18] you watching you might simply be happy
[04:21] with a dog that's now walking this
[04:23] nicely and yes i do the tune up because
[04:25] i want to achieve this quickly so we can
[04:27] get out and we can explore
[04:29] quickly so we can lean into that
[04:31] migration quickly but this is just the
[04:35] beginning now i've dialed this in i want
[04:37] to then go to awesome fun obedient style
[04:41] heal so not only is he doing it from a
[04:43] place of
[04:44] engaging with me and looking up to me
[04:46] for guidance and direction but then we
[04:48] can do it in a fun way where i can ask
[04:50] it of him as a command and i can reward
[04:52] him i can praise him we can use loads of
[04:54] fun things like toys and food to really
[04:57] then build up our relationship even
[05:00] further and as you've seen on this
[05:01] channel countless times by doing these
[05:03] tune-ups it doesn't affect our
[05:05] relationship negatively as you saw when
[05:07] i came down to his level his tail's
[05:09] wagging he wants to give me kisses he's
[05:11] happy to be with me because he's
[05:13] starting to trust me
[05:14] because i'm stepping up and taking this
[05:17] leadership position however i want to
[05:19] now build on that with tons of obedience
[05:22] and fun training work to take this next
[05:25] level so then we've already made huge
[05:27] progress on loose lead walking and we've
[05:30] made that progress built on my
[05:32] engagement tune-up and the foundations
[05:34] of leadership but what we want to do now
[05:36] is we want to turn the act of heel
[05:38] walking into a nice obedience command
[05:40] and when it comes time for obedience we
[05:42] go straight to good old trusting
[05:45] trustworthy food work
[05:48] and the first thing that you need to be
[05:50] able to have your dog do before you can
[05:52] do any kind of form or heal work and for
[05:54] the vast majority of obedience commands
[05:56] is to have them follow a law now the law
[05:58] we're going to be using is simply his
[06:00] food
[06:01] i popped my mates food here
[06:04] for his day into my treat pouch so
[06:07] that's what's in the old tree pouch but
[06:09] we also then need to start the principle
[06:11] of luring him and when we can get him
[06:13] following the law we can then start
[06:15] shaping and creating obedience commands
[06:18] so it's gonna be as simple as getting
[06:19] his attention
[06:21] getting him to follow a law
[06:23] and then rewarding him when he does so
[06:25] so he understands that to get access to
[06:28] this
[06:29] just follow it wherever it goes now we
[06:31] can utilize this for many different
[06:33] things
[06:34] obviously a classic example would be
[06:37] oven over for a sit that would be how
[06:39] you would teach sit you could do the
[06:41] same thing with a down but when it comes
[06:43] to teaching formal heal i'm going to be
[06:45] doing the same thing so i'm getting him
[06:47] to follow a law
[06:54] and then he gets it so when he's in the
[06:56] desirable position that i want
[06:58] he gets the food and then we're going to
[07:00] repeat this
[07:02] over
[07:03] and over then when he gets there
[07:05] we reward him
[07:07] now this is literally the first session
[07:09] of this and we need to put dozens into
[07:12] hundreds into thousands of reps into
[07:14] work like this we're going to build that
[07:17] up build it up then we need to add a cue
[07:19] to it which is where it gets even
[07:21] complicated for my mate because he's
[07:23] deaf so i can't use verbal cues so i
[07:24] have to start using tactile
[07:26] different variations of cues that he can
[07:29] understand whilst also building this
[07:31] concept of look up to me for guidance
[07:33] and direction to make it easier for me
[07:35] to communicate because he can't hear
[07:37] with me
[07:38] but as we move on over these coming days
[07:40] we're going to build this up build this
[07:41] up build this up in terms of this formal
[07:44] work then we're going to build it up and
[07:46] build it up and build it up in terms of
[07:48] the distraction level paired with the
[07:50] work we're doing with lead pressure
[07:53] paired with the work we've already made
[07:55] massive progress on in terms of
[07:56] leadership and him following my guidance
[07:58] and direction looking up to me for
[08:00] engagement
[08:02] because of the tune-up drills that we've
[08:04] been working on him is going to be what
[08:06] allows him to have beautiful heel
[08:09] walking in any given situation so it's
[08:11] all well and good being able to do nice
[08:14] heel walking in low distraction
[08:16] environments or when you're doing it
[08:18] beautifully with food work but the
[08:20] rubber meets the road when you come out
[08:21] to high distraction environments and
[08:23] that's why whenever we're working with
[08:24] dogs for longer periods of time we proof
[08:26] the work that we've done which is
[08:28] exactly what we're doing today we've
[08:29] come to the busiest town in our area
[08:31] we're going to go grab a coffee and some
[08:32] breakfast we're going to go through the
[08:34] town centre we're going to have an
[08:35] explore and we're going to be making
[08:36] sure that my mate here stays on a lovely
[08:38] loose lead being calm and well mannered
[08:40] during the whole process
[08:56] [Music]
[09:00] so guys as you can see in the short
[09:02] space of time even within a week you can
[09:04] absolutely take your dog from a freight
[09:08] train pulling you all over the place to
[09:11] beautiful loose lead heel walking
[09:13] whether you're out in the countryside
[09:14] surrounded by livestock or whether
[09:16] you're going through some of the busiest
[09:18] town environments possible but following
[09:20] this system of calm consistent loving
[09:23] leadership helping them understand what
[09:25] you do want and helping them understand
[09:27] what you don't want you can have the
[09:29] dream canine companion that you've
[09:31] always wanted so if you enjoyed the
[09:33] video like subscribe if you're new we do
[09:35] videos like this every single week come

[00:00] so when you bring an 8-week old puppy
[00:02] into your life you're going to want to
[00:04] make sure that you train them to walk
[00:06] beautifully before they grow up because
[00:08] a dog like this that grows into a
[00:10] full-sized German Shepherd will be a
[00:12] nightmare if I don't teach him to walk
[00:14] perfectly on the lead to do so I start
[00:17] with teaching the basics of a heel
[00:19] command to let him know that I want him
[00:21] by my left hand side after that we bring
[00:24] the lead in after that we take it
[00:26] outside after that we level up his
[00:28] duration his raction and his distance
[00:31] that we travel in and before we know it
[00:34] we will have a dog that is walking
[00:35] beautifully on a loose lead obviously
[00:38] there is more to it than we can fit in a
[00:40] short video like this so if you want to
[00:41] know all of the details come and check
[00:43] out my perfect puppy course there'll be

[00:00] it's my absolute passion when it comes
[00:01] to working dogs is helping dogs keep out
[00:03] shelters and off the euthanasia table
[00:05] and if we can give him that in a short
[00:07] session we're going to be setting sunny
[00:09] up here for wild amounts of success
[00:18] [Music]
[00:26] hey guys welcome back to the channel and
[00:28] today we are working
[00:30] some beautiful rescue dogs my absolute
[00:32] passion when it comes to working dogs is
[00:34] helping dogs keep out shelters and off
[00:36] the euthanasia table and today i've had
[00:38] a lovely opportunity to come and work
[00:39] with a few dogs that are at risk of
[00:41] euthanasia to see whether we can kind of
[00:43] help them out and stop that being the
[00:45] case get them on a good track to them
[00:47] finding their forever home today we're
[00:48] working with sunny who is allegedly an
[00:51] american bulldog incredibly anxious
[00:53] around the kennel when we went to do
[00:56] anything with his leads we've noticed
[00:57] that he's very very hand shy which uh is
[01:01] a telltale sign for me of uh oftentimes
[01:04] being mishandled and mistreated now when
[01:06] it comes to dogs in shelters dogs that
[01:09] are anxious fearful hand shy dogs it's
[01:11] really easy to start to feel sorry for
[01:14] them and as we should it's uh something
[01:16] that obviously conjures negative images
[01:20] of what's probably happened to this dog
[01:21] and as nice people we feel bad for him
[01:24] and want to care for him and we want to
[01:25] let him know that he's loved and valued
[01:27] but ultimately that's serving him no
[01:29] purpose what i want to do is get those
[01:31] manners under control what i want to do
[01:34] is get him walking beautifully to heal
[01:35] what i want to do is instill some
[01:37] leadership in him where he trusts me as
[01:39] a loving leader that he can look up to
[01:41] for guidance and direction so i want to
[01:43] get his manners and his engagement under
[01:45] control which will allow his training to
[01:48] then be built on a better foundation his
[01:50] obedience can then be built on that
[01:51] foundation and their potential and
[01:53] prospective owners in the future are
[01:55] much much more likely to be interested
[01:57] in a dog that's walking beautifully to
[01:59] heal it's engaging with an owner eager
[02:01] and willing to work now as you're about
[02:04] to see i decided that the right tool for
[02:07] sunny and to help sunny make maximum
[02:09] amount of progress is the prong collar
[02:11] now this might seem really
[02:13] counter-intuitive that a dog that is
[02:15] very fearful very anxious very hand-shy
[02:18] and is showing signs of clearly being
[02:20] abused why i would utilize a tool that
[02:24] has the capability of administering
[02:26] correction you would presume
[02:29] that that could further the problem and
[02:31] you are absolutely right the
[02:34] modification program and the training
[02:36] that i do with sunny in this session is
[02:38] done from my years of experience and
[02:42] advanced knowledge and finesse of how to
[02:44] implement the prong collar if it was
[02:47] implemented incorrectly with bad timing
[02:50] utilizing the wrong levels it could
[02:52] absolutely make this situation worse
[02:54] which is why it's important that you
[02:56] understand that without the kind of
[02:58] experience or help from somebody with
[03:00] the experience that i have you should
[03:02] not be utilizing these kind of training
[03:04] programs but you see this clip on the
[03:06] fold with my knowledge and how to
[03:09] implement the tool like a prong collar
[03:11] even with an anxious fearful dog like
[03:14] sunny i can utilize that to communicate
[03:18] to him effectively and efficiently to
[03:20] help him understand that i am in charge
[03:23] and all he needs to do is look up to me
[03:25] for guidance and direction and as the
[03:27] session rolls on the weight of the world
[03:30] will come off his shoulders and he
[03:32] starts to really let go of that anxiety
[03:36] and become the happy content dog that i
[03:38] knew was in there but to be able to
[03:40] access that to remove that fear and that
[03:43] anxiety from him i had to help him
[03:45] understand that i'm his loving leader
[03:47] and i'm here to lead him because i love
[03:50] him and he starts that process of loving
[03:52] me because i lead him because leadership
[03:56] is love
[03:57] so as you can see i'm being very very
[04:00] fair with him i'm not asking for perfect
[04:02] heel but what i'm doing is i'm
[04:04] encouraging him and i'm navigating him
[04:06] to help him understand that coming back
[04:08] to me is a great thing i'm also starting
[04:10] to layer in jumping up me we don't want
[04:13] you to do i need you to do a better
[04:14] decision and i want you to sit so i want
[04:16] you to feel comfortable coming to me
[04:18] when you get to me i want you to sit and
[04:20] wait with good manners and then i'm
[04:21] going to pay you so in that drill we're
[04:24] already building up the concept of loose
[04:26] lead walking we're already building up
[04:28] the concept of recall we're already
[04:30] building up the concept of sit and wait
[04:32] with good manners and we're already
[04:34] building up communication pathways sunny
[04:38] yeah good boy good boy sunny
[04:42] yeah good boy good boy
[04:46] yeah good boy good boy
[04:48] good boy
[04:50] yes
[04:51] a dog that earlier
[04:53] literally wet himself
[04:55] when i came down to his level
[04:57] and now i'm coming down to his level
[04:59] he's content to be here
[05:01] yeah good boy
[05:02] good boy this is what i'm talking about
[05:04] when i'm instilling some leadership in
[05:06] him doing in the right way it doesn't
[05:09] make the anxiety worse weirdly and it
[05:11] might seem counterintuitive it flips it
[05:14] on its head and sunny can now start to
[05:16] thrive and we're building
[05:20] a lovely relationship the next part of
[05:23] sonny's assessment but also in this
[05:26] training protocol is we've brought one
[05:28] of the center's
[05:29] role model dogs out and as you can see
[05:32] he's become very very infatuated with
[05:35] that dog we've got my good friend paul
[05:36] another balanced trainer and we've got
[05:38] the role model dog over the corner we're
[05:40] gonna start working him around these
[05:42] people so that he can start to
[05:44] understand the importance of regardless
[05:46] of what's going on i'm all that matters
[05:48] helping him make better decisions just
[05:51] utilizing a tool that communicates to
[05:53] him when used correctly in a language
[05:55] that he understands because i love him
[05:57] i'm going to lead him and i'm going to
[05:59] help him navigate this experience and
[06:01] we're going to do it together good boy
[06:05] again a dog that was anxious and fearful
[06:08] and urinated on me because i went near
[06:10] his neck 15 minutes ago even with the
[06:13] utilization of a tool like a prong
[06:14] collar is building this kind of
[06:16] relationship
[06:19] yeah and that
[06:20] is because leadership is love and if you
[06:23] love your dogs you need to lead your
[06:26] dogs so i hope there's some value in
[06:28] that video for you guys i hope you
[06:29] enjoyed it if you did subscribe we do
[06:31] videos like this every single week and i
[06:32] can't wait to see you on the next
[06:34] episode

[00:00] these are the three breeds that as a
[00:01] professional dog trainer and K9
[00:03] behaviorist I absolutely love now let me
[00:05] let you into a little secret all dog
[00:07] trainers and all behaviorists have
[00:08] breeds that they love to work with and
[00:10] breeds that they don't and the reality
[00:11] is is that there's a common theme
[00:13] amongst those breeds which might be
[00:15] something that you should consider
[00:16] yourself at home as we love these breeds
[00:19] for a reason now for me the first one
[00:21] you probably know the answer to this is
[00:23] going to be the labador retriever I
[00:25] think that they are the king of all dog

[00:28] for the rest of my life it would be rors
[00:30] coming up as a close second for me would
[00:32] be the Connie Corso I love Mastiff
[00:34] breeds they definitely are not suitable
[00:36] for firsttime owners or many families
[00:38] like the labrador is but they do provide
[00:40] a a really unique Bond and relationship
[00:42] and guarding skills that I love and last
[00:45] but not least is the germa shepherd
[00:47] probably the king of all round dog

[00:00] if you're having trouble with your dog
[00:02] then there's a reason that 99 times out
[00:04] of 100 every single trainer on the
[00:06] planet will ask you how much exercise
[00:08] are you giving your dog because a tired
[00:10] dog is a happy dog and a tire dog is a
[00:12] better behaved dog so in this video
[00:15] let's talk about some amazing ways in
[00:17] which you can tire out your dog as
[00:19] quickly and as easily as possible so
[00:21] that you have that perfect dream Canine
[00:23] Companion that you've always wanted now
[00:25] if you truly want to be able to tire out
[00:27] your dogs the first thing we have to
[00:29] understand is what motivates and what
[00:31] drives your dogs right now I'm just
[00:33] working around my work in my Labrador
[00:36] who's enjoying a nice bit of grass if I
[00:38] just hang around him as you can see he's
[00:40] pretty chill
[00:41] he's excitable but he's pretty chill but
[00:43] watch what happens when I do this
[00:46] look at the intensity build look at his
[00:48] back legs shaking and he can barely
[00:51] contain himself the reason is is because
[00:53] this thing is the thing that drives him
[00:56] more than pretty much anything else in
[00:58] life so everything gets more intense
[01:01] everything gets sharper laser focused
[01:05] physically and mentally and when you
[01:07] understand what does this to do your
[01:10] dogs you can be able to utilize that to
[01:13] be able to Tire them out quicker than
[01:15] anything else that you can possibly do
[01:18] with your dogs because you're tapping
[01:20] into their DNA what's bred into them for
[01:24] generations and generations of the
[01:26] triggers that response and if you can
[01:29] tap into that and use it to your
[01:30] advantage you are going to have a dog
[01:32] that is shattered when you get home and
[01:35] will therefore be a much better Canine
[01:38] Companion because of it which takes us
[01:40] on to our second point and that is if
[01:42] you want a calm content relaxed dog
[01:45] especially in the home you need to
[01:47] remember that it's not just about
[01:49] tireing them physically you must Tire
[01:52] your dog mentally because a specially
[01:55] working line dogs like this they are
[01:57] bred to work their bread to solve
[02:00] problems they're bred to work with you
[02:02] and achieve a task that is equally
[02:05] mentally demanding as it is physically
[02:08] demanding so if you want them to be
[02:10] fulfilled content happy you have to Tire
[02:14] them out physically and mentally but
[02:18] don't worry we're going to start looking
[02:19] at some practical ways in which you can
[02:21] actually do that later on in this video
[02:23] and guys if you want dogs that are as
[02:25] well behaved as these are then simply
[02:28] subscribe to this channel we make videos
[02:29] like this multiple times a week to help
[02:31] ensure you have the dream can I
[02:33] companion that you've always wanted so
[02:35] take two seconds click subscribe and
[02:37] let's get into the next point so moving
[02:39] on to how we can understand the best way
[02:41] to tire out your dogs we have to then
[02:43] combine everything we've just learned
[02:45] from the first point with everything
[02:47] we've just discussed in that second
[02:49] point to then truly understand our dogs
[02:52] retrievers love to retrieve herders love
[02:57] to herd protection dogs love to protect
[03:00] that is what that intrinsic DNA that I
[03:03] was talking about earlier tells us so we
[03:06] then need to know that understand it
[03:09] deeply respect it in the dogs that we
[03:12] have and then utilize it to Tire them
[03:14] both physically and mentally now the
[03:17] best way in my opinion to tap into the
[03:20] vast majority of those ancestral
[03:22] qualities that we've just been talking
[03:24] about is the good old-fashioned game of
[03:27] fetch Sully
[03:30] this isn't just for Retrievers in terms
[03:33] of teaching them to retrieve but also it
[03:35] can tap in to a hunting dog's desire to
[03:38] hunt because they're chasing animals we
[03:41] can get this thing alive this is now
[03:44] moving and it's funnily enough that when
[03:47] the dogs go and get it and get their
[03:49] mouth on it it stops moving to them
[03:51] they've kind of done their job we've
[03:54] tapped into those ancestral qualities in
[03:57] terms of tiring them out mentally but
[03:59] we're also tapping into those physical
[04:00] requirements of intense bursts of Sprint
[04:04] coming back and then once we've worked
[04:06] on those skills regardless of the type
[04:08] of breed that you have you can dust off
[04:10] some gun dog skills to take it even
[04:12] further work on physically tiring them
[04:15] out mentally tiring them out but work on
[04:17] your obedience he'll Sit Stay lovely
[04:20] again incredibly High motivation Riley
[04:23] stay
[04:26] impulse control right now massive
[04:28] amounts of obedience stay
[04:31] Riley and yes we're working Labradors
[04:35] today dogs that are bred to retrieve but
[04:37] I promise you with patience skill and
[04:40] perseverance you could teach any dog to
[04:42] go get something and bring it back to
[04:45] you it might take a little bit longer
[04:46] with other breeds but they absolutely
[04:48] can do it and if you want to know how
[04:50] you can teach your dog to play fetch
[04:52] simply subscribe we're going to make a
[04:53] video on that very very soon breaking
[04:56] through each individual step with a
[04:58] breed that's not bred to retrieve so get
[05:00] out there tire out your dogs physically
[05:02] mentally and enjoy a happier dog

[00:01] socializing your dogs is of utmost
[00:04] importance critical importance but what
[00:07] actually is socialization and how do you
[00:09] do it properly i'm will atherton i'm a
[00:12] canine behaviorist and my goal is to
[00:13] keep all dogs out of shelters and off
[00:15] the euthanasia table this dog has been
[00:17] abused and neglected and has a wide
[00:19] variety of behaviour problems because of
[00:21] it i'm going to foster him for seven
[00:23] days and show you exactly what can be
[00:25] achieved with loving leadership so when
[00:27] it comes to socialization the first
[00:29] thing that you have to understand is
[00:30] that you must have realistic
[00:32] expectations and the patience to take
[00:34] things slowly and take baby steps
[00:37] towards improvement now when you first
[00:39] bring a new dog into your home which is
[00:41] what i had to do with my mate here is
[00:43] start to assess potential triggers now
[00:46] very quickly i found out that his
[00:48] potential triggers are other animals
[00:50] livestock in particular so we've been
[00:52] doing lots of work out in the
[00:54] countryside building up and building up
[00:56] his socialization towards livestock
[01:00] sheep cows and birds but what i didn't
[01:03] do on day one is try and walk him
[01:05] straight through a flock of sheep we've
[01:07] been building it up slowly starting
[01:09] with being at a distance where he can
[01:11] see them
[01:12] starting to build up his concept and
[01:15] understanding that even though there's
[01:16] that thing that is triggering an
[01:18] emotional response from you i need you
[01:21] to pay attention to me and look up to me
[01:23] for guidance and direction then as we
[01:25] succeed we just take baby steps baby
[01:27] steps and we move forward we move
[01:29] forward until eventually we will get to
[01:31] a point where we can walk through a
[01:33] flock of sheep and he'll remain in this
[01:35] beautiful loose lead here walking being
[01:37] in tune and engaged with me so we're
[01:39] furthering our socialization and we need
[01:41] to make sure that we're socializing my
[01:43] mate here to a multiple different
[01:45] environments and environmental stimuli
[01:47] today we've come out to the busiest town
[01:50] in our area we're going to be walking
[01:51] down the high street we're going to go
[01:52] into some dog friendly shops we're going
[01:54] to go into a coffee shop have some
[01:55] breakfast
[01:56] and it's not all about letting him do
[01:58] whatever he wants whenever he wants meet
[02:01] people that's not the the importance of
[02:03] socialization what we're going to be
[02:05] achieving today is being in high stimuli
[02:08] environments but him understanding that
[02:10] he must remain calm but more importantly
[02:13] look up to me for guidance and direction
[02:15] if he ever finds himself in a stressful
[02:17] situation as opposed to lunging barking
[02:20] becoming reactive pulling or freaking
[02:22] out that's the essence of socialization
[02:25] i'm in charge as your loving leader and
[02:27] no matter what happens whatever you find
[02:29] yourself in simply look up to me and
[02:32] i'll take control and make sure
[02:33] everything's okay so this is a perfect
[02:35] example of manners based training in
[02:39] various different situations we've come
[02:41] out this when we picked him up would not
[02:43] have happened he was feral diving up
[02:45] furniture climbing onto kitchen worktops
[02:48] jumping up people if he can smell food
[02:50] but just with a bit of loving leadership
[02:51] we're now able to bring him out to a
[02:53] lovely coffee shop and he's able to sit
[02:55] and hang out with us displaying
[02:57] beautiful well-mannered behavior
[02:59] all right mate
[03:01] isn't that right you're a good boy
[03:03] which then takes us on to our next point
[03:05] of socialization and this is what my
[03:07] whole training system is built on and
[03:09] that is the understanding of the
[03:10] fundamental the foundation that is
[03:14] loving leadership if you can provide
[03:17] loving leadership to your dog and have
[03:19] your dog understand that you are in
[03:21] control in any given situation and all
[03:24] they have to do is look up to you for
[03:25] guidance and direction then
[03:27] socialization becomes a million times
[03:31] easier now as you can see we're maybe 10
[03:34] 15 meters away from sheep which when i
[03:36] collected him on sunday would have had
[03:38] him absolutely losing his mind and even
[03:41] myself someone who's big and strong and
[03:43] quite comfortable managing large dogs
[03:45] would have really struggled to keep him
[03:48] safe now is he perfect at this point
[03:50] after four or five days no but is he
[03:53] causing any issue no he's still on a
[03:55] loose lead he's aware of them which i'm
[03:57] fine with but he's making good decisions
[04:00] and staying around me and following my
[04:04] guidance and direction which is all i
[04:06] could ever possibly ask of him now
[04:09] because he's deaf it poses different
[04:11] challenges i now have to use little bits
[04:13] of lead pressure just to communicate
[04:15] with him and guide him around i can't do
[04:18] it verbally but as we practice this
[04:20] built on the foundations of loving
[04:22] leadership and building it up with those
[04:24] small baby steps
[04:26] we're able to make huge amounts of
[04:29] success
[04:30] really quickly aren't we buddy yeah we
[04:32] are
[04:33] so i hope you enjoyed this video guys i
[04:35] hope you liked it if you did make sure

[00:00] biggest mistake that new dog owners make
[00:02] is simple choosing the breed based on
[00:05] how they look yes there are dogs out
[00:07] there that are absolutely glorious but
[00:10] if you don't understand the breed if you
[00:12] don't know how to manage and handle that
[00:15] breed you're setting them up to fail
[00:17] neither of these dogs are dogs that
[00:19] should be owned by first-time owners
[00:20] both of these dogs come with their pros
[00:23] and their cons and if you're not
[00:26] prepared for both of those scenarios it
[00:28] will not go well

[00:00] now I feel incredibly fortunate to have
[00:02] been able to help literally hundreds of
[00:04] thousands of dog owners around the world
[00:06] choose the right breed for them and then
[00:08] help become the perfect K Andi companion
[00:11] for them their life their experience and
[00:13] the reality is is that when you've
[00:15] worked with as many dogs as I have even
[00:18] though we love dogs as K9 professionals
[00:21] I promise you even if they won't admit
[00:23] it we all have our favorite breeds to
[00:26] work with and our breeds that we really
[00:29] don't like working with and in this
[00:31] video I'm going to be completely open
[00:33] and honest about some of the breeds that
[00:35] I really don't enjoy working with now
[00:38] the first breed is the Siberian Husky
[00:41] now a lot of people don't know that I
[00:42] actually used to own a Siberian Husky it
[00:45] was the first dog that I ever rescued
[00:47] and rehabilitated and lived an
[00:49] incredibly rewarding and fulfilling life
[00:51] with us and since rescuing and
[00:53] rehabilitating that Siberian Husky I've
[00:55] also lost count of the amount of huskies
[00:58] that I've worked with and the reality is
[01:01] and I'll be completely honest of one of
[01:03] the reasons that I wanted to rescue and
[01:05] rehabilitate that husky in the first
[01:07] place and I think if other husky owners
[01:09] are being completely open and honest
[01:11] themselves is that the driving force
[01:13] behind getting that breed is how they
[01:16] look because they do look absolutely
[01:20] beautiful they are absolutely stunning
[01:23] arguably one of the most beautiful dog
[01:25] breeds in the K9 Kingdom however even as
[01:28] somebody who has been guilty of this in
[01:30] the past I'm trying my best to help
[01:32] people not make those same mistakes and
[01:34] not choose breeds based on looks and
[01:37] when it comes to the Siberian Husky they
[01:39] have an incredibly high energy output
[01:42] bred to be able to run for dozens of
[01:45] Miles every single day in incredibly
[01:47] harsh climates means that they rarely
[01:50] have the kind of physically rewarding
[01:53] lifestyle that they require when coming
[01:55] into our normal pet dog homes and the
[02:00] reality is is that their temperament and
[02:02] characteristics are one that makes them
[02:04] very aloof they're not very Handler
[02:07] driven which means that they don't
[02:09] necessarily seek guidance and Direction
[02:13] and I find that they're much more like
[02:15] cats than they are like dogs they're
[02:18] also incredible drama queens which makes
[02:21] them really difficult to train
[02:22] especially if you're working on behavior
[02:25] modification and all of those things
[02:26] combined have just got me to a point
[02:28] where Siberian husk just aren't a breed
[02:32] I enjoy training and as somebody that
[02:34] has the high levels of demand for my
[02:36] services that I do I tend to send
[02:40] Huskies to other trainers that enjoy the
[02:43] breed much more and might specialize in
[02:45] the breed and I dedicate my time to the
[02:47] breeds that I really enjoy training and
[02:50] that my style system and experience is
[02:53] much better suited to which takes me on
[02:55] to the second breed that I'm simply not
[02:57] a huge fan of and that is the the dund
[03:00] now the docson has boomed in popularity
[03:03] recently and I believe that just like
[03:05] the Siberian Husky the reality is if
[03:08] people were being completely honest
[03:09] about why they chose to get a docon was
[03:12] because of the way they look now doons
[03:16] are gy little dogs that were bred to be
[03:18] incredibly tenacious Hunters but if
[03:21] people get them for the lifestyle of
[03:25] chilling on a sofa maybe as an Instagram
[03:29] accessory you are setting you and them
[03:32] up to failure that is not a breed that
[03:34] is well suited to that kind of lifestyle
[03:37] and I highly highly suggest that if you
[03:40] are getting a breed just because you
[03:41] think that they look cool the likelihood
[03:45] is is that you and them are not going to
[03:48] be happy in the long run and I see this
[03:51] every single day with docon they tend to
[03:55] suffer with reactivity and Extreme
[03:57] Measures they are very very y happy
[04:00] little dogs and because of the booming
[04:02] popularity in them it means that a lot
[04:04] of people are getting them with no real
[04:07] commitment to doing much with them and
[04:10] it leads them down a path to become very
[04:13] obnoxious frustrating little dog breeds
[04:16] that simply for me are not a joy to work
[04:19] with now don't get me wrong I have met a
[04:21] handful of people that got options that
[04:24] may have admit that they got them
[04:26] because they like the way that they
[04:27] looked but they absolutely put the work
[04:30] in to train them and the reality is is
[04:32] that doons require a lot of training and
[04:35] if you do commit to that level of
[04:36] training they can be cool fun little
[04:39] dogs which is the reality for most
[04:41] breeds is that there are bad examples
[04:43] and there are good examples of each
[04:45] breed there are bad owners that have
[04:47] them and there are good owners that have
[04:49] them but the reality is is that when
[04:51] breeds boom in popularity like the docon
[04:54] often times that might skew towards the
[04:58] kind of owners that might not be
[05:00] prepared skilled or have the desire to
[05:02] put the work in that's required that
[05:04] might be getting them for the wrong
[05:06] reasons and then people are surprised
[05:08] that they develop all of the problem
[05:10] behaviors but for those of you that have
[05:12] committed to training them you don't
[05:14] need to come after me because I promise
[05:16] you I've met plenty of you out there but
[05:19] it doesn't change the fact that when I
[05:21] get a message into my inbox of somebody
[05:23] trying to book in with one that my heart
[05:25] sinks a little bit and I'd rather that
[05:28] message have been from Labrador now
[05:30] before we dive into the third breed that
[05:32] I really just have come to not enjoy
[05:35] working with and training I wanted to
[05:37] mention a couple of things that might be
[05:39] really useful for you now if you're
[05:41] watching this because you're considering
[05:42] what breed you're going to get you need
[05:45] to make sure that you're training them
[05:46] properly like we just discussed and to
[05:48] help you do that I've created a
[05:49] completely free course called my
[05:52] principles of perfect puppy training
[05:53] which will be exactly what you need to
[05:55] get started on your journey of turning
[05:57] whatever breed you end up with into your
[05:59] person Perfect k and I companion
[06:01] there'll be a link to that in the
[06:02] description box below however if you
[06:04] need more help from somebody with the
[06:06] level of experience and knowledge that I
[06:08] have around breeds how to get them right
[06:11] what can often go wrong which breeds are
[06:14] best suited for you and your lifestyle I
[06:17] have my perfect breed consultation
[06:18] service that we can work onetoone
[06:21] together in a completely private bespoke
[06:23] manner where we can get to know each
[06:25] other and I can help you choose the
[06:27] perfect breed for you again there'll be
[06:29] a link in the description box below if
[06:31] you're interested in that service but
[06:32] the final breed I want to talk about in
[06:34] this video is the sharp a now I'm not
[06:37] going to name and shame any other
[06:38] trainers but I can tell you that it is
[06:40] incredibly common for dog trainers and
[06:43] K9 behaviorists to simply not enjoy
[06:46] working with the sharp a they seem to be
[06:48] a breed that develop behavior problems
[06:51] very very easily and when they do
[06:53] develop them they tend to be incredibly
[06:55] significant problems that are also
[06:57] incredibly difficult to fix
[07:00] pair that with their natural tendencies
[07:03] characteristics and general demeanor
[07:06] make them a dog that is very rarely a
[07:09] lovable happy go-lucky well- behaved
[07:11] well-trained well socialized Ki
[07:13] companion because there are lot of
[07:16] things and hurdles that are put in their
[07:19] way historically and genetically that
[07:21] make it difficult for everyday owners to
[07:24] be able to get them there now again
[07:27] there are great examples of sharp a
[07:29] however is somebody who has seen the
[07:31] amount of dogs that I have and seen as
[07:33] many go wrong as I have you also see
[07:36] when things go wrong the things that go
[07:38] seriously wrong and when you talk to
[07:41] other trainers and other behaviorists to
[07:43] the extent that I have about these
[07:45] topics there's no surprise and no secret
[07:48] to me that the sharp is at the top of
[07:50] that list

[00:04] darkness is the only word to capture
[00:07] it painful darkness in my head all the
[00:14] time I made the decision I had to step
[00:16] out in front of a
[00:24] train when I look back never really had
[00:27] lots of
[00:28] friends that I think I was probably the
[00:30] slightly odd one the
[00:32] tagalong you can see it was like obvious
[00:35] kind of desperation to fit in to be
[00:44] liked the earliest memories I have of
[00:47] dogs it has to be yeah family Jack
[00:50] Russell and the the memories were all
[00:53] how bad they were yeah they were
[00:55] terribly behaved they had this habit of
[00:57] like pulling socks off but they'd like
[01:00] catch your feet so I remember having
[01:01] like my feet cut open and
[01:04] stuff funny even though a lot of the
[01:07] memories were um were violent I always
[01:10] liked them always got on with them
[01:14] um I think I always just enjoyed their
[01:17] company it felt easier I
[01:23] suppose I remember it so
[01:26] clearly I'm flicking through the
[01:28] channels and I see the Dog Whisperer and
[01:31] I was like what what is this and I put
[01:33] it on boom that was it seeing this man
[01:37] on TV deal with these crisis situations
[01:40] and being as calm and relaxed and still
[01:43] kind that resonated with me and then the
[01:47] incredible Transformations that that was
[01:49] able to unlock it was this like Perfect
[01:52] Storm of I could be like that one day
[01:55] and I want to do what he does I watched
[01:57] everything everything he ever did I
[01:59] would race home from school to catch the
[02:01] episodes I would read books on dog
[02:04] training and then naturally I'm starting
[02:07] to put these things into practice with
[02:09] my unruly jck
[02:12] Russell certainly it wasn't perfect from
[02:15] the outset but it was massive amounts of
[02:18] improvement and then even from then I'm
[02:21] starting to become the dog guy the guy
[02:23] that can work with
[02:25] dogs
[02:28] yes we'd had bull mastiff and our bull
[02:31] mastiff died she had cancer when she was
[02:32] four that devastated me I really
[02:35] struggled with that but I knew I wanted
[02:37] another dog good boy it was instant
[02:40] instant watched the litter for seconds
[02:43] and I knew Sully straight away he was
[02:45] perfect he was confident without being
[02:48] pushy he wasn't fearful there was no
[02:52] doubt in my mind it's
[02:54] him my wife is very emotional super cute
[02:58] puppy and and Dexter fell in love with
[02:59] him straight away they were best mates I
[03:02] did have kind of my behaviorist head
[03:05] on from minute one we were
[03:08] training training puppies is always
[03:10] atrocious it's really difficult when it
[03:14] came to AB suly for him it was it was
[03:17] easy say he was confident and outgoing
[03:21] yeah it was
[03:28] fun
[03:32] at some point I attempted Burton Pet
[03:35] Care Services that's where I wanted to
[03:37] do dog walking and dog training it was
[03:39] probably a couple of weeks of going out
[03:42] and leaving flyers and vets and putting
[03:44] cards up and stuff no I didn't get a
[03:46] single phone call or anything I thought
[03:48] well this isn't going to work then maybe
[03:49] I should go and do something
[03:54] else I didn't know where I was going or
[03:56] what I should be doing and friend of a
[03:59] friend found out that he worked at this
[04:01] Special Needs school for boys with
[04:02] behavior problems got chat in and he
[04:05] encouraged me to come and like well you
[04:06] should come and volunteer why didn't you
[04:07] come and do a day and see if you like it
[04:09] so a day became a week and then I
[04:12] started regularly volunteering
[04:17] there a lot of the young people I worked
[04:19] with they had been through horrible
[04:21] horrible
[04:23] situations it was physical abuse sexual
[04:26] abuse mental abuse that led them to
[04:28] display Behavior avors that made it
[04:30] unsafe for them to function in schools
[04:33] violence was common violent Outburst
[04:35] towards staff towards people that May
[04:37] challenge kind of their decisions and
[04:39] behaviors I've personally intervened
[04:42] with legitimate suicide attempts yeah
[04:45] it's crisis level situations where lives
[04:49] are on the
[04:51] line I had to learn very very quickly
[04:54] how to handle very extreme unpredictable
[04:58] behaviors and and I found I was quite
[05:00] good at it it's cuz I could have those
[05:03] very very difficult situations with a
[05:05] child that may last a few minutes of
[05:07] extreme violence and immediately I'm not
[05:10] resentful towards them immediately I've
[05:12] got no frustration towards them I care
[05:14] about them I wanted them to be
[05:17] okay after working there for nearly 10
[05:20] years I became a bit frustrated with
[05:22] kind of the educational system towards
[05:24] these young people so I was kind of well
[05:27] I'll do it myself then I'll run
[05:28] something that can help them I wanted to
[05:31] keep it small to start with me and maybe
[05:33] one or two members of staff and two to
[05:35] four kids a day keep it simple that's
[05:37] what I wanted to do that that was the
[05:38] vision that I had and as I'm having
[05:41] meetings they saw potential in me they
[05:45] pushed me into wanting to set up a full
[05:47] private independent
[05:59] I wanted to make something of myself
[06:01] that was the big mistake that I made and
[06:04] that was yeah that was a start of the
[06:07] dark
[06:15] time I now need to write business plans
[06:18] and funding strategies I need to look at
[06:19] the health and safety and the risk
[06:21] assessment all of the different policies
[06:22] and documents then I'm having to have
[06:23] meetings with people in incredibly
[06:25] powerful positions within various
[06:27] different local authorities work 100
[06:29] plus hour weeks to get that stuff done
[06:31] rolls and rolls and rolls more and
[06:34] more at the time I don't think I knew
[06:37] what I was feeling I was just doing I
[06:39] was just running hard wasn't sleeping
[06:42] wasn't recovering and I started having
[06:45] massive panic attacks on the floor fetal
[06:49] position like I can't breathe and then
[06:52] that happening recovering and then
[06:54] getting back to work cuz I felt I had no
[06:57] choice I felt trapped so I just kept
[07:00] going I just kept pushing from the
[07:03] outside you wouldn't have noticed much
[07:05] Will's on it I can't believe what you're
[07:07] doing this is amazing family members
[07:08] were impressed with me old colleagues
[07:10] were like you heard about will have you
[07:11] heard what Will's doing all of that's
[07:13] happening around me the panic attacks
[07:15] were getting regular like multiple times
[07:17] a day I'm fine leave me alone I'm fine
[07:19] it was that attitude if I had one or two
[07:21] of these a day cool just try and do them
[07:23] when no one sees and then get back to
[07:24] work with the depression thing that came
[07:28] quick
[07:30] and went dark very very
[07:33] quickly and where it went dark quickly
[07:37] was seeing that my wife was worried
[07:39] about
[07:42] me it planted in my head
[07:47] that that it was unfair to put her
[07:50] through that and we had a young son and
[07:53] I'm like man this is the life I'm going
[07:56] to put them
[07:58] through
[08:01] and I was convincing myself that she'd
[08:05] never leave
[08:06] me she wouldn't let me leave her
[08:12] um so there
[08:21] was yeah there was one other
[08:28] option
[08:39] I decided on what the train track was
[08:41] going to be I remember Sully was riding
[08:44] shotgun with me on the passenger seat I
[08:47] text my friend just to ask him to keep
[08:49] an eye on ra for me
[08:54] um I remember kissing Sully on the
[08:56] forehead and that was a a bit of a bench
[09:00] I just sat and
[09:02] waited if a train had have come in that
[09:08] time 100% I'd have done
[09:13] it luckily the friend that I
[09:17] texted started hammering me with
[09:21] responses and I promised him i' wait
[09:25] until he got
[09:28] there
[09:31] yeah that was that he walked out of
[09:33] [Music]
[09:41] work that day everything just kind of
[09:44] Came Crashing
[09:46] Down day to day just then became
[09:51] unbearable it was darkness that was
[09:55] unavoidable it was pain but not a
[09:58] physical
[09:59] pain if I was awake it was there so I
[10:02] tried to just be asleep as much as
[10:06] possible because Rachel had to go to
[10:08] work she didn't know what she was coming
[10:10] home
[10:11] to but the pin prick of a light at the
[10:14] end of the tunnel was Sully would be
[10:18] with
[10:23] me he was just by my side the entire
[10:28] time
[10:29] and for a young working line
[10:33] Labrador to be super content just to
[10:37] settle had never taught him to do that
[10:39] it's just who he is I think he is more
[10:43] in tune with my emotions than even I
[10:47] am there was a moment where I realized
[10:50] as much as you're here with me and happy
[10:52] to be with me you're a dog and you would
[10:54] love to go for a walk right now so I'm
[10:56] going to put some clothes on and and
[10:58] we're going to go go for a
[11:00] walk it started to build a bit of a
[11:03] structure of a routine get up and take
[11:05] him for a walk and what started off is 5
[11:07] minutes around the block became 10
[11:09] minutes and then 15 minutes and then
[11:10] half an hour and then I developed this
[11:12] like 1 hour
[11:14] loop it was the first snippet of of rest
[11:19] bite from that
[11:27] Darkness
[11:31] it then didn't become this effort to get
[11:33] out of the house it then actually became
[11:35] something that I started to look forward
[11:38] to I started to get a bit excited about
[11:42] training again we started playing with
[11:44] some retrieval stuff that gave me the
[11:47] Catalyst again to start looking into and
[11:50] reading more around training I started
[11:53] volunteering and working in shelters so
[11:55] breeds that had killed other animals or
[11:57] dogs that had attacked people people it
[11:59] was like this light bulb moment went off
[12:02] what I was learning in terms of working
[12:03] with the special needs children was
[12:05] super relevant I just need to alter the
[12:07] strategy to make it applicable to a dog
[12:10] I was like now this is it I'm going to
[12:12] do this I'm going to help people with
[12:13] their dogs that's what I'm going to do
[12:15] and I'm going to build a life for myself
[12:17] around that that never puts me in that
[12:20] position ever again a life that I wake
[12:22] up excited about that I'm not trapped by
[12:26] that was where I think the tunnel opened
[12:28] up for me now like I've made this
[12:29] decision I'm not going back on that
[12:31] train track I'm going to make this work
[12:34] and then it was let's
[12:36] go this whole thing that this has become
[12:39] over those years since then took a long
[12:42] time and sull has been an instrumental
[12:45] part of every one of those steps I mean
[12:48] he's been with me at every Behavior case
[12:51] I've ever worked with every client I've
[12:53] ever helped su's being there he's still
[12:57] every day teach teaches me how to be a
[13:00] better trainer and behaviorist I joke
[13:03] about it but I truly believe it's true
[13:05] that all I'm doing is trying to be as
[13:08] good a dog trainer as he
[13:10] [Music]
[13:16] ISB more like a
[13:20] dart just came in the
[13:25] face
[13:27] get
[13:29] even after all of that I still advocate
[13:31] for hard work if it's pointed in the
[13:33] right direction and if that right
[13:35] direction is fulfillment and passion and
[13:38] joy and happiness and love and kindness
[13:41] as opposed to ego and pride and money
[13:45] and
[13:46] status when I've Had My Moments where
[13:49] I've fallen back into that pit of being
[13:51] in bed every day for a week guess who
[13:53] was there with me guess who got me out
[13:57] of it again he's just always there he
[14:01] doesn't care about how many followers
[14:03] I've got he doesn't care about the money
[14:05] we make he just wants to be with me and
[14:08] and then he's
[14:11] happy when I look back and thought about
[14:13] that moment of where I picked him and
[14:15] how obvious that was to me and I wanted
[14:19] to give you some really nice behavioral
[14:21] clinical what I saw cuz aren't I a good
[14:25] behaviorist that spotted it in him and I
[14:27] couldn't think of what that was but I
[14:29] knew instantly that it was him whether
[14:33] it was a blessing Serendipity or just
[14:37] I'm the luckiest man in the world but
[14:40] um IE a lot to that
[14:55] dog

[00:00] what are the first things I teach my
[00:01] brand new 8-week old puppy the first
[00:04] thing is I charge my markers with
[00:06] Reginald here I'm actually using a
[00:08] clicker whereas in the past I've used my
[00:10] verbal marker but I need to charge that
[00:12] up to turn the primary reinforcer of
[00:15] food and pavlovian or classically
[00:17] condition that to my secondary
[00:19] reinforcer of the clicker so that I can
[00:21] Mark when he's displaying the exact
[00:23] behavior that I'm looking for the second
[00:25] thing is engagement training or teaching
[00:27] him his name now dogs will never ever
[00:30] understand the concept of a name however
[00:31] I need my dogs to know hey buddy I'm
[00:34] talking to you specifically so stop what
[00:36] you're doing look at me because I'm
[00:38] about to ask you to do something else
[00:40] then the third thing I teach is a Sit
[00:42] command the sit command is the command
[00:44] that I use above and beyond any other
[00:46] piece of obedience and it's the
[00:47] foundational principle for perfect
[00:50] manners with a dog that will sit calmly
[00:53] quietly look up to you for guidance and
[00:55] direction

[00:00] [Music]
[00:00] the first harmful thing that people do
[00:03] with their dogs all the time is giving
[00:05] them too much freedom and especially too
[00:07] much Freedom too soon but unlike humans
[00:11] dogs really don't enjoy that kind of
[00:14] Freedom they love rules and boundaries
[00:17] and expectations knowing what it is that
[00:19] it's expected of them and when without
[00:22] those rules boundaries and expectations
[00:24] dogs will easily become anxious and
[00:27] fearful and when a dog's anxious and
[00:29] fearful and they have to make decisions
[00:30] for themselves they're rarely the right
[00:33] decision so the best thing to do for
[00:35] your dog is to start with nice tight
[00:38] boundaries and then when you're happy
[00:40] with your dog's Behavior over time you
[00:43] can slowly ease off on those boundaries

TRANSCRIPTION:

[00:00] now before we can address puppy biting
[00:02] it is incredibly important that we
[00:03] understand why puppies bite because that
[00:06] allows us to have empathy towards our
[00:07] puppy it allows us to understand our
[00:10] puppies well which helps us remain calm
[00:13] because in raising and training perfect
[00:14] canine companions you're calm consistent
[00:17] leadership is key you have to be able to
[00:19] remain calm you have to be consistent so
[00:21] we don't create confusion and you have
[00:23] to be a loving leader for our dogs if
[00:26] you're getting frustrated and angry all
[00:27] of that starts to break down and you're
[00:29] on a slippery slope towards a badly
[00:30] behaved dog so helping understand that
[00:32] puppies is incredibly important for this
[00:35] process

[00:00] this is the single most important thing
[00:02] that you must know if you want to have a

[00:07] your dog's loving leader it doesn't
[00:10] matter if you have a fearful anxious dog
[00:12] they need to be led because they're
[00:14] scared and don't want to make decisions
[00:16] for themselves if you have a confident
[00:18] dominant dog then they need to be led to
[00:21] stop them making bad decisions for
[00:23] themselves whatever end of the spectrum
[00:26] your dog is on it does not matter what
[00:29] they need is to be led by you there is
[00:32] no ifs ands or buts about it if you want
[00:35] a happy well-behaved dog you must be

[00:00] even if they do make a mistake or make a
[00:02] bad decision we have the ability to
[00:04] challenge that with a more active
[00:05] challenge or a passive challenge which
[00:07] then when they understand oh I did
[00:09] something wrong there I shouldn't do
[00:11] that again we are very quickly going but
[00:13] chew on there what happens is they start

[00:00] [Music]
[00:01] I'm going to show you exactly how you
[00:04] can go from your dog pulling on the
[00:05] leash like this to walking beautifully
[00:08] by your side like this maybe your dog is
[00:12] borderline dangerous like this but you
[00:14] would rather have complete control like
[00:17] this
[00:18] well don't worry as a canine behaviorist
[00:21] I've helped literally thousands of
[00:23] people have these miraculous changes and
[00:26] in this video I'll break down the exact
[00:29] three steps I use that work time and
[00:32] time again the first point if you want
[00:34] your dog to walk beautifully on a loose
[00:36] lead and to not pull is to ask yourself
[00:38] the question do they actually understand
[00:41] what it is that you want from them and
[00:43] by that I mean have you taught your dog
[00:45] The Obedience of the heel command now
[00:48] heel obedience doesn't have to be super
[00:50] fancy it doesn't have to be competition
[00:52] obedience it's actually very
[00:54] straightforward but it's only fair to
[00:56] our dogs to help them understand what it
[00:58] is that we do want before we can move on
[01:00] to step two and step three now teaching
[01:03] heel doesn't need to be complicated it's
[01:05] a very simple process but step number
[01:07] one to stopping your dog from pulling is
[01:10] making sure they understand what it is
[01:12] that you do want from them first
[01:15] once you've had fun teaching your dog
[01:18] the basics of eel it's time to move on
[01:20] to stage two which is building
[01:23] engagement
[01:26] but what actually is engagement well
[01:29] simply put engagement is where your dog
[01:32] looks up to you and focuses on you
[01:37] the better your dog's engagement the
[01:41] more they focus on you and the more they
[01:44] focus on you the more they're not
[01:47] focusing on other things
[01:51] and this is where the magic happens if
[01:54] your dog is focusing on you they can't
[01:57] be in front of you for them to be able
[02:01] to focus on you they have to be by your
[02:04] side or just behind you and the single
[02:08] best way to build engagement is my
[02:10] engagement tune-up drill here's a quick
[02:13] example of me doing just that
[02:15] [Music]
[02:19] so now we've taught your dog what it is
[02:22] that you do want from them and we've
[02:24] built engagement with them now the next
[02:26] step is to challenge them when they're
[02:28] making bad decisions your dog now
[02:31] understands what it is that you do want
[02:32] from them you've put all of that hard
[02:34] work in and with our engagement tune-up
[02:37] process you've taught them this new
[02:40] language of how you can use your lead
[02:43] properly how you can use your lead to
[02:46] further engagement further your
[02:48] leadership and further your relationship
[02:49] once you've done that when your dog
[02:52] makes bad decisions if they know what it
[02:55] is that you want from them yet they're
[02:56] still pulling towards that dog they're
[02:58] still pulling off towards that cyclist
[03:00] that's driving past they're still
[03:02] getting frustrated at the bus over there
[03:04] you now have the ability with minor
[03:06] little bits of lead pressure to be able
[03:08] to challenge your dog and help them
[03:10] understand remember buddy that's not
[03:12] what we're doing we're doing this heel
[03:14] thing that I've taught you do that for
[03:16] me and I'm going to Lavish you with
[03:18] praise reward Lord and all the good
[03:20] stuff in life but if you don't listen
[03:22] you might hurt me you might hurt
[03:24] somebody else and you're most likely
[03:25] going to be hurting yourself so you have
[03:27] a duty of care as a loving owner to
[03:30] challenge that behavior with your dog
[03:32] and you now have the skills to be able
[03:35] to do so and if you follow those three
[03:38] steps you absolutely will be able to
[03:42] follow the thousands of people before
[03:43] you that I've helped turn the shore of
[03:46] their day into the joy of their day
[03:49] and if you want to see more details on
[03:51] any of these points just subscribe As We

[00:00] the first thing we have to do is make
[00:01] your dog love its crate now dogs are
[00:04] Denning Animals by Nature so this
[00:06] shouldn't be too difficult because we're
[00:07] just tapping into their natural DNA but
[00:10] we want them to absolutely love their
[00:12] crate and know that their crate is there
[00:14] safe happy place where they can go relax
[00:16] unwind and decompress and it's our job
[00:19] to guide that and we're going to steer
[00:21] that ancestral DNA with a few games to
[00:24] help level up just how much our dog
[00:25] loves the crate one of the best ways
[00:27] that you can do this is get something
[00:29] like a Kong stuff it full of your dog's
[00:31] favorite thing for me I like to use meat
[00:33] Pate I call this my Frozen meatical and
[00:36] then once you've frozen it it'll last
[00:38] for hours rather than leaving it cool
[00:41] where the dog can get access to it in
[00:43] just a couple of minutes pop that in the
[00:45] crate and the only time your dog ever
[00:47] gets access to their Frozen meatical is
[00:49] when they're inside their crate and
[00:52] playing different games like this with
[00:54] the crate helps us condition our dogs to
[00:56] understanding that their crate is an
[00:58] amazing place that they absolutely Love
[01:00] Now a huge problem that many people
[01:02] encounter when it comes to crate
[01:04] training is thinking that their dog
[01:05] hates the crate so let's take a minute
[01:08] to briefly look at what's actually going
[01:10] on here now in my role as a canine
[01:12] behaviorist I help people with these
[01:13] things all of the time and crate
[01:15] training is one of the fundamental core
[01:17] aspects to my system and theory of
[01:20] having perfect canine companions so
[01:22] every single dog that comes through my
[01:25] system is Crate trained and 99 of those
[01:28] dogs who own us think their dog hates
[01:31] the crate don't hate it at all they have
[01:33] just developed what we call a learned
[01:35] behavior for them getting out of the
[01:37] crate because through a few repetitions
[01:40] they understand that if they cry if they
[01:42] bark if they whine they get your
[01:43] attention and eventually the crate door
[01:45] opens and they start to associate the
[01:47] act of crying barking and whining with
[01:50] getting out of their crate and
[01:52] especially younger or more energetic
[01:54] dogs there are going to be times where
[01:55] we would like them to be in their crate
[01:57] but they would rather not be even if
[01:59] they still absolutely love their crate
[02:01] but we have a duty of care and
[02:03] responsibility to let them know when
[02:04] it's the right time in the right place
[02:06] for different activities and
[02:08] unfortunately it isn't the right time in
[02:10] the right place to be out playing
[02:11] causing Mayhem all of the time we
[02:14] channel that into fun times we channel
[02:16] that into our walks into our adventures
[02:18] into our training but there are going to
[02:21] be times where you need to have our dog
[02:23] settled down so just because your dog
[02:25] might cry or bark or whine in the crate
[02:27] does not mean that they don't like the
[02:30] crate or hate the crate or have
[02:32] separation anxiety it simply means that
[02:34] our dogs are very clever and they're
[02:36] learning how to manipulate you to get
[02:38] out of it so then how do we get over
[02:40] these obstacles well once we started
[02:42] helping our dogs understand to
[02:43] absolutely love their crates and what
[02:45] their crate is we have to then challenge
[02:47] these behaviors of them trying to force
[02:50] their way out of it or demand getting
[02:51] out of it when they want we need to help
[02:54] them understand that they need to settle
[02:56] down relax and snooze when they're in
[02:58] the crate and when they do so and when
[02:59] we're ready ready we will let them out
[03:01] of it which furthers this concept of
[03:04] that they need to settle down whether it
[03:05] is time for them to lie down and have a
[03:08] sleep they do it in their crate and if
[03:10] they want to come out of the crate well
[03:11] the only way they're going to get out of
[03:12] the crate is lying down snoozing and
[03:14] relaxing anyway so it's a win-win for
[03:16] both us and the dog but to achieve that
[03:18] we absolutely cannot let those alert
[03:20] Behavior settle in and we need to flip
[03:22] the script and learn how to challenge
[03:24] those demanding obnoxious behaviors
[03:26] whilst inside the crate and to do that
[03:28] we start off with short distance crate
[03:31] Taps when I'm crate training a dog for
[03:34] the very first time or crate training a
[03:36] dog that the owners believe hate their
[03:38] crate we've done some of the fun stuff
[03:40] we've started to get the dog to enjoy
[03:42] being in the crate and know that when
[03:44] they're in the crate great things happen
[03:45] but when it comes time to have those
[03:47] first few sessions where they're in the
[03:49] crate and the crate door is closed I
[03:51] have that crepe right by me maybe I'm at
[03:53] my desk doing a little bit of work maybe
[03:55] I'm chilling in the evening and watching
[03:57] some TV but the crate is right there I
[03:59] make sure all the dog has had everything
[04:01] it needs it's had opportunity to go out
[04:03] to the toilet it's not hungry it's had
[04:05] plenty of time with me we've worked
[04:06] together we've exercised and it is now
[04:09] time for them to settle down so the dog
[04:11] goes into the crate and we shut the door
[04:13] the Split Second any type of demanding
[04:17] Behavior sets in I tap on top of the
[04:20] crate with a verbal correction of shush
[04:23] and we repeat this process and you will
[04:25] be shocked at just how quickly your dog
[04:27] will understand that those kinds of
[04:30] behaviors don't get them attention don't
[04:32] get them out of the crate simply gets
[04:35] this tap on top of the crate doesn't
[04:37] harm the dog whatsoever it's just
[04:39] startling it's just whoa okay and they
[04:41] have a minute to pause and relax and
[04:43] what happened there and then they might
[04:46] go okay I'll try that barking thing
[04:49] again and a soul and then the same thing
[04:51] happened at all and by the time that's
[04:53] happened two or three times they start
[04:54] to learn oh it's when I do this thing
[04:57] that thing happens so I'm just not gonna
[04:59] to do that thing what should I do
[05:01] instead actually I'm quite tired I'm
[05:03] just gonna have a little lie down and
[05:04] wait and when they make those good
[05:06] decisions then we do the airdrop rewards
[05:09] where I'll sit with some treats and when
[05:11] they are lying down I'll sprinkle a
[05:13] little bit of treat through the gate
[05:14] then comes time to add time and distance
[05:17] we don't always want to be sat right by
[05:19] our dog's crate to be able to crate
[05:21] train them so what we want to start
[05:23] doing is adding time and distance and
[05:26] this can be just a simple Act of moving
[05:28] around the room if that obnoxious
[05:30] behavior starts to arise you're right
[05:32] there you can go back and you can
[05:33] address it once your dog has been
[05:35] chilled for five seconds or 10 seconds
[05:37] you can go back in and deliver an
[05:39] airdrop reward then you can extend this
[05:42] out to 20 seconds 30 seconds 60 seconds
[05:45] maybe popping in and out of the room but
[05:48] you're always there ready to challenge
[05:50] those behaviors where need be now my
[05:52] next two points are how you're going to
[05:54] be able to get your dog to settle down
[05:56] in the crate for long periods of time
[05:57] going into hours while you're you're
[06:00] outside the house but before we do that
[06:02] crate training your dog isn't the only
[06:04] thing that's required in having a
[06:06] perfect canine companion and if you're
[06:08] struggling with any behaviors with your
[06:10] dog I want to help you free of charge
[06:12] and to do that I created a completely
[06:14] free course it's called My Canine
[06:16] Companion clinic and I've summarized all
[06:18] of my theories and years of experience
[06:21] in behavior modification from basic bad
[06:23] behaviors all the way to some of the
[06:25] most extreme in the world and summarized
[06:28] it in to this completely free course so
[06:30] after this video if you want to learn
[06:31] more about crate training but if you
[06:33] also want to learn more about you
[06:34] becoming a higher level canine leader
[06:36] and fixing other problem behaviors you
[06:38] may be having with your dog the canine
[06:40] companion Clinic free course there'll be
[06:42] a link in the description box below and
[06:44] I'll see you over there but now comes
[06:46] time to start leaving your dog for more
[06:48] extended periods of time and if you're
[06:51] not there to challenge those behaviors
[06:53] what if those behaviors start to stem
[06:55] again and build and build and build well
[06:57] I've got a two-prong approach for how
[06:59] you take out dog from this point which
[07:01] is huge success to be able to be settled
[07:03] in their crate for multiple hours at a
[07:05] time the first one is a very simple one
[07:08] leave a podcast on for your dog dogs can
[07:11] often find it very soothing to hear that
[07:13] there's people around to hear
[07:14] conversations and one of the best things
[07:16] that you can do is just leave a long
[07:18] form podcast on some speakers on low
[07:20] volume when you start to leave your dog
[07:22] for longer periods of time then comes
[07:25] the ability to challenge your dogs a
[07:27] longer distance and this is going to be
[07:29] something that we're going to set up
[07:30] we've worked on short distance
[07:32] challenging of those behaviors now we're
[07:34] going to move on to long distance
[07:35] challenging of those behaviors and we're
[07:37] going to Simply use a long line a long
[07:39] line with a nice metal buckle on the end
[07:41] you can attach that to the front of the
[07:43] crate and you can run that all the way
[07:45] around into the next room and you're
[07:46] going to start proofing this out for
[07:48] longer periods of time you can set your
[07:50] dog up you can make it feel like you've
[07:52] gone out go and open the front door shut
[07:55] the front door and then stay really
[07:56] quiet then you wait and you listen quiet
[07:59] tightly and if after a few minutes five
[08:02] minutes they might start to test those
[08:03] obnoxious behaviors you use your long
[08:06] line and you rattle it and it creates
[08:08] exactly the same situation a crate or
[08:11] rattle slightly it'll make that noise
[08:12] and it will challenge your dog's
[08:14] behavior and they'll think that that
[08:16] just happens anytime they do those
[08:19] behaviors it's not necessarily you
[08:20] coming over and tapping on top of the
[08:22] crate that causes it it's any time they
[08:25] display those behaviors that happens so
[08:27] whether you're there or whether you're
[08:29] not they won't bother trying and they
[08:31] settle down relax learning to love their
[08:34] crate know it's their happy safe place
[08:36] your hard-earned possessions are kept
[08:38] safe your neighbors don't hate you and
[08:41] your dog is able to recover recuperate
[08:44] and be happy perfect canine companions
[08:47] thank you

[00:00] if you want to have massive success and
[00:02] have that dream can I companion that
[00:04] you've always wanted there are
[00:06] absolutely things that you should be
[00:07] doing long before the dog even comes
[00:10] into your home and as a canine
[00:12] behaviorist I specialize in helping
[00:13] people when their dogs have gone wrong
[00:16] and these are the things that people
[00:17] with badly behaved dogs didn't do and
[00:20] when I meet people with incredibly
[00:21] trained dogs these are the things that
[00:24] they did do so you want to make sure
[00:25] that you are the latter get these things
[00:28] right first and set you and your dog up
[00:30] for Success now this is of utmost
[00:32] importance if you want to have success
[00:34] with your dog and you absolutely must
[00:38] find the right breed for you your family
[00:41] and your lifestyle this is the number
[00:44] one mistake that I am seeing people all
[00:46] around the globe make every single day
[00:49] with their dogs they are failing before
[00:53] they even bring their dog into the home
[00:54] because they are choosing a breed either
[00:56] based on how it looks or simply based on
[00:59] that leads popularity at the time with
[01:02] no thought on their breeds
[01:04] characteristics temperaments energy
[01:06] expenditure trainability leadership
[01:09] requirements are all things that you
[01:11] absolutely should be thinking about to
[01:14] ensure that you and your dog are going
[01:16] to have success because you are a good
[01:18] match if you fail to plan you are
[01:22] absolutely planning to fail one of the
[01:25] most important things that you must have
[01:27] in place long before your dog comes into
[01:30] your home is a plan a plan of action of
[01:33] how are you going to train them all the
[01:35] obedience that they need how are you
[01:38] going to socialize them adequately how
[01:40] are you going to teach implicit manners
[01:43] and how are you going to do that
[01:45] understanding your dog's different skill
[01:47] set depending on their age you can't
[01:50] expect to have everything done within
[01:51] the first couple of weeks but if you
[01:53] wait for those first couple of weeks
[01:54] establish bad behaviors might absolutely
[01:57] happen so you need to have a plan of
[02:00] action in place before your dog comes
[02:04] home and once you have a plan with your
[02:06] dogs the most important thing is to then
[02:09] ensure that everybody in that dog's life
[02:12] is aware of the plan but also then ready
[02:15] to execute on the plan consistency is
[02:19] absolutely key when it comes to having
[02:21] success with dogs and one of the worst
[02:23] things you can do is Dad be incredibly
[02:26] consistent but kids be woefully
[02:29] inconsistent for mum to be incredibly
[02:31] consistent but Dad to let the dog get
[02:33] away with murder for Dad to use one set
[02:36] of commands a mum to use a different set
[02:39] that inconsistency not only will make
[02:42] training much harder but more
[02:44] importantly for me is it creates anxious
[02:47] fearful dogs because dogs need
[02:49] consistency to be able to trust they
[02:52] need trust to be able to be happy
[02:54] content dogs that are well behaved under
[02:58] control and well balanced so get that
[03:00] plan in place but then just as if not
[03:03] more importantly ensure that everybody
[03:06] is aware of the plan and everybody is
[03:08] prepared to stick to the plan

[00:00] The Brak command is one of the most
[00:01] important commands you can have at your
[00:03] disposal suly Place stay you need to be
[00:07] able to let your dog clearly know when
[00:10] they finished doing something or they'll
[00:12] start making that decision for
[00:14] themselves I've asked him to place and
[00:16] stay there and he must do that until I
[00:18] tell him otherwise what otherwise means
[00:21] is I'm going to ask him for another
[00:23] command which could be heal it could be
[00:25] down it could be recoil or it could be
[00:27] you finished go and do what you want to
[00:29] do if you don't provide that for your
[00:31] dog they'll start making those decisions
[00:33] for themselves and if they make those
[00:35] decisions for themselves in a formal
[00:37] situation like this they'll make them in
[00:39] real world situations when you're out
[00:41] and about and that is a slippery slope
[00:43] to a dog that just ignores you because
[00:45] they pick and choose when they have to
[00:46] listen and when they don't soid break
[00:50] break command make sure it's in Your
[00:52] Arsenal now crate training is something
[00:54] that I truly believe all dog owners
[00:56] should teach their dogs but more
[00:58] importantly it isn't something something
[01:00] the dogs dislike if you do it well you
[01:03] can make the crate one of the best
[01:05] places for your dogs and the way that
[01:06] you can start this is just introducing
[01:09] the crate in a fun way the way I do that
[01:11] is just get something that your dog
[01:12] likes Cole what's
[01:14] this get them to be interested just
[01:17] Chuck it in let them go in let them
[01:19] sniff let them come out when they want
[01:21] come on and then call what's this do it
[01:25] again so for the first couple of days
[01:27] that you're working on crate training
[01:29] with your dog just have this ability
[01:34] cois to get them comfortable going in
[01:37] and out and building up that positive
[01:39] Association that when they're inside the
[01:40] crate that's a really good place now
[01:42] this isn't crate training finish that's
[01:45] just the first part of crate training
[01:47] but when crate training is built on this
[01:48] Foundation that the crate equals good
[01:51] things with the other tips and tricks
[01:53] that I teach around crate training you
[01:55] will have your dog love their crate it
[01:57] be their favorite place which means you
[01:58] can keep them safe and under control not
[02:01] destroying your house at all times now A
[02:03] ball for Sully is the single best thing
[02:07] in life to him he lives for this ball so
[02:11] as always I'm smart enough to use this
[02:13] to my advantage now the leave it drill
[02:16] is something that is incredibly useful
[02:17] if your dog is reactive towards other
[02:19] dogs being able to tell them to leave it
[02:21] and for them to disengage beautiful if
[02:23] there's any kind of resource guarding
[02:25] issues leave it can be incredibly
[02:27] powerful if they're prone to picking up
[02:28] things that are dangerous game telling
[02:30] them to leave it is incredibly powerful
[02:32] it's getting your dog to disengage from
[02:35] something that they are actively
[02:36] pursuing in but how do you teach that
[02:38] well it's a basic principle if I always
[02:40] start with a dog on a lead so that I can
[02:42] control the variables you can do this
[02:43] with a piece of food you can do this
[02:45] with a toy now like I say Sully is going
[02:48] to want this if I just give it him he's
[02:50] going to take it Sully drop good boy now
[02:52] I want him to be able to do the same
[02:55] thing but not to go for the ball I've
[02:57] got my lead to control the variables if
[02:59] he doesn't listen to me I can challenge
[03:01] the behavior with a slight bit of lead
[03:04] pressure to make sure he doesn't get it
[03:05] and reset and go again so he leave
[03:09] it and he knows to ignore it you see how
[03:12] he's disengaging from looking at it
[03:15] because we've worked on this now if he
[03:16] broke this and went to get the ball I've
[03:18] got my lead ready and I would challenge
[03:20] that behavior we'd reset and work at it
[03:22] again give you another example so again
[03:25] you can see how much he wants this if I
[03:27] just do that he's going to take it drop
[03:30] but if I do this leave
[03:33] it again he's going to disengage from it
[03:36] and not go anywhere near it we can use
[03:38] this same principle to disengage our
[03:41] dogs from other dogs other people
[03:44] cyclists anything that they display
[03:46] negative behaviors towards then if it is
[03:49] practicing like this I can get to a
[03:50] point where I can say leave
[03:54] it good boy and I reward him with the
[03:57] thing that he's leaving in the first
[03:59] place so it's a win-win Co po good boy
[04:02] now I didn't teach Co and uh let you in
[04:05] on a little secret I don't recommend it
[04:08] it is an easy trick to teach it is a
[04:10] little bit of fun but the problem is and
[04:13] especially for medium large and bigger
[04:15] dogs I find it causes way more trouble
[04:18] than it's worth dogs are renowned for
[04:21] doing what we call offering behaviors
[04:23] when they want something if they want
[04:24] your attention if they want a treat they
[04:26] will offer behaviors that they think
[04:29] might gain them access to it and if you
[04:31] have taught them to pour with a treat
[04:33] they'll start offering that behavior
[04:36] what that means is you might be sitting
[04:37] and hanging out and your dog will just
[04:39] come and start swatting at you they're
[04:41] offering you poor and offering you a
[04:43] behavior that you have rewarded in the
[04:46] past now if that happens to be a small
[04:48] child and you have a larger dog I've
[04:50] seen it happen countless times you now
[04:52] have a dog that is pouring a child
[04:55] accidentally in the face I just don't
[04:57] think there is any kind of benefit that
[05:00] outweighs the negative of teaching
[05:05] [Music]

[00:00] which dog breeds simply have too much

[00:08] much energy for one person might be

[00:15] behaviorist which breeds do I see cause
[00:17] problems more than all of the others
[00:20] because of their insane levels of energy
[00:22] well for me it's simple it's two breeds
[00:24] it's the border collie and the Belgium
[00:26] Malinois in the right hands for somebody
[00:28] who can actually handle that kind of
[00:31] energy and intensity amazing dogs but

[00:00] having a perfect dog is so much more
[00:02] achievable than people think and as a
[00:04] canine behaviorist I've helped thousands
[00:06] of people achieve their perfect canine
[00:09] companion
[00:10] I'm going to share with you the top tips
[00:12] you can do easily every day to set you
[00:16] up for huge success and even better you
[00:19] can get them all done first thing in the
[00:22] morning
[00:23] and as I believe so strongly in these
[00:26] tips they're the exact things I do with
[00:29] my own dogs every morning
[00:31] [Music]
[00:36] sizing your dog but it doesn't need to
[00:38] take loads of time out of your day
[00:43] find creative ways to quickly burn
[00:45] energy from your dog
[00:49] the best way by far is to teach your dog
[00:52] a game of fetch
[00:54] but if your dog doesn't like fetch then
[00:56] my top tip is to find ways to let your
[00:59] dog do the thing it was bred for if it's
[01:03] a sight hound or a hunter by a law
[01:06] course if it's a protection dog practice
[01:08] those skills if it's a scent dog hide
[01:11] their favorite items and have them go
[01:13] searching and what's great is that five
[01:16] to ten minutes of this will be the
[01:18] equivalent of hours of normal walking
[01:22] and you have to understand the entire
[01:24] dog is a better behaved dog and a tire
[01:27] dog is a happy dog
[01:30] taking your dog out for a loose lead
[01:32] walk not only does it make the act of
[01:34] taking your dogs for a walk a much more
[01:36] pleasant experience for you but it's
[01:38] also much more enjoyable for your dogs
[01:40] it provides much better physical
[01:42] exercise and mental stimulation for your
[01:45] dogs but it has massive widespread
[01:47] ramifications because for them to be
[01:49] walking by my side on a loose lead means
[01:53] they have to be paying attention they
[01:54] have to be looking up to me for guidance
[01:56] and Direction and we can use that in
[01:58] every single aspect and area of our
[02:01] dog's lives which means that I can
[02:04] navigate them through exactly what it is
[02:06] that I need them to do and exactly what
[02:09] it is that I need them not to do which
[02:11] is what means you can have a dog be
[02:13] beautifully behaved no matter what
[02:15] situation you find yourself in
[02:19] the next tip is
[02:20] [Music]
[02:22] a shootie if
[02:24] this ever single day
[02:27] don't waste meal times take your dog's
[02:30] rations for the day and put them in a
[02:33] training pouch
[02:35] that way you're always ready and able to
[02:38] reward your dog for doing the right
[02:40] thing
[02:43] come back when called hey
[02:46] listening to commands pay eye contact
[02:49] hey there are endless opportunities to
[02:53] reward your dog and often we are quick
[02:56] to punish the undesirable Behavior but
[02:58] far too slow to reward the desirable
[03:01] Behavior
[03:04] oh
[03:07] socializing your dogs is of incredible
[03:10] importance but it's not just any
[03:12] socialization it's not just letting your
[03:14] dogs do what they want when they want we
[03:17] need to take them to different
[03:18] circumstances different situations
[03:19] different environments but not just do
[03:22] that you need to do it with purpose and
[03:24] the purpose is to help them gradually be
[03:27] able to not just remain calm in those
[03:30] different situations but more
[03:31] importantly to be able to look up to you
[03:34] for guidance and direction in those
[03:37] situations it's impossible to be able to
[03:40] socialize your dog to absolutely
[03:42] everything but what we can do is
[03:44] socialize them to as much as possible
[03:46] and help them understand that no matter
[03:48] what they come across they look up to us
[03:50] for guidance and Direction so when they
[03:52] do come across something that's making
[03:53] them nervous or making them anxious or
[03:55] making them fearful their reset button
[03:58] is look up to you for guidance and
[04:00] direction that then gives you the
[04:02] opportunity to communicate to them what
[04:04] it is that you do want from them what it
[04:06] is that you don't want from them and
[04:07] you're able to keep your dog calm
[04:09] content happy and well behaved in any
[04:12] given situation or circumstance
[04:17] now in this short morning walk with
[04:19] Uncle Sully and queen Eileen I provided
[04:22] great exercise
[04:24] I've worked on loose lead walking I've
[04:28] socialized them to a new place and found
[04:31] plenty of opportunity to reward
[04:33] desirable Behavior setting us up for an
[04:36] amazing day

[00:16] planting your flag well it's a concept
[00:19] that builds on from my Loosely pack
[00:21] walking and anytime you come to a stop
[00:24] you need to claim the space in front of
[00:26] your dog and you can simply do this by
[00:28] planting your flag get into the habit of
[00:31] just placing your foot slightly in front
[00:33] of your dog and be relaxed calm
[00:35] confident and loving leader this
[00:38] communicates to your dog effortlessly
[00:40] because you are in control and they can
[00:42] relax as well let the opposite happen in
[00:45] your dog claims space then they might be
[00:47] alert which is often a trigger for

[00:19] and the Belgium malamir and you can wrap
[00:20] in most high D high energy working
[00:24] breeds that are incredibly Handler
[00:25] driven into that mix as well those kinds
[00:29] of breeds need tons of exercise they
[00:31] need tons of training and they really
[00:33] thrive on building a relationship with

[00:38] and if you're too busy to provide that

[00:00] these are three dog breeds that I would
[00:01] never own myself as a Kine behaviorist
[00:04] first up for me would have to be the
[00:06] Caucasian Shepherd I genuinely don't
[00:08] think that is a breed that anybody
[00:09] should be considering getting unless
[00:11] they need a legitimate livestock
[00:13] Guardian breed in a country where you
[00:16] have predators like wolves and bears
[00:17] that are a very real threat to you and
[00:19] your livestock number two for me is the
[00:21] Siberian Husky I used to own the
[00:24] Siberian Husky and I've worked with
[00:26] hundreds of them for me I'm just not a
[00:29] big fan Huskies I think are more cat
[00:31] than they are dog and just don't really
[00:33] Vibe with what I look for from a dog and
[00:35] last up for me would probably be a
[00:37] Chihuahua now don't get me wrong I
[00:38] definitely think I could pull off
[00:40] rocking a really small dog breed but
[00:42] honestly I'd be worried that I might
[00:44] lose it sit on it or hurt it so I just
[00:46] wouldn't take that risk

[00:00] let's look at what I think might be the
[00:01] three most important things you need to
[00:04] understand if you want to raise and
[00:05] train your puppy to be a perfect K and I
[00:08] companion that you've always dreamed of
[00:10] probably the reason you got a dog in the
[00:11] first place do you want to be able to
[00:13] take your dog with you to coffee shops
[00:15] with you to pubs be able to take them on
[00:16] a holiday and just be able to have that
[00:18] dog be an absolute legend that is fun to
[00:21] take everywhere enjoyable to take
[00:23] everywhere safe to take everywhere and a
[00:25] well- behaved K9 companion so then let's
[00:27] look at the first of the three things I
[00:29] want to talk about in today's video and
[00:31] the first thing is starting as you mean
[00:33] to go on now this is probably one of the
[00:35] most difficult parts of puppy training
[00:37] because let's face it 8 week old puppies
[00:40] are absolutely adorable but when you
[00:43] bring your puppy into your home I really
[00:44] want you to focus on this idea I want
[00:47] you to picture your dog in 12 months
[00:50] time 18 months time 2 years time and
[00:53] really think about what that dog is
[00:55] going to be at that point and then what
[00:57] it is that you're going to expect of
[00:59] your dog at that point when the novelty
[01:02] of having a puppy is worn off when the
[01:04] cuteness of having a puppy is worn off
[01:06] and what all you want is for your dog
[01:08] just to be well behaved start as you
[01:11] mean to go on treat your puppy like
[01:14] you'll treat your dog in 18 months 2
[01:16] years old will you let your 18month old
[01:19] 2-year-old dog jump all over you every
[01:22] time you walk into a room if the answer
[01:23] is no then don't let your puppy do it
[01:26] will you allow your 18mon old dog to
[01:28] chew all of your Furniture to chew all
[01:31] of your clothes to chew all of your
[01:33] shoes then don't allow your puppy to do
[01:36] it now I'm not saying that your puppy is
[01:37] going to be trained straight away but
[01:39] you need to have those same expectations
[01:42] because it's unfair of you to let your
[01:44] puppy get away with things and I'm
[01:46] talking about jumping up they come
[01:48] running over to you they're super cute
[01:49] they jump up you and you go oh you're so
[01:51] adorable and you pick them up and you
[01:52] cuddle them but in a few months time
[01:55] when they're older and they're more
[01:56] grown and it's annoying and starting to
[01:58] become dangerous and then you get frust
[01:59] ated that's not the dog's fault that's
[02:01] your fault you're now adding confusion
[02:04] which is going to jeopardize your
[02:05] relationship which is going to make
[02:06] every other aspect of you and your dog's
[02:08] life more difficult so set your
[02:11] expectations for your adult dog and
[02:13] start as you mean to go on from day one
[02:16] number two and this is something that if
[02:18] you've done this before you will be
[02:20] agreeing with me that yes absolutely
[02:22] this is mandatory and every puppy owner
[02:24] should do it and if you've never done it
[02:26] before you'll probably think I'm being a
[02:28] bit extreme with saying that absolutely
[02:29] every body should do it but that is
[02:31] crate training your puppy it is an
[02:34] absolute non-negotiable fundamental when
[02:37] it comes to me training puppies or if
[02:39] I'm helping clients to train their
[02:41] puppies when I bring a puppy into my
[02:43] home it is the number one priority that
[02:46] is all I care about on day one is toilet
[02:50] training and crate training and getting
[02:52] that dialed in as quickly as possible if
[02:55] you can get your crate training done
[02:56] which can be done in day one or have
[02:59] massive success with setting up crate
[03:01] trading on day one night times will be
[03:04] easier which means you'll get more sleep
[03:07] which means you won't be angry about
[03:08] having puppy you'll avoid the puppy
[03:10] Blues the regret won't kick in and
[03:12] you'll be able to handle all of the
[03:13] other responsibilities and things that
[03:15] you need to do with your puppy much
[03:17] better if you crate train your puppy
[03:20] from day one toilet training will be
[03:22] much easier because dogs are Denning
[03:23] animals and when you do it properly when
[03:25] you do it in a positive fun way you're
[03:27] going to set your toilet training or
[03:29] potty training up for huge amounts of
[03:31] success do you want to avoid separation
[03:34] anxiety do you want to be the kind of
[03:36] neighbor who when you go out your dog's
[03:38] howling and crying and barking nonstop
[03:40] and everybody on your street absolutely
[03:42] hates you or do you want to be able to
[03:44] go out and your dog to understand how to
[03:46] settle down how to be alone how being
[03:48] alone can actually be a nice experience
[03:51] for them and to teach them some
[03:53] Independence the single best way of
[03:55] doing that is crate training if God
[03:57] forbid your dog ever has an accident and
[03:59] needs to go into the vet for an extended
[04:01] period of time that will be easier for
[04:03] them if they are crate trained traveling
[04:05] will be a safer experience for everybody
[04:07] involved if they are crate trained crate
[04:10] training is one of the best things you
[04:12] can do for your puppy and for you and I
[04:16] highly highly recommend that you take
[04:19] that seriously and again be working on
[04:21] crate training from day one and last but
[04:24] not least I want to focus on this
[04:26] concept of Basics over tricks a lot of
[04:29] people get a new puppy into their home
[04:31] and they want to do training and they're
[04:33] thinking about fun things that they can
[04:34] do with their dogs and they teach them
[04:36] loads of different things they teach
[04:38] them loads of different tricks but let
[04:40] me let you in to a secret let me let you
[04:42] into to the reality of what it's like to
[04:44] again own a dog once it to come out of
[04:47] that novelty period of having a puppy is
[04:50] that tricks mean absolutely nothing when
[04:53] you are out in public with your dog it
[04:55] does not matter if your dog can play
[04:57] dead roll over spin horn you name it if
[05:01] they are reactive to other dogs if they
[05:04] are constantly pulling you down the road
[05:06] if they jump up people when they meet
[05:08] them because they're over excited that
[05:10] all those tricks you've taught will mean
[05:12] absolutely nothing if your dog is badly
[05:14] behaved all I care about with dogs is
[05:17] that they will walk nicely by my side
[05:20] basics of heel training that they have
[05:22] excellent manners so they will sit and
[05:24] wait patiently and that they'll come
[05:26] back to me when I ask them to if I have
[05:28] just those fo the mental basics in place
[05:31] I have a dream K and I companion that I
[05:33] can take with me safely anywhere and
[05:35] they are a joy to take anywhere I often
[05:38] get stopped in public with my dogs to
[05:40] say how amazingly behaved they are the
[05:42] reality is even as a dog trainer even as
[05:45] a k9 behaviorist I don't teach my dogs
[05:47] any tricks I have no interest in doing
[05:49] it for fun and it's not what I look for
[05:51] for my dogs what people are stopping me
[05:53] in public about to say how they wish
[05:56] their dogs were as well behaved as mine
[05:58] or they wish their dogs were as well
[05:59] trained as mine is because I can be in a
[06:02] coffee shop and if I ask them to sit and
[06:04] stay they sit and stay once I'm walking
[06:07] down the High Street doesn't matter how
[06:08] many dogs are walking past me they don't
[06:10] have fancy formal heal they don't have
[06:12] fancy obedience but they just walk next
[06:15] to me calmly and quietly if you focus on
[06:18] just the basic principles you will have
[06:21] a happier life with your dog you can
[06:24] make sure that your dog understands that
[06:26] to gain access to your attention to gain
[06:28] access to your training treats to gain
[06:30] access to all the positive things in
[06:31] life it walks nicely next to you it sits
[06:34] and waits with good manners it looks up
[06:36] to you for guidance and Direction comes
[06:38] back to you when called if that's all
[06:40] you're working on every single day you
[06:42] are going to have a dream dog if you're
[06:44] working on loads of different things and
[06:46] doing them not brilliantly and not
[06:49] getting the basics in place so that when
[06:51] you are in the real world all of that
[06:52] stuff goes out the window again you'll
[06:55] just be in a situation where you just
[06:57] wished all I want is my dog to nicely to
[07:00] sit when I ask it to to come back when I
[07:03] ask it to so focus on the basics put all
[07:05] of the time and energy that you would
[07:07] spread across loads of other things put
[07:10] all of that into the basics and you can
[07:13] thank me
[07:15] [Music]

[00:00] these are the top breeds that I
[00:01] recommend to families now I've just been
[00:03] working with a family here on my
[00:04] behavior consultation World Tour in
[00:06] Vegas and they had an absolutely awesome
[00:08] dog a mix between a German shepherd and
[00:10] a hound the problem is that does
[00:12] possess a lot of difficulties especially
[00:15] if you're a firsttime owner luckily
[00:17] these owners were very experienced and
[00:18] we just had to put a little bit of
[00:20] Polish to be able to help them get the
[00:21] dream K and I companion they've always
[00:23] wanted but if you are a new owner and
[00:26] you've got a family then I have to
[00:28] recommend for you the lab retriever or
[00:30] the golden retriever as the best dog for
[00:33] families

[00:00] now this is exactly why I would get a
[00:02] whip it now this whipit is here at my
[00:03] facility for some training today and
[00:05] absolutely loves a scratch behind the
[00:07] ear now I usually wouldn't get a breed
[00:09] like this but I'm going to let you in on
[00:11] a secret and even behaviorists and
[00:13] trainers like myself we have certain
[00:15] things about dogs that we deal with
[00:18] better and certain things we find very
[00:19] challenging for me crying howling and
[00:22] excessive barking is the thing that
[00:24] makes me Twitch the most the thing I
[00:26] find most challenging about dogs what I
[00:29] love about rets and most sounds for that
[00:31] fact is just how quiet they are you
[00:35] never really hear a peep out of them
[00:37] they very very rarely bark and with some
[00:39] basic crate training you can have a
[00:41] super chill sweetheart as of a dog to
[00:44] share your life with

[00:00] [Music]
[00:24] we often have kind of two tracks and we
[00:27] we always want to be working on both but
[00:28] there's the behavior that we're seeing
[00:30] which might be barking and crying and
[00:32] not settling but then the emotional
[00:34] underpinnings of that and it sounds like
[00:37] you've made great progress on the the
[00:39] behavior side of things but the
[00:41] emotional underpinnings are clearly
[00:43] still there aren't they that it he is
[00:45] that you say she she's very stressed
[00:48] still even though you're happy with the
[00:49] Behavior now which again is brilliant
[00:52] what we want to do is get her that
[00:54] emotional arousal level coming down and
[00:58] the protocol that you would use with
[00:59] that with separation anxiety in
[01:01] particular is kind of a desensitization
[01:03] program they are very difficult to do
[01:06] and very long winded it's a long road to
[01:10] be able to completely change her mindset
[01:13] of I'm so stressed that you've left to
[01:15] actually I'm quite happy or relaxed that
[01:17] you've left um and especially with
[01:19] rescue dogs cuz we don't know what has
[01:21] happened that the it's like humans isn't
[01:24] it if there's severe trauma it's not
[01:26] something that we can overcome quickly U
[01:28] but the fact that you've got the
[01:30] behavior side that's amazing if you've
[01:33] been working with a credit to kind of
[01:35] the work that um yeah that you've put in
[01:38] to kind of get to that point is
[01:39] beautiful many people can't get there
[01:41] with that kind of severe level of
[01:42] separation anxiety so that's brilliant
[01:45] um and again a desensitization program
[01:47] would be kind of what you want to be
[01:49] working
[01:57] on those kinds of problems for me things
[02:00] that I would be working on kind of over
[02:02] a couple of week stuff you you can come
[02:05] in and kind of correct those behaviors
[02:08] quite swiftly but then you're playing
[02:10] whack-a-mole you might fix that but
[02:12] create an issue elsewhere with like
[02:13] Place training and Sit Stay training you
[02:15] kind of like countering with obedience
[02:17] then rather than having to rely on kind
[02:19] of overly aversive strategies which like
[02:21] I say might fix it in the the immediate
[02:23] which might be required especially if
[02:25] it's dangerous um but I think if you use
[02:28] protocols to kind of set yourself up for
[02:29] sucess set a little bit it's nice cuz
[02:31] you're not just telling her what you
[02:32] don't want you're helping her understand
[02:34] this is no this is what I want from you
[02:36] if I'm hugging somebody goodbye I just
[02:37] want you to sit and wait there and then
[02:39] if she doesn't do that that's what
[02:41] you're then challenging of I've asked
[02:43] you to do this and you're now not doing
[02:45] it so I'm going to challenge that
[02:47] because by the time that hyperarousal is
[02:49] erupted if you're now trying to deal
[02:52] with that so much can go wrong or like I
[02:55] say create little issues elsewhere
[02:57] whereas if and you just set that up in
[02:59] training t maros kind of like this of
[03:01] like I know if I do this that's going to
[03:03] get her to do that brilliant let's get
[03:05] her play Staying and we're going to go
[03:07] say we're going to then she goes and
[03:09] we're ready to handle that nope back and
[03:12] then it just builds that picture of like
[03:14] obedience comes first using that is
[03:17] always a preferable option for kind of
[03:19] behavior stuff um because again the fact
[03:22] that she can do this like this is
[03:24] brilliant it's clearly there it's just
[03:26] helping a reminder that that expectation
[03:27] is no matter what's going on we have
[03:30] these levels of
[03:37] expectations feels like it's random but
[03:41] he's hyper focusing in on the pitball
[03:43] I'm sure you're kind of feeling that um
[03:46] and that to me says that there isn't
[03:48] Randomness in his explosion it's very
[03:51] calculated and it's very I see it really
[03:52] commonly with rck wiers they're so hyper
[03:54] tuned in with their kind of guarding
[03:56] roles and they would be the things I
[03:59] would be making a real mental note of of
[04:01] like when that happened what was it that
[04:03] caused it and watching it there was a
[04:05] time in the car park where it was
[04:07] something new came into the B crossed
[04:09] kind of a key spatial boundary and then
[04:12] in this situation cuz he's quite a
[04:14] confident boy as well that makes there's
[04:17] not a nice myth there and it's neither
[04:20] fault but that's just a classic example
[04:22] that not all dogs are going to be best
[04:24] friends but that would be the kind of
[04:26] thing that I would be clocking if I was
[04:28] handling him is spotting in all kind of
[04:31] these other dogs wouldn't concern me but
[04:33] when I see a confident kind of dog like
[04:36] this that would be for me a real sign of
[04:38] I'm going to have to either be
[04:40] hyperfocused or give this space um and
[04:44] yeah I think that's just a really nice
[04:45] example of understanding your dog and
[04:48] not realizing that not all dogs are the
[04:51] same and therefore not there's not going
[04:53] to be a one size fits all situation but
[04:55] that was a beautiful example there of I
[04:57] kind of saw it going and then the lunch
[05:00] happened and that's usually I'm when I'm
[05:02] a bit faster I would have stepped in and
[05:04] you could have addressed that there um
[05:06] but you getting better in tune with what
[05:08] those triggers are are going to be
[05:09] gamechanging for him

[00:00] as a canine behaviorist I have had the
[00:02] privilege and honor to be able to
[00:03] literally help tens of thousands of
[00:04] people be able to achieve their dream
[00:06] Canine Companion now as a part of that
[00:09] process I have also been able to see the
[00:11] work that needs to go in to being able
[00:13] to have the dream can I Companion now
[00:16] contrary to popular belief it's not as
[00:18] much as you might think when we're first
[00:20] getting on top of potentially bad
[00:22] behaviors there might be a little bit
[00:23] more involved but once we're making
[00:25] progress we just need to keep the
[00:27] fountain topped up we just have to
[00:29] trickle away at certain things and in
[00:32] this video I want to focus on a few
[00:33] different training exercises that you
[00:35] should be doing with your dog every
[00:37] single day to help maintain high levels
[00:40] of success with your dream Canine
[00:42] Companion the first thing I think you
[00:44] should be doing with your dog every
[00:45] single day is what we call Place
[00:46] training it's the ability to send your
[00:49] dog somewhere and have them stay there
[00:51] now that might seem a bit trivial but
[00:53] let me explain why that's so important
[00:55] first of all having your dog be able to
[00:58] go and settle somewhere is just super
[00:59] useful for let's face it there are times
[01:01] where you just want a bit of peace and
[01:03] quiet you just want your dog to be able
[01:05] to just chill out and relax while you
[01:07] deal with whatever else is going on in
[01:09] life it's incredible at working on it
[01:11] impulse control with your dog our dogs
[01:13] are driven by their natural ancestral
[01:16] desires and that is different for every
[01:17] dog a lot of it is informed by their
[01:20] breed the control those desires and
[01:22] impulses a beautiful way of practicing
[01:24] that every single day it's just Place
[01:26] training I want you to go on there and
[01:28] to stay on there but Place training is
[01:30] incredibly beneficial for impulse
[01:32] control it also helps with your dog
[01:34] understanding good manners when we need
[01:36] them to be calm quiet relax and stay
[01:38] somewhere they do so so that when you
[01:39] take that out in public it's a skill
[01:41] that I promise you you'll use and you'll
[01:43] be incredibly glad that you have at your
[01:45] disposal for me as a trainer and
[01:46] behaviorist it gets me excited and it's
[01:48] something I love doing with clients
[01:49] because it's a really nice way to work
[01:52] on Handler timing when it comes to
[01:54] marking good behaviors rewarding good
[01:56] behaviors communicating laws and cues
[01:59] appropriately at the right time place
[02:02] training is an excellent way to work on
[02:04] that because there's that very clear
[02:05] distinction between the floor and when
[02:07] the dog commits and puts all four paws
[02:09] on the placebed or the raised bed
[02:11] whatever it is that you're using so it
[02:13] helps you develop good timing in
[02:15] communicating to our dogs what it is
[02:17] that we do want and then if they make a
[02:19] mistake and get off the place board when
[02:21] they shouldn't as soon as that first
[02:23] pour goes off we can verbally challenge
[02:25] that redirect them back onto the place
[02:27] board and it builds good timing with
[02:29] challenging bad behaviors and rewarding
[02:31] praising and marking good behaviors
[02:35] [Music]
[02:40] foreign
[02:43] [Music]
[02:51] the second thing I think you should be
[02:52] doing with your dog every single day is
[02:54] recall games now for me teaching perfect
[02:56] recall involves loads of different fun
[02:59] games that we play for our dogs and I've
[03:01] developed tons of different games that
[03:03] work on different individual pieces of
[03:05] recall from things like impulse control
[03:07] to distraction levels to competing
[03:10] motivators these games work on all of
[03:12] those different pieces of the puzzle but
[03:15] when you have perfect recall the ability
[03:17] to go and enjoy the great outdoors with
[03:19] your dog opens up to you and you can do
[03:21] so safely and keep you and your dog
[03:24] under control and not be that nightmare
[03:26] owner that has a completely out of
[03:28] control dog ruining the experience for
[03:31] everybody else now achieving perfect
[03:32] recall is more complicated than we can
[03:35] cover in this short video but to help
[03:37] people get perfect recall I created a
[03:40] completely free course it's called My
[03:42] rapid recall course it teaches you all
[03:44] about the theory and fundamentals of
[03:46] achieving perfect recall and it includes
[03:48] some of my recall games again completely
[03:51] free of charge so before we move on to
[03:53] the next thing you should be doing with
[03:54] your dog every single day there will be
[03:56] a link to that in the description box
[03:57] below that you can check out if you're
[03:59] interested the next thing I think you
[04:00] should be doing with your dog every
[04:01] single day is what I call my magic green
[04:03] circle game now if you've seen me watch
[04:07] me on any platform for even just a
[04:09] couple of videos you've probably heard
[04:10] me waffling on about the importance of
[04:13] loose lead heel walking I do think it is
[04:16] probably the single most important thing
[04:18] that you should be doing with your dog
[04:19] every single day having the ability to
[04:22] walk your dog on a loose lead has a
[04:24] whole host of benefits that I've covered
[04:27] at length literally thousands of times
[04:30] in thousands of other videos because
[04:32] it's so powerful one of the best ways to
[04:34] achieve loose lead walking is what I
[04:36] call my magic green circle game once
[04:39] we've gone through some of the processes
[04:40] to get our dog starting to develop this
[04:43] idea of being on our side I turn it into
[04:46] a really fun game imagine there is a
[04:48] green circle attached to your left foot
[04:50] going out to one side if your dog stays
[04:53] in that magic circle attached to your
[04:55] foot the circle stays green and if they
[04:58] stay within that Circle we can change
[05:00] different directions keep them guessing
[05:02] we can go over obstacles around
[05:03] obstacles if they stay in that green
[05:05] circle we reward and we praise them if
[05:08] they drift outside of that Circle either
[05:10] to the side or to the front or behind we
[05:12] use our leash pressure Basics to be able
[05:15] to bring them back into that Circle and
[05:17] we teach them that staying in the circle
[05:19] is an amazing thing that they should do
[05:21] at all times focusing on us it is one of
[05:24] the single most powerful ways to achieve
[05:26] loose lead walking and it's a game that
[05:28] you can do from Five Seconds up to five
[05:30] minutes you can do it at the start of
[05:32] your walk during your walk at the end of
[05:34] your walk and I do think it's something
[05:36] that you should dial in every single day
[05:38] and really help your dog find the art of
[05:40] walking on a loose lead and Incredibly
[05:42] fun and enjoyable one but they
[05:45] understand at the same time that it's
[05:47] something that they must do

[00:00] when your young puppy is pulling towards
[00:02] another dog it might not seem that big
[00:04] of a problem but if it's not addressed
[00:07] it can become a huge issue which is
[00:09] exactly what has happened here now a
[00:11] friend of a friend knows that i
[00:13] specialize in reactivity and pulling
[00:16] based cases and he was desperate for my
[00:19] help and i'm absolutely going to put
[00:20] them in touch with one of my approved
[00:22] trainers for their long-term program but
[00:25] i was able to free up exactly 18 minutes
[00:28] out of my busy schedule today and i want
[00:30] to show you just what can be achieved in
[00:32] 18 minutes so let's throw up a timer for
[00:35] 18 minutes and let's dive in to helping
[00:37] this beautiful girl go from a pulling
[00:40] nightmare to walking beautifully so that
[00:42] walks become the joy of the day again
[00:45] rather than them being the chore of the
[00:47] day now i always like to kick off my
[00:49] training sessions with some fun with
[00:52] some food work with some positive
[00:54] reinforcement work and help them start
[00:56] to understand what it is that i do want
[00:59] in a really fun way before i move on to
[01:01] helping them understand what i don't
[01:04] want from them but as you can see bess
[01:06] is absolutely not interested in the food
[01:09] rewards that i've got and she is also
[01:11] not engaging with me whatsoever which
[01:14] tells me that this is absolutely at the
[01:16] root cause of the problem is that there
[01:18] is no engagement between the dog
[01:21] and that other thing on the end of the
[01:23] lead and right now that's me but for us
[01:25] to be able to make progress i need her
[01:28] to start looking up for me for guidance
[01:30] and direction so i'm not going to waste
[01:32] any more of my 18 minutes i'm going to
[01:34] dive straight in to my tune-up drill now
[01:36] the two main things i'm looking to
[01:38] achieve from my tune up drill is first
[01:40] and foremost guidance and direction
[01:43] helping the dog understand that they
[01:44] must look up to me for guidance and
[01:46] direction and more importantly they must
[01:48] follow my direction and i'm giving them
[01:51] that guidance and direction because i
[01:52] love them and i want to keep them safe
[01:54] under control so that we can explore the
[01:57] world and have an amazing life together
[01:59] which then takes me to the second thing
[02:01] that i'm trying to achieve with this
[02:03] drill and that is helping them
[02:04] understand that there's a time and a
[02:06] place and the time and the place for
[02:08] playing with dogs isn't right now it
[02:11] isn't why we're on a lead now is the
[02:12] time in the place to pay attention to me
[02:14] be with me
[02:16] walk with me there will come a time and
[02:18] a place where you're going to get to
[02:20] play and have fun and be a dog and do
[02:21] all of those amazing things but they
[02:23] have to understand
[02:25] when that's appropriate and more
[02:27] importantly in this situation when it
[02:29] isn't and now we've made huge progress
[02:32] with both of those two really important
[02:34] steps i'm going to use the remainder of
[02:36] my 18 minutes to put it into real world
[02:38] practice it's all well and good being
[02:40] able to do it here in my center under
[02:42] low distraction but that's no use to the
[02:44] owner so let's go back repeat what my
[02:47] staff did earlier by testing just how
[02:49] bad she is same situation get the same
[02:52] dogs out and let's see how much success
[02:54] we've been able to achieve in just 18
[02:56] minutes
[02:58] [Music]
[03:03] good girl good
[03:06] good good
[03:09] so as you can see absolutely huge
[03:11] progress and how much time we've got
[03:13] left joe uh four minutes four minutes
[03:15] we've got four minutes left so as the
[03:17] remaining four minutes what i'm going to
[03:19] do is i'm now going to bring riley in
[03:21] and we're going to utilize the power of
[03:23] a pack walk as you saw earlier she lost
[03:26] her mind at the concept of walking with
[03:28] another dog but i'm going to bring that
[03:30] same dog back in and we're going to dial
[03:32] that up tune that up but without wasting
[03:34] any more time let's get going with that
[03:37] i'm just going to sweep past your h how
[03:39] to casually take the lead
[03:40] riley let's go
[03:46] going to do the same principle we're
[03:47] going to make the most of this last four
[03:48] minutes as you can see completely
[03:50] different energy
[03:51] completely different aura
[03:54] is it absolutely perfect heal no not yet
[03:56] but my approved trainer that we'll hand
[03:58] this over to will make monumental
[04:00] amounts of success built on this
[04:02] beautiful foundations let's go oh look
[04:04] at that perfect
[04:06] much better engagement much better let's
[04:09] go
[04:10] on a dime it's exactly what i want to
[04:12] see that shows that she's paying
[04:13] attention to me even with a high
[04:16] distraction
[04:17] dog right next to her if i do let's go
[04:21] and we can start building this up and
[04:23] what a much more enjoyable experience is
[04:27] this
[04:28] compared to what it was about 16 or 17
[04:32] minutes ago and we are coming right up
[04:33] to the end of the 18 minutes i need to
[04:35] go back and crack on however time and a
[04:38] place walking down to my paddock the
[04:41] time and the place was to pay attention
[04:43] to me follow my guidance and direction
[04:45] and walk nicely now we're down here the
[04:47] time and the place is going to be run
[04:50] play have fun be dogs time and a place
[04:53] for everything the key takeaway is that
[04:56] you dictate when that time and when that
[04:59] place is achieve that and you'll have
[05:01] the dog of your dreams subscribe so i
[05:03] can't wait to see you on the next

[00:13] environment that could quite literally
[00:15] be a Gateway it could also be going out

[00:00] now the leave it drill is something that
[00:02] is incredibly useful if your dog is
[00:04] reactive towards other dogs being able
[00:05] to you tell them to leave it and for
[00:07] them to disengage beautiful if there's
[00:09] any kind of resource guarding issues
[00:11] leave it can be incredibly powerful if
[00:13] they're prone to picking up things that
[00:14] are dangerous again telling them to
[00:16] leave it is incredibly powerful it's
[00:18] getting your dog to disengage from
[00:20] something that they are actively
[00:21] pursuing in but how do you teach that
[00:23] well as a basic principle of I always
[00:25] start with a dog on a lead so I can
[00:27] control the variables you can do this
[00:29] with a piece of food you can do this
[00:31] with a toy now like I say Sully is going
[00:33] to want this if I just give it him he's
[00:35] gonna take it slowly drop good boy now I
[00:38] want him to be able to do the same thing
[00:40] but not to go for the ball I've got my
[00:43] lead to control the variables if he
[00:45] doesn't listen to me I can challenge the
[00:47] behavior with a slight bit of lead
[00:49] pressure to make sure he doesn't get it
[00:51] and reset and go again slowly leave it
[00:55] and he knows to ignore it

[00:03] it's time to talk about the XL Bully ban
[00:07] now I'm incredibly honored to have
[00:09] become one of the most followed Kine
[00:12] behaviorists in the world but I also
[00:16] take that influence that I have very
[00:18] seriously and I ensure that I choose my
[00:21] words very carefully and I have a rule
[00:23] when it comes to making content that
[00:25] every piece of content that I make is
[00:27] built on love kindness and empathy
[00:30] and helping people positively moving
[00:33] towards better outcomes for them and
[00:36] their dogs so with that said I
[00:40] personally am impacted by this ban my
[00:43] dog puppy who I rescued at just eight
[00:45] weeks old from a pound that saved her
[00:48] from a life of dog fighting meets a lot
[00:50] of the criteria to be an XL Bully type
[00:53] dog even though she isn't and is
[00:55] therefore going to be at risk of being
[00:57] classified as a dangerous band breed so
[01:00] naturally I was just as angry frustrated
[01:02] and confused as many of you are but
[01:05] instead of making emotionally charge
[01:08] content that would have been wrapped in
[01:10] negativity and frustration I stuck to my
[01:13] principles of trying to find Positive
[01:16] Solutions to moving forward effectively
[01:19] and I've since been speaking to Legal
[01:21] experts experts in Academia and experts
[01:23] in politics to find out what the actual
[01:26] opportunities are for us and what the
[01:28] actual potential outcome comes to help
[01:30] make this situation a more positive one
[01:33] rather than simply making content for
[01:36] Instagram likes that doesn't help anyone
[01:40] and the conclusion that we have drawn
[01:42] since speaking with these experts is
[01:44] that this ban is going to go through and
[01:48] that this ban is going to be messy this
[01:51] ban is going to be confusing and this
[01:53] ban is going to impact lots of people
[01:56] and lots of dogs lives but I personally
[01:59] refuse to wallow in the anger of
[02:01] something that is out of my control and
[02:03] I refuse to add more anger and
[02:05] negativity to the social media landscape
[02:08] so me and my team have been hard at work
[02:10] to provide an element of control that
[02:13] those of you that are also impacted by
[02:16] this ban can take ownership of and to be
[02:18] able to keep your dog safe and under
[02:21] control and live as happy life as
[02:23] possible regardless of this ban and my
[02:26] first step towards this is creating a
[02:29] comprehens ensive muzzle training course
[02:31] that you guys can access to be able to
[02:34] make the muzzle training part of the
[02:35] process as seamless as fun and as a a
[02:39] positive experience as possible for both
[02:41] you and your dog but more importantly to
[02:44] ensure that as many people as possible
[02:47] impacted by this ban have access to this
[02:50] positive solution I have made this
[02:52] course completely free of charge for the
[02:55] rest of 2023 and all of 2024 regardless
[02:59] of whether your dog is impacted by this
[03:01] ban or not you can also have this course
[03:05] completely free of charge I'm offering
[03:07] this course completely free so that we
[03:09] can lead the charge and being positive
[03:12] examples of what these breeds can be
[03:15] being positive examples of muzzle
[03:17] advocacy and to give those of you in
[03:19] need of this help easy access to making
[03:22] this transition a fun and positive one
[03:25] for your dogs so yes this is a difficult
[03:28] complex confus using and frustrating
[03:31] situation and it is a situation that is
[03:33] even more frustrating because of the
[03:36] lack of control the owners like us have
[03:39] over it however I truly believe that we
[03:42] have to focus on the things that are in
[03:44] our control and right now I think the
[03:46] thing that we can control is making sure
[03:50] that we are shining examples of what
[03:52] these breeds can be having them trained
[03:55] to high levels and having high standards
[03:58] and as always me and my team are here to
[04:00] help assist you in being able to become
[04:02] better loving K9 leaders that are able
[04:05] to raise and train perfect K9 companions
[04:09] starting with right now you being able

[00:00] what are the best small dog breeds as a
[00:02] canine behaviorist it's no secret that I
[00:04] love large powerful dog breeds but I
[00:07] often get asked if I had to have a small
[00:08] dog breed which one would I choose and
[00:10] why so these are my favorite small dog
[00:12] breeds first up has to be the Boston
[00:14] Terrier what I love about the Boston
[00:16] Terrier is you get a lot of the fun
[00:18] characteristics of a breed like a French
[00:20] Bulldog however they're much more
[00:22] athletic and far healthier than some of
[00:24] those other brassiophallic breeds and if
[00:27] I wanted a super lovable almost zero
[00:29] risk dog to just hang out at my house to
[00:32] chill with my wife and children I'd have
[00:34] to choose the Cavalier King Charles
[00:35] Spaniel and this small dog breed is one
[00:37] that I'm probably actually going to own
[00:39] over the next couple of years I think
[00:41] they're awesome they're great fun and
[00:43] frankly it'd just be an amazing Vibe the

[00:00] it's no secret I think Labradors are one
[00:02] of the greatest dog breeds in the world
[00:04] I can't not throw in the labrador
[00:05] retriever into the mix Labradors the
[00:07] labrador retriever the labrador Labrador
[00:09] the labrador the labrador but I wondered
[00:11] if that was just me so I asked some of
[00:13] the best dog trainers in the world which
[00:15] breed they thought was the best Labrador
[00:17] Retriever a Labrador Retriever Labrador
[00:19] Retriever Labrador Retriever so the huge
[00:22] question this left me with is why is the
[00:24] labrador the best dog breed in the world
[00:26] I started by looking into the incredible
[00:28] history of the labrador and discovered
[00:30] their lineages can be traced back to the
[00:32] St John's water dog from the island of
[00:34] New Foundland and that's the dog that
[00:36] started their amazing journey across the
[00:39] Atlantic to here in England and it was
[00:42] in the harbors of pool where the Earl of
[00:43] milsbury realized they'd excel at duck
[00:46] hunting and when he later met the Duke
[00:49] of booklu he sent him with two of his
[00:51] dogs Ned and aan to his estate in
[00:54] Scotland which became the foundation for
[00:56] the labrador we know today so for me to
[00:59] get to the bottom of this question I
[01:01] knew I had to travel to Scotland to find
[01:03] out
[01:04] [Music]
[01:09] more but it's not just about coming to
[01:11] Scotland we need to find one of the best
[01:14] dog trainers in the world that are
[01:15] training Labradors for their original
[01:18] purpose the reason that they were bred
[01:20] for us to be able to answer this
[01:22] question of why our Labradors the best
[01:24] dog breed in the
[01:28] world
[01:33] [Music]
[01:38] like what is it about a labrador that
[01:40] Natural Instinct that you want from them
[01:43] that you're then shaping yeah yeah so
[01:45] it's a desire to retrieve and the desire
[01:48] to please their owner so when you
[01:50] combine the two things where they really
[01:52] want to retrieve and you're really happy
[01:55] that they're retrieving and it doesn't
[01:57] get any better than that for them
[01:58] there's lots of other natural ability
[02:00] things that we talk about with gun dogs
[02:02] like game finding ability marking
[02:03] ability they're all big things as well
[02:05] but it all starts with their desire to
[02:08] retrieve and their desire to please
[02:09] their order and as somebody that's bred
[02:11] Labradors when do you start seeing that
[02:13] as soon as they can walk really yeah
[02:15] yeah as soon as they can physically pick
[02:17] things up in their mouths they'll be
[02:19] doing that what is the difference for
[02:21] you between show line and working line
[02:23] because I've had some people that have a
[02:26] level of expertise in the dog field that
[02:28] will say that there isn't a different
[02:30] between show line and working line and I
[02:32] would scratch my head of like have you
[02:34] spent time with them the working line
[02:36] labs are definitely higher energy I
[02:38] think they're more intelligent as well
[02:40] they've been bred for their intelligence
[02:43] for their stamina for their Drive the
[02:45] show dogs have been bred because of how
[02:47] they look so physical performance hasn't
[02:50] came into it one of the unique things
[02:52] about Labradors is specifically the UK
[02:55] work in line Labradors they have got
[02:57] what you call the onoff switch Okay so
[03:00] providing you're stimulating them
[03:01] properly with work and training and
[03:04] plenty of exercise then you can they
[03:06] will switch off and they can chill out
[03:08] and be a good dog in the house what
[03:10] would go wrong with a dog like this in
[03:13] the wrong hands is a kind of a common
[03:15] theme you've seen or a lot of dogs that
[03:17] have got a lot of intelligence and a lot
[03:19] of drive you get a lot of chewing
[03:21] problems bad recall once you do let them
[03:23] off they like oh we've got to go and
[03:24] burn energy we've got to go and
[03:26] stimulate ourselves cuz we're not
[03:27] getting stimulation from our owner have
[03:29] you you come across much aggression bite
[03:33] incidents with Labradors personally I
[03:35] haven't I've never had any any bites at
[03:39] all from any Labradors I've never known
[03:40] anyone personally that's had been bitten
[03:42] by a labrador do you think that's breed
[03:44] related I think a lot of that breed
[03:47] related yes yeah cuz my answer is when
[03:49] you make the mistake and you have to
[03:50] come to me to fix it I would rather be
[03:53] fixing a labrador then you made that
[03:55] mistake with a malenoir or an XL Bully
[03:57] or and again people get upset with that
[04:01] Viewpoint that there isn't that big of a
[04:03] difference between breeds yeah my
[04:05] experience of when Labradors go wrong
[04:07] they don't go that kind of wrong yes and
[04:09] I'm like okay well I can fix a lot of
[04:12] the issues where they have gone wrong
[04:13] which again is no excuse to get one but
[04:16] I do believe there'd be a lot less
[04:18] problems if people got more Labradors
[04:20] yes people aren't getting all to death
[04:21] by Labradors no after seeing their
[04:24] abilities in the field it wasn't just an
[04:26] incredible experience for me but it gave
[04:28] me loads to think about in terms of why
[04:31] these dogs that are so capable also make
[04:34] the best pet dog
[04:38] [Music]
[04:47] breed so then is the labrador the best
[04:49] pet dog breed and if they are then why
[04:53] now having that incredible experience
[04:55] and having time to really think about it
[04:58] it has conf confirmed to me that the
[05:00] labrador is the best pet dog breed but
[05:03] the reason why is different from what I
[05:06] initially thought because I now truly to
[05:09] my core believe that the labrador is the
[05:12] best breed by accident they work the
[05:15] designed or developed to be the best pet
[05:18] dog breed but they happened to become so
[05:21] because of what they were actually bread
[05:23] for now let me explain first of all they
[05:26] were bred to be able to work as part of
[05:28] a team of dog that means the dogs that
[05:30] were bred for and were selected in their
[05:32] working capacities had to be great with
[05:35] other dogs they didn't want dogs
[05:37] fighting they wanted dogs to be able to
[05:39] get on and be in close proximity to each
[05:41] other for us as pet dog owners that
[05:43] means Labradors tend to be amazing with
[05:47] other dogs they were bred and selected
[05:49] to have a soft mouth and as pet dog
[05:51] owners that's only ever going to be a
[05:53] good thing for us whilst out hunting
[05:56] they needed to be incredibly intelligent
[05:58] so it gave that was bred for working
[06:01] rolls but for us it's amazing cuz it
[06:03] makes training them an absolute Breeze
[06:06] Hunters wanted their Labradors to be
[06:08] what they call steady in the field that
[06:11] means they wanted a dog to be calm and
[06:13] quiet whilst they were out hunting
[06:15] different game birds again great for the
[06:18] hunter the reason that they were bred
[06:20] but for us it's wonderful it means that
[06:22] we get Labradors that can be calm can be
[06:25] relaxed which makes amazing pet dogs
[06:28] Labradors were selectively bred with
[06:30] examples that were desperate to please
[06:33] their owner have that innate desire to
[06:36] please their owner when people took them
[06:37] out hunting they were much more
[06:40] successful with them again a benefit to
[06:43] us as pet dog owners and pet dog
[06:45] trainers not only are they incredibly
[06:47] intelligent but they also have a high
[06:49] desire to please we put those things
[06:52] together and it's no surprised that
[06:53] they're one of the easiest dog breeds to
[06:56] train and one of the dog breeds that is
[06:58] easiest to train to an incredibly high
[07:00] level on and off the field but Labradors
[07:03] were also bred to be reliant on Handler
[07:07] instruction Hunters knew that yes their
[07:09] dogs needed to be incredibly intelligent
[07:12] they needed to have all those other
[07:13] amazing traits that we've just talked
[07:15] about but there are going to be times
[07:17] where they need to instruct their dogs
[07:19] on where to go how to go how to retrieve
[07:22] what to retrieve and for them to do that
[07:25] they need to be looking at the hunter
[07:26] they need to want to please the Hunter
[07:29] want to follow instructions from them as
[07:31] well again we bring that back to our
[07:34] purposes paired with that desire to look
[07:37] up to us for guidance and Direction it
[07:40] makes them one of the best pet dog
[07:42] breeds so is it then any surprise that a
[07:45] breed that was bred for all of those
[07:47] amazing traits that then accidentally
[07:50] means that they want to look up to us
[07:53] for guidance and Direction they want to
[07:55] please us they're incredibly intelligent
[07:57] they're bred to Be steady bred to be
[07:59] able to get on with other dogs they're
[08:01] bred to have amazing bite inhibition so
[08:04] that they very rarely turn out to have
[08:06] any aggressive tendences that we are
[08:08] left with not just one of the best
[08:11] working dogs in the world but one of the
[08:13] best pet dog breeds in the world so as
[08:17] always when in doubt get yourself a
[08:25] Labrador

[00:02] well for me this one is a simple one and
[00:04] not only do I think they're the easiest
[00:05] breed to train but they're also my
[00:07] favorite breed and also the breed that I

[00:13] and I'll also accept the golden

[00:00] what is the hardest dog breed that I've
[00:01] ever had to train and as a canine
[00:03] behaviorist I've had to work with
[00:05] thousands of different dogs of hundreds
[00:07] of different breeds with different
[00:09] owners so I've got a lot of experience
[00:11] in which breeds are easier to train and
[00:13] which ones are harder to train when it
[00:15] comes to the breeds that are hardest to
[00:17] train it's breeds that have been bred to
[00:19] work very independently you combine that
[00:22] with violent or guarding Tendencies and
[00:24] it often means that not necessarily
[00:25] they're even harder to train but the
[00:28] potential for things going wrong goes
[00:30] through the roof there's no secret that
[00:32] the livestock Guardian breeds for me fit
[00:34] that category perfectly like the
[00:36] Caucasian Shepherd or the Turkish candle
[00:38] however there's another breed that I
[00:40] always find challenging to train and
[00:42] having spoke to hundreds of different
[00:43] canine professionals share this opinion
[00:45] and that is the Siberian Husky it's why
[00:48] you will rarely if ever see practicing
[00:51] dog trainers or canine professionals
[00:53] actually owning them and my opinion is
[00:55] that they are more cats than they are
[00:57] dog

[00:00] what is the least scary dog breed now
[00:02] when people think of scary dog breeds
[00:04] oftentimes they go for bigger is scarier
[00:07] now Queen Eileen here is the biggest dog
[00:10] breed in the world the English Mastiff
[00:11] however I don't think she's particularly
[00:14] scary I think she's absolutely glorious
[00:16] and a big gentle teddy bear when it
[00:18] comes to a dog being scary I think it's
[00:22] about athleticism combined with power
[00:24] combined with intent athleticism intent
[00:28] she doesn't have any so for me that
[00:30] makes her a not very scary dog breed now
[00:33] when it comes to some of the smaller dog
[00:34] breeds athleticism and intent for
[00:36] violence things like the jack russell
[00:38] have in Spades they just might be
[00:40] missing out on a little bit of the power
[00:41] however a breed like the Cavalier King
[00:44] Charles Spaniel doesn't have much power
[00:46] doesn't have tons of athleticism has
[00:48] absolutely no intent and therefore might
[00:51] be the most unscary dog in the world or
[00:56] Queen Eileen here

[00:00] what are the scariest dog breeds in the
[00:02] world now for me this is quite an
[00:03] interesting question because I spend a
[00:05] lot of time working with guard dog
[00:06] breeds I also spend a lot of time
[00:08] helping owners that want a guard dog but
[00:11] might not be experienced enough to
[00:13] actually be able to raise and train them
[00:14] successfully but when you get chatting
[00:16] to those people you often find out that
[00:18] what they want is a really intimidating
[00:20] dog that would stop people from trying
[00:22] in the first place and there are a few
[00:24] breeds that aren't necessarily a serious
[00:27] and as hard to train as others yet do
[00:30] pack incredible levels of intimidation
[00:32] Factor now for me when it comes to
[00:34] scariness it's not just about sheer size
[00:36] but when you combine size with
[00:38] athleticism and if I had to choose one
[00:40] dog that does that the most and even
[00:42] gets my heartbeat racing a little bit
[00:44] faster when I see one would be a cropped
[00:46] and docked Doberman

[00:13] your hands and under your nails is just
[00:15] gross and even wearing gloves is just
[00:17] not ideal another frustrating thing
[00:19] about feeding your dog raw is just how
[00:21] much freezer room you're going to need
[00:22] and the bigger your dog the bigger the
[00:24] freezer you're gonna have to have and
[00:26] that's something that holds back so many

[00:04] many trainers are able to achieve far
[00:06] higher levels of obedience in certain
[00:09] sporting uh and competitive environments
[00:12] than I achieve with my dogs but I'm a
[00:14] pet dog trainer and I'm a pet dog owner
[00:18] myself I do a little bit of fun gun dog
[00:20] stuff with Uncle Sully but they're pets
[00:22] first and foremost and I like working
[00:23] with people that have pet first and
[00:25] foremost so yes I think you need to have
[00:27] a level of skill and experience but what
[00:30] really impresses me about other of
[00:32] trainers is when they have the skill in
[00:35] being able to pass that information on
[00:37] to owners that don't have the experience
[00:39] or knowledge that they do they're
[00:40] incredible Educators so the names that
[00:42] jump to my head when I think about who I
[00:44] think the best trainers are that I've
[00:46] had the privilege of of working with or
[00:48] watching work in person would be Ben

[00:07] interesting question of should you get

[00:13] absolutely should support rescuing
[00:15] breeds of all shapes and sizes and mixed
[00:17] breeds have a lot of benefits but we
[00:18] can't ignore the fact that there are
[00:20] some potential concerns we have to be
[00:22] aware about now for me as a behaviorist
[00:24] I utilize breed Evolution and breed
[00:26] genetic standards temperament and
[00:29] characters to form a lot of the training
[00:31] I do and one of the things about having
[00:33] mixed breed dogs especially where you
[00:35] aren't sure what their breed is you do
[00:38] end up doing a lot of guess work which
[00:40] can make training and raising them more
[00:43] difficult than if you're absolutely
[00:45] certain of their background and history
[00:47] but that definitely doesn't mean you
[00:49] shouldn't get one that was just a bit of

[00:00] why do I think a tired dog is a good dog
[00:02] now this is one of those topics that is
[00:04] hotly debated and I completely
[00:06] understand the other point of view that
[00:08] if you exercise your dog loads you may
[00:10] just create an incredibly fit dog that
[00:13] still has the behavior problems that
[00:15] might get worse because it's now a super
[00:17] athletic problem Behavior fied dog
[00:19] however I do truly believe that a lot of
[00:21] problem behaviors stem from a dog's
[00:22] anxiety and that anxiety can be really
[00:24] well managed by putting the dog into
[00:26] motion the best way to do this for me is
[00:29] going on a nice long Loos lead heel walk
[00:32] with your dog you are going to burn off
[00:33] some of that energy but you're also
[00:35] going to build incredible leadership
[00:37] skills relationship skills and
[00:38] communication skills with your dog which
[00:40] one of those things is responsible for
[00:42] the problem behavior is something that
[00:43] we'll probably never truly know but it's
[00:46] definitely worth doing it because I do
[00:48] know that it absolutely helps

[00:00] why do you hate Siberian Huskies so much
[00:02] now again that is an interesting
[00:05] question and the honest answer is that I
[00:08] actually used to have a Siberian Husky
[00:10] she was one of the first dogs that I
[00:11] rescued from being put down I did a full
[00:13] rehabilitation program and we were going
[00:15] to rehome her and my parents fell in
[00:17] love with her so she ended up living
[00:18] with my parents for 12 years and
[00:21] actually passed away last year and in
[00:23] that time since becoming a k9
[00:25] behaviorist professionally I have worked
[00:27] with countless huskies and I have a lot
[00:29] of experience with them and it isn't
[00:31] that I hate them there isn't a breed on
[00:32] the planet that I hate I just think that
[00:34] certain breeds have certain requirements
[00:37] and meet certain Lifestyles better than
[00:39] others and Siberian Huskies don't like
[00:42] to look up to people for guidance and
[00:44] Direction they're very independent and I
[00:46] can find that they're often aloof and
[00:49] drama queens and when my system is built
[00:52] on the relationship in which you all the
[00:54] dogs loving leader and they look up to
[00:55] you for guidance and direction that just
[00:57] doesn't mesh very well with me

[00:00] one of the most important things you can
[00:01] do to have a perfectly behaved dog is to
[00:04] crate train them crate training is one
[00:07] of my mandatory pieces of the puzzle of
[00:09] having a perfect Canine Companion if
[00:11] you're struggling with a problem
[00:12] behavior in the home it's probably a
[00:15] destructive Behavior potty training
[00:17] incident separation anxiety all of which
[00:20] can absolutely be solved with proper
[00:23] crate training and best of all crate
[00:25] training is not cruel whatsoever when
[00:27] you do it properly dogs are Denning
[00:29] Animals by nature and we can very easily
[00:32] help them understand that their crate is
[00:34] their safe Den for them to take
[00:36] themselves away relax calm down
[00:38] decompress and when done right you will
[00:40] find it is your dog's favorite place
[00:42] just like it is with all of mine
[00:44] including uncle

[00:00] this is why I hate Mastiff breeds and
[00:02] the truth is that was just clickbait I
[00:04] don't I absolutely love them however it
[00:06] doesn't mean that they are perfect
[00:08] because they certainly aren't here at my
[00:11] Center we get many Mastiff breeds come
[00:12] through with a whole host of problem
[00:14] behaviors all stemming down to the fact
[00:17] that the owners that bought them didn't
[00:19] have the skill knowledge and experience
[00:22] to be able to raise and train them
[00:23] effectively from a place of loving
[00:25] leadership so if you are going to
[00:27] consider a glorious mastiff breed like
[00:29] this it is not going to be easy it is a
[00:32] challenge it is difficult and it is
[00:34] going to consume a lot of your life
[00:36] however if you do provide those things

[00:00] why I hate about the Rottweiler more
[00:01] than anything as a k9 behaviorist and
[00:04] that for me is simple it's people
[00:06] getting these glorious breeds that don't
[00:08] have the skill experience or assertive
[00:11] confidence required to train them keep
[00:13] them under control and let them Thrive
[00:15] as the dogs that they should be they are
[00:17] very independent confident dogs that are
[00:20] prone to aggression if required and if
[00:23] you don't know how to handle that how to
[00:25] harness that and how to turn that into
[00:27] positivity you will have a disaster on

[00:00] this is why I don't like mixed breed
[00:02] dogs like this Romanian Street dog
[00:03] that's here with me at my center for a
[00:05] day of training now to be fair that was
[00:07] clickbait cuz I absolutely love these
[00:09] breeds but it doesn't mean that they're
[00:11] perfect there are a lot of amazing
[00:13] benefits about mixed breed dogs but
[00:15] there are some concerns that you might
[00:17] want to factor in for me the main one is
[00:19] whenever a dog is coming into my Center
[00:21] I want to know as much about its history
[00:23] as possible I want to know what the
[00:25] breed is what the Bloodlines are and who
[00:27] the breeder is cuz that usually gives me
[00:29] a really good understanding of the
[00:32] general expectations I'm going to be
[00:34] facing in that type of training with
[00:35] mixed breeds especially rescue ones like
[00:38] these Street dogs from Romania or
[00:40] Albania or many of the other countries
[00:42] that that's happening very frequently
[00:44] from you are often just guessing waiting
[00:47] and see and sometimes that means things
[00:49] just take a lot longer

[00:00] this is why you shouldn't get a boxador
[00:02] now a boxador is a mix between a boxer
[00:04] and a labrador both are breeds that I
[00:07] absolutely love so does it make sense to
[00:09] put both of them together well it
[00:12] depends if you want the Best of Both
[00:14] Worlds then they are absolutely
[00:16] incredible however if you are looking
[00:18] for a stoic hyper reliable incredibly
[00:22] focused Labrador type breed by putting
[00:25] the boxer in you may be running the risk
[00:27] of removing from that a little bit with
[00:30] the simple love for life and fun that
[00:32] comes with the boxador so if you want
[00:34] full-fledged serious working line dog
[00:37] then maybe stick with the labrador if
[00:39] you want some of those great features
[00:41] and want to put a little bit of fun in

[00:00] so why do I never use clicker training
[00:02] now clicker training for me is an
[00:04] interesting one it's become its whole
[00:05] style of training but in terms of actual
[00:08] training methodologies clickers are
[00:11] simply markers to let your dog know that
[00:13] they've displayed a desirable Behavior I
[00:16] use markers all of the time the problem
[00:18] with clickers for me is that I forget
[00:21] them and I don't ever want to rely on
[00:23] something that I might forget and
[00:25] because a marker can be nothing more
[00:27] than a yes can achieve exactly the same
[00:30] thing as a clicker when delivered with
[00:33] good timing consistently so how do you
[00:35] charge a marker it's the same way that
[00:38] you might charge a clicker to let the
[00:40] dog know that that means a reward is
[00:42] incoming the way that that would look
[00:44] like would be something like yes dozens
[00:47] into hundreds of reps charge that word
[00:50] yes to mean that food is uncoming the
[00:53] beautiful thing about yes is that I
[00:55] always have it and I'm not going to

[00:20] with their aptitude for Learning and
[00:22] resilience to training which makes them
[00:24] fun to work with and usually able to
[00:26] achieve high levels of success

[00:31] sit down Place stay then I know he's
[00:34] going to do it and not let me down

[00:17] pass away at just four months old and
[00:20] she had a congenital heart defect now
[00:23] E's passed away such a young age from
[00:25] what the Vets think was a very

[00:33] that is riddled with the health problems

[00:23] and having readible high energy outputs
[00:25] people with especially young families
[00:27] are very rarely able to provide the
[00:29] exercise that is required and in a

[00:34] running around it triggers that hering

[00:38] of people that having issues with their
[00:40] Coles of their dogs hurting their

[00:01] that lead busy active Lifestyles well
[00:04] this for me is going to be a dog breed
[00:05] that thrives with Handler engagement
[00:07] wants to be with their people all the
[00:09] time we often call these velcro dogs
[00:11] have incredibly high energy levels need
[00:13] lots of exercise and love to work that
[00:16] is a recipe for disaster for people that
[00:18] lead busy Lifestyles I most commonly see
[00:20] people make this mistake with the Border
[00:22] Collie they think because it's so
[00:24] intelligent and easy to train that it
[00:26] might be a good fit where actually they
[00:27] will quickly ruin your life exactly the
[00:30] same thing can be said for a working
[00:31] line German Shepherds or Belgian
[00:33] malamars ludicrously high levels of
[00:35] potential but you better be willing
[00:37] ready and able to put the time in to get
[00:39] them there and then also work inline
[00:41] Labradors it's no secret I think they're
[00:43] some of the best dog breeds in the world
[00:44] but if you lead a busy lifestyle go for
[00:46] a lower energy show line Labrador rather
[00:49] than High Drive working lines

[00:00] as a canine behaviorist what do I think
[00:01] the worst dog breed for families are now
[00:04] unfortunately I've worked with many dogs
[00:06] that have attacked children and caused
[00:08] significant damage unfortunately I've
[00:09] also seen many dogs be euthanized
[00:11] because of this exact problem a lot of
[00:13] it could have been prevented if the
[00:15] owners the parents had chosen a more
[00:17] suitable breed for families in the first
[00:19] place and when we're looking for that I
[00:20] think it's important to choose a dog
[00:22] that's naturally gentle towards children
[00:24] lower on the energy scales and doesn't
[00:26] have a sky-high prey drive which is
[00:28] often what children kick in with dogs
[00:31] that then create these issues in the
[00:32] first place so the ones that I think may
[00:34] be worse for this the Border Collie I
[00:37] see problems with children all the time
[00:38] they want to hurt they want to chase
[00:40] they want to nip Belgian Malinois can
[00:42] often have similar issues again they
[00:44] like to bite they like to herd they like
[00:46] to put things in their mouth and when
[00:48] small children are running around they
[00:49] can hardly contain themselves and last
[00:52] but not least I'm going to have to throw
[00:53] in the XL American Bully because just
[00:56] look at the news the data speaks for
[00:58] itself

[00:00] so what is the worst dog breed for
[00:02] first-time owners breeds are going to be
[00:03] terrible for first-time owners they're
[00:05] going to be ones that have extreme
[00:06] violence in their breed histories breeds
[00:09] that were bred for fighting breeds that
[00:11] were bred for hunting breeds that were
[00:13] bred for genuinely not just scaring off
[00:16] humans but causing them serious harm
[00:19] they're going to be very confident
[00:20] they're going to be very independent and
[00:21] they are going to be prone to Violent
[00:23] behaviors those are going to be breeds
[00:25] like the American Pit Bull Terrier
[00:26] unfortunately I love the breed but that
[00:28] is a reality the tocerinu the Dogo
[00:31] Argentino the Presa Canario the
[00:33] livestock Guardian Breeze like the
[00:35] Caucasian Shepherd the Turkish Kangal
[00:37] all need absolute expert levels of
[00:40] experience handling skill and assertive
[00:44] confident leadership to keep them under
[00:46] control and safe canine companions and
[00:49] you can very much have a dog like mine
[00:52] puppy here but in the hands of a
[00:54] first-time owner she could be an
[00:56] absolute disaster

[00:00] I've just been asked on Instagram what
[00:01] is the worst dog breed for firsttime
[00:03] owners now I'm here in Vegas as part of
[00:05] my International Dog Rescue and Behavior
[00:07] tour and we've been helping lots of
[00:08] firsttime owners that have rescued and
[00:10] adopted dogs it's been an amazing
[00:12] experience but I definitely do see a
[00:14] trend of people with amazing intentions
[00:16] that are rescuing dogs which is
[00:17] absolutely awesome forgetting that even
[00:20] with rescue dogs breeds absolutely do
[00:23] matter and it is a difficult one because
[00:24] I absolutely love people that are
[00:26] willing to rescue dogs but it is
[00:28] counterproductive if you rescue a dog
[00:30] that you're not capable of being able to
[00:32] manage cuz you haven't built up that
[00:34] experience and skill yet then either
[00:35] you're really struggling with your dog
[00:37] or the dog has to go back to the rescue
[00:39] and go through that cycle again and I
[00:40] see this time and time again with the
[00:42] guardian breeds and with the booming
[00:44] popularity of working live Shepherds and
[00:46] working my malamir lots of them are
[00:48] ending up in rescue centers amazing
[00:50] people want to help rescue them but
[00:52] they're finding themselves way over
[00:54] their head in managing such a serious
[00:55] breed

[00:00] what is the worst dog breed for busy
[00:02] people as a canine behaviorist I see
[00:04] lots of problem behaviors stem from
[00:06] bored dogs because the owner doesn't
[00:08] have time to fulfill their needs first
[00:10] up is the Hungarian visler a really fun
[00:13] obscure alternative to a working line
[00:15] Labrador which is a common reason that
[00:17] many people get them however they are
[00:19] equally if not more intense than a
[00:21] working line Labrador they need tons of
[00:23] exercise and tons of attention from
[00:25] their owner to truly Thrive and be happy
[00:27] the Doberman is another breed that I see
[00:29] people make this mistake with over and
[00:31] over again not only do they need lots of
[00:33] training do they need lots of exercise
[00:35] but they are also a kind of breed that
[00:37] needs lots of time with their owners or
[00:40] they will suffer from separation anxiety
[00:42] and this breed is a breed that I see
[00:44] people make this mistake with most often
[00:47] every single day I have people in
[00:49] desperate need of my help because
[00:50] they've brought this breed and we're not
[00:53] ready to give it the time it needs and

[00:00] what is the worst dog breed if you have
[00:02] a young family and this absolutely
[00:04] should be something that you should take
[00:05] incredibly seriously as a canine
[00:07] behaviorist I have had the unfortunate
[00:09] pleasure of working with lots of dogs
[00:12] that come from young families that have
[00:15] bitten attacked or done some kind of
[00:17] damage to young children and it is an
[00:19] absolute travesty and is usually a
[00:22] one-track path towards rescue centers
[00:24] and euthanasia now this can be avoided
[00:27] with lots of training for all breeds
[00:29] however certain breeds are definitely
[00:30] going to fit the bill better and for me
[00:32] I always recommend breeds that have low
[00:34] prey drive and low hunting drive and low
[00:37] herding drive so breeds like the Border
[00:39] Collie might be quite gentle trainable
[00:41] dog but that herding Drive gets them in
[00:43] trouble with children all the time and
[00:45] it doesn't take a genius to work out how
[00:47] dogs that were bred for fighting or
[00:48] serious guarding capabilities could go
[00:51] easily wrong with children so for me as
[00:54] always when in doubt get a Labrador and
[00:56] thank me later

[00:05] Bulldog that stereotype of them being
[00:07] lazy snory dogs yeah it's pretty much
[00:10] true they've got a bit of tenacity
[00:12] they'll go for a walk around the block
[00:13] but they're not coming with you for
[00:15] serious hikes next up is the
[00:16] Newfoundland yes the Newfoundland has
[00:19] working lineages in its history yes
[00:21] they're amazing swimmers and will work
[00:23] all day swimming but that is stop and
[00:26] start with lots of rests in between a
[00:28] nice slow and steady pace for them and
[00:30] in more recent years they're not in
[00:32] working roles anymore so they're bred
[00:34] for looks and temperament much more than
[00:36] working then we have to talk about the
[00:38] Basset Hound one of the coolest looking
[00:40] dogs in the planet yes they have a great
[00:42] nose yes they can be worked in some
[00:44] capacities but they'd much rather be at

[00:17] they're so trainable it means that
[00:18] they're easy dogs to live with but that
[00:20] couldn't be further from the truth those
[00:22] herding instincts will kick in and if
[00:24] you don't fulfill the dog properly which
[00:25] many people don't have the time or
[00:27] energy to do so they will start hurting
[00:30] your kids and by hurting your kids I
[00:32] mean chasing them around biting their
[00:33] ankles next up is the Akita I love
[00:36] Akitas and in the right situations they
[00:38] can be incredible dogs but time and time
[00:40] again I see them having serious issues
[00:42] with children and it's never pretty when
[00:44] it happens and last up the dalmatian

[00:08] they're independent they're dramatic and

[00:17] next up is anything a poo now don't get
[00:20] me wrong they can be great versions of
[00:22] these dogs but with over breeding
[00:24] there's lots of neurological problems
[00:26] setting in and frankly these are the

[00:30] people making the mistake of
[00:32] anthropomorphizing them treating them
[00:34] like babies which creates a whole host
[00:36] of problem behaviors that I then need to
[00:38] unpick and address and last up is the
[00:40] Caucasian Shepherd a truly terrifying
[00:42] dog that when it goes wrong it goes

[00:34] reinforcing separation anxiety when you
[00:36] leave and when you return and leave your
[00:38] dog alone go and come back quietly and
[00:41] calmly stop getting your dog so hyped up

[00:26] that are least suited to first-time
[00:27] owners and not just the ones that are
[00:29] prone to severe violence but also are
[00:32] prone to work on their own which means

[00:09] the first thing you have to be careful

[00:15] so we have to make sure that we are not
[00:17] feeding her anytime before we might be

[00:10] always start off with an assessment
[00:12] watching the dog pulling and in
[00:14] particular this dog was a nightmare
[00:15] around livestock it was clear to me that
[00:18] there was absolutely no engagement
[00:19] between the dog and the Handler so
[00:21] that's exactly where we had to start we
[00:23] choose the right piece of equipment and
[00:25] we tune the dog up so that they
[00:26] understand they have to follow our
[00:28] guidance and Direction and look up to us
[00:30] for our loving leadership oftentimes you
[00:32] can see the weight of the world come off

[00:35] realize that there's somebody in their
[00:37] life stepping up and taking control and

[00:41] dog within just the first session of the

[00:45] and the rest of the day we spent out on
[00:48] walks around different types of
[00:49] distractions and environment to proof
[00:51] the behavior and make sure that the

[00:00] what are the worst mistakes that people
[00:01] make when they take their puppy out for
[00:03] the first time the biggest mistake
[00:05] especially first time owners make is
[00:07] they panic and they make it something
[00:09] that it doesn't need to be they're so
[00:10] desperate for it to go right that their
[00:12] adrenaline's really high they're nervous
[00:14] but the problem is that nervous high
[00:16] energy is being passed down to the puppy
[00:18] and if you're concerned the puppy's
[00:20] going to be concerned and then you're
[00:21] creating negative associations to being
[00:23] outside which is what can cause the
[00:25] puppy to be fearful of being in public
[00:27] in the first place then in a similar
[00:29] vein to that a lot of people expect too
[00:31] much of their puppies yes your training
[00:33] might be going beautifully indoors but
[00:35] as soon as you add in the incredibly
[00:36] High distraction of being out in public
[00:38] don't expect it to go as well have
[00:40] realistic expectations of your puppy and
[00:42] you'll be setting them up for success
[00:44] rather than setting them up to fail
[00:45] before the final point we have to talk
[00:47] about you not vaccinating your dog make
[00:49] sure that their vaccinations are where
[00:51] they're meant to be before you take them
[00:53] out into public for the first time

[00:00] what are the worst things about the
[00:02] Beagle as a canine behaviorist I see
[00:04] when dogs go really wrong therefore I
[00:07] see the bad side of all the different
[00:09] breeds I get to work with when it comes
[00:11] to the Beagle the first really
[00:12] frustrating thing is how difficult it is
[00:14] to teach them recall being such
[00:16] scent-driven hunting dogs teaching
[00:18] recall can be a nightmare which means
[00:20] they're often going to let you down if
[00:21] you ever make the mistake of letting
[00:23] them off lead in high distraction
[00:25] environments the next thing is that
[00:27] they're serious howlers they vocalize
[00:29] all the time at hours you wish they
[00:32] wouldn't they're incredibly loud which
[00:33] means that you might be hated by the
[00:35] vast majority of your neighbors and
[00:37] especially why they're young beagles
[00:39] tend to have a good off switch being
[00:41] hunting dogs they want to work work work
[00:44] they have high energy drive and they are
[00:46] capable of going all day every day so
[00:49] don't be surprised if you're trying to
[00:51] take them for one lap around the block
[00:52] every day isn't giving them the exercise
[00:54] they need which creates that howling
[00:56] problem we just mentioned much worse

[00:02] mastiff now I used to own a bullmastiff
[00:04] my bullmastiff Roxy was the joy of our
[00:06] family's life but I know some of the
[00:08] great things about them and some of the
[00:09] bad things about them and for me the
[00:11] worst thing about the bullmastiff is a
[00:13] weird one because it's also one of the
[00:15] best things and that's their incredibly
[00:17] protective nature they are wary of
[00:20] strangers and wary of anybody coming
[00:22] into your home so if you don't have the
[00:23] skill set to be able to manage that
[00:25] safely the ball Mastiff can go from a

[00:08] example of why Dobermans can be amazing
[00:11] breeds but just like all breeds they
[00:13] have their pros and cons like all breeds
[00:17] that are bred to be confident Guardian
[00:19] Protection breeds like the Doberman the
[00:21] thing that makes that most difficult is
[00:23] that they need experienced skill
[00:25] handlers to be able to raise and manage
[00:28] them this dopamine is just lacking on a
[00:30] few missing pieces of leadership that
[00:32] we're going to instill today with a dog
[00:35] this athletic of this size this
[00:37] capability small mistakes can end up in
[00:41] big issues so if you're going to get a
[00:43] doberman make sure that you are skilled

[00:14] the first thing is their hair they have

[00:18] get there for absolutely everywhere
[00:21] their fur also gets covered in mud and
[00:23] gets wet and is then really difficult to

[00:27] retrievers also absolutely love to roll
[00:29] in things and by Rolling In things I
[00:31] mean the things that come out of the
[00:33] back end of other animals which makes

[00:38] retrievers are sometimes just too happy
[00:40] and that happy excited joyous energy
[00:43] over spills into pulling and jumping up

[00:17] I don't have a golden retriever even
[00:19] though I think they might be the best
[00:20] breed on the planet and that is because

[00:08] create the terrible behaviors that you
[00:10] then need people like myself to help fix
[00:11] the first is not leading your dog dogs
[00:14] crave leadership they need to understand

[00:19] what it is that we don't want from them
[00:20] if we don't provide them that leadership
[00:23] they become confused frustrated and
[00:25] anxious which is the recipe for disaster
[00:27] and creates the vast majority of problem
[00:29] behaviors the next thing is people
[00:31] loving on their dogs too much don't get
[00:33] me wrong I love dogs more than anybody
[00:35] on the planet but to show love to dogs
[00:37] they want to be led not be loved on so
[00:41] if you truly love your dog lead your dog
[00:43] next up is not teaching your dog to walk
[00:45] on a nice loose lead by your side if you
[00:48] teach your dog that it's okay to pull
[00:50] and provide tension on the lead you are

[00:00] why is the easiest dog breed to take
[00:01] anywhere with you now most people their
[00:04] brain automatically goes to a small dog
[00:07] for this role but for me there's so much
[00:09] more to it you want to make sure that
[00:11] you have a very sociable dog that is
[00:13] enjoys being around lots of different
[00:15] places and lots of different people you
[00:17] want to make sure that you have a

[00:21] lots of different people and lots of
[00:23] different situations and won't be prone
[00:25] to becoming fearful anxious or stressed
[00:27] and then yes size does come into it as
[00:31] much as a breed like a Newfoundland or
[00:34] an English Mastiff might fit those first
[00:35] two things very well getting them in and
[00:38] out of cars getting them into certain
[00:40] spots in the pub where you want to just
[00:42] curl them up under the table is
[00:44] definitely not going to be as easy on
[00:45] the medium size the breeds like the
[00:47] labrador is an absolute no-brainer but
[00:49] if you want a dog that really can go
[00:51] everywhere because of the small package
[00:53] and that they're confident and that
[00:55] they're sociable for me I love breeds

[00:27] it could be you finish go and do what
[00:28] you want to do if you don't provide that
[00:31] for your dog they'll start making those
[00:33] decisions for themselves and if they
[00:34] make those decisions for themselves in a
[00:36] formal situation like this they'll make
[00:39] them in real world situations when
[00:41] you're out and about and that is a
[00:42] slippery slope to a dog that just
[00:44] ignores you because they pick and choose
[00:46] when they have to listen and when they
[00:48] don't it's always break
[00:50] break command make sure it's in Your
[00:52] Arsenal

[00:00] let me explain to you one of the most
[00:01] important principles in all of dog
[00:03] training and it might sound like a fancy
[00:05] word but stay with me we refer to it as
[00:07] impulse control what that simply means
[00:09] is your dog's ability to control
[00:12] themselves they might want to go and do
[00:15] that thing but if you've asked them not
[00:17] to they won't they see a squirrel on the
[00:19] other side of the road that they really
[00:20] want to chase that might get them run
[00:22] over you ask them not to and they don't
[00:25] when it comes to teaching impulse
[00:26] control it's way better to do it fun Pro
[00:30] actively rather than reactively that
[00:32] sometimes has to use methods that we
[00:34] might not want to have to use one of the
[00:36] best ways that you can do that is
[00:38] wrapping it up in a game of fetch but
[00:40] start to formalize it rather than
[00:42] letting your dog run after the tennis
[00:44] ball you can throw it have them wait
[00:47] fight those impulse controls before they
[00:49] can then go and do it we can make this
[00:51] really fun we can turn it into a game
[00:54] that then means that impulse control can
[00:56] be utilized in all other aspects of
[00:58] their life

[00:00] what are the three things you need to be
[00:01] doing with your puppy first of all you
[00:04] need to be working on obedience which is
[00:05] exactly what we're doing with this
[00:07] glorious spanel here second of all you
[00:09] need to be working on manets yes it's
[00:11] really fun to be able to have a dog
[00:13] whipping around this fast but at some
[00:15] point we need to have them relax and be
[00:17] able to be calm well mattered nice
[00:19] puppies to be able to take out with you
[00:22] anywhere but that's not the point of
[00:23] this training session right now so let's
[00:25] get the energy back up and the third
[00:28] thing is socialization you need to make
[00:30] sure that your dog is desensitized to
[00:32] all different sight smells peoples
[00:34] sounds so that they can remain calm with
[00:37] the manners and under control with your
[00:38] obedience and you will have the perfect
[00:40] Ki companion that you've always dreamed

[00:00] this is why you should get this
[00:01] incredibly rare breed the Alaskan cleart
[00:03] now the reality is the vast majority of
[00:05] people get breeds like this or Huskies
[00:08] or Malamutes because of the way that
[00:10] they look and they are woefully prepared
[00:12] for what that life will then entail and
[00:14] they have huge problems is why I'm not a
[00:17] huge fan of spits type breeds because
[00:19] most people especially in countries like
[00:21] here in the UK or over in America rarely
[00:23] actually need a breed like that however
[00:26] if you love the Siberian Husky and
[00:28] genuinely think they may be perfect fit
[00:30] for you your family and your lifestyle
[00:32] however they're slightly big for you
[00:35] then the Alaskan CLE ey could be a
[00:36] perfect solution

[00:00] what are the three things that you
[00:01] should be doing with your dog every
[00:03] single day well for me number one starts
[00:05] with this you must take your dog for a
[00:08] loose lead walk every single day number
[00:11] two is my barrier to entry drill and
[00:14] that barrier to entry drill is simple
[00:16] anytime my dog wants something from me
[00:18] they must sit wait patiently looking up
[00:21] to me for guidance and Direction when
[00:23] they do that they can have access to
[00:25] everything that they want and the third
[00:27] thing is working on your dog's impulse
[00:29] control impulse control is incredibly
[00:31] important and you can work on it in many
[00:34] different ways Sully sit
[00:36] for Sully here I want him to understand
[00:39] that even though there's stuff going on
[00:41] around him he has to control his
[00:43] impulses but it's his job to control
[00:46] that impulse and wait for my guidance
[00:48] and Direction the more you work on this
[00:50] the better it gets the better this gets
[00:52] the more reliable your obedience is the
[00:54] more reliable your obedience is the
[00:55] better behaved your dog is going to be

[00:00] I had this young German Shepherd come
[00:01] into my incenter for an intensive day
[00:03] because despite how young it was it was
[00:05] already developing incredibly bad
[00:07] pulling and reactivity on the lead and
[00:09] we had to get on top of it before it got
[00:11] any worse now when it comes to younger
[00:13] dogs I always adapt to my system and
[00:16] we're a bit more patient and feather in
[00:18] any kind of lead pressure or challenging
[00:20] of behaviors and we had to start by
[00:23] changing the equipment and starting
[00:25] afresh doing so allowed me to teach this
[00:27] new language to the German Shepherd that
[00:29] allowed me to say hey buddy don't do
[00:32] that but I want you to do this instead
[00:34] while simultaneously making sure that
[00:36] this adorable German Shepherd puppy knew
[00:39] where the line was and that line is
[00:41] always I am your loving leader and you
[00:43] must follow my guidance and Direction

[00:00] did you know that your dog can

[00:04] sense of smell is around 100
[00:07] 000 times better than our own so they
[00:10] can absolutely smell the different
[00:11] things that go on with us biologically
[00:13] when we are happy when we are scared
[00:15] when we are anxious or fearful and your

TRANSCRIPTION:

[00:00] let me make this next tip abundantly
[00:02] clear
[00:03] stop thinking that your dog has to like
[00:07] all other dogs you don't like all other
[00:10] people your dog shouldn't like all other
[00:13] dogs your dog doesn't have to like any
[00:16] dogs now what they do need to be is
[00:18] neutral around them and display the
[00:20] behaviors that we need from them to keep
[00:22] them and other people safe but stop
[00:24] forcing dogs that don't like other dogs
[00:27] into situations where they have to make
[00:29] bad decisions dog parks are the worst
[00:33] thing for this and it's why I think
[00:34] nobody should ever go to dog parks if
[00:37] you do have a very sociable dog find
[00:40] structured places where you can meet
[00:43] other well sociable dogs but if your dog
[00:46] isn't that way that's fine as well honor
[00:49] your dog understand your dog and set
[00:52] your dog up for success

[00:00] welcome to episode 2 of the dog training
[00:02] experience we have just gotten home here
[00:04] in New Orleans with my brand new puppy
[00:06] inertia I'm Zach George I trained dogs
[00:09] and this is my new dog inertia I'm
[00:12] taking you along as I train her from day
[00:14] one you can start from the beginning or
[00:16] pick up anywhere and start learning
[00:18] welcome so the dog training experience
[00:21] it's pretty late right now she does need
[00:23] to go to bed but she's also been
[00:25] sleeping most of the day so I've got two
[00:27] things to do immediately I need to get
[00:28] her bedroom set up and I've got to get
[00:31] her exercise paint almost immediately I
[00:34] want to acclimate her to her outside
[00:36] place to go potty but we'll cover her
[00:38] indoor option in a sec this is her first
[00:41] time seeing our backyard here yes hey
[00:46] you want to play you want to play you
[00:48] know I can't resist a puppy who wants to
[00:50] play so let's play then boy nothing like
[00:52] fetch at 10 o'clock at night ok let's go
[00:56] back inside I'm gonna give you a tour of
[00:58] my plan for tonight now everything
[01:00] doesn't always go according to plan but
[01:02] I'm hoping this is gonna be ok I'm
[01:04] actually gonna get in here
[01:05] I'm hoping this is high enough if not
[01:07] I've warded a higher one because she
[01:08] might be able to jump up and climb I'm
[01:10] not sure yet we'll just have to see
[01:11] about that so I've got a crate here with
[01:13] a divider panel and I like oversized
[01:15] crates but the divider panel stops about
[01:17] here and since it's her first night at
[01:19] this house I want to make sure that she
[01:21] has plenty of room where she can come
[01:23] out here and go pee because remember I
[01:24] want her to be pad trained in addition
[01:27] to being trained to go potty outside
[01:28] sometimes there's bad weather or any
[01:30] other reason that I can't think of where
[01:32] I might want her to have the option to
[01:33] go inside I'm gonna go ahead and set her
[01:35] down right now I'm gonna take her off
[01:37] leash notice I'm not letting her off
[01:39] leash in the house at all yet and since
[01:41] she's 8 weeks old I'm probably gonna put
[01:43] this and a few other chew toys in there
[01:45] the hope is she'll just crash here in
[01:46] the middle of the night she can get up
[01:48] and go on our wizz smart pad because
[01:50] instinctively dogs don't like to relieve
[01:52] themselves in their direct sleeping area
[01:54] these were really helpful at her first
[01:55] night at the hotel last night with smart
[01:57] pads for the best pee and potty pads
[01:59] that I know of I like that they're
[02:00] shockingly absorbent that allows them to
[02:03] dry almost instantly so your dogs not
[02:05] tracking their pee everywhere you can
[02:06] see how thick they are relative to
[02:08] traditional body bags I'm gonna have a
[02:10] link below where you can get these with
[02:12] smart pads now
[02:13] always going to have such a large number
[02:15] of pads out here eventually I'm going to
[02:17] relocate the pads to another part of the
[02:18] house and have maybe four down as she
[02:21] starts to get the hang of potty training
[02:22] I'm gonna give her some food in her
[02:24] crate nothing can get a dog comfortable
[02:25] quite like food alright it's time to get
[02:27] ready for bed it is a nurses first night
[02:30] at my house you'll recall from my last
[02:32] episode it ended up with inertia and me
[02:35] cuddling on the floor in the motel so
[02:37] I've decided to sleep down here with her
[02:39] just to make sure she's comfortable so
[02:40] we have a blow-up mattress and I'm gonna
[02:42] turn it on but I know it can make a loud
[02:43] sound I don't know how she's likely to
[02:45] react to that so let's see what she does
[02:46] I'm gonna turn it on kind of quietly
[02:48] here right there you see your react so
[02:52] that's good being extra sensitive to
[02:53] things that might cause an unpleasant
[02:56] reaction from your dog is recommended
[02:58] things like motorized sounds or other
[02:59] sounds can be off-putting to some dogs
[03:01] yes you're doing great by the way if
[03:04] you're wondering what kind of treats I'm
[03:06] using I'm using a whole combination of
[03:07] different trees just to mix it up
[03:09] experiment and see what she likes
[03:13] yes good job and since everything's
[03:16] going pretty normal here I'm gonna let
[03:17] it continue to go normally I might go a
[03:19] bit slower than this but I'm really
[03:20] tired night 2 in the puppy who wouldn't
[03:23] be right what is that she took notice of
[03:26] the fact that this has inflated before
[03:28] her eyes okay it looks like she's over
[03:31] it now that my sleeping accommodations
[03:32] are complete it's time to let our
[03:34] sometimes reactive senior dog indi
[03:37] outside this will actually be the first
[03:39] time in d season or show we're not
[03:41] prepared to introduce them just yet and
[03:43] we're just gonna have a walk pass to go
[03:45] outside what is that Indy's like hey you
[03:47] got treats I'll listen to you and
[03:49] inertia was like there's a surprise you
[03:52] guys will meet later update its later I
[03:55] don't know how much later but I've
[03:56] modified the pen here to be a bit
[03:58] smaller the reason I modified it is
[04:00] because she was getting a little too
[04:02] active and I've also increased the
[04:04] number of two toys for her so I think
[04:06] she's gonna be content we'll see okay
[04:08] night two went way better than night one
[04:10] at the hotel you can see Episode one to
[04:12] see how we handled her waking up in the
[04:14] middle of the night good morning you
[04:19] want to go outside hello
[04:21] Oh wrong nurse's slept really well last
[04:22] night she whined a little bit but
[04:24] promptly went back to sleep I see that
[04:25] she used her pee pads this is why I want
[04:28] to have pads available just so when she
[04:30] does have to go if I'm unconscious she
[04:32] has a place to go that isn't our normal
[04:33] marble floor now I want to take her
[04:35] outside so that she can also experience
[04:38] going outside okay so far so good on
[04:40] potty training now it's time to give her
[04:41] a puppy workouts gonna work on some
[04:44] morning fetch with her I'm sure that may
[04:45] evolve into her routine we've done a
[04:47] little bit outside but it's a little
[04:49] warm
[04:49] I put inertia up we just had a little
[04:51] play session and I can't believe how
[04:54] well inertia is doing it's like she
[04:56] never acts up at all
[04:57] she's having a bit of a puppy anxiety
[05:00] attack here so I'm gonna let this play
[05:01] out for probably a few minutes on my own
[05:04] time I won't make you guys sit through
[05:05] it but the reason I'm sharing this with
[05:07] you is to show you how normal this stuff
[05:09] really is puppies are going to get
[05:11] anxious when you leave them alone
[05:11] sometimes but I've got to make my lunch
[05:13] and I want to make sure she's in a safe
[05:15] controlled environment I find it helpful
[05:18] in situations like this to set a timer
[05:20] because it can be maddening if
[05:22] not used to it it can be very
[05:23] frustrating when your dog is throwing a
[05:25] bit like that he's here he's set a timer
[05:27] for five minutes within five minutes
[05:29] she's probably gonna settle down that's
[05:31] kind of in her pattern with your dog
[05:32] maybe it's ten minutes maybe it's 20
[05:34] minutes
[05:34] maybe it's to notice the different
[05:40] vocalizations - some of them are howling
[05:42] others are more frantic some of them are
[05:45] more subdued more relaxed all these
[05:47] little things that's what you have to
[05:49] interpret and get to note with your own
[05:50] dog usually the louder like that the
[05:52] more anxiety they're experiencing looks
[05:55] like she's starting to settle down a
[05:56] little whining is subsided we have three
[05:58] minutes and 16 seconds left now I'm the
[06:01] five-minute timer she'll probably do
[06:02] some more whimpering then maybe she'll
[06:04] pass out puppies like this need to sleep
[06:05] for like 16 18 hours a day it's
[06:07] ridiculous so I don't feel too bad about
[06:09] encouraging her to sleep she's growing
[06:11] so rapidly in this case I don't think
[06:13] it's really necessary to reinforce with
[06:15] food as she calms down rather I just
[06:17] kind of want her to achieve a calm state
[06:19] of mind just naturally I think a big
[06:21] reason as to why she's behaving like
[06:23] this - is clearly the massive adjustment
[06:27] she's had to go through she's had
[06:29] relatively free range to live on her
[06:31] farm where she came from with her mom
[06:33] and her siblings and now she's without
[06:36] all of that it's gotta be a lot of
[06:37] stress on her so if your dog stresses
[06:39] out like this or you're having any other
[06:40] issue with your dog I'll have a link to
[06:42] both of my books below so that was a
[06:44] little bit longer than five minutes I
[06:46] was actually about eight or nine minutes
[06:47] that's one of her more significant
[06:49] outbursts I would say after she sleeps
[06:51] for an hour - I'm gonna work with her
[06:52] some more I'm gonna do some training
[06:53] with her and exercise to give her that
[06:55] mental and physical stimulation because
[06:57] if you're not doing the regular training
[06:58] and you're not doing the regular
[06:59] exercise and it's not reasonable to
[07:01] expect your dog to settle down
[07:03] eventually you have to meet them halfway
[07:04] but if you're fair to them that's why I
[07:06] don't feel guilty when she has that
[07:08] outburst right there because I know I'm
[07:09] more spending a lot of time with her and
[07:11] giving her that exercise she's got her
[07:12] food she's been outside to go potty and
[07:14] you know all that so I've checked all
[07:16] the boxes now that inertia has been
[07:18] asleep for a few minutes I'm going to
[07:19] keep up her sound desensitization so
[07:22] that she's encouraged to sleep no matter
[07:23] what's going on around her part of my
[07:25] strategy is to really keep her
[07:27] desensitized to sounds gonna make these
[07:30] sounds here walk past her and I know
[07:32] what you might be thinking well she just
[07:33] got quiet why would you do that I'm all
[07:35] about letting
[07:36] sleeping dogs lie but at the same time
[07:38] if I can sit here and talk at this
[07:39] normal or loud voice here and she still
[07:41] stays asleep I'm really desensitizing
[07:43] her that when she's sleeping and she
[07:45] learns how to relax
[07:46] under these louder situations so there
[07:49] she woke up a little bit but I'm just
[07:51] trying to find what it takes and at this
[07:52] age you know they just go back to sleep
[07:54] so easily so today is a big day I want
[07:56] to start preparing her for getting a
[07:57] bath cutting her nails and brushing her
[07:59] teeth
[07:59] but she's wound up after that nap so I
[08:01] need to get some of that energy out to
[08:03] make the experience as pleasant as
[08:05] possible she needs to learn fetch but
[08:08] that's gonna take many many weeks never
[08:10] too soon to start though you have to
[08:12] really kind of teach your dog the game
[08:13] before you can reliably get their energy
[08:15] out so I'm gonna get her interested in
[08:17] the new squeaky toy we have so many
[08:18] different toys he's really tracking a
[08:20] lot better too and she's very young so
[08:22] we're conservative with exercise it's so
[08:24] fun to watch him discover new things
[08:25] look at that curiosity that curiosity is
[08:28] such a great sign look at the play bow
[08:29] look at that oh that's awesome I'm just
[08:32] gonna let this go here because he's
[08:34] moving around of course a puppy's
[08:35] favorite toy is well usually human flesh
[08:39] this play biting is pretty fun right now
[08:41] I don't mind her biting right now as
[08:42] long as it's not too hard that shows her
[08:44] how to use her bite pressure that's all
[08:46] healthy stuff too
[08:47] I don't want her to be afraid to use her
[08:48] mouth at all so I'm not trying to
[08:49] discourage all biting I'm just trying to
[08:51] discourage hard biting or biting without
[08:53] permission whoa oh my gosh look at you
[08:57] oh you won
[08:59] she's been exercised and mentally
[09:02] stimulated now she should be more
[09:03] receptive to learning about this strange
[09:05] concept of getting a bath I don't want
[09:08] to wait until it's time to give her bath
[09:09] too then just get her comfortable with
[09:11] it so I'm gonna try and get her
[09:12] comfortable with you know one step at a
[09:14] time
[09:15] good job it was awesome you see what I
[09:17] did there I just turned on the water see
[09:19] how she's not taking treats she's really
[09:21] nervous right now for some reason so
[09:22] we'll make it a little bit easier for
[09:23] rather than just giving her a bath just
[09:26] get her used to a wet washcloth I don't
[09:28] think she wants to be in the sink so I'm
[09:29] gonna put her here on the counter we're
[09:30] gonna go real slow I'm gonna see if I
[09:33] can get away with having the water on a
[09:35] little bit in the background just to get
[09:38] her used to that what's okay good job
[09:41] doing really well I'm gonna touch her
[09:43] face a little there she's being very
[09:45] tolerant she's licking it see how she's
[09:47] a little less nervous now a little less
[09:49] I mean I don't I think if I were to put
[09:51] her in there and just try to bathe her
[09:52] she would probably get a little nervous
[09:53] and freaked out and that would set me
[09:55] back a long time this is how you build
[09:57] trust with a dog get this more wet oh I
[10:01] love that she showed some initiative
[10:02] right there and walk towards the water
[10:04] I'm gonna touch her paws she's doing
[10:06] great with having her paws touched I've
[10:08] been doing that a lot lately you'll find
[10:09] if you just go real slow with this kind
[10:11] of stuff they usually are far more
[10:13] likely to do a lot better it'll touch
[10:14] the inside of her ears here just start
[10:17] desensitizing her that she reacted a
[10:18] little but that's all pretty healthy and
[10:20] so that was her first little sponge bath
[10:21] a very light version of a bath obviously
[10:24] but these are the kind of things I'll be
[10:25] doing this stuff a lot with her just to
[10:27] get her more and more comfortable with
[10:28] it the more often it happens and the
[10:30] more gradually you ease your dog into
[10:32] this stuff the smoother raising them is
[10:34] gonna go you did so well that was good
[10:36] all done what oh I like the wave that
[10:41] was cute that's cute she just offered
[10:43] her pop got a click that when your dog
[10:45] does something you like on their own let
[10:47] them know you like it
[10:47] bath training check now let's begin
[10:49] getting her ready for nail trimming in
[10:51] the future no clipping is another thing
[10:53] the dogs need to get used to right now
[10:54] she's feeling a little bite he said this
[10:56] probably isn't the best time for a nail
[10:57] trimming for her I'll probably save it
[10:59] for when she's a little more fatigued
[11:01] from exercise but this is still good I
[11:03] can at least touch her with it and get
[11:04] her used to the motion without clipping
[11:06] I'm gonna come around her nail just put
[11:08] some pressure on it this is just
[11:09] desensitizing pure desensitizing here
[11:12] that's a nice new feeling for her and
[11:14] she's adjusting really well I'm gonna
[11:15] give you a treat yes and I'm not using
[11:18] the clicker here only because my hands
[11:20] are a bit full and that's okay clicker
[11:21] training is great when you can use it if
[11:23] you can't that's okay too it's not
[11:25] required we're certainly gonna do more
[11:26] nail trimming in a future but it's time
[11:28] to prepare her for tooth brushing I want
[11:31] to be able to touch every bit of the
[11:32] inside of her mouth there with her
[11:34] reacting calmly and cooperatively
[11:35] I'm not restraining her she's not
[11:37] running away and I'm able to really
[11:39] stick my whole finger all over the place
[11:41] in there get your dog used to having
[11:43] their teeth brush with just a finger
[11:44] before you even start anything else
[11:46] don't push them to where they start
[11:47] getting frustrated either stop while
[11:49] they're doing well okay let me give her
[11:50] a break and then I'll introduce a
[11:52] toothbrush to
[11:53] you might notice I'm kind of finger
[11:54] brush on my finger here this is for
[11:56] puppies to brush their teeth if you've
[11:57] ever tried to brush a dog's teeth who
[11:59] isn't prepared for it you'll know how
[12:00] tough that can be so we're going to get
[12:03] her used to it from a young age at least
[12:04] we're gonna try and we're gonna see how
[12:05] she's doing gonna put her on my lap here
[12:09] good job go ahead and give her a little
[12:12] bit of a tiny piece of meat there let
[12:15] her know you're doing great what was
[12:18] that was that a puppy burp when she
[12:21] shows resistance I'm gonna stop because
[12:23] I'm not trying to show her how to get
[12:25] her teeth brushed in this training
[12:26] session I'm just trying to ease her into
[12:27] it over the next days two weeks
[12:29] nice job okay that's good and so I'm
[12:32] just gonna leave it there the important
[12:33] thing to understand don't wait until
[12:35] it's time to get your dog to do
[12:37] something to also train them one of the
[12:39] mistakes that we make if we're new to
[12:42] training dogs is you take the mindset oh
[12:44] it's time to give them a bath well let's
[12:45] go see how it goes or it's time to clip
[12:47] their nails they need it done I've got
[12:49] to do it right now and you don't on the
[12:50] luxury of time so if you want to give
[12:52] yourself options it's important to give
[12:54] yourself time to prepare them you can
[12:56] see our dining room has been completely
[12:58] taken over for the inertia project right
[13:00] now it's important to have your dog's
[13:02] currency available everywhere throughout
[13:04] the house small Tupperware containers
[13:06] like this with your treats in them you
[13:08] should have some on the end table in
[13:09] your living room in your family room in
[13:11] your kitchen and so on so that you have
[13:13] quick easy access to them number one so
[13:15] that you can reinforce when your dog is
[13:17] doing something that you really like by
[13:19] giving them a treat number two having
[13:21] treats frequently available to you so
[13:23] that you can consistently redirect your
[13:25] dog when they're biting on your
[13:26] shoelaces or annoying on the table even
[13:28] when you do have them on lease they
[13:29] still might have access to a few things
[13:31] we have a tendency to want to kind of
[13:33] scold our dogs and yell at our dogs when
[13:35] they're doing things that we don't like
[13:37] but it's really important to understand
[13:38] they're just doing what comes natural
[13:40] and you can skip the whole stage of
[13:42] yelling at them and getting frustrated
[13:43] and instead just focus on really showing
[13:45] them what you prefer they do right now I
[13:47] don't want her looking at those potty
[13:48] pads it looks like she might be thinking
[13:50] about chewing them I'm gonna try to be
[13:52] one step ahead of her hey what's this
[13:55] yes good job it's pretty easy to be one
[13:58] step ahead of a puppy I mean there's
[14:00] something that it's tempting she's
[14:01] obviously teething and I was able to get
[14:03] her attention off of that
[14:05] never trust a puppy that's what I always
[14:07] say basically she's either in training
[14:09] or she's in her pen in her exercise area
[14:12] over here or she's tied to me like that
[14:14] with a leash so that I'm able to keep
[14:16] track of her at all times I hope you

[00:08] trained dog and this is my new dog
[00:11] inertia I'm taking you along as I train

[00:33] delivered I'll have a link and discount
[00:34] code in the description below today I'm
[00:37] gonna use a clicker to conditioned
[00:38] inertia to some very sensitive things
[00:40] like nail trimming and getting a bath
[00:42] when your dog is in a really tired state
[00:44] that's a great time to introduce things
[00:46] like nail trimming so they're less
[00:48] likely to resist and enjoy the process a
[00:51] bit more when a puppy is nine weeks old
[00:52] it's not that difficult to get them
[00:54] tired because they sleep so much but for
[00:56] good measure I'm gonna go ahead and see
[00:58] if I can burn a little bit of inertia's
[01:00] energy off just to really optimize her
[01:02] for these training sessions okay let's
[01:04] start with a nurses first nail trim
[01:05] let's see where she is on being
[01:07] desensitizing it up touch her toe there
[01:09] give her a treat I just want to make
[01:11] sure I can touch all these - we'll see
[01:13] right there I'm not gonna click that cuz
[01:15] she got a little squirmy good right
[01:19] there was nice and acceptable yeah see
[01:23] I'm not waiting for her to start to
[01:25] squirm I'm just gonna touch it wiggle it
[01:27] real quick there and see if I can get a
[01:29] click so she ought to get the hint that
[01:30] when she's nice and still she's gonna
[01:32] get rewarded here let's check those back
[01:34] feet a little more sensitive on the back
[01:36] good for this training session I've
[01:38] opted to just use real meat here I'm
[01:40] using turkey
[01:44] she's pulling from the let go she's
[01:46] getting playful I'm still gonna go ahead
[01:47] and even click that cuz I like that
[01:49] she's in that relaxed frame of mind
[01:50] let's see if I can get her back in
[01:52] position and there we go good job she's
[01:56] doing pretty well on having her paws
[01:57] touched and everything so now let's go
[01:59] ahead and see where she is on having the
[02:02] nail clipper introduced oh boy no I
[02:04] don't want you to bite this how about we
[02:05] just sniff it good let her get nice and
[02:09] familiar with it if I do that yeah we
[02:12] good you see how I got it under there a
[02:14] little bit around not cutting it yet see
[02:17] that oh that was a great reaction
[02:19] because she could feel the metal around
[02:21] her nails presumably I cannot emphasize
[02:23] this enough do not rush into cutting
[02:26] your dog's nails if at all possible
[02:28] get your dog very comfortable with
[02:29] entire training sessions dedicated to
[02:32] getting them used to the nail trimmers
[02:34] so I'm gonna go right here don't want to
[02:36] be too short let's go yes good job I
[02:39] have both my hands occupied that's where
[02:41] that yes comes in handy I'm just cutting
[02:43] a teeny tiny bit just to make the
[02:45] experience ultra positive I'm not just
[02:47] going one after the other here she
[02:49] starts to get concerned I'll stop that
[02:51] one's kind of long right there alright
[02:54] let's try the back legs I'm gonna put
[02:56] her into it down the back toes might be
[02:59] more sensitive even though she's being
[03:04] squirmy right now it appears to be
[03:06] because she's pretty playful and I think
[03:08] that's great I love it when a dog is in
[03:09] a playful mindset that's a really good
[03:11] Association as good as food if you ask
[03:13] me and rather than try and cut her nails
[03:14] right the second instead what I'm gonna
[03:16] do is while she's playful I'm gonna
[03:18] desensitize over here without touching
[03:20] those toes still firmly good
[03:24] Oh tempting
[03:28] [Music]
[03:33] yes I'd say for her first nail trimming
[03:36] session with me that was pretty good by
[03:38] going slow and making sure that it's a
[03:41] stress-free experience for your dog it's
[03:43] so worth it moving forward now if your
[03:45] dog has already freaked out about things
[03:47] like this you would still do the same
[03:48] thing but you would just start over work
[03:50] on having them sniff it click them treat
[03:52] them whatever you have to do to get them
[03:54] to equate getting their nails trimmed
[03:55] with something they really enjoyed don't
[03:57] feel like you have to cut their nails in
[03:59] their first second or third training
[04:00] session this is probably the third time
[04:02] I've worked up to cutting her nails at
[04:04] this point if she was a different kind
[04:06] of puppy and was less comfortable with
[04:07] it I'd go even slower if it took me
[04:09] weeks to work up to it I would take that
[04:11] time let's introduce inertia to the
[04:13] brush for the first time I think you're
[04:15] seeing a pattern here yes what is that I
[04:18] mean she doesn't know this is a new toy
[04:19] or what you can see she's really
[04:21] inquisitive about it I wanted to let her
[04:23] know I like that you're very inquisitive
[04:24] and welcoming of this new thing so often
[04:27] when we do something like go to brush
[04:29] our dog we just start brushing them
[04:30] without letting them check out the
[04:32] device they're like what is that thing
[04:34] gently introducing a tomb can be a great
[04:35] way to start here yes
[04:37] and so what I'm working towards here is
[04:40] being able to have her kind of ignore it
[04:42] as I touch her here we go
[04:45] good my goal here is not to thoroughly
[04:47] brush her my goal is to just introduce
[04:49] her to the brush because I've not used a
[04:51] brush with her before he pulls on their
[04:52] hair a little bit there so that's why we
[04:54] want to be really careful it can be
[04:55] uncomfortable oh good job I'm moving
[04:57] pretty quick here but she's doing so
[04:59] well and I'm not gonna necessarily go in
[05:01] a linear fashion here I'm gonna go back
[05:03] to just tapping her with it letting her
[05:05] know this thing can do all sorts of
[05:06] things I can tell right now but I just
[05:08] started brushing or she'd be like all
[05:10] over the place she's so playful I'm
[05:12] barely touching her here and she thinks
[05:14] it's a toy she's enthralled by it she's
[05:16] like more of that that's so cool so I'm
[05:18] actually gonna take a step back here
[05:19] since it's not a toy I'll discourage
[05:21] play with it there was a quick moment of
[05:24] restraint so let me acknowledge that
[05:26] it's worth stressing I'm using a
[05:28] combination of clicking or saying yes
[05:30] and treating just to let her know
[05:31] they're both synonymous she's not
[05:33] stressed or anything here but I'm not
[05:34] gonna click it because I don't want her
[05:36] biting on it necessarily so the
[05:38] clickable behavior here is being
[05:40] tolerant right there yes that's a
[05:42] clickable moment
[05:43] job like how she's really kind of
[05:45] pressed up against me right here very
[05:46] trusting part of building that bond see
[05:49] grooming practices like this can help
[05:51] you really build that bond between you
[05:52] and your dog which is what all of your
[05:54] training should be based on a very
[05:56] strong bond and Trust yes that was a
[05:59] good stroke I don't know if he could
[06:00] hear it and the play dead too because
[06:02] she's been working on this play dead
[06:03] she's kind of figured out that that
[06:05] makes the clicker go off sometimes but
[06:06] she can't quite remember how to do it
[06:08] all the time
[06:08] yes she's brainstorming so I'm kind of
[06:11] clicking both things hear her play dead
[06:13] and her tolerance it's like four strokes
[06:17] with a brush well you look so much nicer
[06:20] when you're brushed I should probably do
[06:21] this more often in general it's a good
[06:23] idea to brush your dog every day or to
[06:25] keep all the dirt out of there codes and
[06:27] now for one of the most delicate
[06:29] training exercises yet bath time so I'm
[06:32] gonna set inertia into the bathtub here
[06:34] she's never been in the bathtub
[06:36] she has no affiliation of the fact that
[06:38] water is gonna come out there or
[06:40] anything so my first objective is just
[06:42] to gently get her comfortable with the
[06:44] bathtub
[06:45] sniff it around okay she's like what is
[06:47] that see oh she's not taking treats
[06:51] that's a sign that she's a little
[06:52] anxious and maybe I should just take a
[06:54] step back since she's looking pretty
[06:55] inquisitive right there I'm gonna let
[06:57] her just smell everything and check it
[06:59] out remember dogs really perceive the
[07:01] world with her nose you can see her nose
[07:02] is going crazy right now just trying to
[07:04] gather information good job so she's
[07:08] starting to take treats now that's a
[07:10] good sign let me see if I can get her
[07:11] attention on me or if she's just too
[07:14] overstimulated yes good job I'm just
[07:21] gonna try to let her get it out of her
[07:22] system here yeah I saw that coming this
[07:25] is what I want to discourage right here
[07:27] so there I failed to preempt her and
[07:31] that's what will happen
[07:33] see inertia good she was thinking about
[07:37] jumping again it looked like I want to
[07:39] really see if I can get her to freeze
[07:41] this right here by upping my rate
[07:44] of reinforcement good job you're doing
[07:47] great and again I'm giving her tiny
[07:49] pieces here so it's not like I'm giving
[07:52] her a ton of food
[07:54] down because that's an even more stable
[07:57] position in the bath let's bring your
[07:59] over here because my next step is to
[08:01] introduce the water but to do so
[08:03] extremely delicately so before I even
[08:06] turn the faucet on I want to do a bit of
[08:08] a mini experiment right here I'm gonna
[08:10] go ahead and see how she reacts to water
[08:12] in the tub just by having a couple of
[08:15] drops fall down yes she barely noticed
[08:22] it over there and that's exactly what
[08:24] I'm looking forward letting her know hey
[08:25] water can happen in here do you see how
[08:27] meticulous were being I mean this is if
[08:29] you will go out of your way to be
[08:30] meticulous like this you'll greatly
[08:33] increase the odds at your dog adjusted
[08:35] very well it's when we just over a one
[08:37] more dog and just turn on the faucet and
[08:39] let the water run just start pouring
[08:40] water over them that we run into
[08:42] problems let's now go to the next step
[08:44] here remember she has no idea that water
[08:47] comes out of you you can see that caught
[08:49] her interest a little let her
[08:50] investigate this the water that came out
[08:52] and see how she's licking it that
[08:53] doesn't look like she's too scared of it
[08:54] she's adjusting well she's still a
[08:56] little thrown off as she explores here
[08:58] and I'm monitoring her here just to see
[09:01] how nervous she becomes see how she's
[09:03] starting to walk back there I wanted to
[09:05] cut off the anxiety immediately and take
[09:07] a step back on my training she looked a
[09:09] little guarded
[09:16] you can see she's like looking a little
[09:18] more guarded I'm just gonna do some
[09:19] general conditioning right now she's
[09:22] sitting there click their feet hey
[09:25] everything's cool okay inertia what's
[09:31] this what's this
[09:34] she may be getting a bit nervous any
[09:36] simple stop yes good girl get that look
[09:46] at it in this case the jumping up is
[09:48] actually preferred because she's
[09:50] investigating the source of the water
[09:51] and I want her to be very comfortable
[09:53] with this faucet there were a big reward
[09:55] for that one all right so let's try this
[09:57] let me see if I can like kind of litter
[09:59] and be able on that Turkey I've got a
[10:01] little chunk right there and I'm gonna
[10:02] turn the stream on while she's nibbling
[10:05] in
[10:07] [Music]
[10:14] [Music]
[10:15] yes
[10:17] the fact that she's approaching it makes
[10:19] me very optimistic I wanted to let her
[10:20] know looking at it interacting with it
[10:22] it was really gonna get her a treat -
[10:29] did you see that oh this is good you
[10:32] know I'm gonna go ahead and continue to
[10:34] click her and treat her I love that she
[10:35] investigated on her own yes good girl
[10:39] maybe letting it run here for just a
[10:42] minute or two or five or ten or twenty
[10:44] just gonna desensitize her you can see
[10:46] that I up the stream there she's a
[10:48] little thrown off the fact that she's
[10:49] taking treats seems to me as though
[10:52] she's not overly stretched so I'm just
[10:54] doing this conditioning here and letting
[10:55] her know water equals fun stuff getting
[10:59] a little warm there so it's add a little
[11:00] bit of cold very slowly yes
[11:07] let's see she'll go over there with my
[11:08] toss a tree yeah good job
[11:14] hey we go over here what are you kidding
[11:18] me this is wonderful guys the only point
[11:21] of this particular session is just to
[11:24] get her comfortable being in a bathtub
[11:25] with water running but if she continues
[11:27] to be calm and accepting we can keep
[11:29] going let's see something now yes
[11:34] a port in front of them yes here you go
[11:46] and so from her perspective it's another
[11:48] little faucet that popped up
[11:53] [Music]
[11:57] okay so right here you can see the
[12:02] anxiety rising again let me see if I can
[12:03] get her back before I just turn off the
[12:05] water I think we can overcome this but
[12:07] if not I'll turn it off good job it's a
[12:09] fine line sometimes between backing off
[12:11] entirely or helping your dog work
[12:13] through it if in doubt take a
[12:14] significant break or even take a step
[12:16] back to your last exercise where your
[12:18] dog is less stressed let's try a leaky
[12:21] mat here these leaky mats can be a great
[12:23] way to reduce your dog's anxiety during
[12:25] bath time I'm gonna have a link below
[12:27] they have these grooves so when you
[12:28] smear peanut butter on them or something
[12:30] like that it's a little more challenging
[12:31] for your dog to get the magic moment
[12:34] here is when the water makes contact
[12:35] with them for a look at that yes good
[12:37] girl
[12:38] gonna let that settle in for a moment
[12:40] let her get back to the peanut butter
[12:42] this is great
[12:49] so you're acknowledging it but that's
[12:51] okay yes good girl very good oh okay
[13:01] she's quite the athletes yes yes good
[13:14] girl I'm gonna get down here with you
[13:16] you're doing so great look at us we're
[13:19] in hearing them bathtub together so I'm
[13:22] just gonna kind of rinse her off here
[13:30] let me have this let her smell this
[13:33] washcloth she's behaving really well as
[13:36] I rinsed her yes give her a treat for
[13:39] being so good like that don't you
[13:41] alright so I've got some shampoo I love
[13:50] you so much I sure do get those paws
[13:57] nice and clean get that head nice and
[14:00] clean
[14:00] yes I'm gonna pick up the Leakey mat
[14:02] here and we're gonna go back to Turkey
[14:08] good girl
[14:10] very good you're being so great yes what
[14:13] is this
[14:25] and smell
[14:31] [Music]
[14:34] like yeah that's what a good girl see
[14:37] how slow we're going here so the theme
[14:44] here is going slow motion to get them
[14:47] comfortable with all of this yeah that
[14:52] was a good one I'm not in a hurry if it
[14:56] takes me an hour to rinse her that's
[14:58] cool I want to go on her terms right now
[15:00] which is comfortable with to avoid
[15:02] problems in the future
[15:04] almost done one more okay yes very good
[15:11] okay now it's time to drive her ah
[15:14] similar thing here I think she's gonna
[15:16] be okay with this but I'll pick her up
[15:18] she's pretty comfortable with being
[15:19] picked up
[15:20] I'd call that a successful training
[15:21] session in the next episode we'll go to
[15:23] puppy class for the first time expose
[15:25] inertia to major fireworks and focus on

[01:36] link below just go to bark box comm
[01:38] slash dog training believe it or not
[01:40] we've had inertia for three whole weeks
[01:42] now and this is going to be her first
[01:44] play session with indie that's because
[01:46] indie can be hit or miss with new dogs
[01:48] and while it's been years since Indies
[01:50] had an altercation with another dog I
[01:52] wanted to make sure that inertia had
[01:53] plenty of experience and some proper
[01:55] Corrections from a variety of other dogs
[01:57] before engaging in a full-on play
[01:59] session with indie as a precaution India
[02:01] is wearing a basket muzzle remember
[02:03] these are humane muzzles that allow a
[02:05] dog to pant freely take treats drink
[02:08] water I think there's a 98% chance that
[02:11] Indy is going to react just fine which
[02:13] is why
[02:13] comfortable having her interact at all
[02:15] with inertia right now okay say hi see
[02:19] I'm the puppy it's okay
[02:20] say hi that's in your show the puppy
[02:24] that I've been telling you about
[02:28] good yes perfect this greeting behavior
[02:32] looks very normal you can see how
[02:34] they're greeting each other from the
[02:35] side that's usually a sign that both
[02:37] dogs or a tease so a nurse is trying to
[02:39] solicit play and he's like I don't want
[02:41] to do any of that play good healthy yes
[02:48] good girl that's okay
[02:49] that was a perfectly measured response
[02:50] from Indy she simply let inertia know
[02:53] that she didn't want her to close
[03:01] he's sweet good girl yeah say hi you're
[03:04] okay
[03:04] that's good that's okay Indy Indy at 13
[03:07] and a half years old isn't quite as
[03:09] mobile as she used to be but she's still
[03:11] pretty quick
[03:11] the muzzle was just a precaution and I
[03:13] think we're ready to take it off and let
[03:15] them meet without the muzzle but first I
[03:17] want to get some playtime in within D
[03:19] since Indy and I played together all the
[03:21] time maybe that will get her in an extra
[03:23] playful mood you know we talk a lot
[03:24] about bite pressure and how I'm trying
[03:26] to teach an Ursa that it's okay to bite
[03:28] in some circumstances as long as the
[03:30] pressure is appropriate that's something
[03:32] Indy is really mastered she has
[03:34] permission to bite them softly so you
[03:37] can see that I can put my whole hand in
[03:39] her mouth and her bite pressure is light
[03:41] so she knows just how hard is okay it's
[03:44] also good that inertia is watching
[03:45] calmly in the background so that I can
[03:47] play with Indy and she's in a perfectly
[03:50] stable state of mind like that remember
[03:53] I'm not allowing inertia to simply walk
[03:55] out of the crate just because the door
[03:56] opens let's see how her weight when the
[03:58] crate door opens is coming along okay
[04:00] yes okay these next few moments are
[04:06] important I've held off on introducing
[04:08] these two until inertia has gotten lots
[04:10] of experience with older dogs who were
[04:12] known to behave well with puppies and as
[04:14] I said it's been a very long time since
[04:16] India's had an outburst towards another
[04:18] dog you can come close but not too close
[04:26] this is how close you get she's being
[04:28] very measured look at the context in
[04:31] which it's occurring she's not shown a
[04:33] propensity to overcorrect and
[04:34] furthermore inertia has shown a
[04:37] willingness to comply with those dog to
[04:41] dog interactions she's allowing indeed a
[04:44] doer sniffing then she sniffs of them
[04:46] taking turns is really great so far all
[04:51] of this body language looks fine to me
[04:53] both dogs appear to be playful and
[04:54] having a good time
[04:55] let's keep watching :
[05:01] nice job good girl it's okay
[05:04] go play I'd like to see an Ursa get on
[05:07] her back she hasn't done much of that
[05:08] yet yeah there we go that's my boy on
[05:13] cue huh that really seems to send the
[05:15] signal that a dog is not a threat you
[05:18] could get on their back their way of
[05:19] saying I just want to play
[05:22] [Laughter]
[05:39] I wonder if she's like do you know how
[05:40] to give treats when I do this thing this
[05:42] is language I have learned do you
[05:44] understand this language it's like this
[05:47] it's called play dead hey inertia Indy
[05:53] had a little bit too much and this is
[05:54] her way of letting a nursin know it but
[05:56] at no point did she bite or attempt to
[05:58] harm an Ursa so I consider this an
[06:00] acceptable correction from an older dog
[06:02] to a young puppy don't play so rough
[06:04] with your sister she doesn't like to
[06:06] play that raw it's time for puppy class
[06:08] again and I can't get enough inertia
[06:10] needs to meet as many dogs as she can
[06:12] right now and puppy class is a super
[06:14] efficient and safe way to do that she's
[06:17] really excited to play right now so
[06:18] check this out
[06:19] she probably won't even listen to me see
[06:21] this inertia right now is pretty
[06:24] unresponsive to her training in this
[06:26] very exciting environment that's normal
[06:28] she's calming down a bit in this
[06:29] environment so I'm taking this
[06:31] opportunity to reinforce that calmness
[06:32] since inertia is now showing a little
[06:34] bit of interest in the treats that shows
[06:36] me that she's in a teachable mindset now
[06:38] if she were to show little interest in a
[06:40] really high value treat then I would
[06:42] just chill out and let her observe the
[06:44] class so we've got a couple of German
[06:46] Shepherd dog puppies coming in sightings
[06:57] with Ruthie who she's met before okay go
[07:01] play hey just like dogs remember friends
[07:04] from past classes since this is a new
[07:07] batch of dogs inertia is more reserved
[07:10] at first
[07:25] okay good job inertia so right now we're
[07:29] supposed to be working on sits and downs
[07:30] but a nurse is a bit too distracted to
[07:32] follow a lure right now so instead I'm
[07:34] choosing to reinforce calm behavior with
[07:36] her right now
[07:36] you know like when she's automatically
[07:38] sitting or lying down and checking it
[07:39] out see you nice loose leash so I kind
[07:42] of appreciate that too so there's always
[07:44] something to look for sometimes when you
[07:46] have a dog especially this young you
[07:47] have to kind of wait for them to be in
[07:49] the mood now if I were able to get her
[07:50] attention I wouldn't make sure that I
[07:52] give her an extra good reward so that's
[07:56] good nice job good so extra big reward
[08:01] there Jeannette the awesome instructor
[08:03] of this puppy class brought her dog
[08:05] Tahoe out so that the puppies can
[08:06] practice being around an adult dog yes
[08:09] and now I was able to get it down so
[08:10] that's good so they're kind of and then
[08:12] how your dog doesn't just go from like
[08:14] listening to not listening it's kind of
[08:16] like this in and out pure you have to go
[08:18] through during the communication
[08:19] building things all right now inertia
[08:20] looks like she wants to interact with
[08:21] these puppies a lot more now than she
[08:23] did before so this is a great example of
[08:26] using your environment as a reward
[08:28] practice telling your dog to sit or hold
[08:31] a stay or a weight and then let them go
[08:33] play with the dogs as the reward
[08:44] and now it's time to get back to
[08:47] training what we're practicing Crumlin
[08:48] called in the presence of other dogs
[08:50] here so let's see how she does see
[08:52] mixing basic training with socialization
[08:54] and alternating like this every few
[08:56] minutes is a great way to get dogs
[08:57] paying attention to you while around
[08:59] other dogs training your dog in this
[09:01] kind of environment while socializing
[09:03] them with other dogs can be so valuable
[09:05] so puppy class is done but that doesn't
[09:08] mean socialization is done you don't
[09:10] want to just rely on puppy class to
[09:11] socialize your dog we thought what a
[09:13] great idea to come out get some
[09:15] breakfast and given her some additional
[09:17] exposure to a new place she's never been
[09:19] surrounded dog friendly restaurant here
[09:21] in New Orleans
[09:22] places called cafe Navarre great place
[09:24] what I'll be looking for seeing when she
[09:26] naturally calms down again that's a
[09:28] really huge part of training when she
[09:30] automatically just lies down and chills
[09:32] out because right now you see she's
[09:34] frantic that's normal for many dogs
[09:36] especially young dogs I'm keeping her on
[09:38] a short leash because I'm not gonna let
[09:39] her have all the freedom in the world
[09:40] here's oh and look there's a natural
[09:42] settle right there yes let her know that
[09:46] behavior works
[09:47] then I'll periodically acknowledge it
[09:49] when she does know she's still probably
[09:50] likely to get up and walk around and
[09:53] then hopefully get back into her settled
[09:54] again but as long as she's holding it
[09:56] all every few seconds a couple times a
[09:58] minute as she gets settled reinforce her
[10:00] with some really good treats inertia has
[10:02] discovered a very brave bird and she's
[10:05] being so good not chasing down the bird
[10:07] just observing the bird this is why
[10:09] socializing is good you know when
[10:11] they're this young and they see a bird
[10:12] like this and they have any experience
[10:14] of being relaxed in a calm state of mind
[10:16] chances are they're going to be better
[10:18] adjusted as they get older I don't mind
[10:20] that she even gets up and looks at the
[10:21] bird right now I'm not introducing a
[10:23] hardcore stay session she's allowed to
[10:25] be interested in something new and look
[10:27] at it that's cool I love that I can get
[10:29] our attention on a toy in this
[10:31] environment but again we probably be
[10:32] here for 20 minutes before I could get
[10:35] her attention on this
[10:36] these zippers whoop oh yeah good and
[10:42] she's listening around the rain inertia
[10:45] continues to impress in public places
[10:47] later on it was time to do some trick
[10:49] training though so I have to show you
[10:50] guys this fun trick I just discovered
[10:52] recently in fact I was in here doing one
[10:54] of my off-camera training sessions with
[10:56] her just to kind of proof a lot of the
[10:58] stuff that she's already learned and I
[10:59] discovered she was starting to do this
[11:01] really cool trick so I called Bri in
[11:03] here I'm like Bri get your iPhone come
[11:04] in here and film this
[11:05] take a look yes since inertia was so
[11:16] freely offering this behavior naturally
[11:18] I feel pretty comfortable training this
[11:19] to her in moderation now if at any time
[11:22] she were to look uncomfortable or
[11:23] awkward then I would stop doing it did
[11:27] you see how she's jumping and she's like
[11:28] sit I don't want to sit so I'm just
[11:31] gonna stick with her for a minute over
[11:32] here yes good as I was teaching her this
[11:42] I realized I need to get her up on all
[11:44] fours because doing a somersault from a
[11:46] sit position isn't quite as practical
[11:48] for her at this point see it turns out
[11:50] that just placing this Treat right at
[11:52] her nose and between her front legs it
[11:54] was enough to encourage her to do one
[11:56] little somersault that was a really good
[11:58] example of finding something that
[11:59] inertia feels comfortable doing
[12:01] capturing it and encouraging it and
[12:03] molding that behavior into something
[12:05] pretty cool like a somersault let's talk
[12:07] a little bit more about how to teach
[12:08] your dog to stand very few people teach
[12:10] stand but it's an extremely valuable
[12:12] skill it comes in handy at the vet or
[12:15] the groomer plus it's the foundation of
[12:16] so many different things that you're
[12:18] going to teach your dog moving forward
[12:20] keep in mind that Stan can take a solid
[12:22] couple of weeks or more to master first
[12:25] your dog's gonna need to know a good sit
[12:27] like that and we're just gonna lure her
[12:29] up yes stand yes
[12:33] Stan okay and I'm gonna release her from
[12:36] that stand to let her know that position
[12:37] is over and she can now move so you
[12:39] could say yes if you were using a
[12:41] clicker as I often do with her this is
[12:44] how it would look
[12:45] stand okay good job so I'm gonna release
[12:58] her from that stand before she takes a
[12:59] step forward on her own you really want
[13:01] to capture her holding that stand and
[13:03] then release her very early on don't
[13:05] insist on a 10-second stand so I'm just
[13:07] gonna lure her up just like this and I'm
[13:10] gonna click just as she's holding that
[13:12] stand and I'm gonna try and capture her
[13:13] standing without those feet moving for
[13:15] just a few seconds and then I'm going to
[13:17] release her but you might start with
[13:19] just trying to get your dog to hold it
[13:20] for a half a second and release them
[13:24] okay
[13:25] stand yes stand is no good if they're
[13:29] just walking around the stand position
[13:31] is where they are standing with all four
[13:33] feet glued to the ground okay good job
[13:36] so really good work I mean she did take
[13:38] one step Lord but she looked really
[13:40] stable right there that was excellent
[13:42] that's where we are in stand it's still
[13:44] gonna take quite a bit of proofing or
[13:46] practicing in a variety of contexts and
[13:48] settings for to really generalize that
[13:50] concept if you want to keep up with
[13:51] inertia in real time follow us on

[00:00] I'm Zack George I trained dog and this
[00:03] is my new dog inertia I'm taking you
[00:05] along as I train her from day one you
[00:08] can start from the beginning or pick up
[00:09] anywhere and start learning
[00:11] welcome to the dog training experience
[00:14] at this point in the series so many of
[00:16] you have asked me to detail my daily
[00:18] routine when training inertia in today's
[00:20] episode I'm gonna cover what an average
[00:21] day of training looks like with a three
[00:24] month old puppy like inertia obviously
[00:26] there are many of you watching who have
[00:27] lots of different types of dogs with
[00:29] different needs so periodically I like
[00:31] to discuss super premium dog foods with
[00:33] you guys
[00:33] solid-gold is a brand of food that's
[00:35] been around for over 40 years
[00:37] and people who use solid gold with their
[00:38] dogs swear by it
[00:40] choosing a food that's perfect for your
[00:41] dog is pretty tough but one good place
[00:43] to start is to make sure that your dog
[00:45] food has really good ingredients and
[00:47] immediately when I look at these top
[00:49] ingredients you have lamb lamb meal
[00:50] brown rice there's a lot of great
[00:52] quality protein and healthy grains in
[00:54] this food there's over 20 superfoods in
[00:56] this formula things like carrots pumpkin
[00:57] blueberries broccoli almond oil and more
[00:59] so you can tell solid-gold puts a lot of
[01:02] thought into a food like this all solid
[01:04] gold dry recipes have ocean fish meal
[01:06] for fatty acids and egg protein for
[01:09] muscle growth and metabolism this solid
[01:11] gold sea meal is really innovative it
[01:13] supports skinning Cote digestive and
[01:15] immune health - I also like these meal
[01:17] Stoppers so maybe if your dog is a picky
[01:19] eater or you're trying to give them some
[01:20] extra nutrition these bone broth meal
[01:22] stoppers are awesome nice short
[01:24] ingredient list and they have these in a
[01:25] few different flavors too right now
[01:27] solid gold is gonna give you 30% off of
[01:29] your first order by visiting solid gold
[01:31] pet com / - Zac I'll have a link in the
[01:34] description solid gold is available
[01:35] worldwide - I thought it would be a
[01:37] great idea to take a step back in our
[01:39] series right now and really just cover
[01:41] what a day of training actually looks
[01:44] like with a three month old dog for me
[01:46] it works out to break the day into three
[01:48] rounds or three sections I'm in the
[01:51] habit of getting up pretty early in the
[01:52] morning in general but when you have a
[01:54] puppy that can be extra important so I
[01:56] get up typically around 5 a.m. or so to
[01:58] let inertia out to do her business and
[02:01] just kind of wake up and when she does
[02:02] have those successes outside and does
[02:04] her business and goes pee and poop I'm
[02:06] really in the habit of praising her and
[02:08] letting her know I appreciate that
[02:10] following it up with some playtime maybe
[02:12] a
[02:12] reward potty training is still far from
[02:14] over my mindset isn't even like is she
[02:17] getting close to being potty trained I'm
[02:18] still like okay she's nowhere near being
[02:20] potty trained now fortunately the good
[02:23] thing about having an attitude like this
[02:24] is that she has not been in a position
[02:27] to have many accidents at all lately
[02:29] I've been really good about controlling
[02:31] her environment making sure she's got
[02:32] her little puppy bedroom which is the
[02:34] crate and exercise pen combo she's been
[02:37] really great about not having accidents
[02:39] in her little bedroom area my preference
[02:41] would be to take her on a short walk but
[02:43] she's too young to go on walks and
[02:44] neighborhoods were the park behind our
[02:46] house because a fair amount of dogs
[02:48] frequent those areas and she has to get
[02:50] her final round of vaccinations before
[02:51] we can do that so in place of that I've
[02:54] been letting her do a lot of free play
[02:55] in the yard and just letting her explore
[02:56] the world and if it turns out that she's
[02:58] like in this extra playful mood I'll
[03:00] encourage her to play with me and we'll
[03:01] do some basic fetch or some type of
[03:03] training like that or maybe I'll try and
[03:05] get her to chase me just to really try
[03:07] and move her towards this fluid game of
[03:09] fetch that I'm hoping to train over the
[03:10] next few months with it so it's usually
[03:12] only about an hour so that I let her
[03:14] kind of play around get some of that
[03:15] energy out and then I'll put her into
[03:17] her puppy bedroom and give her some
[03:19] breakfast and then she usually passes
[03:20] out for like hours so I really take
[03:23] advantage of this still morning time to
[03:25] let her sleep so I can get my work done
[03:27] because I do have a job outside of
[03:29] training her contrary to what many
[03:31] people might think I know a lot of
[03:32] people with full-time jobs where you
[03:34] have to leave your house who have a new
[03:35] puppy can get really stressed out and
[03:37] overwhelmed because they think they need
[03:39] to do so much but you know if you'll
[03:41] just get up approximately one hour
[03:43] earlier which I understand may be
[03:44] inconvenient but if you got a puppy you
[03:47] got to do what you got to do right but
[03:48] if you'll spend that hour with them just
[03:50] doing some play and general training
[03:52] with them whatever you're working on you
[03:54] should find that most puppies especially
[03:56] that young will sleep for many hours so
[03:58] you can go off to work knowing that
[04:00] they're probably content until about
[04:02] lunchtime so when she wakes up a few
[04:04] hours later around midday say twelve
[04:06] o'clock or so that's when I'll do some
[04:08] more formal training with her either
[04:10] focusing on things that she's already
[04:12] learned and trying to get those to look
[04:14] a little bit better I also take
[04:15] advantage of this time to introduce
[04:17] introductory training exercises to new
[04:19] things that I intend to teach her later
[04:21] maybe a trick like play dead or rollover
[04:22] you know something like that
[04:24] you
[04:24] Julie inertia his attention span is
[04:26] around 15 minutes or so if she's really
[04:28] in the mood I might give her a 10-minute
[04:30] break after that 15-minute session and
[04:32] see if I can get another one out of her
[04:33] but that really depends on how she's
[04:35] feeling on that particular day
[04:36] I'll also be sure to give her some
[04:37] general outdoor exposure because you'll
[04:40] remember that getting your dog used to
[04:42] paying attention to you while outside is
[04:44] one of the most challenging parts of
[04:46] getting a dog to listen to you by
[04:47] desensitizing her and just getting her
[04:49] used to being in the world without being
[04:52] asked to do anything and allowing her to
[04:54] smell around and just take everything in
[04:56] is a huge part of training and it's
[04:58] pretty low maintenance on my part she
[05:00] does her thing I do mine everyone's
[05:02] happy
[05:02] if she does indicate that she's kind of
[05:04] interested in paying attention I might
[05:05] do some very light training on stuff
[05:07] that she understands very well at this
[05:09] point like sit and lie down with a lure
[05:12] for example but if she just wants to
[05:14] completely tune me out and ignore me and
[05:16] just sniff the ground that's ok too
[05:18] right now so for those of you with a
[05:20] traditional full-time job it would be
[05:22] ideal to come home during lunch and
[05:24] spend anywhere between 30 minutes to an
[05:26] hour with your dog if possible if you're
[05:28] unable to do that though maybe you have
[05:30] a family member that can help out and
[05:31] also doggie daycare can be a wonderful
[05:33] option for many of you as well so once
[05:35] I'm done doing that I'll probably bring
[05:36] her inside let her just have some casual
[05:39] time in the house she's been really
[05:41] enjoying playing with our older senior
[05:42] dog Indy a lot and Indy's been enjoying
[05:44] her a lot too so they've been having a
[05:46] lot of bonding going on so I'll usually
[05:48] let them play for a little bit and then
[05:49] I'll put inertia back up and encourage
[05:51] her to settle down and she usually yet
[05:53] again goes to sleep almost immediately
[05:55] it is incredible how much young puppies
[05:57] sleep once inertia finally wakes up it's
[06:00] time for her final round of the day with
[06:02] inertia being as young as she is we've
[06:03] been taking her to a different place
[06:05] virtually every day just to really show
[06:08] her that there's lots of things to see
[06:10] out there now of course the catch is as
[06:12] I mentioned earlier she hasn't had her
[06:13] final round of vaccinations so those
[06:15] places typically tend to be dog friendly
[06:17] bars and restaurants where a ton of dogs
[06:19] don't really go I found a couple of
[06:21] sports fields that are pretty well
[06:24] capped so we've kind of snuck into those
[06:25] to try and give her some time to run
[06:27] around and play it's also been great
[06:29] taking her to a lot of our friends
[06:30] houses some of them have dogs and as
[06:32] long as those dogs are vaccinated as our
[06:34] friends dogs are then
[06:35] it's cool with her to meet with those
[06:37] dogs and interact with them so at this
[06:38] point you know we'll return home and I
[06:40] might do one more of 10 to 15-minute
[06:42] training session with her that's
[06:44] dependent on again how she's feeling and
[06:46] if she's tired or I might let her play
[06:48] with Indy it's just kind of this
[06:49] flexible time that I have for her that I
[06:52] utilize in a way that makes the most
[06:53] sense for that given day after she's
[06:56] done with all of that I'll feed her let
[06:58] her digest her food for an hour or so
[07:00] take her off to do her business and then
[07:02] I'll put her up for the night and I'm
[07:03] careful to make sure that she has lots
[07:04] of good chew toys that are safe for her
[07:06] water to drink things like that and
[07:08] inertia has been so fantastic about just
[07:10] passing out and sleeping to the next
[07:12] morning where we'll do it all over again
[07:14] now as she gets older she's not gonna
[07:15] sleep quite so much so there's going to
[07:18] be additional challenges moving forward
[07:19] there are some additional things that
[07:20] I'd like to bring up too that you can do
[07:22] throughout the day for example I'm very
[07:24] careful to make sure that when she is
[07:26] awake maybe she hasn't passed out as
[07:28] quickly as she normally does I'm careful
[07:30] to make sure that she goes out and has
[07:31] potty breaks every hour that she is
[07:33] conscious
[07:34] I'll also focus on reinforcing general
[07:37] training throughout the day too for
[07:38] example I might do a very casual come
[07:40] when called training session when in a
[07:42] new public place when we're doing our
[07:44] socialization sessions or when she's
[07:46] playing with Indy I might work on settl
[07:48] training between rounds of play so there
[07:50] are plenty of opportunities throughout
[07:52] the day to implement spontaneous
[07:54] training sessions that just last a few
[07:56] seconds or so maybe you're trying to
[07:57] practice a real life leave it and you
[07:59] throw a sock in front of your dog and
[08:01] have them leave it so there's a lot of
[08:02] that type of thing that goes on during
[08:04] the training process right now and
[08:05] remember for those of you looking for a
[08:07] new high-quality premium food check out
[08:09] solid gold I'll have a link in the
[08:10] description and in order to make it
[08:12] extra easy to try solid gold is going to

[01:19] awesome pup retreats that I use all the
[01:21] time with inertia teaching your dog how
[01:23] to leave things alone in a real-world
[01:25] context is something we've been talking
[01:27] a lot about and it's the kind of thing
[01:30] that you really have to practice a lot
[01:32] in situations that are indistinguishable
[01:35] from a real-life context I try to make a
[01:38] salad at least every day and I'm gonna
[01:40] bring inertia along with me on my salad
[01:43] making experience today and we're going
[01:46] to do some setup drills that will
[01:48] hopefully teach her how to leave things
[01:50] alone in the real world all right let's
[01:54] start with some lettuce so not only
[01:57] we're dealing with a real life leave it
[01:58] we have to obviously discourage this
[02:01] behavior right here over here come on
[02:04] yes all I did was read avert her
[02:07] attention off of the counter and start
[02:09] to rip off a hunk of lettuce they're
[02:11] over here come on down here
[02:13] yes sit good chop don't choke
[02:16] okay good girl here's a chunk of lettuce
[02:18] for ya so I'm gonna go ahead and let her
[02:20] have some of that because I don't eat
[02:21] all the iceberg anyway if I accidentally
[02:23] war to drop a piece of lettuce leave it
[02:26] alone
[02:26] look at me very good nice work good job
[02:31] by simulating something that's really
[02:33] close to real life your dog is much more
[02:36] prepared for these real life experiences
[02:39] I like cheese to my salad as well so
[02:41] I'll put that in here no warning this
[02:43] time
[02:44] [Music]
[02:46] leave it alone yes good girl here how
[02:52] about a sweet potato you can have that
[02:54] really good job maybe I don't want her
[02:56] to eat the cheese so I'll put that aside
[02:57] and not let her have it in other words
[02:59] you don't have to give your dog the
[03:00] thing they're leaving alone it is a good
[03:02] idea though to give them some type of
[03:03] treat or something to let them know how
[03:05] much you appreciate that this is what I
[03:07] mean when I say don't limit your leave
[03:09] it training sessions too traditional
[03:11] leave it training sessions think outside
[03:13] the box and just try to come up with
[03:15] ways to strongly mimic highly
[03:17] distracting situations where your dog
[03:19] might potentially have difficulty
[03:21] leaving something alone I don't know
[03:22] plate let's try this leave it alone
[03:26] good girl let's continue on making our
[03:29] salad here
[03:34] very good she's blowing me away guys at
[03:37] no point did I say leave it just then
[03:40] and I'm rewarding her right now with
[03:41] these sweet potato treats from pupper
[03:43] she's loving those sometimes I like to
[03:46] put cashews in my salad too
[03:48] [Music]
[03:52] leave it alone Oh less successful this
[03:57] time leave it alone good job yes and how
[04:05] about more look at me leave it waiting
[04:13] for the look at me
[04:14] [Music]
[04:19] yes there's the glance I was waiting for
[04:22] here you go you can have a beef liver
[04:23] treat for that one good job and I'm not
[04:25] gonna pick all those up she's just gonna
[04:27] have to leave those alone for the
[04:28] duration of my salad she is being really
[04:30] good with all these cash she's on the
[04:31] ground so I'm gonna go ahead and offer
[04:33] her another reward good job all right
[04:37] and whoa good job this is what I mean
[04:44] when I say your dog needs to learn a
[04:47] default leave it in other words things
[04:49] are to be left alone by default the only
[04:52] things they interact with are the things
[04:53] that you over time allow them to
[04:56] interact with if she does go for
[04:58] something I'll just give her a gentle
[04:59] reminder leave it and since we're making
[05:01] it a priority to practice this on walks
[05:03] and all sorts of training sessions she's
[05:06] really beginning to understand this so
[05:08] your dog starts to realize okay I leave
[05:10] everything alone not just a treat when
[05:13] you drop it in front of me not just a
[05:14] piece of chicken and so your dog starts
[05:16] to suddenly realize that oh okay I leave
[05:19] that alone - I don't just leave a treat
[05:21] but if a piece of lettuce or a tomato or
[05:24] a piece of roast or nuts or a bunch of
[05:26] dog food falls in front of them I'm
[05:28] supposed to leave that alone to leave it
[05:30] is such an underestimated important
[05:32] thing to prioritize training with your
[05:34] dog especially when you train it without
[05:36] force without making your dog do it at
[05:38] no point do I pull her back to keep her
[05:40] from getting something rather block her
[05:42] access to it is what I like to do to
[05:43] really teach her to think good job yes
[05:46] and that's my salad I'm gonna go have
[05:48] lunch now good job in Ursa if you find
[05:50] it helpful to have a written guide to
[05:51] troubleshoot issues as they arise I
[05:53] recommend that you pick up my books so
[05:55] that they're always handy whenever you
[05:56] have a question I made sure that the
[05:58] index of both books is extremely user
[06:00] friendly so you can quickly get to any
[06:02] topic you're interested in inertia is
[06:04] new friend Lola the silkie is going to
[06:07] be coming over and they're gonna have
[06:08] some fun together hopefully it's
[06:09] important for inertia to get lots of
[06:12] exposure and experience with dogs of all
[06:14] different sizes and breeds and
[06:15] temperaments and energy levels
[06:17] especially while inertia is under 8
[06:19] months of age I'm gonna make sure that
[06:20] interactions with other dogs like this
[06:22] happen two maybe three times a week at
[06:24] least and we'll continue doing puppy
[06:26] classes to give her lots of exposure to
[06:28] different dogs of different temperaments
[06:30] so you can see a nurse has got a little
[06:32] erection going on right now but she's
[06:34] mostly playful I think that's gonna
[06:36] subside pretty quickly if I know her
[06:38] pretty well looks like a nurses met her
[06:39] match boy Lola has a ton of energy she
[06:43] loves playing don't be rough don't give
[06:47] up
[06:48] she's delicate let him chill out for a
[06:52] minute it's a really good idea to break
[06:54] up we're in bunk just play like this
[06:55] every few minutes or every few seconds
[06:58] if necessary to give the dogs a second
[07:00] to calm down and adjust before resuming
[07:02] again you wanna go say hi to the puppy
[07:06] okay it looks like a pattern is
[07:11] developing here Lola keeps jumping on
[07:13] the chair bye mom probably because a
[07:15] nurse's coming on a bit strong and
[07:18] inertia hasn't been taking the hint
[07:19] quite as well as Lola might likes
[07:21] different playstyle than she's used to
[07:24] inertia look at the different move she's
[07:25] having to pull out check out the new
[07:27] moves that inertia has developed here
[07:29] with this new style of dog she's like a
[07:32] turbo guinea pig every dog is different
[07:34] so she has to learn how to play with him
[07:36] on a case-by-case basis and Louis so
[07:39] quick that she's having to adjust her
[07:41] moves a little bit the younger you
[07:43] probably wore ties teaching your dog how
[07:45] to play with other dogs by giving them
[07:47] lots of experience the better once your
[07:49] dog has a broad sample of other dogs who
[07:51] play differently and they have lots of
[07:53] experience with things going well then
[07:56] they're more likely to adjust to other
[07:57] dogs in the future so another pretty
[08:00] good play session for inertia
[08:01] I think she's doing wonderfully time to
[08:03] do some training now she's intrigued by
[08:05] the birds straightaway she doesn't have
[08:06] a lot of exposure to birds and we have a
[08:08] plethora of species of birds at this
[08:12] park we're just saddled a car and you
[08:14] know what look at her she's sitting
[08:15] she's being calm right now looking at
[08:17] these birds from a distance I'm fine to
[08:19] just chill right here and let her take
[08:21] it in especially if she's behaving like
[08:23] this I love it we're gonna continue on
[08:25] now and right now I'm giving you our I
[08:26] don't know if feels like about 7 feet 8
[08:29] feet of leash to work with I'm not gonna
[08:31] let the whole 15 foot leash extend
[08:33] because this is an area where
[08:35] pedestrians could be so I want her to
[08:37] understand that in areas like this
[08:40] sometimes we keep on a shorter leash
[08:42] this is one of my favorite parks to
[08:43] train at because there are so many
[08:45] different birds and distractions to
[08:47] train around lots of different animals
[08:48] you can see inertia is really really
[08:51] focused on all the ground sense I'm
[08:53] gonna see if she'll follow me and
[08:55] abandon the snipping right here if I
[08:57] encourage her to undergo
[08:59] come on wonderful wonderful that's great
[09:03] so at 15 weeks old she's starting to
[09:07] become increasingly reliable on
[09:10] listening to me around ground sense that
[09:13] really have her distracted it's not
[09:14] perfect though that was a success that's
[09:16] what we're looking for
[09:17] look at her body language right now
[09:18] she's like I hear people I'm looking
[09:20] around this is a new area this feels
[09:22] different you can see her ears are back
[09:24] she looks a little more guarded there's
[09:26] a sound in the distance we'll let her
[09:28] explore this very interesting bridge
[09:30] here look at that close-up view of a
[09:32] bicycle good work really well done I'm
[09:36] gonna see the Ducks come on go see you
[09:38] seems to have a healthy respect of the
[09:40] Ducks which is nice not for asking them
[09:42] but checking them out so we're gonna
[09:43] continue on our socialization walk here
[09:46] come on come on okay she doesn't want to
[09:49] you see it's give-and-take like I wanted
[09:51] to keep going on with the walk but then
[09:53] again like this is so new to her and you
[09:55] know even things like that car alarm in
[09:56] the background are important for dogs to
[09:58] experience right now she won't listen to
[10:01] me and I'll demonstrate that in a second
[10:03] and what I'm hoping to do is check in
[10:04] every few minutes with her maybe every
[10:05] 10 minutes and see if she becomes more
[10:07] reliable around these distractions the
[10:10] fact that we have a lot of wind today
[10:11] really amplifies the difficulty getting
[10:14] her to listen to me because there's lots
[10:16] of sense in the air the goal isn't
[10:18] necessarily to get her doing stuff today
[10:21] as much as it is to give her prolong
[10:24] low-level exposure to an environment
[10:27] like this the more we do that the more
[10:29] reliable she'll be in the future of
[10:30] places like this at least that is the
[10:33] hypothesis okay looks like that bird has
[10:36] her attention you see the hair standing
[10:42] up so something threw her off there that
[10:44] just means she's very alert and unsure
[10:46] so we're just gonna let her do what she
[10:48] wants if she wants to retreat she can if
[10:49] she wants to investigate she can if she
[10:51] wants to get distracted and forget about
[10:52] it she
[10:53] it's up to her right now let's start a
[10:55] stopwatch right now and we'll check in
[10:57] every few minutes puppies or
[10:58] inexperienced dogs are less likely to
[11:00] listen in the beginning when they go to
[11:01] a new and/or exciting place so we'll see
[11:04] how she does over an hour or so let's
[11:06] see what our baseline is right now let's
[11:08] see how much she'll listen to me
[11:09] inertia come yes let's go over here yes
[11:19] so she came to me she's taking treats
[11:21] that's good let me see if so listen we
[11:23] said usually a pretty reliable behavior
[11:27] there she was wavering and of course she
[11:29] got up she didn't hold her sit like she
[11:31] would in another type of place that's my
[11:34] cue that she needs to check out this
[11:35] environment a little bit more so that
[11:37] she can become more familiar with it we
[11:39] have put ourself in a position to be
[11:42] able to easily manipulate the distance
[11:44] between any of these distractions should
[11:46] we need to be able to get away from
[11:47] something we can do it very easily
[11:49] I'm not intentionally putting her in a
[11:51] position where she's likely to overly
[11:53] react low level exposure is important at
[11:55] first oh what is it
[11:58] what is she reacting to here you want to
[12:00] go over here what is it what do you want
[12:02] I just want to see what you is pulling
[12:05] towards right here I don't understand
[12:07] this others people over here maybe she
[12:10] just wants to see the people oh okay
[12:13] this she's like what is that now she
[12:15] gets to see that it's a young child over
[12:18] here good girl yes very good oh she's
[12:22] really intrigued won't take the treat
[12:24] right now she's like I'd rather pay
[12:25] attention to that very exciting young
[12:27] lady over there
[12:28] usually when dogs don't take high-value
[12:30] treats in this particular context it
[12:32] means they are far more interested in
[12:33] something in their surroundings in this
[12:35] case people walking by the fix you
[12:37] guessed it prolonged and low level
[12:39] exposure to settings like this so there
[12:42] I thought it was important to kind of
[12:43] call that plan B and let her go
[12:45] investigate whatever was but now I'd
[12:47] like to go back to my plan a and expose
[12:49] her to those birds inertia come inertia
[12:54] come here
[13:01] yeah come here what's mine come on no
[13:07] okay she still is really unresponsive to
[13:09] basic requests right now she's very
[13:11] overwhelmed by the sights smells and
[13:13] sounds let's see where we are in her
[13:15] stopwatch ten minutes now there's a sign
[13:18] that she's starting to relax a little
[13:20] bit she's starting to lie down could
[13:21] offer her some water this is a great way
[13:28] to spend time not only training your dog
[13:30] but just to get clarity in your own mind
[13:33] too it's great to come out to a park
[13:34] like this and just chill out with your
[13:36] dog this is a nice place to Train
[13:37] because you have this bridge so you have
[13:39] people walking over it periodically and
[13:41] they're likely going to ignore her
[13:43] because we're far enough away so she
[13:44] learns there's no payoff for making a
[13:46] big scene every time I see a person go
[13:48] by that's pretty normal nice organic
[13:51] settle this is good
[13:52] we're at 18 minutes now and we have an
[13:55] organic settle she's relaxing he looks
[13:58] content so you're smelling the wind
[13:59] they're gathering information you can
[14:01] just tell by looking into her eyes and
[14:03] watching that nose work that she's
[14:05] heavily stimulated right now 25 minutes
[14:08] now let's see if she's responsive at 25
[14:10] minutes in hey inertia come here what's
[14:16] up there we go got her into me can I get
[14:18] a since yes good girl gonna give her an
[14:23] enthusiastic yes to let her know I love
[14:25] that let's see if she'll do a trick look
[14:26] at that so 25 minutes in I've got her
[14:29] focused enough now to do a basic trick
[14:31] look at me hey up here look at me little
[14:35] tougher to look at me understandably so
[14:38] I'm gonna reward her anyway for doing
[14:40] the trick okay get down good job you can
[14:42] see she's slowly slowly starting to get
[14:45] a little more focused the more time we
[14:48] spend out here see very often we expect
[14:51] our dogs to listen to us just upon
[14:54] arriving in a new environment and that's
[14:56] really hard for them especially when
[14:58] they're young and inexperienced with the
[14:59] world but she seems to be in a relaxed
[15:01] calm state of mind right now let me see
[15:03] if she'll play fetch I don't think she
[15:05] will but let's bring out the toy and see
[15:07] if she's yet interested in playing while
[15:09] in this highly
[15:10] extracting new place I don't immediately
[15:12] expect an Ursa to be interested in this
[15:15] toy
[15:15] let's see them it would be a plus if she
[15:18] was can I get her playing tug with it
[15:19] that's what on the Seas got that there's
[15:23] life here look at that yes oh good
[15:26] see her tug is nowhere near as intense
[15:29] as it is inside the more intensely she
[15:32] plays tug the more into the toy she is
[15:34] and the more into the toy she is the
[15:36] more I can control her in public because
[15:38] I can use it as currency well at first
[15:40] she was a little interested in the toy
[15:42] it looks like that interest has died off
[15:44] a bit as she prefers to observe other
[15:46] things around her way too into her
[15:48] surroundings to really give it much
[15:50] attention right now
[15:51] for those of you who have dogs that
[15:53] won't play outside it's because they're
[15:55] not yet used to being outside it's about
[15:57] 35 minutes in right now let's do a check
[16:00] in and see if she is more responsive see
[16:03] if I can get her back into the toy
[16:04] because she was a little interested
[16:06] before I'm working hard here to get her
[16:08] in a playful mood and it seems to be
[16:10] paying off even if only briefly after
[16:12] all I have to get a single repetition of
[16:14] fetch before I can get a whole fetch
[16:16] session in a place like this magic
[16:19] moment right there getting fetch in this
[16:21] environment is awesome see the second
[16:26] the energy died off she lost interest
[16:28] right there that's completely normal
[16:29] that is a major victory so I'm happy to
[16:32] quit while I'm ahead on that an Ursa
[16:33] please don't please don't eat the ground
[16:36] come on let's go okay real life leave it
[16:42] is getting a lot better I'm able to call
[16:44] her off a lot of minor distractions so
[16:47] I'm appreciating that this is wonderful
[16:52] life is good cuddling with your dog
[16:54] under a tree oh there's a dog up there
[16:57] the dogs got our attention good-looking
[17:00] Doberman healthy reaction yes good job
[17:03] 51 minutes now we've got a stroller
[17:06] coming by right now and we'll see how
[17:09] she reacts to it looking at it and she's
[17:20] like cool
[17:21] that's interesting not barking at it not
[17:24] lunging at it now if your dog were
[17:26] really wound up in the situation like
[17:28] this it would be a good idea to exercise
[17:30] them before you came out to a place like
[17:31] this so we're gonna do one more test to
[17:34] see how responsive she is to training I
[17:35] consider it a victory already with how
[17:37] responsive she's been I don't expect
[17:39] perfect focus far from it right now
[17:41] that's it
[17:42] yes all right good look at me good so
[17:47] good bit more responsive leave it alone
[17:50] look at me
[17:51] yes very good weights hug
[17:56] wait that's there's no way she would
[18:03] have been this focused to do this type
[18:05] of trick just one hour ago okay good job
[18:07] nice work bottom line she's done much
[18:10] better now than she would have an hour
[18:12] ago this just illustrates the point that
[18:14] that low level exposure over time is
[18:16] what's required to get your dog to be
[18:18] more focused in places like this and a
[18:20] little bit brie and I would like to go
[18:21] grocery shopping of course with having a
[18:23] young puppy like inertia leaving them
[18:25] home alone is always a little bit
[18:27] stressful and you want to prepare them
[18:29] for that for example sometimes it really
[18:31] depends on her mood sometimes she's
[18:32] great but very often the second she sees
[18:34] me leave out of this store in the other
[18:36] door she's like wait a minute take me
[18:38] with you so let's see what's going on
[18:40] here you can see that anxiety is still
[18:45] present the moment I walk out of the
[18:47] door
[18:48] this is extremely normal for puppies and
[18:50] patience is required now if we just
[18:52] leave right now this type of whining and
[18:54] crying would likely continue
[18:55] indefinitely until we return let's cover
[18:58] the proper protocol to implement before
[19:00] you leave your new puppy alone before
[19:03] you're really ready to leave your dog
[19:05] alone for significant periods of time
[19:07] you'll want to make sure that they're
[19:09] comfortable being alone for sure
[19:11] periods of time when you are at home so
[19:13] for example right now she's in a pretty
[19:14] settled mindset it seems I'm gonna go
[19:18] over here I'm gonna sit down get some
[19:20] work done and she's generally pretty
[19:22] good when I do that so I'll be over here
[19:24] answering emails and doing YouTube and
[19:27] all that good stuff there's a little
[19:28] anxiety there but she's generally pretty
[19:30] good there she is hidden her settle
[19:32] pretty decent behavior there can't
[19:34] complain she's also very good when I go
[19:37] out of sight for short periods of time
[19:39] so I'm walking over here she can't see
[19:41] me and she tends to behave really well
[19:43] in these circumstances so that's great
[19:46] overnight she's very good this is where
[19:48] she spends the night for a good eight
[19:51] hours and she may have an occasional
[19:53] outburst overnight but generally that
[19:54] subsides very quickly but leaving the
[19:56] house for longer periods of time it's a
[19:58] little different because you don't want
[19:59] your dog to develop this anxiety long
[20:01] story short make sure your dog is
[20:03] comfortable being alone for short
[20:04] periods of time when you're out of sight
[20:06] and you are at home before you expect
[20:09] them to behave when you're not at home
[20:10] next just before you leave you'll want
[20:13] to provide sufficient exercise so that
[20:16] they're likely to get that pent-up
[20:17] energy out of them and they're more
[20:19] likely to relax calm down and maybe even
[20:21] take a nap while you're gone
[20:23] tiring them out physically is important
[20:25] but keeping your dog mentally stimulated
[20:27] is not optional you have to really keep
[20:30] them engaged so working on some basic
[20:32] training just before you got to go
[20:33] somewhere this first several times can
[20:35] be really beneficial look at me good
[20:39] notice I'm timing my training session
[20:42] post exercise she's got that edge off
[20:44] she's more likely to listen less likely
[20:46] to be bitey and amped up wait yes
[20:49] perfect wave yes she's in a more relaxed
[20:57] state of mind now I'm going to retest
[20:59] walking out of the door and see how she
[21:01] does
[21:02] settle good see her naturally going to
[21:05] this settle I'll be right back okay
[21:09] good job physical and mental stimulation
[21:13] really does make a huge difference here
[21:15] I mean you can see she's noticeably less
[21:17] anxious now for those of you that have
[21:18] to get up early and go to work this is
[21:20] what you'll want to do before work to
[21:22] reduce your dog's anxiety exercise them
[21:24] train them and when you are at home get
[21:26] them comfortable with being alone for
[21:28] significant periods of time work up to
[21:30] that of course I want inertia to be
[21:32] engaged while I'm gone I've been giving
[21:34] inertia the beef tendon cheese she's
[21:35] really been enjoying these so this is
[21:38] also likely to keep her nice and happy
[21:40] while we're gone I'm gonna have a link
[21:42] to these in the description below so I'm
[21:43] gonna be like nonchalant and just kind
[21:46] of slip out the door right now she's
[21:48] preoccupied with her beef tendon chew so
[21:51] far her pup for beef tendon is doing the
[21:53] trick it really keeps her engaged we've
[21:55] been gone about maybe 7 minutes this is
[21:57] what inertia is up to she just actually
[22:00] right ii went into a settle it's like
[22:02] she could detect we're here what do you
[22:05] think I don't even want to go shopping I
[22:07] just want to sit here and look at a
[22:08] nurse all day she's passed out right now
[22:10] so all looks good we've been away from
[22:12] the house in what 12 minutes now we're
[22:15] checking out now and inertia is just
[22:18] passed out still asleep she's doing
[22:21] great it seems as though we adequately
[22:23] prepared her for at least this time of
[22:25] being alone I can't wait to get back to
[22:27] Sierra I think I'm the one who's having
[22:29] separation anxiety here she notices that
[22:31] I'm here and I'm just gonna go continue
[22:34] to unload I'm not gonna make a big scene
[22:35] I'm not gonna go up to her and encourage
[22:37] her to be excited even though I really
[22:39] want to but just because I'm here
[22:43] doesn't mean that we're gonna get all
[22:44] crazy and start jumping embark in
[22:46] inertia and our older dog even getting
[22:48] along better and better and I've been
[22:49] giving one-on-one attention to inertia
[22:51] mostly on walks
[22:53] but it's time to include Indy in the
[22:54] action and of course adding the
[22:56] distraction of having a nurses best
[22:58] friend on a walk is a significant one so
[23:01] when these walks I'm tolerant when
[23:02] inertia doesn't always give me her
[23:04] attention hey leave it alone
[23:07] inertia come up let's go leave it there
[23:10] we go so there was an example of a real
[23:12] life leave it there was some type of
[23:14] debris on the ground that she was trying
[23:15] to get out and I was able to get her to
[23:16] leave it a little nurse checkup
[23:20] come on there we go good job yes perfect
[23:24] good girl so that was win call at 30
[23:28] feet away so we have dogs in the
[23:30] distance over here she's likely to
[23:33] notice them by scent at some point
[23:39] pretty healthy reaction seeing him from
[23:42] a distance good I love how she hangs
[23:43] back like that inertia good girl
[23:46] low-level exposure to dogs and
[23:49] distractions that's my general gameplan
[23:52] with the young dog starting to rain so I
[23:56] guess we should get going
[23:58] good job inertia you too Indy after a
[24:02] walk like this is a great time to let
[24:04] inertia have some supervised off leash
[24:06] time in the house because she's gotten
[24:08] that initial layer of crazy energy out
[24:10] so she's a little more likely to be well
[24:12] behaved inertia is still at that young
[24:14] really exciting age where she likes to
[24:17] continually insist that India are much
[24:19] older a 13 year old dog play with her
[24:21] all the time and he doesn't want to play
[24:23] all the time and I don't blame her since
[24:26] they just had a walk they've gotten a
[24:28] lot of their energy out I played fetch
[24:29] with inertia earlier in the day so she's
[24:32] well exercised I want them kind of just
[24:34] existing together in the hope that maybe
[24:36] they'll just settle down exist in the
[24:38] same room and not play and check that
[24:41] out they are existing nicely together
[24:44] they're both relaxed good job inertia
[24:47] good job indeed
[24:52] it's so much fun to see how these two
[24:55] are learning to play together over time
[24:56] even though Indy is 13 years old she
[24:59] still has some pep in her step you can
[25:01] sell buy in Dee's body language that
[25:02] even though she's getting in her face a
[25:04] little bit it's still play for overall
[25:06] body language suggests the playful
[25:08] mindset her tail wagging or hitting that
[25:10] play bow poking her butt up in the air
[25:12] same with inertia as well he looks very
[25:15] playful
[25:16] download the free new pup bird app and
[25:18] check their awesome lines of treats and
[25:20] shoes I'll have all the links in the

[00:00] I don't know how to get down so she's
[00:01] barking because she wants to get back
[00:03] here I'm Zack George I trained dogs and
[00:09] this is my new dog inertia I'm taking
[00:12] you along as I train her from day one
[00:14] you can start from the beginning or pick
[00:16] up anywhere and start learning
[00:18] welcome to the dog training experience
[00:20] today we'll see what it's like living on
[00:22] the road with a four month old puppy
[00:24] having a new puppy has reminded me how
[00:26] important it is not to ever run out of
[00:28] puppy food and it always seems to be an
[00:30] inconvenient time every time you run out
[00:32] of puppy food get your pets food the
[00:34] 21st century way by going to pet Flo all
[00:37] you do is choose your pet's food and

[00:42] all of your emergency runs to the store

[00:46] service easy to try enter code Zac 30 to
[00:49] get $10 off your first three automatic
[00:52] shipments I'll have a link below today
[00:53] is an exciting day because I'm going to
[00:55] take my dog inertia to Atlanta that's my
[00:58] hometown where I have lots of family
[01:00] because my family hasn't seen my dog is
[01:01] a puppy yet
[01:02] so I thought this was a good opportunity
[01:03] to show you guys kind of how I prepare
[01:05] for a road trip the things that I bring
[01:07] in order to keep inertia happy I've got
[01:09] some different leashes this is a 15 foot
[01:11] leash to give me some options because I
[01:13] don't want to let her just have the run
[01:15] of the house and houses that she's never
[01:16] been in before I've got a 6 foot leash
[01:18] when I need to keep her more contained
[01:20] and assuming we can find a nice park to
[01:23] work at I've got a nice long retractable
[01:25] leash to give her some free roaming
[01:27] space on those longer walks to where she
[01:29] can just check out the environment and
[01:31] explore two bowls one for food one for
[01:33] water a nice fun unconventional ball one
[01:36] of her favorite plush toys I think she's
[01:43] ready to go right now I'm just going to
[01:44] ignore that barking for now she heard
[01:47] the squeak can I have a saddle excuse me
[01:51] while I try to get this barking under
[01:52] control
[01:54] relax good girl since she's just under 4
[01:58] months of age she's gonna need lots of
[02:00] things to chew on so I've got this I got
[02:02] a little plastic thing I've got these
[02:04] deep tendon shoes so she should have a
[02:06] decent variety as far as currency goes
[02:08] for food I'm gonna be bringing cheese
[02:12] can you settle thank you the good thing
[02:16] about these little packs is that they
[02:18] keep well for traveling whereas keeping
[02:19] real meat with you
[02:20] might be kind of tough I also have some
[02:22] other dog treats that you might like of
[02:24] course I've got my clicker got a brush
[02:26] here to make sure she looks good for
[02:27] everybody got wipes for to keep her
[02:29] clean of course if she has an accident
[02:31] we have to be fully prepared for that so
[02:33] we've got stain remover and paper towels
[02:35] and a couple of ways to transport her
[02:37] water so a bigger water jug and one of
[02:39] these these are great right here you can
[02:41] squeeze it out and you have a bowl of
[02:43] water everywhere you go and of course
[02:44] we've got her food too so that's it I'm
[02:46] ready to get on the road in my personal
[02:48] experience most dogs tend to really just
[02:51] get infinite eyes by the road and go to
[02:53] sleep inertia has been sleeping pretty
[02:56] much the whole time we haven't heard
[02:57] much out of her at all and the reason
[02:59] for that is that we've exercised her
[03:01] she's had some training today and she
[03:02] probably feels content hopefully she'll
[03:04] sleep through the night then that's
[03:06] gonna be interesting we're at a Tesla
[03:07] supercharging stop right now and I'm
[03:10] gonna show you more about how we travel
[03:11] with a dog
[03:12] we have inertia back here you can see
[03:14] that she is in her travel carrier this
[03:16] is how I feel safest transporting a dog
[03:19] having a dedicated crate for them is
[03:21] especially to the puppy the way that I
[03:22] like to do it waits the nurse has been
[03:25] doing really good on wait at the crate
[03:26] okay come on good girl now you'll want
[03:29] to make sure that your dog's harness is
[03:30] super secure on them because you don't
[03:32] have the safety net when you're
[03:34] traveling we double-checked hers to make
[03:35] sure it is there's not a fenced area
[03:37] you're often by an area where there's a
[03:39] lot of cars good girl she went pee
[03:42] that's good we're stopping every couple
[03:44] of hours because we have a dog that
[03:45] isn't quite four months old yet you want
[03:48] to give them ample opportunities to go
[03:50] so every couple of hours is pretty good
[03:51] if you have an older dog you might be
[03:53] able to travel for longer periods of
[03:54] time when you're taking a road trip you
[03:56] have a lot on your mind and maybe it
[03:58] might be easy to forget to give your dog
[04:00] some water so pack extra water with you
[04:02] and offer it to them at every break some
[04:05] dogs get carsick and they get kind of
[04:06] queasy when
[04:07] you travel if that's your dog give them
[04:08] a light meal so that there are less
[04:10] likely to lose their breakfast I
[04:13] exercised inertia before the trip but if
[04:15] you have a high-energy dog or a fairly
[04:17] energetic one its if at all possible do
[04:19] some playtime with them at your stop
[04:20] maybe some fetch if you can find an area
[04:22] or certainly a short walk might be a
[04:24] good idea that'll also encourage better
[04:26] behavior on the trip if they tend to get
[04:28] a little antsy in the car she's still
[04:30] under that critical socialization age of
[04:32] eight months of age so every new
[04:34] experience every new place is a welcomed
[04:36] opportunity when you have a dog this
[04:38] young today we stopped two or three
[04:40] times that's two or three new places in
[04:41] one day all right put her back in there
[04:45] and she's gonna go back to sleep it
[04:46] looks like nice and comfy so I'm gonna
[04:48] be staying with my dad and his whole
[04:50] basement is available for us hopefully
[04:52] that works out I've never stayed in this
[04:54] basement
[04:55] [Music]
[04:56] okay we've made it to Atlanta and my dad
[04:59] is extremely anxious to meet inertia for
[05:01] the very first time however inertia not
[05:04] so much she looks a little nervous of my
[05:06] dad right now she's like why is this guy
[05:07] on the ground over here I'm trying to
[05:09] encourage my dad to be calm as his
[05:11] enthusiasm is met by skepticism from
[05:13] inertia turns out dad training is
[05:15] tougher than dog training let's go when
[05:19] you get down that throws are off I think
[05:20] your excitement really makes her nervous
[05:22] it looks like you really want to say hi
[05:24] dad's more excited than she is look just
[05:27] let her come up and smell you show there
[05:28] she goes that's good she's jumping while
[05:32] I generally discouraged my dog jumping
[05:34] on people in this case it's a sign that
[05:36] she's more comfortable always consider
[05:38] its context when your dog is behaving a
[05:40] certain way she's good she just needs a
[05:44] minute sometimes okay she loves her
[05:46] grandpa chef now let me introduce her to
[05:49] this new place a little bit more
[05:50] formally maybe we should give her a
[05:52] bigger leash right now to explore since
[05:53] she's been cooped up all day this is
[05:55] very encouraging she's playing fetch in
[05:57] a new state usually dogs are too
[05:59] preoccupied in new places to focus on
[06:01] games like fetch which would be just
[06:03] fine but this shows she is capable of
[06:05] focusing on me in some new outdoor
[06:07] places that was pretty good cuz I mean
[06:09] she's never experienced grass like this
[06:11] I mean even small things like a
[06:12] different species of Atlanta grass can
[06:14] be distracting factors in your training
[06:16] the first thing I really want to do is
[06:18] show her the proper place to go potty
[06:19] which is either out here
[06:20] but she's gonna be going in the back a
[06:22] lot so let's go there - this is her
[06:24] potty area back here and I'm gonna let
[06:27] manure get familiar with it smell around
[06:28] she seems to be really interested in the
[06:31] smell of the tree and rather than
[06:32] waiting until you think they absolutely
[06:34] have to go it's a good idea to get them
[06:36] nice and comfortable when you have some
[06:38] time to show them okay so she's doing
[06:40] well outside let's go see what's going
[06:42] on inside this is a nurses sleeping area
[06:45] over here I'm just kidding are used to
[06:46] this crate right here because it's
[06:48] smaller than the one that she usually
[06:50] uses it's really important to make sure
[06:52] that you control your puppy's
[06:54] environment all of the time but
[06:56] especially in new places you can think
[06:58] of a crate like this as a crib for a
[07:00] baby it keeps them safe and out of
[07:02] trouble but we've set it up really close
[07:03] to where we sleep so that we can keep an
[07:05] eye on or obviously keep her from waking
[07:07] my dad up upstairs and you might also
[07:10] notice that we're right by the door so I
[07:11] can easily let her out in the middle of
[07:13] the night if I have to or first thing in
[07:15] the morning or whatever she has to go
[07:17] out but I want to be mindful in the
[07:18] amount of time that she's spending in
[07:20] the crate as well even though I'm out of
[07:21] town I'm here to visit family I can't
[07:23] forget about her I've got to make sure
[07:24] she's getting her exercise I can't just
[07:26] leave her in here while I go off and
[07:27] visit I'm hoping to give her lots of
[07:29] exposure to people and also get her
[07:31] comfortable in the crate when I
[07:32] definitely need my own time but so far
[07:35] she's doing a great job good job okay
[07:38] come on I'm about to take inertia on a
[07:40] walk but I want to do some warm-up
[07:42] training drills with her we've been
[07:43] working on heal indoors she's not ready
[07:45] to do this outside I love how she's
[07:47] looking at me they're here I'm simply
[07:48] proofing getting her attention a basic
[07:51] look at me is a great way to measure if
[07:52] she's in a teachable mindset leave it
[07:55] yes this way yes
[08:00] look at me good yes yes notice how she's
[08:07] holding that stand we've been working on
[08:08] that and she's not automatically going
[08:10] into the sit look at me we're not
[08:12] focused on heel now now I'm just focused
[08:14] on making sure she'll walk on leash in
[08:16] this new place doing a good job
[08:18] things are looking so good in this new
[08:20] place it's wonderful not having these
[08:22] additional family distractions around
[08:24] right now hey Dad how are you yeah come
[08:27] on come say good morning to YouTube and
[08:31] now she does tend to pee when she gets
[08:33] excited yep right there we've been
[08:34] dealing with this excitement urination
[08:37] right here inertia has been struggling
[08:39] struggling with excitement urination
[08:41] it's really common with puppies when
[08:42] they get excited they just can't control
[08:44] their excitement they start peeing
[08:45] everywhere
[08:46] that's something typically dogs will
[08:47] outgrow but in the meantime you can take
[08:50] them outside before they're likely to
[08:51] get excited encourage your readers to
[08:54] greet them a little less excitedly of
[08:56] course my dad doesn't listen to me at
[08:58] all
[08:58] but it's not really a potty training
[09:00] issue because the behavior is completely
[09:02] involuntary no doubt having dad here is
[09:04] making my training more difficult for
[09:06] inertia as she is distracted but this is
[09:09] the real world so let's take advantage
[09:11] of having this distraction present have
[09:13] enough - can you turn out here oh well
[09:15] he loves a grandpa there's still work to
[09:18] do let's go out into the wild and do
[09:20] some training now I've driven to a local
[09:23] park here to give inertia some room to
[09:25] walk and check out the new place this is
[09:28] less of a training walk and more of a
[09:29] explore and have a good time walk hence
[09:32] the retractable leash over here if you
[09:34] are gonna use a retractable leash don't
[09:36] be obnoxious about it when you know that
[09:39] there's gonna be people around make sure
[09:40] you shorten it so your dogs not just
[09:42] running up to people oh there's a dog
[09:43] coming up over here so let's go over
[09:45] here because I don't want to create an
[09:47] excited situation but this is nice and
[09:49] shaded this gives her room to explore
[09:51] ready go get it
[09:53] her playtime outside is still quite
[09:56] intermittent it really just depends on
[09:57] her mood I expect that to change with
[09:59] time though that's really typical of
[10:01] dogs regardless of age early in their
[10:04] training with fetch they're less
[10:06] interested in it than they will be in
[10:07] the future when they start playing fetch
[10:09] so their interest slowly intensifies
[10:11] over time assuming that you continue
[10:14] try and work with them if I catch her in
[10:15] a moment where she's feeling playful
[10:16] then I'll try and encourage her to play
[10:18] fetch otherwise I'm happy for her to
[10:20] just explore the great land of Georgia I
[10:22] found a basketball court here that's
[10:25] nice and fenced in would have closed
[10:26] this door see if I can get her running
[10:30] around of course this is a rough
[10:31] pavement so I don't want to encourage
[10:32] rough play too much inertia come on
[10:35] what's this get it come on you want to
[10:42] play okay so I thought I'd try and play
[10:44] in here since we have this enclosed area
[10:47] but look still doesn't want to play at
[10:49] the toy when we say dog is
[10:50] overstimulated this is what we're
[10:52] talking about they're just really really
[10:54] interested in everything around them and
[10:56] I can't underestimate the importance of
[10:57] really satisfying your dog mentally and
[10:59] physically when you're out of town with
[11:01] them because remember the most
[11:02] significant way that you can throw off a
[11:04] dog is to dramatically change their
[11:06] surroundings and environment and when
[11:08] you go to a new house and a new city
[11:10] with new smells and new people and a new
[11:13] routine and everything that can really
[11:15] cause a dog to act unpleasantly
[11:17] uncharacteristically by letting her
[11:20] explore by getting her energy out that
[11:22] we keep her training routine up she's
[11:24] likely to adjust much better we have a
[11:26] bit of a spark here she's taking an
[11:28] interest in a tennis ball so that's
[11:29] exciting good sometimes switching up the
[11:33] toy health the goal is to be able to get
[11:36] her to play fetch anywhere at any time
[11:38] and time will tell if we ever get there
[11:41] good yes ready go get it people so we'll
[11:47] stop before she gets bored we'll
[11:49] continue on our walk now so these walks
[11:51] are kind of a combination of walk
[11:53] explore let's see if you want to play
[11:54] check out new things new dogs new people
[11:57] at a distance there's just a lot of
[11:59] things to kind of consider on these
[12:00] walks I think so she's doing really well
[12:02] with that weed whacker a few weeks ago
[12:04] she was really scared of those that's
[12:06] encouraging yeah now that she's like
[12:08] taking a walk she's kind of gotten some
[12:10] energy out this is a good time to work
[12:12] on some of her basics let's see how
[12:14] responsive she is in this new highly
[12:17] distracting place remember we don't have
[12:18] pine straw like this where I'm from
[12:20] every little thing like pine cones
[12:23] completely new variable to her and
[12:25] they're quite fragrant to us I can only
[12:27] how she smells and processes these
[12:29] things but I do know one thing I do know
[12:31] that when we give our dogs exercise and
[12:34] attention that they're more likely to
[12:36] pay attention to us than if we don't
[12:37] what's this you want to treat can I have
[12:40] a sit
[12:40] oh very good so I love that I love that
[12:43] we're getting a sit out here in a public
[12:45] environment okay come here right here
[12:47] I'm just doing some of the more easy
[12:49] things that she knows like sit and calm
[12:51] I'm having to use a treat right now I
[12:53] think if I weren't using treats she
[12:54] wouldn't be very responsive it's
[12:56] important to use a good currency for an
[12:58] extended period of time let's try that
[13:00] heel in this outdoor environment see if
[13:01] I can get her into that heel position
[13:03] come here
[13:04] what this yes good holding the stand all
[13:10] right yes good very good
[13:14] look at me okay yes all to far too far
[13:17] come here wait
[13:23] do it wait okay yes
[13:27] look at me yes
[13:33] look at me yeah sit good actually ask
[13:38] for the sit now so really good this
[13:40] might not look like much but just taking
[13:42] these small steps in this environment
[13:44] keeping her on my left side doing this
[13:47] general training is a really good sign
[13:48] for a dog that isn't even 4 months old
[13:50] yet and with the weed whacker in the
[13:52] background too it's time to go catch up
[13:53] with my sister's boyfriend upon arriving
[13:56] a nurse I had a barking outburst that
[13:57] was pretty challenging to quell so in
[13:59] this case I elected to manage her by
[14:02] simply picking her up and carrying her
[14:03] inside rather than dedicating a full-on
[14:05] training session to this we finally made
[14:08] it inside we got inertia quiet I'm
[14:10] hanging out over here at my sister's
[14:12] house and just really trying to show
[14:13] inertia how to be good and behave well
[14:16] when in new places I love this position
[14:18] I love that she's relaxed here so I'm
[14:20] gonna say ok give her a piece of meat
[14:22] and I'll just continue to acknowledge
[14:24] the calm ideal babe this is my sister's
[14:27] boyfriend
[14:28] he likes to periodically we're dead cool
[14:30] mask whatever to each their own oh look
[14:33] at that
[14:33] yep that's a mask okay an Ursa is thrown
[14:39] off by that can you give me a sense why
[14:42] don't we take the mask off for a second
[14:44] and then let her see that there's a
[14:45] human in there that's gonna trip her out
[14:46] look at that okay I know not much
[14:48] different huh and now maybe walk over
[14:50] slowly see if she reacts no she yeah
[14:52] she's like I know you I remember you
[14:54] from me a few minutes ago she's okay
[14:56] when he's not wearing the mask putting
[14:58] on in front of her and let's see what
[14:59] that does so interesting and now call
[15:02] her over yeah make some move your usual
[15:06] yeah exactly I mean just like that okay
[15:08] so now it's like oh I get it sometimes
[15:10] humans wear masks right right and here
[15:14] I'm gonna tolerate the jumping just
[15:15] because she was scared I like that she's
[15:17] not scared that is more important to me
[15:19] than the fact that she's behaving a
[15:20] little wildly so if you ever want to
[15:22] take your dog to a convention and you
[15:24] want to socialize your dog with people
[15:26] wearing masks maybe you're at cosplay or
[15:28] at Halloween or you want them to be nice
[15:31] to burglars oh is that not right they
[15:36] fun visit with my sister now we're on
[15:39] the way to North Point Mall to see my
[15:41] dad my dad has a jewelry store I thought
[15:43] this would be a good opportunity to show
[15:45] inertia
[15:46] an indoor retail environment so we'll
[15:48] see how she does I'm gonna obviously
[15:50] give her a potty break before we go into
[15:52] a shopping mall because it's no fun if
[15:53] your dog is peeing or pooping inside of
[15:56] them all now that I've instructed my dad
[15:58] to be nice and calm when he greets
[15:59] inertia since she pees when excited
[16:01] we'll see how that goes
[16:04] there's the pee look at that okay so
[16:07] that didn't go quite as planned oh well
[16:09] we're coming in the back way you know
[16:11] through the secret entrance into the
[16:12] shopping mall here's a great opportunity
[16:14] to introduce an Ursa to the staff you
[16:16] understand hi yes I like how she's
[16:31] settling kind of quickly so that's good
[16:33] yet another new place a completely
[16:35] different environment and she seems to
[16:36] be going into her settle after just a
[16:39] few moments so I want to reinforce that
[16:41] give her a little bit of meats the idea
[16:43] is you take your dog to so many places
[16:44] that they all just become normal like
[16:46] new places or just the normal thing we
[16:48] do so there's no need to act really
[16:50] crazy just cuz you go to a new place
[16:51] environment causes dogs to act more
[16:53] uncharacteristically than anything else
[16:55] just about and so now we're gonna go
[16:57] from this back area into the pretty
[16:59] jewelry part and see how she does so
[17:03] yeah you can see how she's uninterested
[17:05] in my dad all of a sudden there because
[17:07] there's new smells new things let's go
[17:10] see what else we can see look at that
[17:13] good I love the way she's reacting just
[17:16] because we're out here it's not the same
[17:18] as back there everything's a little bit
[17:20] different she wants to check out all of
[17:21] the new stuff going on let's see if
[17:23] she'll do something basic like whiteout
[17:26] good so that's a sign that she's not so
[17:29] overwhelmed that she can't pay attention
[17:30] to me good
[17:31] nice can you give me a leave it's good
[17:36] inertia is really adjusting well well
[17:39] she was but that's gonna be normal for
[17:41] puppies they're going to relax they're
[17:43] gonna get up they're gonna smell around
[17:44] but as long as her overall behavior is
[17:46] decent and she's behaving politely I'm
[17:48] happy let's go check out one of my
[17:50] favorite spots in Atlanta today I wanted
[17:53] to take inertia to Piedmont Park
[17:54] Piedmont Park is one of my favorite
[17:56] parks in Atlanta real sentimental to me
[17:59] it's a wonderful place to spend time
[18:01] with your dog that person is just
[18:03] running come on this way she's getting
[18:09] thrown off less and less by like joggers
[18:10] and bikers and things but she still
[18:12] reacts here and there and that just
[18:14] underscores why it's so important to
[18:16] continually get out there and show your
[18:18] dogs lots of different things so they
[18:19] get a broad sample and get a clue as to
[18:23] how the world works
[18:24] you might notice I have her on the
[18:25] retractable leash today I have it really
[18:27] restricted but since we're in a pretty
[18:29] open park I want to give her lots of
[18:31] room to explore I use a retractable
[18:33] leash in a very specific way not for
[18:35] leash training or anything like that but
[18:37] I'm trying to get her just into an open
[18:39] grassy area to smell run around in you
[18:42] know that sort of thing she's pulling
[18:44] right now I'm not too concerned with
[18:45] that as it's more important that she
[18:47] explore this big lawn back here was the
[18:50] site of a frisbee dog competition I did
[18:52] years ago every time I look at this lawn
[18:54] that's what I think of you're not
[18:55] technically allowed to play frisbee with
[18:57] your dog over here but I used to do it
[18:58] all the time you know dogs are supposed
[19:00] to be on leash which is a good idea but
[19:03] my dog was really trained and she
[19:05] listened to me and she didn't go up to
[19:06] other dogs and bother people the most
[19:08] wonderful sight to play frisbee with
[19:10] your dog in all of Atlanta and
[19:12] unfortunately you're not allowed it's so
[19:15] far as much as playing frisbee with my
[19:17] dogs was a big part of my past with my
[19:19] dog something I really love doing I
[19:21] haven't done it with inertia until this
[19:23] very moment really I've shown her the
[19:25] frisbee before but I've not really done
[19:26] a lesson or sugar how to grab the
[19:29] frisbee and right now I'm loving this
[19:31] this is great because she was tuning out
[19:33] but she looks so into it right now it's
[19:35] like she can detect she's in frisbee
[19:38] playing territory so let's have a little
[19:40] impromptu lesson here now I do have to
[19:42] admit that if I had planned this frisbee
[19:44] lesson for you guys I would have her on
[19:46] a 15 foot lead rather than trying to use
[19:49] this retractable leash but it'll work
[19:51] for a brief lesson the first thing that
[19:52] you should do when you're teaching your
[19:54] dog to play frisbee is teach them how to
[19:56] grab it from the rim we call it a take
[19:58] so let's see what's this
[20:02] see how she's not grabbing it at the rim
[20:03] she's going above she's like trying to
[20:06] grab it here she's like how do I grab
[20:07] this thing yes good very good
[20:11] it's not necessarily intuitive for a dog
[20:12] to just bite it like that look look how
[20:15] she's trying to get control of it by
[20:17] putting her head under it doesn't quite
[20:19] know what to do what's this but I don't
[20:20] want to release interest yeah
[20:22] god what is this seed eating it up from
[20:28] underneath is that how I do it
[20:29] so she's not really feeling the take it
[20:31] I don't want her to lose interest in the
[20:32] training session by dwelling on take it
[20:34] she wants to chase something so I'll
[20:36] adhere to her desires right now it's so
[20:40] rolling the frisbee like this can also
[20:42] encourage her to grab it by the rim as
[20:43] well because dogs don't know how to
[20:45] catch a frisbee out of the air just cuz
[20:47] we think it should seem illogical I
[20:49] can't even tell you how happy I am that
[20:51] we're doing her first frisbee lesson
[20:53] right here if we didn't plan it that way
[20:55] but I can't resist what's that
[20:57] youko good notice how I'm also keeping
[21:01] her short range I'm not throwing it
[21:03] across the field nice work good so she's
[21:07] chasing it now let's see if she can
[21:08] chase it pick it up and return it again
[21:11] we're not gonna throw it yet she's not
[21:12] ready for that
[21:13] hey inertia good looks like she lost
[21:19] interest in it she's distracted by a
[21:21] runner coming up this is completely
[21:23] normal especially in a distracting place
[21:25] like this looks like our Frisbee session
[21:27] is getting invaded by helicopters and
[21:29] more pedestrians and dogs walking by I
[21:32] know what is that those are people
[21:35] working a letter satisfy my curiosity a
[21:38] little bit see her pilo erection see her
[21:39] hair standing up just means she's unsure
[21:41] she's caught off guard she's like I
[21:43] wasn't expecting all those people to
[21:45] come over here right now overall even
[21:46] though she's barking she doesn't seem
[21:48] too concerned she's kind of taking steps
[21:49] towards them and everything this is what
[21:51] I like to refer to as sparking the Flint
[21:53] when you're teaching a new game like
[21:55] this we're really trying to get a big
[21:57] fire going but she loses interest when
[21:59] we're sparking the Flint therefore we
[22:01] have to take a step back and try again
[22:02] later we'll take a five-minute break
[22:04] we'll see if she wants to revisit it or
[22:06] not okay it's been a few minutes let's
[22:08] see how things are going now
[22:10] oh oh you see that introducing it a
[22:14] different way
[22:15] you know sometimes makes a difference a
[22:19] really good attempt right there see it's
[22:22] so frustrating to pick up for a dog in
[22:24] the beginning oh look at that
[22:28] yes good come on that's what I'm talking
[22:30] about there we go good war and if she
[22:33] wants to play tug I'll reward her or it
[22:36] looks like she's really into the chaser
[22:37] aspect of the game right now so I'll
[22:40] give her that look at her try to pick it
[22:46] up good yes yes good yes come on good
[23:02] girl go get come on come on okay good
[23:10] job take a break so general interest in
[23:12] the frisbee is well within range I'm
[23:15] happy with this and we sought to teach
[23:17] her how to do the take it she's showing
[23:19] promise there but I like that she's
[23:20] chasing it in the future I'm sure we'll
[23:22] cover her catching it in the air but
[23:24] she's not ready for that just yet
[23:25] good job inertia this was a great
[23:27] session meanwhile back at the house
[23:29] there's more training to do inertia has
[23:31] yet to have a formal lesson on going up
[23:33] and down stairs when you travel what
[23:36] they're going to families house or
[23:37] whatever you're going to encounter
[23:38] things that you realize hey I didn't
[23:40] anticipate that with inertia here's a
[23:42] good example this is a fairly steep
[23:44] staircase for her she checked this out
[23:46] and she was like you know I don't know
[23:48] about this this looks a little weird my
[23:49] goal is to show her how to go down these
[23:51] stairs comfortably so we'll see how she
[23:53] does you can see she's like whoa I don't
[23:55] know see how she took a step I don't
[23:57] quite know how to handle this this is
[23:59] weird wait a minute come back here I
[24:03] don't know how to get to you my
[24:05] intention is to walk her through this
[24:07] rather than starting up here I think it
[24:09] might be smarter to start down at the
[24:11] bottom of the stairs just so she can
[24:13] kind of get the muscle memory intact and
[24:15] understand how to do stairs so let's go
[24:17] to the bottom of the stairs and see if
[24:18] we can get her taking the stairs like a
[24:19] champ I'm just gonna lure her yes good
[24:22] job you got it so
[24:23] she's good at putting two paws up can we
[24:25] get her up here is he going up the
[24:27] stairs she's a little bit more
[24:28] comfortable oh look at that I mean so
[24:29] she's going up she'll go all day long
[24:31] but inertia what about you gonna come
[24:33] back down I don't know how to get down
[24:35] so she's barking because she wants to
[24:37] get back here good very good so I'm
[24:43] starting at the bottom because I think
[24:44] it'll be less daunting and here I'm just
[24:47] lowering her with the treat come on
[24:49] what's this yes good she kind of did a
[24:54] step in the right direction there so I
[24:56] don't let her know that I appreciate
[24:57] that okay come on yes look at that she's
[25:02] gonna go real slow what you don't want
[25:04] to do is force your dog yeah good girl
[25:10] you did it that was great
[25:12] are you gonna give her a big reward so
[25:14] she took like the bottom two stairs
[25:15] nice and easy yeah good job so it's kind
[25:20] of like when she's really at the top
[25:22] it's overwhelming but my hope is wife
[25:24] taking the time to do this one step at a
[25:27] time that shall come to adjust to it
[25:29] good and see I'm here to spot her in the
[25:33] event she slips you know you do have to
[25:34] be careful it is a new movement for a
[25:36] puppy to be going up and down stairs
[25:38] this is where building trust really
[25:40] comes in with your dog you really want
[25:42] to build trust with them so they know
[25:44] they can trust you you'll find that when
[25:45] you prioritize building communication
[25:47] with your dog they catch on to a lot of
[25:49] things like this really quick because
[25:50] you have this common language and the
[25:52] trust that you focus on building with
[25:54] one another really compounds to give you
[25:57] success on lessons like this I think
[25:59] we're ready now to see if she can take
[26:01] the whole staircase let's see how it
[26:02] goes oh look at that boys she can haul
[26:05] up them alright good girl no can you
[26:10] come down come on yes
[26:17] good yeah good girl
[26:21] did you see how methodical she was she's
[26:23] just learning inertia that was awesome
[26:26] it may not look like much but dogs don't
[26:28] automatically know how to go up and down
[26:30] the stairs I think this was a really
[26:32] productive lesson I'll continue to
[26:33] monitor her and make sure she does it
[26:35] safely
[26:36] that's your leash you don't want that
[26:38] staying in a new place also gives you
[26:40] the option to train in a new environment
[26:41] and it's still an indoor environment so
[26:43] it's pretty easy but it's one that she's
[26:45] not used to training in so I'm gonna
[26:47] work on some of her basic training I
[26:49] know we've been hitting settle quite a
[26:50] bit in these episodes but that's because
[26:52] I want her to be able to settle tune out
[26:54] and relax on hue in future environments
[26:58] in future new environments I should say
[27:00] good so I'm working on that right now
[27:02] she's on a long lead just so I have
[27:04] general control look at me good job
[27:07] settled so I'm gonna turn my back on her
[27:10] very often when you turn your back on
[27:11] your dog like that they're like oh gosh
[27:13] I better go chase them I've been really
[27:15] focusing on assuming a lot of different
[27:17] positions good I'm gonna reiterate
[27:19] settle to her just in case there's some
[27:21] confusion I'm gonna go up to her and
[27:23] then go back down the hall over here
[27:26] good job
[27:27] pretty reliable in this calm nice easy
[27:30] setup training session let me try out of
[27:33] sight right here real quick settle oh
[27:38] did you see that out of sight we haven't
[27:41] done what's training with that so that's
[27:43] something we can work on settle Oh
[27:48] oh wow so she's really sensitive the
[27:50] moment I go out of sight that's cuz dogs
[27:52] like to be nearest saddle and to slow
[27:54] down my pace a little bit
[27:55] the reason I'm being so deliberate right
[27:57] here is I'm sensing the early stages of
[28:00] frustration from her cuz she's like what
[28:02] did I do wrong I don't understand
[28:05] look at me wait you need to focus on her
[28:09] now I'm just gonna watch her I'm not
[28:10] gonna turn my back on her because that
[28:12] makes it harder easy
[28:14] wait okay I need to take another step
[28:18] back so I'm pushing it way too much set
[28:30] settle sometimes you have to break down
[28:32] your training into smaller goals than
[28:34] you originally plan for here I'm
[28:36] pre-empting likely failure points by
[28:38] acknowledging success before she breaks
[28:40] her settled settled yes nice work
[28:49] look at me settled turning my back this
[28:59] time settle
[29:05] yes so
[29:16] yes okay good job very good she got
[29:20] excited I got excited there so that's
[29:22] how we start like out of sight settles
[29:25] basically I believe that was an extra
[29:27] potent training lesson because it does
[29:28] take place in a relatively unfamiliar
[29:31] environment for her so take advantage of
[29:33] new places especially when you're
[29:34] traveling to train your dog it'll go a
[29:36] long way because if they get in the
[29:38] habit of listening to you in unfamiliar
[29:40] places well that's pretty amazing it's
[29:43] been a great family trip here in Atlanta
[29:45] and we're about to head back to New
[29:47] Orleans so I want to make sure that
[29:49] inertia goes potty and get some exercise
[29:51] before we go there fetch is getting
[29:53] better and better she's loving this yard
[29:55] here where she can really run we're
[29:57] gonna get her plenty of exercise before
[29:58] this trip so she's likely to relax and
[30:01] sleep and just be a really good dog the
[30:03] whole time
[30:03] since you're so busy training don't
[30:05] waste time going to the store to buy dog
[30:07] food either set up automatic pet food
[30:09] delivery at pet flow and get $10 off
[30:11] your first three automatic shipments

[30:30] her first formal training walk in a
[30:32] neighborhood setting instead of a
[30:34] wide-open part let's just say that
[30:35] things don't really go smoothly we'll
[30:37] see you guys next time

[00:00] oh my gosh
[00:03] good nice job this got real very quick
[00:07] i'm zach george i train dogs and this is
[00:10] my new dog inertia i'm taking you along
[00:13] as i train her from day one you can
[00:15] start from the beginning or pick up
[00:16] anywhere and start learning welcome to
[00:19] the dog training experience
[00:21] today i'm going to see how much progress
[00:23] i can make with inertia's leash walking
[00:25] manners this should be a challenge and
[00:27] i'll show you how i'm training her some
[00:29] important obedient skills and much more
[00:31] i'm going to do a leash walking lesson
[00:33] with inertia in just a moment
[00:36] i've given her a long walk i played a
[00:37] little bit of frisbee with her and
[00:40] hopefully that'll make my job of
[00:41] neighborhood leash walking a little bit
[00:43] easier
[00:44] if you have a dog you need to get their
[00:46] food automatically shipped to you and
[00:48] with petflow they make it so easy
[00:49] because you never have to think about
[00:51] that chore again literally choose your
[00:53] dog's food and tell them how often you
[00:55] want to deliver they have a massive
[00:57] selection and you'll get 10 off your
[00:59] first three automatic shipments when you
[01:01] enter code zach30 i'll have a link and
[01:03] discount code in the description of this
[01:05] video on a side note i've been getting a
[01:07] little more consistency on frisbee that
[01:09] continues to trend upward she's not
[01:11] totally obsessed with the frisbee she
[01:13] caught it she was interested but then
[01:14] the wind distracted her so i'd like to
[01:17] build even more focus on this activity
[01:19] over time which will likely translate
[01:22] into focus in other situations too come
[01:25] on yes good girl come around
[01:28] go
[01:29] with a little coaxing i was able to get
[01:31] her to chase one more
[01:34] come on come around
[01:36] go
[01:38] good nice job inertia
[01:40] that's a beautiful thing to see a dog
[01:42] running around with a frisbee in their
[01:44] mouth just doing a spontaneous weight
[01:46] lesson right now before a walk she's
[01:48] really extra tempted by indy so i know
[01:50] that she loves indie more than life
[01:52] itself and really having her pay
[01:54] attention to me right here while i open
[01:56] and close the door it's important to do
[01:57] those little things and this is the kind
[01:59] of training that i'll do a few times a
[02:01] day like 30 seconds at a time wait
[02:05] crossing the threshold thing if she'll
[02:06] hold the weight with distance there and
[02:08] get back here before she decides to
[02:10] break that stay good girl look at me
[02:13] stay
[02:16] okay
[02:18] okay come on
[02:20] she's like are you sure okay she just
[02:21] wanted to be really sure i think right
[02:23] there
[02:24] good job here
[02:26] leave india alone we're not playing with
[02:27] indy right now i'm really trying to
[02:29] teach her how to leave india alone
[02:30] because she wants to play with indy
[02:32] probably more than indie wants to play
[02:35] inner should come good girl
[02:37] that's good very nice
[02:42] see all the smells from the outside come
[02:44] rushing in sit wait i think that i just
[02:47] want to go out here a couple of steps i
[02:49] want to prevent super excitement during
[02:50] this training session my fear is that if
[02:52] i get out there and i take 5 10 20 steps
[02:55] that she's going to immediately start
[02:56] lunging and pulling and smelling i think
[02:57] my goal is just to make it right over
[02:59] here to uh this little area okay
[03:03] wait
[03:05] yes i'm gonna really get in there and
[03:06] rapidly reward that because she's
[03:08] holding
[03:09] a really good weight right there
[03:12] wait
[03:13] you can see she's interested let me
[03:15] close the door ah inertia see her
[03:17] tendency is to want to move forward
[03:19] come here keep in mind that this is a
[03:21] training walk there is no preset
[03:23] destination or a distance i'm just
[03:25] focused on getting her attention outside
[03:28] of the house while moving wait
[03:33] okay
[03:34] wait
[03:37] nope didn't get a weight there inertia
[03:39] over here
[03:40] can i have a sip please wait i'm gonna
[03:43] hang out here for a second just because
[03:44] i'm coming outside doesn't mean it's
[03:46] time to get excited and wild so i'm
[03:47] going to encourage her to be calm and
[03:49] just hang out right here so i'm trying
[03:50] to get her to do things just you know
[03:52] easy stuff like lie down and sit
[03:55] just teaching her hey just like we do
[03:57] inside let's do the things we do inside
[03:59] right here
[04:01] because i want to be able to get her in
[04:02] a nice calm
[04:04] reliable state as often as possible
[04:06] especially while in public
[04:07] so
[04:08] as far as she knows we're in public
[04:10] right now we don't spend a lot of time
[04:11] training here i think it's normal to
[04:13] think of a leash walking session as
[04:14] walking up and down the sidewalk which
[04:16] you know it is and we'll get to that in
[04:17] a little bit but this is part of it too
[04:19] just getting your dog to be in a focused
[04:22] mindset and the only way to do that is
[04:23] just to get them comfortable this is why
[04:25] you don't wait until you are trying to
[04:27] actually exercise your dog so the way i
[04:28] exercised her was by doing kind of a
[04:31] long relaxed walk on a long lead
[04:33] this morning on the levee behind our
[04:36] house where she can roam and smell but a
[04:38] neighborhood walk is much more
[04:39] disciplined my goal is really just to
[04:41] get to the end of the driveway with her
[04:42] acting civilized and then maybe i'll do
[04:45] another break over there and see how she
[04:46] does but yeah let's give it a shot oops
[04:49] she's a little distracted there person
[04:51] walking by see
[04:53] nice job wait
[04:55] so there's tension on the leash right
[04:56] now it's because inertia is pulling good
[04:58] girl yes will you come back here
[05:08] right now she's so interested it's
[05:10] really hard to get her attention i got
[05:12] it there so let me let her know i really
[05:13] like it yes
[05:15] good girl
[05:16] wait can you look at me
[05:19] not ready for that huh
[05:21] i'm gonna do a look at me training drill
[05:23] right here look at me yeah nice job
[05:27] inertia look at me
[05:29] perfect
[05:34] yes
[05:36] leave it
[05:37] look at me
[05:40] yes so i threw a treat on the ground to
[05:42] distract her spontaneously i was able to
[05:45] get her attention on me so that's a good
[05:46] sign i'm gonna walk forward now okay
[05:48] let's go
[05:50] come on
[05:51] yes hey inertia
[05:55] here
[05:57] good i like that she didn't go wild
[06:01] inertia
[06:03] what's this
[06:04] this way let's go back this way
[06:07] my goal is to avoid as much tension as
[06:09] possible on the leash right now
[06:12] inertia over here
[06:13] yes
[06:15] good
[06:16] nice good i'm gonna really have a high
[06:18] rate of reinforcement this is not heel
[06:20] training even though she's
[06:22] walking like it she's free to move
[06:24] around i just want her nearby
[06:26] inertia what's this hey
[06:30] come here yeah thank you
[06:32] good so what happens if i just sit down
[06:35] here for a minute i mean in her mind i
[06:37] might just want to stop and sit on the
[06:39] sidewalk at any time and she just needs
[06:40] to learn to be accepting of that when
[06:42] you go on a walk and your dog is in the
[06:44] habit of pulling it's because they're
[06:46] used to that very predictable movement
[06:48] they understand that a walk is in
[06:50] progress that you always move forward
[06:52] rather rapidly so if they think hey
[06:54] sometimes we're just going to stop what
[06:56] we're doing and do this maybe do some
[06:57] tricks on the sidewalk then that's how
[06:59] they learn ah play dead on the pavement
[07:03] look at that doing random skills or
[07:05] tricks like this is a great way to test
[07:06] your dog's compliance and get them
[07:08] listening to you in a brand new context
[07:11] so it's also a good excuse to practice
[07:13] your basic obedience we've been working
[07:15] on stand and wait let's see how take a
[07:17] bow looks take a bow
[07:19] wait
[07:21] take a bow
[07:24] a little
[07:26] hey take a bow
[07:28] yes she's i think she's a little
[07:31] uncomfortable bowing on this surface
[07:34] wait
[07:34] let me see if i can get her comfortable
[07:36] there you go good that's a wait
[07:39] car coming by
[07:41] oh that distracted her i was curious to
[07:43] see if she would have held that position
[07:47] oh love it wait
[07:49] as soon as the car has passed she's back
[07:51] into it so she's still susceptible to
[07:52] acknowledging her environment
[07:54] which
[07:56] is probably a good thing my goal is to
[07:58] make it about three or four houses down
[08:01] over here to see if i can get her paying
[08:02] attention to me there's a neat training
[08:05] set over here that i'm trying to get us
[08:06] to easy okay don't pull me
[08:09] easy let's go
[08:13] yes good girl here
[08:16] good
[08:17] yeah
[08:18] yes inertia good girl want some
[08:22] high rate of reinforcement here wait
[08:27] there we go a car drove by and she's
[08:30] holding her sit i'm going at this like
[08:32] super slow pace right here very
[08:34] intentionally because i mean this is
[08:36] really good behavior i didn't expect her
[08:38] to be this good i think the exercise has
[08:40] made a big difference and you know i've
[08:42] done a few of these training sessions
[08:44] now okay let's go
[08:46] yeah sure she asked for a treat there
[08:48] and i'm like i'm happy to give you one i
[08:50] like that you're paying attention to me
[08:52] she asked me with her eyes
[08:54] okay let's go come on
[08:57] attention oh i don't want that
[09:00] but i'm not going to get frustrated here
[09:01] i'm just going to calmly and gently ask
[09:03] her to come here yeah that's right can i
[09:05] have a sit and rather than just going
[09:07] back into that leash walking session i'm
[09:09] gonna park right here i mean you know
[09:10] the street's quiet enough lie down
[09:13] wait
[09:14] we'll work on downs oh sit
[09:17] down
[09:18] look at me
[09:22] i'll take a play dead
[09:23] okay
[09:25] i'm really just trying to get her
[09:27] complying okay what no never mind i
[09:29] changed my mind so i'm gonna go as far
[09:31] as to fake her out sometimes to really
[09:33] teach her to be sharp to me i can change
[09:36] my mind at any time i really want her to
[09:38] be in tune with me and be really focused
[09:40] building focus is something that takes
[09:42] time we have a leaf blower in the
[09:43] background here and
[09:45] that's something that used to really
[09:47] throw her off and now look at that i
[09:49] mean yes
[09:50] good
[09:51] we give her lots of tiny bits of chicken
[09:53] right now
[09:55] yes
[09:56] wait
[09:57] you're doing so well right now
[10:00] wait
[10:03] i'm gonna since she's pulling i'm
[10:04] actually gonna make us go farther back
[10:06] come here
[10:07] sit
[10:08] perfect good job
[10:10] so you can imagine what that leaf blower
[10:12] over there is going to do to my training
[10:15] plans you know it's gonna kick up all of
[10:17] those smells of the grass and the dust
[10:20] and just everything i imagine that's
[10:21] going to be highly stimulating not to
[10:23] mention that's a new person walking over
[10:25] there there's so many things right now
[10:26] that are going to be challenging about
[10:28] making it through that area
[10:30] see right here she's heavily distracted
[10:33] on the street if a car were coming
[10:35] it would be very difficult to get her
[10:36] attention so i'm gonna practice now come
[10:38] on
[10:39] in our show let's go
[10:41] yes
[10:42] perfect
[10:43] good job let's go
[10:48] yes
[10:50] good you never know what you're going to
[10:52] encounter in public there are so many
[10:54] things that you just can't possibly
[10:58] account for ahead of time
[11:02] sit
[11:03] wait
[11:04] come on over here
[11:13] good girl so you can see she's getting
[11:15] thrown off by that trail or another
[11:17] vehicle here
[11:20] good job
[11:21] good job yep good girl wait this got
[11:24] real very quick
[11:26] and i know that generally for production
[11:28] people leaf blowers in the background
[11:31] drive them crazy but for a dog training
[11:33] video
[11:34] it's ideal i'm gonna go back here a
[11:37] little bit
[11:40] inertia stay with me over here come on
[11:47] yes
[11:48] good
[11:51] yes
[11:53] good
[11:56] sit
[11:58] and this particular patch of real estate
[12:00] here is a little bit easier to navigate
[12:02] with her because we were just here a
[12:03] minute ago it's as though she's a bit
[12:05] more satisfied that she's explored this
[12:07] area so as we get into new territory it
[12:11] becomes very interesting and distracting
[12:13] to her
[12:14] okay let's go over here come here
[12:16] good girl
[12:18] wait sit
[12:19] stay good girl
[12:21] stay
[12:25] yes
[12:27] very good all right let's go
[12:29] yes
[12:32] good oh wait inertia
[12:35] [Music]
[12:36] wait
[12:38] wait
[12:39] good girl given how challenging this
[12:42] particular training environment is i'm
[12:43] going to rapidly reward inertia for
[12:45] every second of good behavior
[12:48] yes
[12:50] yes
[12:54] yes
[12:57] wait oh
[12:59] that was a really nice little uh effort
[13:02] there but then i lost her so let's see
[13:03] if i can get her back here i'm gonna
[13:04] hang out for a few seconds here just
[13:06] because i was starting to lose her i
[13:08] think in the interest of being thorough
[13:09] i'm gonna go back a few paces here just
[13:12] to make sure i really have her attention
[13:13] so i'm kind of introducing this new
[13:15] territory in a more staggered way rather
[13:18] than all at once so we have familiar
[13:20] territory that she saw just a moment ago
[13:22] that she feels more familiar with while
[13:24] we're slowly implementing the new
[13:25] territory inertia what's this oh good
[13:28] job
[13:30] look yeah yeah oh my gosh
[13:33] i can't believe that attention i'm
[13:34] getting see i mean it's so much easier
[13:37] going away
[13:38] uh from where we just were wait
[13:40] yes
[13:42] you're good i'm gonna go all the way
[13:44] home
[13:45] inertia over here come on come on
[13:50] yes
[13:51] and i'm really avoiding tension because
[13:52] i want her going through the motions i
[13:54] really want her to think
[13:56] through her actions so she understands
[13:58] that she's to stay with me not because
[14:00] i'm pulling on her but because it makes
[14:02] sense for her to want to be near me
[14:05] in her mind
[14:07] good
[14:09] good so i've you know i've retreated all
[14:12] the way back here just to get some good
[14:13] behavior and now i imagine we ought to
[14:16] be able to get back to where we were
[14:18] in pretty short order but i don't want
[14:20] to jinx us
[14:27] leave it alone see her going for a
[14:28] ground scent you can see her nose is
[14:31] starting to go wild something's
[14:33] distracting her but yes she's choosing
[14:35] to listen i appreciate that like
[14:37] clockwork the moment we got into new
[14:39] territory on this walk
[14:41] she was like i am heavily distracted
[14:44] that's my cue slow down hit the brakes
[14:46] here a little bit go extra slow to
[14:48] really walk her through how she's
[14:49] supposed to behave when she feels like
[14:51] this another car coming it's been a
[14:54] great chance to practice around cars too
[14:56] sit good
[14:58] i'll ask for that sit very periodically
[15:00] just because that tells me if she's in a
[15:02] trainable mindset or if she's just too
[15:04] distracted to listen to something easy
[15:05] and basic like sit sit
[15:10] less likely to sit there but i get a
[15:11] weight spine
[15:14] okay let's go all right so we're just
[15:17] trying to get to this patch of grass
[15:18] right here
[15:20] okay here we are this is where i want to
[15:22] be right now there are a ton of scent
[15:24] distractions in this area right here
[15:27] because this is public access to the
[15:29] lake which is over that hill right there
[15:31] and so that means a lot of people walk
[15:32] here there are a lot of dogs that play
[15:34] around here and
[15:36] i want her to just get this flood of
[15:39] different scents
[15:40] and experience that for a little bit and
[15:42] then maybe see how receptive she is to
[15:44] doing some leash training after she does
[15:46] that so here she's lying down there's
[15:49] some dog poop i've got a teacher to
[15:51] leave that dog poop alone she's really
[15:53] trying to get to it oh boy so look at
[15:55] that i mean that's where i have to
[15:57] really restrain her i don't want her
[15:58] getting to that i'm sorry for this but
[16:00] let's do a real life leave it with this
[16:02] dog poop
[16:03] because i get this question all the time
[16:05] and i have a really good opportunity to
[16:06] have a spontaneous training session here
[16:08] so i'm just going to enforce leave it
[16:10] like we do with many other things come
[16:12] on zach i know you can be more exciting
[16:14] than dog poop inertia look at me
[16:17] thank goodness
[16:19] look at you
[16:21] up here yes
[16:22] nice job got her attention
[16:24] hey
[16:26] inertia what's going on you want this
[16:28] thanks for looking at me instead of that
[16:29] dog poop it's been a few minutes now
[16:32] she's leaving the poop alone but you can
[16:34] see how her nose is just going crazy
[16:36] right now and competing with the sense
[16:39] of an environment is arguably the
[16:41] toughest thing about dog training
[16:42] because dogs smell way better than we do
[16:45] it's almost like a completely different
[16:46] sense to them you know dogs smell with
[16:49] each nostril independently too
[16:51] stereo smelling so let's practice come
[16:54] when called it's been a minute and risha
[16:56] come
[16:59] yes good work let me see if i can get
[17:01] her into heel position i'll bet that's
[17:03] going to be tough for stand
[17:05] and
[17:07] can you oh see right there she's like
[17:09] i'll do this stand good and
[17:13] heal yes perfect big reward for that
[17:16] wait okay heel
[17:19] weight
[17:23] okay
[17:24] heel this way
[17:27] very much speed walking a bit faster
[17:30] nice
[17:31] wait
[17:32] remember we're in a place that inertia
[17:34] is not familiar with so my expectations
[17:36] are adjusted for this i will not hold
[17:38] her to the same standard that i do
[17:40] inside of my house for example
[17:43] come here let's go no can't get our
[17:46] attention right now
[17:47] let's go now there we go
[17:49] sometimes getting playful works good job
[17:52] come here and take a bow
[17:55] i'll take it she
[17:57] wasn't the best bow but she made the
[17:59] effort to pay attention to me while it
[18:00] was very difficult for her
[18:02] okay good and wait can you take a bow
[18:06] nope stand
[18:10] come alive stand
[18:12] yep bow wait
[18:14] come on up here
[18:19] stand
[18:20] wait
[18:21] easy bow remember bow wait at first she
[18:24] didn't really want to bow in fact she
[18:25] was offering almost every trick she
[18:27] knows instead of bao but i took a moment
[18:29] to go in slow motion and really walk her
[18:31] through the trick bow and eventually she
[18:33] offered it
[18:34] okay good
[18:36] so
[18:37] i'm thrilled with that i mean outdoor
[18:39] training is starting to happen it's
[18:40] starting to get more reliable you'll
[18:42] remember earlier on in our training
[18:44] i didn't even try to get her attention
[18:46] like this in this type of environment i
[18:48] mean not very much anyway
[18:50] because i knew she needed to experience
[18:52] it and she still does but i think we're
[18:54] breaking new ground on this
[18:56] this is an example of what your training
[18:58] lesson should look like
[19:00] in order to get your dog to listen to
[19:01] you more reliably when you leave the
[19:03] house
[19:04] i'm on life support on treats right now
[19:06] her allowance has been mostly used up
[19:08] for this lesson so i'm gonna have to
[19:11] ration my treats on the way home very
[19:13] wisely but since the walk home is going
[19:15] to be over familiar territory i'm
[19:17] thinking training should go a little bit
[19:19] easier if you're struggling with your
[19:20] dog to teach them how to walk on leash
[19:22] or any other number of problem behaviors
[19:24] like jumping chewing barking and so on
[19:26] check out my books i'll have a link in
[19:28] the description below
[19:29] alright so we've made it home i'd say
[19:31] that was a pretty successful lesson we
[19:33] got home and i had a great training
[19:35] session in the studio here are some
[19:36] highlights you know i'm trying to do
[19:39] just a couple of minutes of frisbee a
[19:41] day like seriously maybe two minutes
[19:43] because i really want to go easy on her
[19:46] but her interest has been really
[19:48] increasing lately so i'm so excited by
[19:50] that let go good over here i've been
[19:53] teaching her come around
[19:55] she's so young you know she's under six
[19:57] months old so i don't want her doing a
[19:59] lot of jumping but you know i think a
[20:01] moderate amount of cardio
[20:03] sprinting activity like this is okay but
[20:05] i just think you should keep it really
[20:07] conservative when your dog is this young
[20:09] no need to like get them going all out
[20:12] because really my main interest is short
[20:14] sessions where she's into it stop before
[20:16] she gets bored you know and try to
[20:18] maintain a more constant focus on the
[20:20] frisbee when it's out my hope is to
[20:22] build this and make this a really
[20:24] valuable currency where she's like this
[20:26] all the time but she what you're seeing
[20:28] right now is not always typical she
[20:30] doesn't always get into the frisbee and
[20:32] want to play tug with it like she is
[20:34] right now but if she's like that for
[20:36] this
[20:37] most of the time then i can use this as
[20:39] a really valuable currency to motivate
[20:41] her to do all kinds of things like a
[20:44] come around
[20:45] catch it
[20:46] yeah there you go good job i was
[20:48] planning on using my food as currency
[20:51] but since she's so into the frisbee
[20:52] right now maybe i can motivate her to do
[20:55] some of the tricks we've been working on
[20:56] for the frisbee i i would think they
[20:58] would look kind of sloppy so bear with
[20:59] me because i'm usually using food which
[21:01] kind of encourages the dog to be more
[21:03] calm this encourages them to be a bit
[21:04] more excited so i have to work through
[21:06] that wait
[21:07] here get it oh there we go
[21:10] well look at that look how quick she's
[21:11] going that's awesome yeah good get it
[21:14] all right and just a brief game of tug
[21:16] of war maybe a short toss right there as
[21:20] a reward for her it is sufficient where
[21:23] she's like okay cool what else do i have
[21:24] to do for that let go
[21:26] can you let's see come around wait
[21:30] can you bow
[21:32] wait
[21:34] yes good job okay let's throw inertia a
[21:37] curveball and see how she does
[21:39] inertia is doing so well right now let's
[21:41] see how her crawl is looking wait
[21:44] can you crawl
[21:46] oh she's trying to cheat a little there
[21:48] we go yes that's good
[21:50] really nice good job that was great
[21:54] lie down
[21:55] yes wait
[21:57] can you crawl yes oh look she really
[21:59] tries to cheat on that first
[22:02] slide
[22:04] let me give her my attention sit
[22:07] flat out
[22:15] okay good job nice work okay how about
[22:17] her heel training
[22:19] heel
[22:20] yeah that's good it's good weight
[22:23] good
[22:25] look at job here yes wait
[22:28] good let's see how backup's looking look
[22:30] at that ah a little crooked a little
[22:32] crooked
[22:33] that was good though
[22:35] remember back up
[22:36] back up yes
[22:39] there you go good job good job
[22:41] heel
[22:43] wait
[22:45] back up
[22:46] yeah there we go
[22:48] that's it look at that
[22:51] good backups brand new we're gonna do
[22:53] figure eights do you remember these you
[22:55] go like this yes
[22:56] and then like this good
[22:59] go yes figure eights yes
[23:02] good turn around
[23:04] yeah keep
[23:07] yes give me one more so still pretty
[23:10] lord dependent i wonder if she'll let me
[23:12] see if i can do a more subtle lure so
[23:14] i'm not just
[23:15] what's this yes good what's this oh nice
[23:18] i'm gonna reward for that see the hand
[23:20] signal was more subtle
[23:23] yep
[23:25] this way
[23:26] let's check in on one of the nurses
[23:27] newer tricks dig dig is weird because it
[23:31] was taught through capturing because we
[23:32] discovered her doing it and i really
[23:35] should do it more the way i get her to
[23:36] do it is i'm like
[23:38] yes
[23:39] that was actually really good but i want
[23:41] her like digging vigorously so
[23:43] just when i ask her as a trick you know
[23:47] what's that what's this come on i want
[23:49] to get her going yeah that's good yeah
[23:51] what's this yes i like how she's
[23:53] scratching it there that's awesome
[23:56] i'm trying to get her to you know really
[23:58] do it more vigorously either with one
[23:59] foot or ideally alternating feet yes
[24:05] what's that yes get it yeah oh i like
[24:08] that all right give me three come on dig
[24:12] yeah i'll take it good see really trying
[24:14] to push her there
[24:16] three
[24:21] oh there we go
[24:23] yep got her to use the other foot there
[24:25] i know what you're thinking that's nice
[24:27] but how do i stop my dog from digging my
[24:29] hypothesis as to why most dogs dig is
[24:32] because they're not getting enough
[24:34] energy out they're not getting enough
[24:35] fetch in their lives or vigorous walks
[24:38] or whatever it is for your dog some dogs
[24:39] might require a 20-minute walk some dogs
[24:42] might require cumulative hour with
[24:43] breaks of fetch and so digging is a nice
[24:46] release it seems to be satisfying
[24:48] recreational to dogs so most digging is
[24:51] solved through exercise i know that's
[24:52] counterintuitive but
[24:54] that should fix most instances of
[24:57] digging then there's digging to get out
[24:58] which is related you know if a dog's
[25:00] trying to dig to get out they got a lot
[25:01] of energy to dig some dogs dig to get
[25:03] cool and if that's the case you just
[25:06] interrupt them before they do it very
[25:07] consistently and over time they learn
[25:09] okay i guess i'm not allowed to do that
[25:11] i showed you guys this training session
[25:13] live on instagram and at this point a
[25:14] viewer asked about how i decide which
[25:16] hand signals to use for all of these
[25:18] different skills what a great question
[25:20] it depends like some of them i'm not
[25:22] even to a hand signal i'm still luring
[25:24] like like i couldn't get her to weave
[25:26] through my legs without some type of
[25:27] lure basically i was having her weave
[25:29] like this at first and then now we're
[25:32] like i can weave like this by luring her
[25:34] and then i was able to like you know
[25:36] weave by
[25:37] this this and eventually i want to be
[25:39] able to be like weave
[25:41] it just look cool it gets to a point
[25:42] where it's indistinguishable from
[25:44] talking to a person it's like if you
[25:46] work enough with your dog then you you
[25:48] guys just your partners and they're like
[25:50] okay i got you that was a totally
[25:52] awesome live i think it went really well
[25:54] what do you think bree i think it went
[25:56] pretty well get 10 off your first three
[25:58] automatic shipments from pepflow by

TRANSCRIPTION:

[00:00] it's just Oh what are you doing
[00:04] what was this I'm Zack George I trained
[00:08] dogs and this is my new dog inertia I'm
[00:12] taking you along as I train her from day
[00:14] one you can start from the beginning or
[00:16] pick up anywhere and start learning
[00:18] welcome to the dog training experience
[00:21] in today's episode you'll see exactly
[00:23] why you really need to be on guard every
[00:26] time you take your dog someplace new
[00:28] today we're on a road trip to Corpus
[00:30] Christi Texas we're coming here to see
[00:32] one of Brianna's closest friends and
[00:34] we're bringing inertia with us as well
[00:36] so traveling with your dog can be pretty
[00:38] tricky sometimes lots of training
[00:40] opportunities present themselves hey can
[00:42] you not dig did please don't dig that no
[00:45] inertia I'm always looking for the most
[00:48] dynamic unique chews and treats to use
[00:50] when I train dogs and that can be
[00:52] surprisingly hard to find this is what
[00:54] really sets pup firts products apart I
[00:56] use them all the time in my training
[00:57] these are items that you just don't find
[01:00] everywhere pup firt has really gone out
[01:02] of their way to find items that dogs are
[01:03] very interested in instead of the same
[01:06] old same old
[01:06] they have some of the most unique
[01:07] options on the market like free stride
[01:09] sweet potatoes maybe you don't want to
[01:11] give your dog protein all the time for a
[01:13] really special treat sometimes I'll give
[01:14] my dog's a salmon skin shoe or beef
[01:16] tendon chew their chicken jerky treats
[01:18] are gonna be loved by just about every
[01:20] dog on earth and a favorite around here
[01:22] amongst our dogs are the Himalayan yak
[01:24] cheese choose the best way to try out
[01:26] their entire line and get the most bang
[01:28] for your buck is to get their pack deals
[01:30] which bundle their products together so
[01:32] that you can try them all and save money
[01:34] while doing it it's a super simple way
[01:36] to get every type of reward your dog
[01:38] could possibly want in one purchase I'll
[01:41] have a link in the description where you
[01:42] can check out all of their different
[01:43] bundle deals hey leave it good girl
[01:46] that's perfect no don't stop eating
[01:48] plants we're staying at an Airbnb house
[01:52] I'm gonna have to introduce her to a
[01:53] brand new house and make sure that she
[01:56] doesn't destroy the place fingers
[01:57] crossed I feel pretty confident I look
[01:59] forward to doing these types of trips
[02:01] because it allows me to train in places
[02:03] and new settings and the more reliable I
[02:06] can get her in those new places and new
[02:08] settings the better there is so much
[02:11] that a dog has to see in the
[02:12] a couple of years of training and my
[02:14] first book dog training revolution I
[02:15] give you a complete overview of the main
[02:17] things you need to consider when raising
[02:19] your dog I'll have a link in the
[02:20] description if you're looking for a more
[02:22] detailed book specifically on the ins
[02:24] and outs of dog training I'll have a
[02:25] link to my second book in the
[02:27] description below - we're here in Corpus
[02:29] Christi right now at our Airbnb it's
[02:31] right on the coast really cool place and
[02:34] it's got this nice big fenced yard so
[02:36] one of the first things that I want to
[02:38] do is introduce inertia to this outdoor
[02:41] area this is where she'll be taking her
[02:43] potty breaks this is where we'll be
[02:45] doing some exercise and I want her to
[02:48] really get familiar with it and
[02:50] acclimated with it and I really want her
[02:52] to explore it let's do what most people
[02:54] do in this situation I've inspected the
[02:57] perimeter it all looks secure they'll
[02:59] take the leash off they usually don't
[03:00] have treats ready and they'll say go
[03:02] check it out go run around so let's see
[03:04] what happens when we do that with
[03:06] inertia I mean what could possibly go
[03:08] wrong right weights okay good go look
[03:13] around so just let her sniff around for
[03:16] a bit so she's looking at me I'll I'll
[03:20] walk with her just to encourage her to
[03:22] look at things I like that she looked at
[03:25] me just there that was cool
[03:27] she's like you come in I'm like okay in
[03:28] general I don't trust dogs off leash in
[03:30] new places until they've shown me that
[03:32] they're extremely reliable for many
[03:34] months while on leash first one of the
[03:36] best ways to start introducing off leash
[03:39] training to your dog is to bring them to
[03:42] brand new places like this that are
[03:43] secure but just because it's secure she
[03:46] doesn't realize that so it's a good time
[03:48] to see how likely they are to come to
[03:50] you how likely they are to stay and
[03:51] listen to you and what they may view as
[03:54] an uncontrolled environment but you know
[03:56] that you have control of I mean right
[03:58] off the bat here I can't have her
[03:59] jigging I need just oh look at this
[04:02] did you see that I came over here to
[04:04] limit her access to the yard look oh my
[04:06] gosh she's running from me right now you
[04:08] see this inertia come here what was this
[04:14] it inertia come let's say right now I
[04:17] wasn't in a fenced area would you want
[04:19] your dog doing this in public
[04:20] hey inertia come here yep huh you know
[04:29] and the thing is when your dog gets away
[04:31] with running away from you like this
[04:33] it's very reinforcing to them I mean to
[04:35] her it appears to be a whole lot of fun
[04:37] right now and I want her to have fun but
[04:39] I don't want her to ignore come when
[04:40] called so this is something that really
[04:42] needs a lot of work I had a hunch this
[04:45] would happen because I'm getting to know
[04:46] her but I think it's important that we
[04:48] realize that we don't want to give our
[04:50] dog too much freedom in new places until
[04:52] we've adequately done some training and
[04:55] this is a really good example of why so
[04:59] I do need to manage regaining control
[05:01] over here my first step here is going to
[05:04] be once I finally do get control of her
[05:06] is to put her on a long lead when your
[05:09] dog is playing chase with you like this
[05:10] they're having a blast they really enjoy
[05:12] it and they're just looking at it as a
[05:14] game probably but it can be a really
[05:16] dangerous game if it happens at the
[05:17] wrong place
[05:18] so don't engage in a game of chase like
[05:20] this with a dog this young in a nurses
[05:22] case pretending to leave is usually what
[05:24] gets her to come to me pretty reliably
[05:26] so let's see if she'll call my bluff I
[05:28] think the best way to put this game of
[05:30] chase to an end is to quit engaging in
[05:33] this and trying to capture her so I'm
[05:35] just gonna go walk away and look at that
[05:37] I got control of her because she came to
[05:39] me so we're gonna try this again I'm
[05:41] gonna regain control of her environment
[05:42] but still give her lots of freedom with
[05:44] a 26 foot retractable leash and this
[05:47] time I'll be using treats and we'll see
[05:50] if we can teach her how to behave a
[05:51] little more ideally than what we just
[05:53] saw the reason I'm using a retractable
[05:56] leash in this situation is I like that
[05:58] it's really difficult to trip over so it
[06:00] really stays above their body and it
[06:02] doesn't get tangled as much and I feel
[06:04] like in an area like this 26 feet in any
[06:06] given direction is something I can
[06:08] tolerate while I'm training her inertia
[06:11] Hey alright so you can see she's digging
[06:14] right there let me see if I can stop
[06:16] that in her she'll leave it alone
[06:19] you want this c'mere
[06:20] sit oh when you look at that and so when
[06:25] they're young like this you get
[06:26] behaviors like this anyway you can even
[06:28] if you have to give them a treat because
[06:29] you're still teaching them to go through
[06:31] the motions and think and once this
[06:34] becomes this commonplace for them and
[06:35] you're really consistent they just come
[06:37] to accept okay I don't dig at the yard I
[06:39] pay attention to my mom or dad when they
[06:41] ask me to and that's just how life is
[06:43] all right so we're off to a good start
[06:45] so let me let her explore let's go so
[06:49] this is a good opportunity to practice
[06:50] calling her getting her to follow me
[06:53] good girl come here come on
[06:55] good oh I love that and she's a little
[06:58] bit more inspired to come to me since I
[07:01] have a really good treat I'm using
[07:03] freeze-dried beef liver treats from
[07:04] puppet right now inertia come on little
[07:09] slow but she came to me on the first
[07:10] request inertia leave it come good girl
[07:16] come on let's go good little peppy here
[07:19] that time good work the biggest mistake
[07:24] people make with young dogs like this is
[07:26] too much freedom too early and I am in
[07:29] no rush to have her off leash I'm going
[07:32] to be very methodical about teaching her
[07:34] how to listen off leash by simulating
[07:36] off leash conditions with long leads
[07:38] retractable leashes like this and going
[07:41] to new places often alright let's go
[07:43] explore the Airbnb now come on let's
[07:45] explore let's look let's look around
[07:48] what do you think come on
[07:50] my wife was eating popcorn over here a
[07:52] moment ago dropped it and inertia went
[07:54] to go for it so I'm gonna do an
[07:56] impromptu real life leave it hey see
[07:58] this popcorn leave it alone
[08:00] leave it see okay good job so that's
[08:06] like 15 20 seconds of training to really
[08:09] solidify a real life leave it to your
[08:11] dog take advantage of those moments good
[08:13] job now I've got a reward here I'm just
[08:15] gonna let her continue to explore the
[08:17] environment in some situations were
[08:19] close to phasing out using treats to
[08:21] reward a real life leave it because we
[08:23] practice it so much that it has
[08:25] seemingly become second nature but if
[08:27] she leaves something really tempting
[08:28] alone I will reward her I don't you know
[08:31] sometimes I do it just because but
[08:33] I don't think it's required in most
[08:35] circumstances but that still depends
[08:38] it shouldn't jinx myself too much there
[08:40] this is the kitchen good it sound like
[08:43] how she keeps looking to me too let's go
[08:45] out back here there's a lovely porch
[08:47] that I'd like to see let's see how she
[08:48] does there one of the first things I
[08:50] really like to do in a new place is
[08:51] insist that my dog stay at doorways
[08:54] leading to the outdoors so we're gonna
[08:56] have a refresher course on that to make
[08:58] sure she listens to that this is a
[09:00] doorway she's never had to stay at
[09:01] before so I'm just further solidifying
[09:03] here's another instance of a doorway
[09:07] that you need to stay at let's see what
[09:09] happens if I open it here she just
[09:12] walked out in other words it wasn't her
[09:14] default to stay there so I need to
[09:16] change that inertia I come here and of
[09:18] course I have her on leash so she's not
[09:20] in a position to go and just run around
[09:22] out there you can see she's really
[09:23] curious about this sit stake
[09:31] look at me not getting eye contact
[09:36] quickly but she offered it there good
[09:39] this time I'm gonna use the environment
[09:42] as the reward instead of at regrets oh
[09:44] you know that's a really handy thing you
[09:47] can do there's a moss over here that's
[09:48] got a got our attention I don't know if
[09:51] you can see that but you know here's a
[09:53] real life distraction she's responding
[09:55] well wait okay let's go all right
[10:03] and so you can see her nose gets to work
[10:06] immediately out here
[10:07] she likes to smell and see what's going
[10:10] on these are some beautiful plants but I
[10:12] have a feeling I'm gonna be distracting
[10:14] to inertia and I don't want her getting
[10:16] into those but right now it's just oh
[10:19] inertia what are you doing
[10:23] okay we'll need to clean that up and
[10:25] that's her first accident and I mean
[10:28] months but you know this is an outdoor
[10:30] kind of feeling area I mean that's a
[10:32] porch so maybe she hasn't yet equated
[10:34] okay
[10:35] I can't pee everywhere that feels like
[10:37] outside she doesn't know that yet this
[10:39] is also a dog friendly Airbnb so who
[10:41] knows if there are sense there from past
[10:43] dogs but we brought an enzymatic cleaner
[10:45] with us just in case and see if she had
[10:48] been off leash I might not have even
[10:50] noticed that body accident really it's
[10:52] vital to have them on leash and under
[10:54] control when introducing them to new
[10:55] places particularly when they're young
[10:58] or untrained leave it and this has
[11:02] thorns on it too so I'm gonna give her a
[11:05] good reward there for paying attention
[11:07] to leave it okay come on much better
[11:10] good look at look at how I have her
[11:12] attention now that's very good I like
[11:15] that a lot so she's doing really well
[11:17] being introduced to a new place like
[11:19] this she smelled around she had an
[11:21] accident got into a plant but I was able
[11:23] to get her focused on me and that's the
[11:26] important thing
[11:26] she looks relaxed and adjusted here
[11:29] let's go check out the deck and see what
[11:30] she does okay no show come on all right
[11:34] here's the door wait
[11:39] loose leash this is not a controlled
[11:41] environment out here uh-uh
[11:42] wait good
[11:45] yes I'm definitely gonna reward that
[11:49] because that's the first time ever in
[11:50] her life that she's encountered this
[11:52] door she honored it on the first request
[11:54] so very important wait
[11:57] and her so look at me I want to get her
[12:02] attention yes now we're gonna use the
[12:05] environment okay we're gonna use the
[12:07] environment to say hey I'll let you
[12:10] check out this area now there's so many
[12:12] awesome Birds there's a lizard right
[12:13] there I don't know if she sees it or not
[12:18] and I'm not rushing around not
[12:20] immediately asking her to do things in
[12:22] this particular instance though I may
[12:23] want to do that in the future because
[12:25] just because you go to a new place
[12:27] doesn't mean that you don't want your
[12:28] dog to listen to you it just takes a lot
[12:29] of time to teach that particular skill
[12:32] so in this case I'm just gonna skip the
[12:34] whole frustrating thing oh hey pay
[12:36] attention to me and just again let her
[12:38] check out this new part of the world
[12:39] that she's never been to before
[12:41] nor have I so it's pretty interesting
[12:43] opportunity for both of us move stairs
[12:45] she doesn't encounter a lot of stairs
[12:47] look at that see how she's a little
[12:48] rusty on the stairs it's a new set of
[12:50] stairs good girl
[12:52] yes and we're near water's edge so I
[12:54] ought to keep her on a real short leash
[12:56] come on yes
[13:00] come on let's go come on
[13:05] good girl and see she wants to walk
[13:08] right up to that edge I'm not gonna let
[13:10] her do that
[13:11] let her go up to write about their stay
[13:14] would she jump in I don't think so but
[13:17] I'd rather not find out right now so
[13:19] she's acknowledging this dogs across the
[13:21] way over here but both dogs are being
[13:22] really good all right so this is pretty
[13:25] much what I expected here she's
[13:26] interested in the area but she's
[13:29] reacting within an acceptable range
[13:31] she's not barking or going nuts or
[13:33] anything so that's good let's see if she
[13:34] can go up the stairs come on oh the dog
[13:37] is barking it's like another dog over
[13:40] there it's barking there's a plane above
[13:42] okay come on let's go whoa this way come
[13:46] on at our house she's not allowed up the
[13:50] stairs so she's still a little weird
[13:51] about going up the stairs you want some
[13:53] turkey oh there you go
[13:56] yeah that'll do it okay come on let's go
[14:02] inertia come let's go what this yes good
[14:07] job you got it easy right okay so let me
[14:13] give you a brief tour of some of the
[14:14] things we brought of course frisbee just
[14:16] because I mean you got to bring the
[14:17] frisbee with you I've got freeze-dried
[14:19] sweet-potato treats from pop Burt I'm
[14:21] using beef liver treats also from pop
[14:23] verge these are Himalayan dog chews that
[14:25] I'll give her when she goes in her crate
[14:26] to keep her occupied as well as these
[14:30] beef tendon chews got some of her
[14:33] favorite toys in the world she like
[14:34] likes this one it's got a good squeaker
[14:36] nice and tough toy this is still like
[14:39] number one it is disgusting it's been
[14:42] washed like one time but I think it's
[14:44] due for a second wash she just loves
[14:46] this thing I've got cleaner just in case
[14:49] of any accidents even when dogs are
[14:50] potty-trained when you take them to new
[14:52] places all bets are off
[14:53] and you have to really assume that
[14:55] they're gonna be a little confused at
[14:56] first we also brought some food puzzle
[14:59] toys right here with some peanut butter
[15:01] so I want her I want to have a lot of
[15:03] different interesting things based on
[15:06] whatever her mood might be at the moment
[15:08] to keep her really engaged while she's
[15:10] put up what
[15:12] look at this she jumping on the counter
[15:15] inertia you can't do that her jumping is
[15:19] slight getting a little tough to control
[15:21] right now so I need to really be focused
[15:23] on that whether it's jumping on the
[15:24] counter jumping on people or whatever
[15:26] lots of things to train so I want to
[15:29] show you her sleeping area now and where
[15:31] she's gonna be crashing tonight this is
[15:33] a nurses sleeping area over here we have
[15:36] a crate and her bed I'm gonna put some
[15:38] water in there and some food later on
[15:41] but I haven't kind of over here I'm
[15:43] still getting her used to sleeping alone
[15:45] I'm intentionally not putting it in the
[15:47] bedroom because I'm really trying to
[15:48] encourage that independence out of her
[15:50] and getting her comfortable with being
[15:52] alone and at the end of the day of
[15:53] training and exercise she's likely to
[15:56] just pass out and there and that gives
[15:59] her this this association about man this
[16:01] is a comfortable place to just check out
[16:03] for many hours and go to sleep
[16:05] like I want her thinking of her crate
[16:07] like that the obvious variable here is
[16:09] at our house we cover in a much bigger
[16:11] area with an exercise pen but here this
[16:13] is a smaller crate because it was easier
[16:15] to travel with she's stayed in the crate
[16:17] this small a couple of times but again
[16:19] she only goes in here at the end of the
[16:20] day when she's very tired and she goes
[16:23] right to sleep hopefully we'll see what
[16:24] she does here but typically when I have
[16:26] the space I'll give a dog a very
[16:27] oversized area so this is smaller than I
[16:30] usually use but I think she'll be okay I
[16:32] want to see how she does with fetch in
[16:34] this new yard
[16:35] I like that she's into this is she into
[16:37] this all right I'm gonna bring out all
[16:40] three of these toys and we'll see which
[16:42] one she wants to play with today so I'm
[16:44] gonna drop the leash but this will be a
[16:45] lot easier to get to her if she gets to
[16:47] zoom he's on me let's try that go get it
[16:52] oh she went right after that I like that
[16:53] ready and go
[16:58] good get it come on let's go come on
[17:03] let's go come on
[17:12] you can do it good girl all right wait
[17:16] yes yes ready and go
[17:24] good you want this like that one see not
[17:32] into the frisbee but into this toy a
[17:34] little bit so in this new place she's
[17:36] like I do not know how to play fetch
[17:38] this is a really good illustration she
[17:40] will not bring it back to me right now
[17:42] in this brand new place that's normal by
[17:44] the way just means I have to work with
[17:45] her and right now she doesn't seem too
[17:47] receptive so maybe we'll try again later
[17:49] I'm checking it right now on inertia and
[17:52] she's still passed out in her crate so
[17:54] this is all good news I'm glad that
[17:56] she's not experiencing anxiety or
[17:58] anything like that and she's just at
[18:01] peace I think our training is working on
[18:03] minimizing anxiety so far this is why it
[18:07] pays off to really give your dog
[18:08] experience with being left alone
[18:10] overnight as well when you leave for a
[18:14] meal or something if you ever find that
[18:17] your training isn't going as fast as you
[18:19] like remember to mix up your currencies
[18:21] puppet has a fantastic deal right now on
[18:23] their bundle packs they have some of the
[18:24] most unique treats available for dogs
[18:26] anywhere I'll have a link to their pack
[18:28] deals in the description below follow us
[18:31] on Instagram and tik-tok to keep up with
[18:33] inertia and our training in real time
[18:35] subscribe to this channel and get a copy
[18:37] of both of my books for a complete guide
[18:39] to training your dog in the next episode
[18:41] we'll attempt to teach inertia some

[18:44] texas-sized distractions

[00:00] there it is see that that's a nice tug
[00:02] good shake off I'm Zak Jorge I trained
[00:06] dogs this is my new dog and I'm gonna
[00:09] show you how I train her from day one
[00:11] things definitely won't always go
[00:13] smoothly
[00:14] you can start from the beginning or you
[00:15] can pick up anywhere subscribe and hit
[00:17] the bell notification so you never miss
[00:19] an episode when you put into motion an
[00:21] approach based on love and respect your
[00:23] results will forever remain in motion
[00:25] this is inertia
[00:27] welcome to the dog training experience
[00:30] today we're gonna work on continuing to
[00:33] increase a nurses desire to play we'll
[00:35] also see how she's doing during bath
[00:37] time and I'm going to attempt to start
[00:39] teaching her a new trick - she's been so
[00:42] conditioned that when she sees her pup
[00:44] box she gets real excited you don't know
[00:46] pup box is a monthly subscription box
[00:48] they give you age specific items that
[00:51] make it easier to train your dog and you
[00:52] get this guide every single month as
[00:54] well that keeps you on track with your
[00:56] training I mean look at this a bat kind
[00:58] of scrubber this is a way to like really
[01:00] effectively scrub your dog in a way
[01:02] that's comfortable for them what is that
[01:04] we're gonna use this definitely that's a
[01:06] nice one quality product and chicken
[01:08] hearts this is a delicacy in many parts
[01:11] of the world just so you know
[01:12] go get your toy let's see how that
[01:14] retrieve is looking all right she's got
[01:16] it come on girl let's go good you want
[01:19] this perfect let's give a little reward
[01:21] for that you want a chicken hearts
[01:24] that's a real chicken heart phone so you
[01:27] put food in this they roll it around and
[01:30] food comes out so for example if your
[01:31] dog is dealing with separation anxiety
[01:33] or they bark when you leave the room
[01:35] giving them a toy like this is likely to
[01:37] keep them really preoccupied so I have a
[01:39] whole month's worth of supplies here to
[01:42] use to motivate inertia and to care for
[01:44] her and train her so I'm really glad pup
[01:47] box exists pup box is gonna give all of
[01:50] you 50% off of your first pup box when
[01:52] you sign up for a three six or 12 month
[01:54] subscription just go to pup box.com
[01:56] slashes act and enter discount code Zach
[01:59] I'll have that linking code in the
[02:00] description I'm gonna try something new
[02:02] today we're gonna go on a frisbee walk
[02:04] and see how that goes so first we walk
[02:08] is well I don't know because I think I
[02:10] just invented it but I noticed that when
[02:12] we're on
[02:13] she sometimes gets randomly interested
[02:16] in playing and jumping and biting and I
[02:17] think I can convert that enthusiasm into
[02:20] drive for the frisbee that's my
[02:22] objective is just to periodically take
[02:24] advantage of times when she's naturally
[02:25] into playing to see if I can really
[02:28] intensify her intensity in the game
[02:30] we're doing it just a normal walk as far
[02:32] as she's concerned letting her spell
[02:33] around letting her get adjusted to the
[02:35] outdoors I'm prepared with my frisbee
[02:37] over here when she decides she wants to
[02:39] play let me just see something let's
[02:41] let's try to get a baseline sample here
[02:43] for a second let's see if I can get her
[02:44] playing tug with the frisbee on demand
[02:47] that's it let's look at that playground
[02:50] ready let's try a roller she's more
[02:52] likely to go after a roller like that
[02:54] than she is a frisbee being thrown in
[02:56] the air so that's good but tug-of-war is
[02:58] actually what I'm really after right now
[03:00] because tug is what really evolves into
[03:03] intensity when it comes to frisbee so I
[03:06] have limited tug right now but she's
[03:07] pretty interested so I also take it come
[03:09] around ready go Nike it's a good effort
[03:13] huh good job but see how she just drops
[03:17] it and loses interest that's something
[03:18] we're trying to improve yeah go get it
[03:20] come on get it see that tugs a little
[03:23] lame right now got to get a more intense
[03:25] tug she's not really grabbing it and
[03:27] holding on that's what I want
[03:30] come on all right there it is see that
[03:33] that's a nice tug good good and that tug
[03:35] is a real symbol of intensity good let
[03:39] go just watch this nice effort really
[03:44] good that's it see a little bit more
[03:46] interested in the frisbee inertia this
[03:49] way come on come on good yes good look
[03:54] at that tug nice go ahaha good catch
[04:00] that's one of our best ones right there
[04:02] so far and see that's the thing with
[04:04] with Grisby and a dog like inertia it
[04:06] can take a good bit to get them into it
[04:08] by stopping when she's at peak interest
[04:10] I think we're gonna increase the odds
[04:11] that she'll be more interested in it
[04:13] next time - good girl get it good let go
[04:17] and we're gonna stop right there so we
[04:19] keep a really interested and then we'll
[04:21] revisit this maybe in a little bit since
[04:24] it inertia is only 7 months old and not
[04:26] fully grown yet
[04:27] Frisby lessons like this or kept pretty
[04:29] short and low intensity for now she
[04:31] stumbled on another frisbee that I
[04:33] brought out inertia this would be a
[04:43] significant moment let go
[04:49] yes leave it come here what's this this
[04:52] would literally mark the very first time
[04:54] that inertia has disregarded the frisbee
[04:56] she's playing with and decided to go
[04:58] after the additional frisbee good come
[05:01] on what's this oh boy
[05:04] what do we got here that does a lot
[05:06] because you're introducing a new
[05:08] dimension to the game using multiple
[05:09] frisbees which will peak many dogs
[05:11] interests secondly it lets you set up
[05:14] lots of different exercise options for
[05:16] your dog and cool fancy patterns see how
[05:18] she's like dying off a little bit let me
[05:20] see if I can get her more into the game
[05:22] by playing tug yes yeah see this is why
[05:27] tuck is important because if you take a
[05:28] step back and start playing tug and
[05:30] getting them really interested in you
[05:32] then they're more likely to be engaged
[05:34] in the game go see just like that look
[05:37] at that that's how you get yourself a
[05:38] catch one of my next medium-term goals
[05:41] with frisbee is to get her playing with
[05:43] more than one disc at a time it's a
[05:45] really great way to keep frisbees super
[05:47] extra interesting by introducing
[05:49] multiple frisbees let go yes come around
[05:53] good go
[05:57] see see how unnatural that is because
[06:00] she's like I was playing with this one
[06:03] and I want to go after that one that
[06:05] means leaving another one behind come on
[06:07] let's go yes come on look at that
[06:10] good inertia hey come on what's this
[06:16] what's that get it yeah see what I mean
[06:22] you can do stuff like that maybe we
[06:25] should just try to do the double for fun
[06:26] and see what our expression is like the
[06:28] double disc throw is exactly what it
[06:29] sounds like it's a freestyle frisbee
[06:31] move in frisbee competitions that only a
[06:33] handful of dogs can actually pull off
[06:35] I wonder if inertia ever will
[06:40] go one and oh do you see that she went
[06:45] for the first one I was hoping that she
[06:47] might glance at the second one go okay
[06:51] so we've got a long way to go before she
[06:53] can catch this double but she's showing
[06:55] promise yeah that's a nice tag there we
[06:58] go so after a little break - look at
[07:00] that intensity so her intensity is
[07:02] increasing slowly but surely come around
[07:05] and one more go good and on a success
[07:10] while she's still into it
[07:12] keep her wanting more by giving your dog
[07:14] an appropriate outlet for their energy
[07:16] like fetch and following a few other
[07:17] guidelines you can resolve all kinds of
[07:20] unwanted behaviors if you want all of my
[07:22] dog training advice in one place pick up
[07:24] both of my books and subscribe to this
[07:25] channel I'll have links in the
[07:27] description so why don't we check and
[07:29] see how inertia is doing in the bath
[07:32] it's been a while since we've done a
[07:33] bath update I've given inertia several
[07:36] baths at this point and while she does
[07:38] have some nervousness in the bath she
[07:39] generally does very well but it's still
[07:41] a delicate process so I think it's
[07:43] really important to tread pretty lightly
[07:45] during this bath it's a temperature
[07:48] right girl yes very good I'm gonna go
[07:52] real gentle since you know it's normal
[07:54] for dogs throughout that first year to
[07:56] feel a little nervous of the water and
[07:59] everything so we're gonna go nice and
[08:00] slow with her you really understanding
[08:03] see this reassurance feel nice and
[08:11] remember we've worked up to this
[08:12] overtime by giving inertia lots of
[08:14] treats and positive experience along
[08:15] with her baths even though she's a
[08:18] little more nervous here
[08:20] I've given her enough that's where I
[08:21] feel like she's going to recover in a
[08:22] moment but if your dog were extremely
[08:24] nervous you would want to go even slower
[08:26] than this weight job you're so dirty
[08:35] this reminds me that I probably need to
[08:37] use a non-slip surface or inertia in the
[08:39] future you can see here that inertia may
[08:42] be feeling a little bit anxious here by
[08:43] the way she's licking her lips
[08:44] repetitively though it might also be the
[08:46] water I got on her face to be mindful of
[08:49] body language like lip licking and
[08:51] yawning when you're training your dog in
[08:52] a potentially stressful situation this
[08:54] is your cue to go easy
[08:56] she's pretty tolerant of the bath I
[08:58] really think that's because I was really
[09:00] cautious and careful about introducing
[09:02] her to the bath and making it a fun
[09:05] experience good girl
[09:07] I'd say she's wet enough now I've been
[09:09] using this shampoo I'm almost out of it
[09:11] but I got this in a puff box as well and
[09:13] I love it so we're gonna get her all set
[09:16] it up we got this bath scrubber in our
[09:18] puff box so I'm really anxious to use
[09:20] this I love this one this is nice it's
[09:22] really easy to grip to but it really
[09:25] allows you to get all the way through to
[09:26] their skin rather than just rubbing you
[09:28] know and it really allows you to get
[09:30] super good suds and she's loving it most
[09:33] dogs seem to love it in he will happy I
[09:34] mean she's doing really well you think
[09:36] she's seven months old right now and
[09:38] she's very tolerance for the bath weight
[09:43] good girl good thing about bath time too
[09:48] it's a really good time to build trust
[09:51] with your dog and really build
[09:53] communication with them you can see how
[09:54] our training is coming together I asked
[09:56] her to wait even though you know she
[09:58] doesn't want to it's also a really good
[10:00] time to teach them how to shake off on
[10:02] cue hmm shake off I'm gonna capture the
[10:06] behavior hey you did a great job can you
[10:08] shake off shake off okay she doesn't
[10:16] quite know that one ready and shake off
[10:25] shake off today I hope to train the
[10:30] inertia how to sit pretty you know
[10:31] that's where they sit on their button
[10:33] they do this and hopefully hold that
[10:35] position but the thing about teaching
[10:37] sit pretty is there's a lot of muscle
[10:39] memory involved with it so it's not the
[10:40] type of thing you typically train in one
[10:42] session I'm gonna be using a clicker
[10:43] today remember the click just means good
[10:45] dog I like that you win a piece of meat
[10:48] I think it's extra important to use a
[10:49] clicker in the beginning stages of
[10:50] training especially if you're new to
[10:52] training a dog because it helps you get
[10:54] better with timing naturally your dog is
[10:56] gonna have to know how to sit before you
[10:57] can teach you sit pretty so that's a
[10:58] prerequisite so let's see where she is
[11:00] really what I'm watching here are her
[11:02] hips over here to make sure she's nice
[11:04] and balanced not leaning to one side not
[11:06] one leg tucked under the other because
[11:07] you want her to have a good foundation
[11:08] I'm continuing to click and reward here
[11:11] just to let her know I like that she's
[11:12] engaged and paying attention to me while
[11:14] I'm talking to you good so I'm gonna
[11:16] lure her and I'm watching to see if both
[11:18] of these feet get up off the ground get
[11:21] it yes did you see that they just barely
[11:24] got up and I genuinely have never done a
[11:27] sit pretty training session with inertia
[11:29] because until now she's been too young
[11:32] and what's up yes good and you might
[11:37] notice over here she keeps trying to
[11:38] play dead she's being a little bitey
[11:40] right now a little frustrated cuz she's
[11:42] like wait I thought I learned all of the
[11:44] tricks so there's still few more to
[11:46] learn so I have to really be patient
[11:49] with her okay I like to play dead -
[11:53] that's alright and it's okay to go ahead
[11:55] and reward the initiative - that's the
[11:57] kind of thing you just have to figure
[11:58] that out with your own dog sometimes
[12:00] it's okay to reward the initiatives
[12:01] sometimes you want to withhold just
[12:03] depending on a variety of factors
[12:05] minimizing frustration is a pretty good
[12:07] thing I'm loving the way that play dead
[12:09] is looking good job come alive no no
[12:13] come alive good job you might notice I'm
[12:16] not saying sit pretty or anything like
[12:18] that because she doesn't yet understand
[12:20] the whole trick so really I'm just
[12:22] focused on getting her into position and
[12:24] just letting her know when she's doing
[12:26] something I like by clicking and
[12:27] rewarding will teach her the actual word
[12:29] later yes good let me see if I can get
[12:32] her to hold that position a little bit
[12:34] more oops
[12:35] luring her up I'm okay that time I did
[12:39] elect to go ahead and reward her even
[12:41] though she broke that sit position just
[12:43] to keep her engaged it's all about the
[12:45] lure would sit pretty if you go too high
[12:47] they jump up off the ground like that
[12:49] and we don't want them jumping up I mean
[12:51] when we teach her to walk on her hind
[12:52] legs if we ever do that would be good
[12:54] but that's not what we're focused on
[12:56] right now so it's just I mean you want
[12:58] to keep that Lourdes glued to their nose
[13:00] yes yes good I accidentally clicked
[13:03] twice there but that was perfect
[13:04] sometimes I get really excited over
[13:07] these things that was actually my goal
[13:09] for this training session just a little
[13:11] bit of extra effort to hold that
[13:12] position so I'm gonna keep that lure
[13:14] really yes good that was awesome
[13:17] let me keep the momentum going yes do
[13:19] you see how clumsy she is when she goes
[13:21] up there the muscle memory takes time
[13:23] you can't do that in one training
[13:24] session even though I'm holding a small
[13:26] treat in my hand I'm still not letting
[13:28] inertia access it until I click that's
[13:30] when I'll release a little piece of the
[13:32] treat for her to nibble on yes I don't
[13:34] even mind that she's grabbing onto my
[13:36] arm there if that helps her that's fine
[13:38] to help her balance we try a bigger
[13:40] piece of treat gear and see if I can
[13:42] encourage her to nibble on it yeah nope
[13:45] I don't like the way she's sitting so
[13:46] home yes good good each time I'm
[13:52] clicking here I'm releasing a bit of the
[13:53] tree good girl we're off to a good start
[13:56] on sit pretty I'll continue to work with
[13:58] her on that and hopefully we'll see that
[13:59] get better if you want to see how
[14:00] inertia is doing today follow us on

TRANSCRIPTION:

[00:00] I think she sees squirrels look at that
[00:02] in this episode I'm gonna show you what
[00:05] we do to get inertias barking under
[00:07] control our daily routine and more I'm
[00:10] Zak Jorge I trained dogs this is my new
[00:13] dog and I'm gonna show you how I trained
[00:15] her from day one things definitely won't
[00:18] always go smoothly you can start from
[00:20] the beginning or you can tick up
[00:21] anywhere subscribe and hit the bell
[00:23] notification so you never miss an
[00:25] episode when you put into motion an
[00:27] approach based on love and respect your
[00:28] results will forever remain in motion
[00:31] this is inertia
[00:33] welcome to the dog training experience
[00:35] it's true inertia is so lucky today
[00:38] because she's got two different boxes to
[00:40] check out when you're choosing one of
[00:42] these boxes though consider your dog's
[00:43] individual personality this is a bark
[00:46] box and it has so many different toys
[00:47] and treats that virtually every dog
[00:50] loves this month's theme for bark box is
[00:52] the squeak easy and this is Bud the
[00:55] bouncer these toys have so much
[00:56] personality this is a nice crinkly cup
[00:59] here oh and it's got an ice cube in it
[01:01] bark toys are the best they really know
[01:03] what they're doing and they always have
[01:04] top-of-the-line treats and shoes to the
[01:06] super chewy boxes for those really rough
[01:09] players who are hard on toys and shoes
[01:11] or dogs that just love tougher toys
[01:13] every super chewy box comes with two
[01:15] bags of treats and you can see how they
[01:17] rank them right here from chewy to
[01:19] crunchy this toy is called the treat
[01:21] giver River and what you're supposed to
[01:23] do is you put this Treat in here and as
[01:26] your dog plays with it that treat should
[01:28] find its way out the other end and you
[01:30] always get to chew sticks to a nurse is
[01:32] very delicate with her shoes so you can
[01:34] choose which one that you think your dog
[01:36] is gonna like or you can get them both I
[01:38] mean it's two different experiences
[01:39] every month for your dog you can get a
[01:41] free extra month when you sign up for a
[01:42] bark box a super shooter box or both
[01:44] when you sign up for a 6 or 12 month
[01:46] subscription go to my special URLs bark
[01:48] box comm slash dog training and super
[01:50] chewy calm slash dog training I'll have
[01:52] both of those links in the description a
[01:54] lot of you guys have asked what a
[01:55] typical day of training looks like fur
[01:57] inertia and me so today I thought I
[01:59] would show you what an average day of
[02:00] training looks like and give you an
[02:02] updated version of where we are on some
[02:03] things naturally the very first thing I
[02:05] do with inertia is take her outside for
[02:07] her potty break and I actually might be
[02:09] ready to say that she is
[02:10] potty-trained and then on an average day
[02:13] like today where the weather's good I'll
[02:14] come out and do some exercise with it I
[02:16] think it's important to exercise a dog
[02:18] early in the day because they've just
[02:20] woken up they have all of this energy
[02:21] and it's nice to get that layer of
[02:22] energy out plus it gets them in a really
[02:24] good mood and optimistic about training
[02:26] and just makes the whole day go a lot
[02:28] smoother especially if you have a more
[02:29] energetic dog
[02:30] there ya go good nice leaping catch come
[02:33] on
[02:34] Oh a little distracted we'll look at
[02:37] that decision good girl she loves this
[02:39] toy come on bring it to me and again
[02:42] this is the value of a new toy by
[02:44] exercising her like this she's gonna be
[02:46] much more behaved on a walk because she
[02:48] doesn't have all that extra energy let
[02:50] go good come around ready
[02:54] go get it it's a super - err - Oi so in
[02:57] nurses doing relatively well here she's
[02:59] pretty focused she's not running after
[03:00] the other dog who's actually playing for
[03:02] it's me today what a great looking
[03:03] frisbee dog when they're panting like
[03:05] that that's the time to take them on
[03:06] their training walks where they're
[03:07] leisurely walks and that is a dog primed
[03:10] for training right there that's what I
[03:12] love to see what do you think are you
[03:14] ready to go take a walk
[03:15] typically our morning exercise sessions
[03:17] or walks will last 45 minutes to an hour
[03:19] or so on these walks like the emphasis
[03:22] for me is more on exercising her at
[03:25] least on the morning walk so I'm much
[03:26] more tolerant of things like the pulling
[03:28] and letting or look at the squirrels cuz
[03:30] it's important for her to just get out
[03:31] and check everything out wake up be
[03:34] optimistic about her day I think how
[03:36] lovely it is when we as people take our
[03:38] morning walks in the neighborhood or a
[03:40] park or whatever it helps us get our
[03:42] head straight and I I really think the
[03:43] same is true with our dogs good girl
[03:47] I think she sees squirrels look at that
[03:49] good 1 2 3 4 of them right there now I'm
[03:53] gonna try to get her attention okay
[03:55] let's go come on bye yes there we go
[03:59] good job good wait
[04:04] lie down
[04:06] okay sit look at you showoff
[04:12] can you hold it yes I'll take it I'll
[04:15] take it that's a good effort also during
[04:18] a walk I'll briefly ask her to do basic
[04:20] things every few minutes or so but I
[04:22] don't dwell on strict training during
[04:24] the morning walk she's been sleeping all
[04:25] night and it's only fair that she get
[04:27] out and enjoy this wonderful place just
[04:29] like we do one of the things that
[04:31] inertia loves doing on her walks is just
[04:33] looking at the squirrels or the Ducks or
[04:36] they geese I mean this park has so many
[04:38] different forms of little critters so I
[04:40] find that if I just meet her halfway and
[04:42] if I let her observe the squirrels and
[04:44] check them out that she's much less
[04:46] likely to react negatively in other
[04:48] words by trying to rush her past
[04:49] distractions she's more likely to be
[04:51] like hey wait a minute I want to see
[04:52] those personally I think it's very
[04:53] important to let our dogs satisfy their
[04:55] curiosities like that and check out
[04:57] these different things if you're having
[04:59] issues on walks at all I'd strongly
[05:01] recommend getting my book guide to a
[05:03] well-behaved dog in that book I fully
[05:05] detail what every walk should look like
[05:07] so if you want to teach your dog to walk
[05:08] politely check that book out I'll have a
[05:10] link below and when we get home from her
[05:12] exercise session whether it be walk or
[05:14] fetch I like to then give her a nice
[05:16] extended break I know that she really
[05:19] loves hanging out here on the deck you
[05:21] want this treat there you go take - good
[05:27] job and so this is a good opportunity to
[05:29] practice her real-life settle and see
[05:31] how she's doing
[05:32] in ersten you want to come over here lie
[05:35] down and settle very good this is one of
[05:39] her favorite places to hang out she
[05:40] likes being in the shade under the tree
[05:42] and who wouldn't right inertia is so
[05:45] well-behaved
[05:46] around the house especially when she
[05:48] gets that morning exercise she's just
[05:50] like the perfect dog and you can tell a
[05:52] difference and contrary to what you
[05:53] might think you don't need to be
[05:55] constantly training your dog all day
[05:57] long give them some time but you're
[05:59] entitled of time for yourself as well so
[06:01] this is a time of day when I'd like to
[06:03] get a lot of my own work done so at some
[06:05] point in the day after she's recovered
[06:06] and she's mentally fresh I like to focus
[06:09] on doing just general training here in
[06:11] the house in order to make sure that
[06:12] she's mentally exercised as well so the
[06:15] way I like to start off a training
[06:17] session with her is to see if I can get
[06:18] her plane
[06:19] with the toy and you can see she's
[06:21] really ready to interact for it she'll
[06:22] do all sorts of things lie down
[06:24] play dead play dead okay I'll take it
[06:33] very good look how she just snaps up
[06:35] right there she loves playing go keep
[06:38] going keep going keep going yes good job
[06:42] stand lie down
[06:45] stand lie down okay good job we haven't
[06:49] done this one in a while
[06:50] get your tail yeah I mean the spirit of
[06:57] it is there
[06:58] she didn't grab it but she's trying it's
[07:00] really hard for her grab her tail but
[07:02] let's try it let's see if we can get
[07:03] lucky here get your tail keep going get
[07:07] it get that tail get your tail get it
[07:11] get that tail yeah good girl she's
[07:14] retained that one good job yes there we
[07:20] go okay okay get down
[07:27] so you know you can see she's feeling
[07:29] pretty confident here she's doing a good
[07:30] job then I'll work with her on something
[07:32] new so one of the things that I'm
[07:33] currently trying to teach her is how to
[07:35] do a back stall while I move she's
[07:38] really good at staying up there but if I
[07:39] start to move she gets a little unsteady
[07:43] yes that's actually quite good okay
[07:53] good nice job so that was pretty good I
[07:55] wonder if she can do it while I stand
[07:57] though that's the harder type of back
[07:58] stall stay so oh good girl very good
[08:04] that was that was a good try right there
[08:06] that was her first time holding it but
[08:08] you can see how she started to get a
[08:10] little uneasy I want to be able to walk
[08:11] around all day long with her on my back
[08:13] like that you know so let's see if we
[08:15] can practice that ready stop stay wait
[08:20] we're gonna move wait stop so it looks
[08:26] like holding a treat up as a lure seems
[08:28] to really keep her focused on getting
[08:29] her a little bit more stabilized good
[08:31] girl okay
[08:32] good job nice work okay so inertia is
[08:35] showing some progress on standing on my
[08:38] back wall I move around but we're gonna
[08:39] have to practice that a little bit more
[08:41] one of the things that I like to work
[08:43] with her on pretty regularly too is
[08:44] retrieving new and random objects so for
[08:47] example I'm gonna put this toy right
[08:49] here stay it's not moving get it good
[08:56] bring it to me it's a start that's good
[09:01] I appreciate that
[09:02] she's doing well with retrieving the toy
[09:04] let me see if she can retrieve something
[09:06] a little more unorthodox come on bring
[09:12] it to me let's go it's a start I haven't
[09:17] actually worked with inertia on fetching
[09:19] food yet you can see she really wants to
[09:22] pick it up but she's also struggling
[09:24] with this inner conflict of what it's
[09:26] food not a toy and you know you might be
[09:28] asking why is this useful this is just a
[09:31] really good mental exercise that can
[09:33] come in very handy later maybe if you're
[09:34] interested in service dog training this
[09:36] is something that you'll want to teach
[09:38] your dog as well sometimes you
[09:40] want your dog to get you a banana this
[09:44] is for me okay you can have some light
[09:49] out that's pretty good here you go you
[09:53] know it gives me an idea she likes this
[09:55] so much and her nails are ready for a
[09:57] trim I wonder if I can use this to get
[10:00] her to be cooperative on getting a nail
[10:01] trim stay yeah so a nurse is very
[10:12] tolerant of her nails being trimmed or
[10:14] dremeled like this she doesn't exactly
[10:16] love it but she puts up with it and
[10:18] she's steadily improving on her reaction
[10:20] to it I mean who could blame her it's
[10:21] got to be a little ticklish right since
[10:23] inertia has so much hair I like to brush
[10:26] her often as well keep those tangles out
[10:29] it's a good time to inspect your dog and
[10:31] see how they're looking overall and he
[10:33] issues developing good girl she loves it
[10:36] on her chest right here it's her
[10:38] favorite part and I like to end our
[10:39] grooming and training sessions like this
[10:41] on a positive note let it go chase her
[10:44] toy I might even let her run around with
[10:46] that one for a little bit and now I just
[10:47] like to let her do her own thing explore
[10:49] walk around play with things and just be
[10:52] a dog you know Indiana nurse show we'll
[10:54] probably have a play session we'll see
[10:56] how they're doing with that and I'll
[10:57] show you what I'm doing when inertia and
[10:59] now much larger than Indy or at least
[11:01] taller gets out of control and I get her
[11:04] to calm down on cue but they get into
[11:06] these wonderful play sessions but I
[11:08] don't want inertia coming on too strong
[11:10] and being too rough with Indy
[11:13] you can see Indy Indy has been afraid to
[11:15] let inertia know what's up and inertia
[11:16] definitely respects Indy's Eldar status
[11:20] and so this is a balance between having
[11:22] the two play together but making sure
[11:24] that inertia doesn't get too rough with
[11:26] her inertia and he's done playing that's
[11:29] enough come here lie down relax very
[11:33] good and so the moment she gets a little
[11:36] too rough for my liking there I'll just
[11:38] intervene and say something like Indy
[11:40] doesn't want to play anymore or that's
[11:42] enough or whatever and then I'll escort
[11:44] her away by calling her and having her
[11:46] settle down over here and just relax for
[11:48] a second and then depending on context
[11:50] sometimes they'll say okay go play again
[11:52] or
[11:52] that's enough we're all done just
[11:54] depending on mainly Indies mood and what
[11:56] she's feeling like and I'm looking at
[11:58] indie and indie looks like she's still
[11:59] receptive to playing a little bit so I
[12:01] guess I'll let them continue okay go on
[12:04] go play with indie but this is something
[12:06] that both dogs really enjoy every day
[12:09] just playing a few times throughout the
[12:10] day and wrestling around and just be in
[12:13] dogs together
[12:14] I can watch dogs play all day long one
[12:17] of the nurses favorite activities to do
[12:18] throughout the day is just to stare
[12:21] outside and watch people walk by and she
[12:24] especially loves it when dogs walk by
[12:26] it's a pretty populated part of town so
[12:28] this happens on a pretty consistent
[12:29] basis throughout the day I don't mind at
[12:32] all if inertia looks out the window she
[12:35] seems to find a lot of gratification and
[12:37] then she's learning stuff about her
[12:39] world that's great however what I don't
[12:41] like are the barking out first so right
[12:44] now I'm trying to teach her how to look
[12:46] and enjoy what she's seeing without
[12:48] completely losing her mind and so when
[12:51] she does that my protocol is call her to
[12:54] me so let's give it a shot
[12:56] inertia come and you can see she snaps
[12:59] right into it I love that good girl I'm
[13:01] gonna give her a treat so the reason
[13:04] that I choose to call her in that
[13:05] situation is because it's completely
[13:07] incompatible with standing at the window
[13:09] and barking whatever's out there Plus
[13:12] come Lane called is such an important
[13:13] skill I practiced this really often all
[13:16] the time throughout the day but like
[13:17] right now everything's died off she's
[13:19] not really interested in barking at the
[13:21] thing let's see if she comes to me
[13:22] inertia come good job that's right and
[13:29] wherever possible I try to let her go
[13:31] back to doing whatever it is she wants
[13:32] to do provided it's not working out of
[13:34] the window or something else
[13:35] unacceptable to let her know that hey
[13:36] coming to me doesn't mean you're gonna
[13:38] be restrained and have to sit and stay
[13:40] though sometimes it does mean that but a
[13:42] lot of times I like to let her know just
[13:44] come to me then you can get back to
[13:45] doing what you're doing
[13:46] she's getting excited here when packages
[13:48] get delivered you can see she tends to
[13:51] bark at that inertia cub we do have a
[13:54] lot of packages delivered good girl lie
[13:56] down good girl she's here slide into her
[14:00] down light up
[14:01] good girl this gives you an idea of what
[14:04] an average day looks like for us now
[14:07] some days we're gonna do a little bit
[14:08] more some days we may even do a little
[14:10] bit less I actually give her a couple of
[14:12] days off every week where we don't do
[14:13] much at all just to let her completely
[14:15] be a dog and do her own thing at this
[14:17] point in the game she's 11 months old it
[14:19] doesn't take as much time to work with
[14:21] her an absolutely every little thing
[14:23] because the communication between us has
[14:25] been built so well so we just tried to
[14:28] build on that communication pretty
[14:30] regularly on a daily basis in the next
[14:32] episode I'll show you what we're doing
[14:33] to improve a nurse's conduct around
[14:36] other dogs remember you'll get a free

[00:36] guessing you've probably got a new puppy
[00:38] one of the best things that I could
[00:39] possibly recommend to a new puppy parent
[00:42] is a subscription to pub box papac's is
[00:45] a monthly box that includes items
[00:47] specifically designed to help you train
[00:49] your puppy based on their current age
[00:51] that's what makes pup box different so
[00:53] you always get lots of relevant items
[00:55] for whatever phase your puppy is going
[00:56] through and you get this surprisingly
[00:58] detailed training guide in every box as

[01:02] tons of advice on teething

[01:06] one's a puzzle game right here put that
[01:08] in there and teach your dog to take it
[01:10] out if you wanted you've got to have
[01:12] your dynamic squeaky ball you get so
[01:14] much in your monthly box training
[01:16] inertia would not have been the same
[01:18] without getting our pup box every month
[01:19] and now that inertia is one year old she
[01:21] gets an adult box she's definitely gonna
[01:23] love this and the good news is our

[01:39] literally started filming the moment we

[01:43] documented how we resolved her puppy
[01:45] biting and everything else and how long
[01:47] it took and I'm gonna show you
[01:48] everything we did to stop her puppy
[01:51] biting today I'm also gonna have a link
[01:53] to a playlist in the description
[01:54] featuring all of a nurses training it's
[01:57] literally the most detailed puppy
[01:59] training series in history and we're
[02:01] continuing to show you how in Ursa is
[02:02] doing on Instagram too so follow us over
[02:05] there as well I also have two books I
[02:07] recommend you get them both but if you
[02:09] do have to choose one this is a really
[02:11] good overview dog training rebel
[02:12] lucien of raising and training a dog the
[02:14] basics whereas my second book guide to a
[02:16] well-behaved dog really focuses on dog
[02:19] training specific issues anxiety issues
[02:22] basic training and more and both of
[02:24] these books have a 4.6 star rating on
[02:26] amazon i'll have links below now that an
[02:28] Ursa is a year old for unwanted puppy
[02:30] biting is well under control and it has
[02:32] been for some time my goal has always
[02:34] been the teacher that biting is okay as
[02:36] long as it's with permission and with
[02:38] stuff that I approve of when we first
[02:40] got inertia she was pretty subdued in
[02:42] fact she spent most of her time sleeping
[02:44] this is really common especially when
[02:46] they're young and so much is going on so
[02:48] I was wondering I mean did I actually
[02:50] get lucky and just happened to get a
[02:52] puppy that didn't bite and no inertia
[02:56] was actually one of the most significant
[02:58] puppy biters that I've ever encountered
[02:59] she'd bite my flesh and it would hurt
[03:02] she'd bite of my clothes any chance she
[03:04] got especially shoelaces man did she
[03:07] love shoelaces and of course biting her
[03:10] leash was irresistible it's like if it
[03:13] existed she was gonna bite it inertia
[03:16] had three really distinct biting habits
[03:18] that needed attention and all of them
[03:20] took different amounts of time to
[03:21] resolve the first one was probably the
[03:24] most obnoxious and that's of course
[03:25] biting flesh see there's a bite of the
[03:28] arm ouch that's too hard she left a
[03:31] little mark there
[03:32] remember puppies bite because they're
[03:34] teething and they want to engage you in
[03:37] the most natural way that they know how
[03:39] to do that is with their mouths
[03:41] puppies start going to grab things that
[03:43] interest them just like infants will
[03:45] grab things that interest them in fact I
[03:47] believe we should nurture this curiosity
[03:49] and encourage them to grab things well
[03:51] we need to show them what's okay to grab
[03:53] and what is it so when your puppy does
[03:56] fight you redirecting their attention
[03:57] onto a toy or into a training session is
[04:00] the way to go and I know what you're
[04:01] thinking that's easier said than done
[04:03] isn't it so let me show you how we
[04:05] actually got it done from start to
[04:07] finish we're in that prime teething
[04:09] season and biting season right now she
[04:11] just bites and bites everything that she
[04:13] comes into contact with you can just
[04:15] look at my arms right here
[04:16] there's bite marks all over them as I
[04:18] tell you guys very often it's not
[04:20] reasonable to expect the dog to just
[04:23] stop biting it gets worse before it gets
[04:25] better
[04:26] this age I've been really careful to
[04:27] give her plenty of things that are
[04:29] acceptable to buy it on because they
[04:31] need to bite at this age so obviously
[04:33] lots of play lots of chew toys
[04:35] lots of biting it's the points in short
[04:37] I'm not discouraging the biting I'm
[04:39] encouraging the biting but with
[04:41] acceptable items because I have lots of
[04:43] plans for her to use that mouth to grab
[04:45] all sorts of things and use it for
[04:46] training and reward so I want her really
[04:48] comfortable biting and I want her to
[04:50] know how to bite and when to bite and
[04:52] when it's socially acceptable and when
[04:54] it's not okay here's how inertia was
[04:56] looking almost two weeks later
[04:58] so the biting is definitely being
[05:00] reduced because I'm consistently
[05:02] redirecting her when she bites too hard
[05:04] or getting her too engaged in a play
[05:06] session or she's really rambunctious
[05:07] just giving her a brief timeout to calm
[05:10] down I say this because even at three
[05:12] weeks in I still have a dog that is
[05:13] puppy biting it does go on for an
[05:15] extended period of time what you're
[05:17] looking for is slow steady reduction
[05:19] over that period of time but we probably
[05:21] still have another few weeks of puppy
[05:23] biting in store after three weeks we
[05:26] were definitely seeing progress but she
[05:28] was still biting and you know what
[05:30] that's pretty normal guys puppies have
[05:32] to both make it through their teething
[05:33] phase and gain the experience and
[05:35] communication with you that they need in
[05:37] order to have some self-control and if
[05:39] you think about it that is a lot to ask
[05:40] of an animal that's only been on this
[05:42] planet for ten weeks or so in the
[05:45] meantime in addition to getting really
[05:47] good at redirecting your puppy when they
[05:48] want to bite we cannot forget about
[05:51] management in the case of puppy biting
[05:53] this means having your dog on leash so
[05:55] that you can restrict them from having
[05:56] access to family members small children
[05:58] or anything else inappropriate that they
[06:00] want to bite it's also important to
[06:02] proactively desensitize them to being
[06:04] touched like this so I've really been
[06:06] prioritizing getting her comfortable of
[06:08] being touched like her feet her nails
[06:10] her years touching her teeth brushing
[06:13] her teeth and everything so with a puppy
[06:14] like this I mean everyday just spend a
[06:16] lot of time giving them a massage and of
[06:19] course it makes it a lot easier when you
[06:20] let them nibble on a tasty treat like
[06:22] this - it keeps them occupied and it
[06:24] also conditions them to enjoy the actual
[06:26] touching good job honey now you might be
[06:29] wondering about doing something like
[06:30] squealing or saying ouch
[06:32] every time your puppy bites you it
[06:34] doesn't hurt to do that but I've always
[06:35] thought that it's a somewhat superficial
[06:37] way to address this because it really
[06:39] address
[06:39] is the symptom you know your dog biting
[06:41] you and not really the cause which is
[06:43] your dog's desire to interact with you
[06:45] that's why I think it's really important
[06:47] to focus on teaching your dog what they
[06:49] should do like biting appropriate toys
[06:51] or focus their excess energy on training
[06:53] by the time inertia was eleven and a
[06:55] half weeks old we were starting to see
[06:56] some really obvious signs that she was
[06:58] learning how to not bite our flesh if
[07:01] you're really trying to measure progress
[07:02] I think one of the things that you
[07:04] should be looking for are greater
[07:05] instances of your puppy licking you
[07:07] where they used to bite you yes so that
[07:11] is like she has just started probably in
[07:13] the last 24 hours starting to lick where
[07:16] she would otherwise bite the reason I'm
[07:18] excited about the licking is because
[07:19] that's what biting evolves into if
[07:22] you're doing your job right that's a
[07:23] good way to measure progress he looked
[07:25] fighting ouch that one's a little hard
[07:28] yes good I'll take the new cute I will
[07:31] in hindsight that was actually pretty
[07:33] much the last day a nurse show was
[07:35] significantly biting our flesh so that
[07:37] painful biting of the flesh started to
[07:40] fade out pretty quickly but there were
[07:41] still other types of biting we had to
[07:43] contend with next to chomping down on my
[07:45] skin and nurses second favorite thing to
[07:47] bite were my clothes and my shoelaces
[07:49] this is a clip of nine week old inertia
[07:52] and as you can see she definitely loved
[07:54] biting my ankles my shoelaces can't stay
[07:57] tied for more than a minute or so I
[07:59] think my shoelaces were actually untied
[08:02] for a nurses entire ninth week of life
[08:04] and you guys know how much I love my
[08:06] shoes right so this was a really hard
[08:09] time for me so obviously I had to get
[08:12] that under control here's how we dealt
[08:13] with clothes and shoelace biting I've
[08:16] been doing a lot of redirecting when
[08:17] she's chewing my shoelace like that you
[08:20] know I have lots of these toys on
[08:21] standby to try and get her attention on
[08:23] it rather than disciplining her and
[08:25] getting her in that frustrated mindset
[08:27] of oh gosh what did I do wrong this time
[08:28] I still want to keep her in a really
[08:30] trainable up Eve mindset remember when
[08:33] your puppy is biting you basically have
[08:35] three options redirect them into some
[08:37] type of play session with a toy redirect
[08:39] them into a training session using
[08:41] treats or give them a brief timeout if
[08:43] they're just too overstimulated or
[08:45] you're unable or unwilling to tend to
[08:47] them at that particular time by timeout
[08:49] I simply mean giving them a break in
[08:51] their puppy
[08:51] for many of you that might be a crate or
[08:53] their exercise pen or spare room in the
[08:55] house and make sure they have plenty of
[08:57] safe things to chew on while they're in
[08:59] there you know things like this that
[09:01] have varying textures are really good I
[09:03] told you pop box had you covered what
[09:05] you do and your puppy bites you depends
[09:07] in part on what mood your dog is in
[09:09] sometimes they're in the mood to play or
[09:11] other times they're in the mood for a
[09:12] training session so make sure to be
[09:14] flexible depending on how your dog is
[09:16] feeling in that particular moment in
[09:18] this clip I'm about to show you you're
[09:20] gonna see me attempting to get
[09:21] nine-week-old inertia into playing with
[09:23] the toy spoiler alert it's not gonna
[09:26] work so we're gonna try initiating a
[09:28] training session using food instead
[09:30] let's get get look at that she's
[09:35] thinking about it she's like no take the
[09:37] shoelace
[09:37] she's been loving this toy all day but
[09:39] for whatever reason she prefers the
[09:40] shoelace right now so I tell you what
[09:43] let's try something a little bit
[09:44] different let me see if I can get her
[09:46] attention off of the shoelace the job
[09:49] I'm gonna just click her and reward her
[09:51] for paying attention to the lure let's
[09:53] see if we can get her over here okay I
[09:55] love it
[09:57] remember the clicker just means good dog
[09:58] I like what you did here is something
[10:00] great how about a sit yes and she's
[10:03] gonna go and do it down cuz I already
[10:05] know that so I'm gonna say down good job
[10:07] to be clear I am NOT rewarding her for
[10:10] chewing the shoelace I'm rewarding or
[10:11] for following my lure going into a sit a
[10:14] down and of course they're gonna be
[10:15] times where your dog doesn't want to
[10:17] play or do a training session in those
[10:19] times it might be best to give your dog
[10:20] a little bit of alone time and just
[10:22] refrain from interacting with them I
[10:24] mean sometimes you just have to let your
[10:25] puppy be a puppy for a while alright so
[10:28] that's the bottom line but this didn't
[10:29] magically just stop her shoelace and
[10:32] pants biting overnight
[10:33] I've had an Ursa now for three weeks and
[10:36] honestly one of the big roadblocks that
[10:38] we've had to encounter is constant
[10:40] biting at my shoelaces so on this day I
[10:42] decided that I really needed to be able
[10:44] to just walk around without having a
[10:47] puppy attached to my ankle at all times
[10:49] here's how I did it my goal here is to
[10:51] be able to walk back and forth on this
[10:53] carpet right here without her biting my
[10:55] shoelaces are you ready okay come on yes
[10:58] so literally on one step I've been
[11:02] giving her a treat just to let her know
[11:04] I appreciate that
[11:05] not biting my shoelaces those of you who
[11:07] have really rambunctious puppy biters
[11:09] who just go at your shoes constantly
[11:11] will know what I'm talking about here
[11:12] see how she's thinking about going for
[11:13] my shoelaces right there it's just on
[11:15] the tail end I hope of getting resolved
[11:17] yes right there she thought better of it
[11:19] she went into a sit and decided not to
[11:21] go for my laces here's how inertia
[11:23] looked after another few days of doing
[11:25] that you can see even some of that
[11:26] shoelace fighting is still around though
[11:28] we have definitely made progress on it
[11:31] that's enough easy thank you
[11:39] yes good job very good so the behavior
[11:42] is being reduced that was an unfortunate
[11:44] relapse there but that's what you deal
[11:46] with when you have a puppy she's quite
[11:48] predictable as puppy's off and on for
[11:50] example I know that if I get up right
[11:52] now there's a good chance she's gonna go
[11:54] over my pant leg or something the first
[11:56] thing to remember is to get very good at
[11:57] redirecting and acknowledging when your
[11:59] dog is not biting especially when you
[12:01] can tell they're exhibiting even minor
[12:04] restraint yep you see how quick I'm
[12:07] acknowledging huh
[12:09] leave it right there yes did you see
[12:11] that really good moment she started to
[12:13] go for my shoes she's like wait a minute
[12:15] I think I'm not supposed to do this I
[12:16] really want that chicken what do I have
[12:18] to do to get it that's what puppy biting
[12:19] is all about if you're a beginner and
[12:21] you've never trained a puppy before
[12:23] getting really good at managing puppy
[12:25] biting requires excellent timing which
[12:27] requires experience but if you're really
[12:30] committed and you're into training your
[12:31] dog you'll be there but understand there
[12:33] is a learning curve and that's okay it's
[12:35] gonna make you a better trainer in the
[12:36] long term if you prioritize getting
[12:38] really good with your timing now and
[12:40] after another few days of practice you
[12:42] could really start to see inertia resist
[12:45] the urge to bite my shoes in my pants
[12:47] sometimes it's really difficult to
[12:49] realize that your puppy is actually
[12:51] improving when you're deep in the puppy
[12:53] biting phase but noticing those small
[12:55] moments of restraint and really
[12:57] celebrating them with your dog will go a
[12:59] long way we're still working on the
[13:01] shoelace thing and I'm not gonna hide my
[13:03] shoes in fact let's see we leave it
[13:05] alone so she's like I'll leave your
[13:08] shoelaces alone but I'll bite your thumb
[13:10] instead
[13:11] ouch
[13:12] leave it yes good I think she's starting
[13:19] to anticipate treats here what's this
[13:21] leave it alone yes him you sit nice and
[13:26] give me it down oh look at that it can
[13:28] be obnoxious right now I'm focused on
[13:30] making a dog training video but she
[13:32] keeps interfering with my points so I'm
[13:34] having to stop what I'm doing and
[13:35] focused directly on her so that I can
[13:38] teach her yes very good
[13:40] notice the position of my shoe right now
[13:42] I'm not keeping it away from her I want
[13:44] to be able to put that shoelace right
[13:46] under her nose
[13:47] and have her leave it alone once your
[13:49] puppy is able to leave your shoes alone
[13:51] while they're still like this it's time
[13:53] to up the ante and have them practice
[13:55] leaving you alone while you're moving I
[13:57] mean there are so many dimensions to
[13:59] this I mean leaving your shoes alone is
[14:01] one thing but you really have to break
[14:03] this challenge down and give your dog
[14:05] experience with leaving things alone in
[14:07] as many situations as you can think of
[14:10] in order to really help them generalize
[14:12] the idea I mean what a project right
[14:14] notice how she's not going for my laces
[14:17] as she has in past leash walking
[14:18] sessions so that's improvement okay come
[14:21] here
[14:21] oh she thought about it can you give me
[14:25] a sit I'll take it you see how she's
[14:28] just now really fighting that urge to go
[14:30] into the biting the pant legs and biting
[14:33] the shoelaces because that's what's
[14:34] natural for her to want to do so this is
[14:36] starting to get a little bit of traction
[14:38] and this is really the last time that I
[14:40] remember any significant biting of my
[14:41] shoelaces or my pants once your dog
[14:44] really starts to understand what you
[14:46] want you have to remain consistent but
[14:49] if you do you should start to see the
[14:50] biting fade out much more quickly in
[14:53] fact by the time inertia was 14 weeks
[14:55] hold virtually all of her puppy biting
[14:57] habits were under control except for one
[15:00] it was really hard for her to resist
[15:02] biting her leash and I'm talking about
[15:04] that really excessive kind of leash
[15:06] biting that interrupts any meaningful
[15:08] training opportunity that you could
[15:09] possibly hope to have it's hard to blame
[15:12] her it's basically a long string tie
[15:14] that's constantly attached to her it
[15:16] takes a lot of self-control to resist
[15:18] something that's just dangling in front
[15:19] of your face all the time
[15:21] here's how we focused on getting her
[15:22] leash biting or just under control
[15:25] a nurses puppy biting is definitely
[15:27] subsiding and getting more under control
[15:29] with the exception of probably biting at
[15:31] the lead so this is still something that
[15:33] really tempts them sometimes I'll use
[15:35] this long 15 foot lead before a potty
[15:37] break or before training session you can
[15:39] see how dangly it is now of course with
[15:41] the gentle leave it I can get her to
[15:43] stop there as long as I get her focused
[15:44] on me and I'm careful to go ahead and
[15:46] follow that up with a reward I like to
[15:48] do many dedicated training sessions to
[15:50] things like this to help inertia
[15:52] understand how I want her to behave
[15:54] leave it
[15:55] yes good so when your dog is doing
[16:00] something predictable preemptive
[16:02] undesirable behaviors before they occur
[16:03] once something has happened twice in a
[16:06] row its pattern so bottom line the
[16:08] biting of my flesh faded out first that
[16:10] took about three weeks of training it
[16:12] took about four weeks to get her shoe
[16:14] and pants biting under control and it
[16:16] took about six weeks to get her super
[16:18] excessive leash biting under control so
[16:20] remember the puppy biting phase is just
[16:22] part of having a puppy it will get
[16:24] better get fifty percent off of your

[00:56] enter code Zach 30 L have a link in the
[00:58] description below so today I'm hoping to
[01:01] take you along as we do some heel
[01:03] training in public she's really good at
[01:05] home or in the driveway but when you
[01:07] come to a place like this things can be
[01:09] a little more challenging I got my green
[01:10] juice and we're just gonna hang out here
[01:12] and let her adjust and once I feel like
[01:14] she's adjusted and she's not like whoa
[01:16] what's all this stuff around here who
[01:17] are these people what's that dog then
[01:19] we're gonna focus on training
[01:24] alright I'm done it's time to train you
[01:26] now so the next thing I'm doing is
[01:28] getting her familiar with the path just
[01:30] letting her smell it and acclimate
[01:32] herself to where she is heel is where
[01:34] your dog stays by your side whether
[01:36] you're standing still or moving you'll
[01:38] remember that one of the prerequisites
[01:39] to teaching your dog heels that you can
[01:41] reliably get their attention on you look
[01:43] at me yes look at me
[01:47] yes good she's relatively adjusted now
[01:51] we've practiced look at me now I want to
[01:53] practice putting her in the heel
[01:55] position and make sure that she'll do
[01:57] that willingly she's feeling a little
[02:00] anxious today and I suspect that's
[02:02] because she's ready to get into training
[02:03] a little bit more am I being too boring
[02:05] okay I'll be more exciting come here
[02:07] there we go look at that there you go
[02:10] you know earlier in this series we
[02:12] covered how to teach your dog this spin
[02:13] into that position and so that's
[02:15] something we've been practicing a lot
[02:17] come here heal good and then switch I
[02:20] know she gets a little confused on
[02:23] switch sometimes but that's okay good
[02:25] job so now that she's reliably doing
[02:27] that I'm just gonna focus on walking
[02:29] making sure that you'll pay attention to
[02:30] me for many seconds at a time slow down
[02:33] inertia yes good come here this way good
[02:43] so when you first start training he'll
[02:45] you'll hold up a lure like that right
[02:48] gives him a target to look at she's
[02:50] doing great she knows you got a treat
[02:52] she's like all right if I pay attention
[02:54] I'll probably get that reward switch yes
[02:59] good here slowly faster let's go faster
[03:08] yeah she's really good about stopping
[03:10] when I stop we've established that she
[03:12] likes looking at the treat right so the
[03:14] next thing that I really want to be
[03:15] focused on with her is teaching her how
[03:17] to look at my hand signal and this is
[03:18] something we're facing in every once in
[03:20] a while when her interest fades I'll go
[03:21] back and let her know I've got that
[03:23] treat and use it as a lure so I'm not
[03:24] afraid to do that but I also want to
[03:26] have her be less dependent on holding a
[03:28] treat up in other words I want her to be
[03:29] able to respond to a hand signal or a
[03:31] hear or look at me or whatever you would
[03:33] like to say to your dog
[03:35] switch good look at me come on and
[03:38] switch yes that's called heal yes with
[03:44] field training especially in
[03:46] environments like this you don't want to
[03:47] make the mistake of phasing out treats
[03:48] too early and in real formal sessions
[03:51] like this I'll even reward pretty
[03:53] generously when I'm doing more casual
[03:55] training I might not reward quite so
[03:56] much I'll train at 30 seconds here in 30
[03:58] seconds there lay down go on stand yes
[04:08] good that was exciting
[04:12] easy
[04:17] come on yep good we're also mindful to
[04:24] keep practicing different turns by
[04:26] taking heel to the next level I want her
[04:28] to be able to do a right turn a left
[04:29] turn be able to speed up or slow down
[04:31] it's really important for her to pay
[04:33] attention to me and stay at my side
[04:34] under a variety of different
[04:36] circumstances sometimes I'll have her
[04:38] turn and stay on one side other times
[04:40] I'll turn and keep her on the same side
[04:42] so she doesn't have to switch at all so
[04:44] it just depends I want her to understand
[04:45] all of those nuances in heel training
[04:48] okay you earned it you earned it
[04:51] it's important to to be really cognizant
[04:53] of your dog's body language in their
[04:55] state of mind but if you notice your dog
[04:57] is frustrated or they're not
[04:58] particularly enjoying the training
[05:00] session that's your cue to take a break
[05:01] fighting the leash like this seems like
[05:03] a nurses way of expressing a little
[05:04] impatience she seems to be saying let's
[05:06] play give me a treat what more do you
[05:08] want you'll be amazed what a two or
[05:10] three-minute break might do to your
[05:12] training session so I'm sure to take
[05:13] breaks very often with inertia we make
[05:15] it a point to practice this a few times
[05:17] a week and I notice that at least in a
[05:19] nurse's case sometimes she's really on
[05:21] and sometimes she's like I'm not so much
[05:23] in the mood so I have to be really aware
[05:25] of those things and do my best to really
[05:27] motivate her to want to do the training
[05:29] session with me it's normal to for many
[05:31] dogs to pay attention to you and then
[05:33] get a little distracted but look for
[05:34] those moments where they voluntarily
[05:36] give you their attention especially
[05:37] without you asking for it heel is the
[05:39] most disciplined form of leash walking
[05:41] and it requires a lot of brain power
[05:42] from our dogs and if you're always
[05:44] insisting on a proper heel it doesn't
[05:46] really give your dog an outlet to see
[05:48] smell and experience their environment
[05:49] and that really is a huge part of having
[05:51] a dog so it's good for mental exercise
[05:53] and it's great for certain situations
[05:55] especially in cities but it's not a
[05:57] substitute for more relaxed leash
[05:59] walking
[05:59] I'm periodically testing inertia by
[06:01] continuing to give her more challenging
[06:03] training scenarios with the nursery
[06:05] being now around one-year-old it's time
[06:07] to start teaching her how to be more
[06:08] reliable in a variety of different
[06:10] environments and in different contexts
[06:12] I'm visiting my brothers and my
[06:13] sister-in-law and my niece actually here
[06:16] in Atlanta so the way that I like to
[06:17] really introduce off-leash training is
[06:19] to seek out unfamiliar but still safe
[06:22] and secure areas in this case the yard
[06:24] is completely fenced see it's really
[06:26] important in the beginning stages that
[06:28] the environment is completely secure but
[06:31] the trick is your dog shouldn't realize
[06:33] that over the next 12 months or so I
[06:35] really want to do extensive testing
[06:38] before trusting her off leash so I've
[06:40] got her on a 50 foot lead right now just
[06:42] to make sure she's reliable before I
[06:44] take her off double controlled
[06:45] environments of them best my dog has
[06:47] disappeared inertia come there we go
[06:50] there's a good recall yes good girl all
[06:55] right you might know that I like to give
[06:57] my dog some time to adapt and adjust in
[07:02] a new place so that's what I'm doing
[07:04] right now I'm just letting her explore
[07:05] being as tolerant as I can so that she
[07:08] is able to satisfy some of that
[07:09] curiosity I first want to make sure that
[07:12] she'll come to me especially when her
[07:13] attention is divided like this I mean
[07:14] you can see she really wants to get up
[07:16] into the house explore inertia come yes
[07:20] good sit
[07:23] why don't good job so she's
[07:25] demonstrating that she's pretty obedient
[07:27] at least under these circumstances in
[07:29] this environment so I feel pretty good
[07:30] about taking the lead off it's only
[07:32] she'll come to me but I'm gonna
[07:33] encourage her to just stay a few feet
[07:35] from me just to kind of make sure she
[07:37] generally follows me while I walk around
[07:39] so let's see hey a nurse should stay
[07:41] over here let's go come on there we go
[07:44] and go so I just wanted to see if she
[07:49] would play with me she got a little
[07:50] bored with the game that's okay well my
[07:52] brother's pug at least wants to play no
[07:54] what do you think all right buddy go get
[07:56] it oh wow she's kind of quick huh and
[07:59] what a good opportunity to practice stay
[08:02] with a significant distraction so that's
[08:05] something we've been working on teaching
[08:06] her how to stay in the face of
[08:07] distractions I really want to make sure
[08:09] that her stay is reliable in these new
[08:11] places inertia lie don't stay a down
[08:14] state tends to be a bit more reliable
[08:16] than any other kind of stay so we'll
[08:18] keep it easy for I'm gonna walk away
[08:26] when come over here don't want to push
[08:28] her to failure okay come good let's see
[08:32] how a nurses frisbee training is doing
[08:34] keep going keep going good lie down and
[08:37] come around okay this way go I'm also
[08:41] really impressed with how well inertia
[08:42] is doing playing fetch this close to
[08:44] snus two other dogs can be so
[08:46] distracting to her and she just loves to
[08:48] play but she's still staying focused
[08:51] training your dog to listen to you off
[08:52] leash in new places is taught 15-20
[08:55] minutes at a time like this over the
[08:57] course of many months you want to really
[08:59] go out of your way to proof this over an
[09:01] extended period of time because it's
[09:03] extremely important that your dog has a
[09:05] lot of experience listening to you when
[09:07] in new distracting environment so today
[09:09] I'm really happy
[09:09] I mean inertia was reliable with
[09:11] listening to me around another dog in a
[09:14] new place so I'm excited good job

[00:00] today inertia and I are going to show
[00:01] you how to train your dog to ring a bell
[00:03] to be let outside I'm Zach George I
[00:06] train dogs this is my new dog and I'm
[00:08] gonna show you how I train her from day
[00:10] one things definitely won't always go

[00:14] beginning or you can pick up anywhere

[00:18] so you never miss an episode when you
[00:20] put into motion an approach based on
[00:22] love and respect your results will
[00:23] forever remain in motion this is inertia
[00:27] welcome to the dog training experience
[00:31] there's a lots of training a dog but
[00:33] really getting those fundamentals down
[00:34] to build upon is what's really going to
[00:37] set you up for success in my completely
[00:39] free 30-day perfect pup course I'll give
[00:41] you a crash course in everything that
[00:43] you need to know to build a strong
[00:45] foundation we cover all of the really
[00:48] important stuff in that course like
[00:49] puppy biting and potty training how to
[00:51] train your dog all of the basics like
[00:53] leash walking and sit and stay come when
[00:56] called and much more there's even an app
[00:58] that will let you keep track of your
[01:00] progress and have the entire course in
[01:02] your pocket so the lessons are with you
[01:04] whenever you need them you really just
[01:06] take the time to practice what you learn
[01:09] in that course and implemented into your
[01:11] dog's daily life over the course of
[01:12] several weeks to several months
[01:14] depending on the skill you'll find that
[01:16] you have a dog that actually listens to
[01:17] you and pays attention to you
[01:19] the ultimate goal when you're training
[01:20] your dog is to have such strong
[01:22] communication with them that you can
[01:24] teach them virtually any new skill
[01:26] without much effort at all because they
[01:28] simply understand your intent and what
[01:30] you're trying to teach them because of
[01:32] that strong foundation I'm gonna have
[01:34] links in the description where you can
[01:35] sign up for 30 day perfect pup and
[01:37] download the app remember everything is
[01:39] completely free puppet also makes
[01:42] amazing treats I'm gonna be using these
[01:43] today and we'll see what kind of results
[01:45] we get with inertia on winging a bet
[01:48] wouldn't it be great if your dog could
[01:49] let you know when they want to go
[01:51] outside well honestly they can I mean
[01:53] this is something that tends to happen
[01:54] pretty naturally with most dogs once you
[01:56] get to know your dog pretty well you'll
[01:57] probably notice that they're pretty good
[01:59] about letting you know in their own way
[02:01] when they want to go outside but some
[02:03] people really like showing their dog how
[02:04] to ring a bell to be let outside anyway
[02:07] and some dogs just love to play dead I
[02:09] guess I've never taught her this before
[02:11] so we'll see how she does
[02:13] by the way I have tons of advice not
[02:15] only about potty training issues but all
[02:17] the most common training problems people
[02:19] encounter with their dogs in my book
[02:20] guide to a well-behaved dog I'll have a
[02:22] link in the description where you can
[02:24] check it out so I have a couple of
[02:25] different bills that we're gonna be
[02:26] working with today but I think we'll
[02:27] start with these bells right here that
[02:29] hang on the door a lot of dogs can be
[02:31] nervous over loud sounds the first time
[02:33] they hear them so I'm trying not to be
[02:35] too erratic but right now inertia seems
[02:37] just more curious than anything which is
[02:39] exactly where I want her see that what
[02:44] is that see but look at that did you see
[02:47] how she backed away I'm gonna go ahead
[02:49] and give her a treat here just to try
[02:50] and get her back into training
[02:51] homeostasis here lie down good job good
[02:58] so by pairing this noise and these
[03:00] sounds with a good treat here you know
[03:03] she's a lot more likely to stick around
[03:04] rather than back away I mean I saw her
[03:06] back away just that split second and
[03:08] that was my cue to go really easy and
[03:11] get her liking these bells rather than
[03:13] being apprehensive of them this is how
[03:16] they're gonna be hanging in a moment yes
[03:19] good girl a nurse is doing great with
[03:22] this so far I think we can now move on
[03:24] to putting the bells on the door so I'm
[03:27] hoping to break this lesson into two
[03:28] main parts first training inertia how to
[03:30] ring the bell and then secondly letting
[03:33] her know that when she rings the bell
[03:34] she gets to go outside there's a couple
[03:36] of ways we can do this in general I
[03:38] would think if you have this type of
[03:39] configuration where you have the bells
[03:41] hanging you want to encourage your dog
[03:42] to nudge the bell with their nose
[03:44] instead of their paw because probably
[03:46] scratching at a wood door isn't exactly
[03:48] ideal unless they're really dainty with
[03:50] it I mean it could be but I'm gonna
[03:52] start with using a nurses nose here and
[03:54] I'll work on teaching her to use her paw
[03:56] later in this video I'm gonna encourage
[03:58] her to kind of snip it remember that's a
[03:59] dogs default when they're investigating
[04:02] something new and couldn't give her
[04:03] permission
[04:04] what's his forget it what is that yes
[04:08] and she already knows kind of a basic
[04:10] touch yes but a way to really teach your
[04:14] dog how to do this maybe if they're
[04:15] having trouble is to hold the treat up
[04:17] right at the Bell for example look at
[04:19] that yes I always think it's kind of fun
[04:21] to see if you can get them to do it
[04:22] without having to put a treat right
[04:24] there just to see where things stand
[04:27] see right now we're attention yes good
[04:30] girl she's like okay good I got it you
[04:32] want me to sniff the bell but actually
[04:34] I'd like you to touch that Bell so let's
[04:36] see if she can do it so what's this even
[04:46] though it didn't range she made more
[04:48] contact with at that time really
[04:50] important to reward those tiny
[04:52] incremental successes what's this yes
[04:55] good so I want to give her an
[04:59] enthusiastic reward there because it
[05:01] actually made a sound yes see that she
[05:05] went up to it right on her own that time
[05:07] I'm just gonna be quiet I'm looking to
[05:08] say anything here I think she's going to
[05:10] brainstorm on her own yes
[05:12] told ya hey what's that yes so I wanted
[05:18] to see if you'd brainstorm on a roam but
[05:20] with a little bit of a reminder there
[05:21] she got it you know try both with your
[05:24] dog yes you can see here as she does
[05:28] that I'm acknowledging that she's doing
[05:30] what I like and I'm following it up with
[05:31] a reward so that she is inspired to want
[05:34] to interact with the bells here I want
[05:36] her to interact with the bells a little
[05:38] bit more enthusiastically there so that
[05:40] I would have a chance of hearing them
[05:41] the farmer in the other room intercept
[05:43] what's that yes I can hear that just
[05:46] fine okay she's doing well with that but
[05:48] let's try it with this Bell this desk
[05:50] Bell right here and instead of having
[05:52] her use her nose I'm going to attempt to
[05:54] teach her to use her paw again I've
[05:56] never had a single lesson doing this so
[05:59] you're gonna see the real thing here as
[06:00] it unfolds but I'm feeling pretty
[06:01] confident that she should learn it but
[06:03] she has surprised me before so we'll see
[06:06] let me get her warmed up with a shake
[06:08] good yes shake
[06:12] yes such a dainty shake today what is
[06:15] that shake yes I mean you can't get
[06:21] better than that that was really good
[06:23] first attempt and she got it so yes good
[06:30] even though it didn't ring that time I
[06:32] still want to let her know that's what
[06:33] I'm looking for
[06:36] yes good did you see how she was
[06:40] brainstorming it she's getting enough
[06:42] experience she knows that okay dad's
[06:43] putting something in front of me he's
[06:45] pointing at it looks like he wants me to
[06:46] do something with that yes again making
[06:54] sure I reward when she's in the right
[06:57] direction inertia come what's this
[07:00] yes you know I just I couldn't avoid
[07:05] like trying this this is so much cuter
[07:07] to me when they ring a bell like this
[07:09] yes I swear I mean I feel like such a
[07:16] dog trainer right now I'm gonna scoot
[07:18] back a little bit let's see how much she
[07:20] can generalize this remember every inch
[07:22] you move back makes it harder for your
[07:23] dog when you're teaching them something
[07:25] new I'm gonna give it one more chance
[07:30] there yes good curl these freeze-dried
[07:37] salmon treats are just amazing inertia
[07:40] will do anything for them now that
[07:42] inertia is getting the hang of this it's
[07:44] time to show her that ringing the bells
[07:46] means that she gets to go outside yeah
[07:50] okay remember the two most common types
[07:53] of rewards or currencies that we use
[07:55] with our dogs are food and types of play
[07:58] like fetch or tug-of-war but a third
[08:00] option is to use the environment itself
[08:02] the world as the reward and that's what
[08:05] we're going to attempt to do here
[08:07] inertia you want to go outside look how
[08:09] excited she gets I would say that's her
[08:11] way of saying yes hey ring that Bell
[08:13] what's this yes good girl and so you can
[08:18] see she is eager to go right outside the
[08:20] minute the door opens she likes to go
[08:22] all the way into the yard okay go on and
[08:24] run around and chase Chipmunks or
[08:26] squirrels or whatever it is which hey if
[08:28] she's enjoying doing it I'm happy and
[08:30] she's even going potty so it's working
[08:32] already one thing I like to do to just
[08:35] on a side note is practice come win
[08:37] called when she's really excited like
[08:39] this inertia come there it goes okay I
[08:45] guess I should open the gate for for
[08:46] purposes of this lesson I'm gonna do a
[08:48] few reps like this yes so there you can
[08:51] see just a little nudge I'm gonna let
[08:53] her go out she also likes going out and
[08:55] hanging out on the deck as well she
[08:56] loves just looking at things out there
[08:58] okay come on
[08:59] come on back good girl yeah that was
[09:03] good so I'm telling her ring the bell as
[09:06] she rings the bell hear things about yes
[09:09] good girl
[09:10] go on go you can see how just using the
[09:13] environment like this can be satisfying
[09:15] it enough to incentivize your dog to do
[09:18] something you want them to do can you
[09:20] ring the bell
[09:21] yes that was really good so that was a
[09:25] big success and on top of going outside
[09:29] I'll go ahead and reward her with these
[09:30] puffer treats as well come here girl a
[09:33] lot of dogs are gonna pick this up very
[09:36] quickly as inertia did in this lesson
[09:38] but to really teach your dog broadly
[09:40] what this concept is it's a really good
[09:43] idea to insist that they ring the bell
[09:45] before you let them out on their normal
[09:46] potty break so let's try bring your
[09:48] balance yes good girl
[09:51] so just touching it and we'll let her
[09:53] know we're gonna go outside naturally
[09:55] you're probably going to find that your
[09:57] dog starts ringing the bell just to go
[09:59] outside even when they don't have to go
[10:01] potty nobody knows your dog like you do
[10:03] so if you're pretty confident that
[10:05] they're just being pushy and they
[10:06] actually don't need to relieve
[10:07] themselves outside you don't have to
[10:09] honor their request every time the way I
[10:11] see it your dogs allowed to ask to go
[10:13] outside and you as their parents are
[10:15] allowed to say yes or no it's most
[10:17] common for people to ask me how to train
[10:19] a dog to do this skill with a brand-new
[10:21] dog and to be honest with you I don't
[10:23] recommend that you teach a dog to ring a
[10:25] bell to be let outside if your dog is
[10:27] new to potty training that's because it
[10:29] is ultimately your responsibility to
[10:31] keep your dog on a schedule especially
[10:34] during the potty training process and
[10:35] give them ample opportunities to go
[10:37] outside in other words it's not fair to
[10:40] say
[10:40] you let me know when you have to go out
[10:42] this works best with dogs that are
[10:43] already potty trained
[10:45] good luck teaching this to your dog and

[00:30] training experience
[00:33] training a dog requires you to know them
[00:35] really well and to be able to train them
[00:36] from the inside outward and you can't
[00:39] train them to their maximum potential
[00:41] without a great diet there's so much dog
[00:43] food available but the ingredients in
[00:45] that food vary widely i've been pleased
[00:48] to see that a good number of you have
[00:49] been using solid gold products and
[00:51] you're loving it it really is a special
[00:53] food a few things you're going to love
[00:55] about solid gold are the fact that they
[00:56] use whole superfoods and the way they
[00:58] combine prebiotics and probiotics
[01:00] carefully promotes digestive health plus
[01:02] they incorporate omega fatty acids to
[01:05] nourish your dog's skin their coat and
[01:07] their immune system solid gold also
[01:09] makes some top of the line supplements
[01:11] like this c meal which is ultra healthy
[01:13] i like to give her these right before
[01:14] her meal if you want to give your dog
[01:16] something really extra special solid
[01:18] gold makes this human grade bone broth
[01:20] it's also good for picky eaters check
[01:22] out solid gold's deal of the week just

[01:30] zach i'll have a link in the description
[01:32] when you have a new dog one of the
[01:33] things that you've got to contend with
[01:35] is when is it okay to let your dog be
[01:38] loose in the house unsupervised for the
[01:40] first time going into this video i was
[01:42] positive that inertia was ready to have
[01:44] the run of the house but
[01:46] now i'm afraid she might start crashing
[01:48] through the walls
[01:50] [Applause]
[01:51] there is no particular moment when it
[01:54] suddenly becomes okay to just let your
[01:55] dog have the complete run of the house
[01:58] especially when you're gone you've
[01:59] probably noticed that if you've been
[02:01] keeping up with this series because
[02:03] there wasn't just a day when inertia
[02:04] suddenly went from being supervised to
[02:06] being free to roam the house all day it
[02:09] happened really gradually over time
[02:11] today we're going to analyze how we knew
[02:12] when the time was right and the steps we
[02:14] took to get there with inertia
[02:16] management is a critical step when
[02:18] you're working towards getting your dog
[02:20] to behave and to not be destructive
[02:22] while you're gone you can't skip this
[02:24] and just rely on correcting behaviors
[02:26] that happen when you leave when i'm
[02:27] raising and training a dog i like to use
[02:29] basically the same logic i would as if i
[02:31] was teaching a toddler so when bringing
[02:33] an eight-week old puppy home the last
[02:35] thing i want to do is just set them
[02:37] loose and cross my fingers and hope it
[02:39] goes right if you're like a lot of new
[02:41] people you might be thinking okay i'll
[02:43] bring my puppy home see how they do
[02:46] and then i'll correct the behaviors that
[02:47] i don't like for example you might
[02:49] notice that your dog is chewing on the
[02:50] furniture or chewing a lamp cord and
[02:53] then scold them for doing so but i've
[02:55] got to tell you at this point i've
[02:56] raised several puppies now and by being
[02:58] proactive and preventative you're much
[03:01] more likely to get better results
[03:03] remember that if you find yourself
[03:04] correcting behaviors after they occur
[03:06] that's likely to be mostly
[03:08] counterproductive instead when you are
[03:11] at home and your dog is at home with you
[03:13] that's when you need to spend time
[03:15] observing them and preventing unwanted
[03:17] behaviors from occurring in the first
[03:19] place so that they don't become a habit
[03:20] to your dog and by the way for those of
[03:22] you with new dogs i do highly recommend
[03:24] you check out both of my books to best
[03:26] learn how to raise and train your own
[03:28] dog this combined with these videos is
[03:30] going to give you everything you need in
[03:31] inertia's case you've noticed throughout
[03:33] the series how i've been very diligent
[03:35] about managing her and controlling her
[03:37] environment in other words when we
[03:39] brought her home the house was virtually
[03:41] completely puppy-proofed so when i would
[03:43] let her explore the house i would let
[03:44] her drag her leash around or i even had
[03:46] the leash attached to me so she was
[03:48] always easy to get to no matter what and
[03:51] i made sure she was always in the room
[03:53] with me or in her crate or in her puppy
[03:55] playpen area and it's worth mentioning
[03:57] you could also use things like pet gates
[03:59] to really modify your house so that your
[04:01] dog is very easy to keep track of
[04:03] remember use toddler logic if a
[04:05] four-month-old baby had the ability to
[04:07] run and jump and bite you certainly
[04:09] wouldn't just set them loose and expect
[04:11] them to follow rules they haven't even
[04:12] had a chance to learn yet right there's
[04:14] no way to do primary training when
[04:16] you're not actually at home with your
[04:18] dog so when you are there you should
[04:20] focus on preventing bad habits from
[04:22] occurring and show your dogs how you
[04:24] want them to behave while on their own
[04:26] naturally exercising your dog before you
[04:28] leave them alone especially in the
[04:30] beginning like this is likely to
[04:32] encourage them to just chill out and go
[04:34] to sleep so they're not likely to get
[04:35] into things that they shouldn't if you
[04:37] do come home and your dog has destroyed
[04:39] something that probably means they're
[04:41] just not yet ready to be in that part of
[04:43] the house unsupervised yet so ask
[04:45] yourself if they're likely to be less
[04:47] destructive in another part of the house
[04:49] like your bedroom but if you think
[04:50] there's a decent chance they might chew
[04:52] up your comforter or your mattress even
[04:54] then you should probably have them in a
[04:56] more controlled dog-proof setting at
[04:58] least for now so for management purposes
[05:01] with inertia at this point in her life
[05:03] we have phased out the crate virtually
[05:05] completely this doesn't mean i'll just
[05:07] never use a crate again but we are at
[05:09] the point where we're completely
[05:11] comfortable leaving inertia alone in the
[05:13] house with our older dog indy in an
[05:15] unrestricted manner for many hours at a
[05:17] time at what age are most dogs ready to
[05:20] be left at home reliably that answer
[05:23] varies so dramatically from dog to dog
[05:26] let me give you a couple of examples
[05:27] though let's say you got a puppy around
[05:29] 10 weeks of age or so and you've worked
[05:30] with them really diligently as i have
[05:32] with inertia i would say that at around
[05:34] seven to eight months of age you can
[05:36] start testing leaving your dog in a
[05:38] general part of the house without
[05:39] supervision assuming they've been doing
[05:41] well in that same part of the house when
[05:43] you are at home and they're not getting
[05:45] into things they shouldn't i'm reluctant
[05:46] to recommend that you leave any dog
[05:48] alone who is not well through their
[05:50] teething phase though and that's really
[05:52] around six to eight months of age it
[05:54] does vary a little bit from dog to dog
[05:56] if you've adopted an adult dog
[05:58] comfortably leaving them alone is going
[05:59] to vary widely depending on their
[06:01] personality and past life experience but
[06:03] i would say with older dogs get to know
[06:05] them really well for two or three months
[06:07] before you give them unrestricted access
[06:10] to the house while you're away so bottom
[06:12] line don't be in a hurry to give your
[06:13] dog total run of the house instead test
[06:16] for very short periods of time at first
[06:18] and only do so after you've extensively
[06:20] supervised them in the environment to
[06:22] make sure both of you feel comfortable
[06:23] and you're confident they'll behave when
[06:25] you leave them alone of course having a
[06:27] camera of some kind to keep an eye on
[06:29] your dog is a really good way to see how
[06:30] we'll do during your testing if you
[06:32] discover or suspect that your dog has
[06:34] separation anxiety you'll want to do
[06:36] some very specific training and
[06:38] exercises centered around that in order
[06:40] to prevent that anxiety keep in mind
[06:42] that dogs are social creatures and they
[06:44] like to be near us and when we're out of
[06:46] sight this can cause some dogs to feel
[06:48] anxious and they may experience
[06:50] excessive barking or whining so our goal
[06:52] is to minimize anxiety to the best of
[06:55] our ability and this can take time and
[06:57] effort i'm going to have videos in the
[06:58] description where i show you how i help
[07:00] dogs overcome their separation anxiety
[07:02] and how i dealt with this with inertia
[07:04] barking and whining can occur due to
[07:06] other reasons that aren't related to
[07:08] separation anxiety at all too maybe you
[07:10] just happen to have a dog with a barky
[07:12] personality or maybe they see something
[07:14] outside or bark at another pet of yours
[07:16] or if you have a dog like inertia maybe
[07:18] they just randomly decide to start
[07:19] barking out of the window in your new
[07:21] house if you're dealing with excessive
[07:23] barking i'm going to have a link in the
[07:24] description for you too ultimately
[07:26] finding the exact right time to leave
[07:28] your dog alone in the house really just
[07:30] take some careful observation and
[07:32] testing on your part you are definitely
[07:34] the best person on earth to know when
[07:37] the time is right for your specific dog

[00:00] remember when inertia was resource
[00:01] guarding we're going to see how she's
[00:03] doing today and i'm going to show you
[00:04] what to do if your dog is a resource
[00:06] guarder or
[00:07] you want to try to prevent them from
[00:09] ever becoming one i'm zach george
[00:11] i train dogs this is my new dog and i'm
[00:14] going to show you how i train her from
[00:15] day one
[00:16] things definitely won't always go
[00:18] smoothly you can start from the
[00:20] beginning or you can pick up anywhere
[00:22] subscribe and hit the bell notification
[00:24] so you never miss an episode when you
[00:25] put into motion an approach based on
[00:27] love and respect your results will
[00:29] forever
[00:30] remain in motion this is inertia
[00:33] welcome to the dog training experience
[00:37] have you ever found training your dog to
[00:38] be difficult at times
[00:40] it's important that you have everything
[00:42] you need when you're training your dog
[00:43] by the way
[00:44] this is more than just a box because
[00:47] with every purchase you make
[00:49] peplo gives a bowl of food to a pet in
[00:51] need
[00:52] things that we routinely need for
[00:53] training our dogs are great toys
[00:56] treats and high quality food is a must
[00:58] petflow has all of that and they do this
[01:00] magical thing where they make your dog's
[01:02] food
[01:03] magically appear at your doorstep
[01:05] without any effort on your part at all
[01:07] i'm going to have a link in the
[01:08] description go to that link select your
[01:10] favorite dog food
[01:12] then tell peflo to ship it to you every
[01:13] three weeks or however often you'd like
[01:15] it shipped
[01:16] you'll get ten dollars off your first
[01:17] three automatic shipments too
[01:19] by entering my special code zach30 at
[01:22] checkout
[01:23] resource guarding is where your dog
[01:25] becomes protective
[01:26] of something it commonly involves food
[01:29] but dogs can guard
[01:30] toys they can guard their bed or any
[01:32] number of things
[01:33] from day one with inertia i knew that
[01:35] resource guarding could be an issue
[01:36] i think it's pretty natural for dogs
[01:38] especially inexperienced dogs
[01:40] to want to protect what they have
[01:42] there's nothing intuitive about letting
[01:44] someone take something away from you
[01:46] so we literally have to teach them that
[01:48] they shouldn't guard things
[01:49] and so i tried my best to be really
[01:52] proactive about this
[01:53] starting when inertia was about eight
[01:54] weeks old i want to get her really
[01:56] comfortable
[01:57] with me going in her food bowl taking it
[01:59] away giving it back
[02:00] to prevent resource guarding issues in
[02:02] the future nonetheless we saw
[02:03] two minor instances of this resource
[02:06] guarding behavior with inertia as she
[02:07] was growing
[02:08] up let's look back there was one
[02:10] instance during one of our resource
[02:12] guarding practice sessions that we were
[02:13] doing with a bone
[02:14] where inertia got a little protective
[02:16] that was actually the first time
[02:18] i had ever seen her display any of this
[02:20] behavior at all a while later there was
[02:22] one
[02:23] instance where inertia got a little
[02:25] protective of a snowball basically
[02:27] shaved ice with chicken broth that she
[02:29] was eating when my wife bree got close
[02:31] to her face with the camera
[02:32] i continue to test and practice with her
[02:34] periodically
[02:36] but today we're going to give her a big
[02:37] test and see how she does
[02:39] also keep in mind i detail how to deal
[02:42] with resource guarding in both
[02:43] of my books i'll have links in the
[02:45] description below so over time i've
[02:47] learned that inertia is not the type of
[02:49] dog who resource guards her regular food
[02:51] but she's become protective of special
[02:53] items like bones or other treats twice
[02:55] before
[02:55] let's recreate our first ever instance
[02:58] where inertia got a little protective
[03:00] which was with an animal bone during one
[03:02] of our routine resource guarding
[03:03] practice exercises
[03:05] and the exercises we're going to cover
[03:06] right now are the same whether you're
[03:08] working on being proactive and
[03:10] preventing resource guarding
[03:11] or your dog already does resource guard
[03:14] the idea is to
[03:15] not put your dog in a position to snap
[03:18] at you while guarding something like a
[03:19] bone
[03:20] if your dog is a resource card or you
[03:22] think they'll get protective if you go
[03:23] right up there
[03:24] and take it you've no doubt experienced
[03:26] the stress of well how do i get that
[03:28] thing away from my dog because
[03:30] he or she can't be behaving that way
[03:32] right so i found that the most practical
[03:33] way to separate your dog from something
[03:35] like that is to use
[03:36] a real high value piece of meat
[03:39] something that's even
[03:40] better than the thing they're likely to
[03:42] guard let me show you what i mean
[03:43] this is what you would do in the case
[03:44] where your dog isn't yet trained and you
[03:46] really have to get it away from them
[03:48] so in this case i'm using real chicken
[03:51] putting it on the ground
[03:53] so in this case inertia knows how to
[03:54] stay so i can say stay
[03:56] and then i can go over here and pick up
[03:59] the thing that she was guarding right
[04:01] the point of luring her away with a meat
[04:03] like this is that it creates a great
[04:05] association
[04:06] with relinquishing whatever it is that
[04:08] she's possessive of
[04:09] and i also wanted to know that sometimes
[04:10] she has a chance of getting the item
[04:12] back too
[04:12] by the way it's a good idea to do this
[04:14] type of training when your dog is
[04:16] not hungry if your dog is hangry that's
[04:19] probably going to complicate things
[04:21] i want to make sure that i can get
[04:22] inertia to come to me even when she's
[04:25] into the bone like this without having
[04:26] to lure her away i'd like to think we're
[04:28] past that so
[04:29] let's check up on that inertia
[04:32] come good job
[04:36] at this point i'm able to get a nurse's
[04:38] attention off of the resource she is
[04:39] coming to me willingly all this is going
[04:41] well
[04:42] but what if i find myself in a position
[04:43] where i just have to get to the item
[04:45] quick
[04:46] first i want to make sure that i can go
[04:47] up to her get her attention on me
[04:49] and feel confident that she's not likely
[04:51] to guard the bone i'm going to do this
[04:53] real slowly just to make sure it goes
[04:55] well
[04:55] so i'm going to be armed with some real
[04:57] chicken here
[04:58] look at me very good
[05:02] and right now i'm looking at her body
[05:03] language she doesn't look like she's
[05:05] trying to guard it
[05:06] or anything like that i'm able to get
[05:07] her attention on to me yes
[05:10] i'm able to touch the bone she didn't
[05:12] try to snap at me or anything
[05:15] yes very good i'm being pretty
[05:17] methodical here to give you an idea of
[05:19] the small steps that you should take you
[05:20] know make sure your dog's okay with you
[05:22] doing that before you just go in
[05:24] yank it and put it away you can see
[05:27] look at that she's reacting very
[05:29] appropriately and civilized
[05:32] you can see with a big animal bone like
[05:33] this she is no longer at least so far
[05:35] very possessive or likely to guard this
[05:38] this is why it's important to set up
[05:40] artificial exercises like this i mean if
[05:42] this were something dangerous like a
[05:43] cooked chicken wing i wouldn't really be
[05:45] able to give her that kind of item back
[05:47] in the real world but an item like this
[05:49] i can give her back for short periods of
[05:50] time and while i'm supervising her
[05:52] so you need to take time to proactively
[05:54] create a good association with having
[05:56] good things
[05:56] taken away and we've been doing this
[05:58] type of training periodically throughout
[06:00] a nurse's life
[06:01] don't overlook training like this it's a
[06:03] really good idea for preventing resource
[06:05] guarding
[06:06] all right so inertia's really into the
[06:08] bone right now more than she's been
[06:09] all day i'm going to do it without a
[06:10] treat this time inner should come
[06:18] good
[06:20] here okay go get it all right so no
[06:23] treat i'm actually going to use the bone
[06:24] as a reward letting her have access to
[06:26] it
[06:26] some ways to tell if your dog is likely
[06:29] to guard a resource
[06:30] or to see how they behave do they become
[06:32] real stiff do they
[06:34] bare their teeth do they growl do they
[06:36] generally act very protective
[06:38] over the item okay so she's great with
[06:40] the bone
[06:41] but her most significant guarding
[06:43] outburst was with my wife brie when
[06:45] inertia was eating a doggy snowball
[06:47] today we made our own homemade version
[06:50] of a snowball which is really just
[06:51] shaved ice and chicken broth so let's
[06:53] see how she behaves when my wife
[06:55] brie goes through these steps with her
[06:57] so we'll give her a chance to get into
[06:59] it here just like she was before
[07:01] okay i'll take the camera we're going to
[07:03] create a trail away from
[07:05] the chicken broth and ice good and then
[07:08] yeah another
[07:09] trail good luck
[07:15] give her one more piece maybe ask her to
[07:16] lie down and stay lie down
[07:19] stay now come over and pick it up
[07:26] that's great i took your chicken broth
[07:29] that's good and
[07:30] now maybe just give it back to her let
[07:32] her know okay i'll give you back yeah
[07:34] okay okay good work
[07:38] then walk away and let her we'll see if
[07:39] she gets back into it
[07:42] she goes right back into it what a fun
[07:44] treat this time just go ahead and call
[07:46] her
[07:46] and reward her when she comes back to
[07:48] you inertia
[07:52] good girl yeah go ahead and give her a
[07:54] piece of chicken
[07:56] and then even tell her go ahead you can
[07:57] go back okay you can go have your
[07:58] chicken broth
[07:59] all done okay
[08:03] so that's real good now just walk right
[08:05] up to her get her attention on you and
[08:07] go slow
[08:08] you know if you see your start to freeze
[08:09] up we'll take a step back because the
[08:11] ultimate goal is not to push her that
[08:12] far obviously
[08:14] treat or no treat i would say use a
[08:16] treat since we're doing a science
[08:18] experiment inertia look at me
[08:20] yeah maybe even have her lie down and
[08:22] stay just to be extra
[08:24] cautious right just to be methodical
[08:27] stay i'm going to take your chicken
[08:29] broth
[08:31] nice real good i took it okay good give
[08:34] it right
[08:34] good girl you can have it back excellent
[08:38] job i remember when she was a puppy and
[08:41] she had the other snowball that she got
[08:43] a little protective of
[08:44] the way that i noticed that she was
[08:46] feeling that way was just like
[08:47] her face kind of tensed up do you know
[08:49] what i mean right
[08:51] and i feel like she has a very relaxed
[08:52] face today like i honestly feel like she
[08:54] looks a lot more chill about us just
[08:56] taking her food and giving it back
[08:57] whereas before
[08:58] she would get this look like what are
[09:00] you gonna do don't take it
[09:02] what happens if you just go in and take
[09:03] it let's see what happens i think she'll
[09:05] be fine i'm gonna take this
[09:06] this simulates maybe a young child runs
[09:08] up to your dog and tries to take
[09:09] something away from them
[09:11] it's important for them to have some
[09:12] training and know how to behave in that
[09:13] particular context
[09:15] and just to reiterate too all of the
[09:17] training in the world
[09:18] doesn't mean that your dog will never
[09:20] resource guard you always need to use
[09:22] common sense
[09:23] and even though i was proactive with it
[09:25] with inertia she still did it a few
[09:26] times
[09:27] and so far we've done really well
[09:28] working through it but i'll continue to
[09:30] maintain this behavior and make sure
[09:32] that she
[09:33] behaves appropriately around things like
[09:34] that get your supplies and get ten
[09:37] dollars off your first three automatic

[00:25] when you put into motion an approach
[00:26] based on love and respect your results
[00:28] will forever
[00:29] remain in motion this is inertia
[00:32] welcome to the dog training experience
[00:36] if there's one thing that everyone wants
[00:38] from their dog it's for their dog to be
[00:40] potty trained right off the bat to potty
[00:42] train your dog you have to have
[00:43] great treats seriously use the best
[00:46] treats that you can get
[00:47] i use pup for treats all the time
[00:49] they're good because they taste great
[00:51] these are the freeze-dried chicken ones
[00:53] and inertia loves these there's 475
[00:57] treats in here do you know how many
[00:58] things you could train with 475 treats
[01:01] when you give your dog a high quality
[01:03] treat like this when they've had a
[01:04] successful potty outing you're helping
[01:06] them understand that doing their
[01:08] business where you want them to
[01:10] means they also get something fantastic
[01:12] puffford has an enormous selection of
[01:14] really high-end treats
[01:16] that's important because lots of dogs
[01:17] like different things i'm gonna have a
[01:19] link in the description where you can
[01:20] get all of puffford's awesome training
[01:22] treats
[01:23] you think she's trying to tell me
[01:24] something okay inertia is just over a
[01:28] year old now
[01:29] and we've filmed oliver trading
[01:31] hopefully by now most of you have seen
[01:32] episode one where we literally picked
[01:34] inertia up at eight weeks of age for
[01:36] obvious reasons potty training was a
[01:38] major priority of ours from day one
[01:41] whether you have a brand new puppy or
[01:43] dog or you're working on training with a
[01:44] dog that you've had for years my books
[01:46] are gonna help you too
[01:47] i'll have links in the description of
[01:48] this video remember
[01:50] when you're potty training a dog
[01:52] managing where they can and can't
[01:54] go is critical your goal is to prevent
[01:57] accidents wherever possible by keeping
[01:59] your dog under consistent supervision
[02:01] and by giving them more than enough
[02:03] opportunities to go potty
[02:05] in the correct places i highly recommend
[02:08] actually attaching your dog to yourself
[02:10] with a leash even indoors
[02:12] because it is so easy to become
[02:14] distracted even when you and your puppy
[02:16] are in the same room with each other i
[02:18] mean think about it if you're always
[02:19] within six feet of your dog
[02:21] it makes it a lot easier to spot those
[02:23] warning signs of an impending accident
[02:25] now of course nobody is perfect but what
[02:27] do you do
[02:28] when you actually catch your dog in the
[02:30] process of having a potty accident
[02:32] do your best to interrupt them with most
[02:34] puppies i do this just by picking them
[02:36] up and taking them to the spot where i
[02:38] want them to do their business
[02:40] oh poop oh boy they're
[02:43] falling out oh no oh my gosh
[02:46] inertia i cannot believe you did that
[02:49] now the whole internet has seen it
[02:51] i mean in the same way that you wouldn't
[02:52] punish a baby for having an accident
[02:54] we're not going to punish our dogs ever
[02:55] for things like this
[02:56] and that goes for if you catch your dog
[02:58] in the act or if you discover an
[03:00] accident that happened hours ago
[03:02] remember dogs don't go in the house
[03:03] where they're not supposed to despite
[03:05] you or to get revenge or anything like
[03:07] that
[03:08] and they also don't wait to
[03:09] intentionally come back inside to pee or
[03:12] poop
[03:12] because they're mad at you so don't take
[03:14] it personally let your efforts be
[03:16] focused on preventing future
[03:18] accidents and focusing on what you like
[03:20] rather than punishing
[03:22] what you dislike to prevent her from
[03:24] being able to have accidents in
[03:25] inappropriate places inertia had her own
[03:28] puppy bedroom downstairs in our house
[03:30] and i was very consistent about
[03:31] supervising her and keeping her near me
[03:34] when she was outside of that area and
[03:36] perhaps more importantly i was really on
[03:38] top of letting her out
[03:39] super often you may even want to set an
[03:41] alarm or a timer
[03:43] to really help keep you on top of
[03:45] letting your dog outside
[03:46] often puppies in particular sleep a lot
[03:49] whenever they wake up take them to the
[03:50] place you want them to go potty right
[03:52] away
[03:53] it's also a good idea to take them
[03:54] outside right after they've been playing
[03:56] for a minute
[03:56] or shortly after they eat and drink and
[03:58] basically if you're asking yourself if
[04:00] you should take your dog out
[04:01] the answer is yes it's much better to
[04:04] take your dog out too much than too
[04:05] little
[04:06] when you give your dog potty breaks
[04:07] during potty training be prepared to be
[04:09] outside for a while
[04:10] give them ample time to sniff and check
[04:13] everything out and don't rush your dog
[04:14] during the potty training process
[04:16] it's also really important to get your
[04:18] dog comfortable with their sleeping
[04:19] space
[04:20] where they'll be spending time when you
[04:21] can't directly supervise them
[04:23] in a nurse's case i used a combination
[04:25] of the crate and exercise pen
[04:27] for her personal bedroom i encouraged
[04:29] her to go in and out voluntarily
[04:32] using lots of great treats so that she
[04:34] would learn to enjoy
[04:35] going in her crate it really didn't take
[04:37] long either i did this
[04:38] very frequently throughout the first
[04:40] week that i had her and really avoided
[04:42] manually placing her in the crate the
[04:44] vast majority of the time
[04:46] if you get your dog really loving their
[04:47] crate or whatever setup you have for
[04:49] them
[04:49] this should make the general potty
[04:50] training process much smoother because
[04:52] dogs tend to naturally avoid
[04:54] going potty in their sleeping area if
[04:57] you do notice that they're having
[04:58] accidents overnight in their sleeping
[05:00] area then you'll probably need to make
[05:01] it a little bit smaller
[05:02] just experiment with your own dog for
[05:04] example initially i tried a little bit
[05:06] of a larger area overnight and put pads
[05:09] down now the reason i did this was to
[05:11] give inertia a larger
[05:12] area and encourage her to be more
[05:14] comfortable because it was so early on
[05:16] in her training and it was more
[05:17] important for her to be comfortable
[05:19] than to be perfectly potty trained i
[05:21] started closing the door to the crate
[05:22] overnight because dogs are less
[05:24] likely to have accidents if their
[05:25] sleeping area is smaller
[05:27] however i would use this expanded area
[05:29] with the crate and the playpen
[05:30] for short periods of management
[05:32] throughout the day i know some of you
[05:34] are wondering about potty pads
[05:36] and i've considered this from a lot of
[05:38] different angles now
[05:39] i've actually evolved my opinion on the
[05:41] use of potty pads over the years
[05:43] i think they can be a great supplement
[05:44] to your potty training because it's
[05:46] always nice to have an
[05:47] indoor alternative for your dog i mean
[05:49] this can be especially useful during
[05:51] long periods
[05:52] of bad weather or if you live in a
[05:53] high-rise building where it takes a
[05:55] while for your dog to get outside or
[05:57] while you're traveling so it's up to you
[05:58] whether or not you'd like to use them by
[06:00] the end of inertia's first week things
[06:01] were going all right
[06:02] she's had what what do you think were
[06:04] you maybe like four or five accidents oh
[06:06] poop yeah maybe like four or five maybe
[06:08] one a day and it's always because i'm
[06:10] being careless or i'm being careless
[06:12] right but the good news is she's yet to
[06:15] have an accident in her crate i've been
[06:16] letting her out very consistently once
[06:18] an hour or so
[06:19] maybe a little bit less than that every
[06:21] time i let her out of the crate we
[06:22] immediately go outside or to a potty pad
[06:24] in the house because remember i want her
[06:25] going on the pads and i want her going
[06:27] outside because it gives me options in
[06:29] the future
[06:30] as the weeks went on potty training
[06:32] challenges began to increase a little
[06:33] bit
[06:34] probably because i was starting to get a
[06:36] little too relaxed
[06:38] many people are under the impression
[06:39] that potty training can be done in like
[06:40] a week
[06:41] but not really right at the three week
[06:43] mark i think it's easy to let your guard
[06:45] down
[06:46] on potty training especially if you are
[06:48] having a lot of success but i think
[06:49] it's more important than ever to really
[06:51] double down on your efforts
[06:52] and keep it top of mind make sure that
[06:54] you get your dog out
[06:55] on a regular schedule even when you
[06:57] think they probably don't have to go
[06:59] it's a good idea to take them out
[07:00] more rather than less but as i got to
[07:03] know inertia better i was able to make
[07:05] better gains on our potty training
[07:07] efforts
[07:08] we've gone like three or four days
[07:09] without an accident at all so
[07:11] i'm fully prepared for setbacks as is
[07:14] common with potty training
[07:15] so i'm not gonna get too excited yet but
[07:18] to review in short the formula for potty
[07:20] training is relentlessly controlling
[07:22] their environment
[07:23] while taking them outside more than they
[07:25] need to go every time that i catch her
[07:27] having an accident i just kick myself
[07:29] because it's like i should have let her
[07:30] out but i just
[07:31] you know pick her up and take her
[07:33] outside there's no scolding or anything
[07:35] like that because i don't want her to
[07:36] get this complex about
[07:37] going potty sometimes when i have her in
[07:39] the house still on leash i'm much better
[07:41] about detecting when i think she's about
[07:43] to go
[07:44] now again i think that's probably too
[07:45] late i should be letting her out before
[07:47] i even detect that she's sniffing around
[07:49] because she has to go
[07:50] like what do you think this is do you
[07:52] think maybe she has to go right now
[07:54] i don't know that makes me nervous i'm
[07:55] gonna go outside let's see okay come on
[07:58] do you have to go pee yes
[08:01] look at that good job that's exactly
[08:05] what i mean you gotta really get to know
[08:06] your dog's individual body language and
[08:08] the way that they
[08:09] foreshadow hey i'm about to go potty so
[08:11] if you ever have a question as to
[08:13] whether or not you should take your dog
[08:14] outside
[08:15] take them outside and as the days went
[08:17] on i slowly began to grant inertia more
[08:19] and more freedom
[08:20] dogs learn pretty quickly not to go in
[08:23] their direct sleeping area
[08:24] so by keeping their sleeping area
[08:26] relatively small at first and then
[08:27] gradually increasing it they'll be much
[08:30] more likely to succeed
[08:31] you might notice here i have enlarged
[08:33] her area while we pretty much
[08:35] always have this up most of the time
[08:37] we've moved to keeping the second door
[08:39] over here
[08:40] open full time so that she has permanent
[08:43] access to a larger area she's got lots
[08:45] of toys in here lots of different
[08:46] textures of things to chew on and play
[08:48] with
[08:49] it was becoming very routine for her to
[08:50] spend a couple hours easy at a time in
[08:52] here
[08:53] and not have any accidents the other
[08:55] night i tried leaving it completely open
[08:57] overnight
[08:58] no accidents and it's been like three
[09:01] nights in a row now
[09:02] no accidents over here so there's no
[09:04] reason we can't expand her living area
[09:06] it can take some time for a dog to
[09:08] generalize your entire house
[09:11] as their home so increase their access
[09:13] to the house
[09:14] slowly and methodically and don't
[09:16] hesitate to take a step back if they
[09:18] have a relapse in potty accidents by
[09:20] this point inertia was doing
[09:22] great on her general potty training but
[09:23] she still had excitement
[09:25] urination that's where some dogs just
[09:27] get so excited that they can't keep
[09:29] their pee inside of them
[09:31] i mean it happens to all of us right
[09:34] in inertia's case anytime she would see
[09:36] our friends or our family
[09:38] she would become overjoyed and pee the
[09:40] way i dealt with this was by trying to
[09:42] get her to go potty just before i knew
[09:44] she was about to encounter someone
[09:45] exciting
[09:46] and by encouraging family to be very
[09:48] calm or even ignore her for the first
[09:50] several minutes
[09:51] of course my dad well he was never great
[09:53] about taking direction from me
[09:57] there's the pea look at that hey come
[10:00] here
[10:02] most dogs will outgrow this kind of
[10:04] excitement urination by the time they're
[10:06] 18 months or so
[10:07] it's also really important to remember
[10:09] that nothing throws off potty training
[10:11] progress
[10:12] like going to a new place and you might
[10:14] remember a few months ago we took a trip
[10:16] to corpus christi texas
[10:18] and inertia had a potty accident even
[10:20] though she had been
[10:21] flawless for several months leading up
[10:23] to that it's just
[10:24] oh inner shop what are you doing
[10:28] okay we'll need to clean that up and
[10:30] that's her first accident in
[10:32] i mean months and see if she had been
[10:34] off leash i might not have even noticed
[10:36] that body accident
[10:37] really it's vital to have them unleash
[10:39] and under control when introducing them
[10:40] to new places
[10:42] particularly when they're young or
[10:44] untrained so with all of that
[10:46] said how do you actually know when potty
[10:48] training is
[10:49] complete when your dog goes a good
[10:51] couple of months with virtually
[10:53] no potty accidents and they can make it
[10:55] several hours between breaks
[10:57] you're pretty much there but remember
[10:59] with house training like this
[11:00] regressions are still fairly common and
[11:02] always always be prepared to take a step
[11:05] back
[11:05] and modify their environment to make
[11:07] things easier for them i mean the
[11:09] occasional accident during your dog's
[11:10] first couple of years of life is normal
[11:12] but make sure to analyze each instance
[11:15] ask yourself for example did your dog
[11:17] have a change in their environment or
[11:18] has it been too long between breaks
[11:20] and plan accordingly for the future so
[11:22] that you can prevent it from happening
[11:23] again
[11:24] if you notice that your dog is having
[11:25] increased accidents seemingly out of
[11:27] nowhere it could be a medical issue so
[11:29] check with your vet to make sure your
[11:31] dog is healthy
[11:32] good luck on your potty training and be
[11:33] sure to get puffer training treats at

[00:00] today's a huge day it's time to start
[00:02] phasing in off-leash training with
[00:04] inertia can you believe it
[00:06] i'm zach george i train dogs this is my
[00:08] new dog and i'm going to show you how i
[00:10] train her from
[00:11] day one things definitely won't always
[00:14] go smoothly you can start from the
[00:15] beginning
[00:16] or you can pick up anywhere subscribe
[00:18] and hit the bell notification so you
[00:20] never miss an episode when you put into
[00:21] motion an approach based on love and
[00:23] respect your results will forever
[00:25] remain in motion this is inertia
[00:28] welcome to the dog training experience
[00:33] guys today's lesson is going to be huge
[00:35] i'm going to show you how i
[00:36] address off-leash training with inertia
[00:39] my own dog
[00:40] doing things like regular training and
[00:42] frequent playing and just generally
[00:44] giving your dog a high quality of life
[00:45] is likely to keep your dog more engaged
[00:47] with you
[00:48] which is why puffer made an entire line
[00:50] of products dedicated
[00:51] to highly engaging items for your dog
[00:54] these are the most high-end dog chews
[00:57] that you can get
[00:58] i think the reason dogs love these so
[00:59] much is that they're completely natural
[01:01] like take these
[01:01] beef tendon cheese for example i mean
[01:03] you can tell exactly what these are
[01:05] and so can dogs why do you guys like the
[01:07] weirdest stuff
[01:09] check out the split elk antler chew here
[01:11] they're actually split to make them
[01:13] softer and easier to chew on for your
[01:15] dog these himalayan dog chews
[01:17] have three ingredients in them yak milk
[01:19] salt and lime juice
[01:21] kind of sounds good check out all of
[01:23] pupfrid's shoes in their engage line
[01:25] they've got a great deal too on
[01:26] multi-packs if you want to try a variety
[01:28] to see what your dog likes
[01:29] i'm gonna have a special link in the
[01:31] description below let's go to alaska
[01:34] off lease training is a huge step for
[01:36] most dogs it's true that some dogs are
[01:38] more reliable off leash
[01:40] and do tend to stay near their people
[01:42] but in inertia's case well
[01:43] she's a pretty average dog in this
[01:45] respect and she's definitely going to
[01:47] make me work to teach her to be reliable
[01:49] off-leash inertia can you leave that
[01:51] alone
[01:53] come
[01:56] yes it's like it just takes her eight
[01:59] seconds to process it
[02:00] that said inertia is at the point in her
[02:02] training now where i am methodically
[02:04] phasing in
[02:05] more off-leash training in new places
[02:07] notice that i said off-leash in
[02:09] new places that's because most dogs are
[02:12] a lot less likely to listen to you
[02:14] when in a new place so you have to do
[02:16] extensive training to prepare for that
[02:18] long tale of distractions that's likely
[02:21] to occur
[02:22] in the real world throughout our
[02:23] training so far you've seen how we've
[02:25] been using a long lead to manage inertia
[02:27] in new places as well as
[02:28] less controlled places because this
[02:30] still gives her the freedom to explore
[02:32] her world
[02:32] using a long lead like this can be a
[02:34] really helpful intermediate step while
[02:36] you're working on teaching your dog to
[02:38] listen
[02:38] off leash during early off leash
[02:40] training sessions i like to wait to take
[02:42] the long lead off until she's had a good
[02:44] bit of exercise
[02:45] the reason for this is that it's more
[02:47] challenging for a dog to listen when
[02:48] they have all of that pent-up energy in
[02:50] the nurse's case if i had just
[02:51] immediately let her off leash as soon as
[02:53] we got here it might be more challenging
[02:55] for her to resist running and
[02:56] investigating every little thing that
[02:58] she wanted to
[02:59] since being anywhere new might be
[03:00] absolutely overwhelmingly
[03:02] exciting for some dogs by giving her
[03:04] some exercise to get that initial
[03:06] layer of energy out and giving her a
[03:08] little bit of time in the environment to
[03:10] satisfy some of her natural curiosity
[03:12] about what's around her she'll be more
[03:14] likely to listen to me without being
[03:16] distracted by wondering about
[03:18] everything in this new place and make no
[03:21] mistake
[03:22] about it dogs know when that lead is on
[03:25] versus when it's
[03:26] off so she still understands that she
[03:29] has a lead on her
[03:30] also taking advantage of the fact that
[03:32] she comes to me so reliably
[03:33] when playing fetch to really solidify
[03:36] come when called so watch look how fast
[03:38] she's running to me right now
[03:39] looking right at me come so i'm saying
[03:43] come when she's doing that very
[03:45] deliberate
[03:46] sprint towards me so she's had a good
[03:48] round of exercise we're gonna go
[03:49] off leash now you might notice we're
[03:51] here in a baseball field which is
[03:53] pretty fenced it's still a controlled
[03:55] environment but here's the thing
[03:56] she doesn't realize that she doesn't
[03:58] know that she can't run for 20 miles
[04:00] that's why it's important to make this
[04:02] part of your off leash training go to
[04:03] new places
[04:04] where your dog is still under control
[04:07] you might have to get creative with this
[04:08] you may have to drive a few miles
[04:10] outside of town but
[04:11] i'm sure you can find something i want
[04:13] to do some training on come
[04:15] and stay those are the two most critical
[04:17] skills especially
[04:18] when you're doing off leash training
[04:19] notice her body language right now you
[04:21] can see she's looking around she's
[04:23] curious about her environment but she's
[04:24] generally pretty relaxed let me verify
[04:26] that i can get her attention
[04:28] on me in her show that was pretty good
[04:30] so
[04:31] i always like to do that because it's a
[04:33] good way to measure our dog's mood
[04:36] and since we're currently in alaska our
[04:38] freeze-dried salmon treats are the
[04:39] perfect choice for this training session
[04:41] and if you're wondering why i'm even
[04:42] using treats at all it's because i've
[04:45] changed a major variable i've now taken
[04:47] that lead off and i'm asking her to
[04:48] listen to me
[04:49] remember dogs know when that lead is on
[04:52] versus when it's not
[04:54] stay gonna give her a stay i'm gonna
[04:57] walk out here
[04:59] come good girl
[05:03] nice and a heel for extra credit i
[05:06] love it okay okay good we have a flock
[05:09] of seagulls look at a nurse's reaction
[05:11] she's already noticed them but she's
[05:12] holding her stay really well
[05:14] some of the nurses favorite distractions
[05:16] happen to be things in the air like
[05:18] birds
[05:19] and airplanes so we have a lot of that
[05:21] here today inertia come
[05:27] lie down stand let's try to stand
[05:30] stay while i walk away again completely
[05:33] off leash that is the major change here
[05:35] from past lessons
[05:37] lie down stand stay
[05:41] come i guess i just can't help but mix
[05:46] it up like that to be unpredictable
[05:48] good girl good you want to take a break
[05:50] so let's try come when called as we walk
[05:51] around out here i mean there may be a
[05:53] situation where it's appropriate to do
[05:54] an off-leash hike in a rural area at
[05:56] some point i want to make sure that she
[05:58] comes back to me
[05:58] as we walk along the field so maybe i
[06:01] want to turn around and call her
[06:02] to come back this way inertia come
[06:09] whoa good girl lie down
[06:12] good job and we're just showing off with
[06:14] lie down that's all
[06:16] since she's behaving so well right now i
[06:17] want to give her some time to
[06:19] you know explore the environment she was
[06:21] really enjoying those clovers over there
[06:22] so i'm going to let her go back to it
[06:24] again we're just looking for general
[06:26] compliance we're trying to keep the
[06:27] training session very upbeat and
[06:29] pleasant for her so she doesn't feel
[06:30] like oh gosh
[06:31] i can't do anything we want her to feel
[06:33] like she can still do some things
[06:35] by the way i base this lesson on a
[06:37] section of my book guide to a
[06:38] well-behaved dog check out that book to
[06:40] help you with the most common behavior
[06:42] problems
[06:43] say we're walking and i notice a
[06:45] distraction in the distance i mean it
[06:46] could be
[06:47] a bear which is the reason i'm wearing
[06:48] bear spray here maybe i need to put her
[06:50] into a sudden stay for example inertia
[06:53] stay lie down good
[06:59] good job yes good work okay so i think
[07:02] it's a good idea to practice these
[07:04] spontaneous training sessions especially
[07:06] with stay and come when they're not
[07:07] expecting it so much
[07:09] inertia come yes
[07:14] good now
[07:17] i snagged this rope over here out of the
[07:18] bag i'm gonna use it
[07:20] as a surprise distraction here in a
[07:22] minute i'm gonna
[07:23] just let her tune out and walk around
[07:27] okay let's go go on go
[07:34] inertia come good girl
[07:37] lie down stay
[07:41] look at me here come
[07:44] good lie down
[07:47] stay you can see the genuine surprise
[07:50] there she didn't know it was coming
[07:51] okay good work here you go
[07:56] i like that she wants to play we'll go
[07:57] ahead and let her play with it
[07:59] she loves her tug toy good girl and so
[08:02] she's really focused today doing a good
[08:04] job
[08:05] fortunately it's a good day of training
[08:07] for her you never know with inertia kind
[08:09] of cool when you have a toy this
[08:10] powerful
[08:11] this isn't really like her she doesn't
[08:12] usually get this obsessed with toys so
[08:14] i actually like it she's behaving like
[08:16] an actual border collie right now
[08:20] if you have a dog that likes to play tug
[08:21] like this use this currency you don't
[08:23] always have to use
[08:24] treats so it's important to use the
[08:26] currency that your dog values most
[08:28] let's do another surprise drill with her
[08:30] this time i'm going to use the frisbee
[08:32] we're going to do some off-leash frisbee
[08:33] which wow
[08:34] awesome right good job very good now
[08:37] watch what i do this time
[08:38] i want to do an emergency come when
[08:40] called let go
[08:41] ready go faked her out
[08:44] come no come
[08:48] there we go
[08:51] come on lie down stay
[08:56] come around ready go
[08:59] inertia come
[09:03] come on good girl here it is yes
[09:06] ready go
[09:10] great job girl even with some people
[09:12] around here she's getting a little
[09:14] distracted but she's regaining that
[09:15] focus so i appreciate that
[09:16] go inertia come
[09:21] yes good girl you can see the confusion
[09:24] but she's still
[09:25] honoring come when called the point of
[09:28] this
[09:28] is you want your dog to know that they
[09:30] still need to listen to things like
[09:32] come when called even when they're in
[09:34] that confused state of mind in her mind
[09:36] she was virtually
[09:37] positive that i was going to throw the
[09:38] frisbee there but she heard me say come
[09:40] and she came running back
[09:42] heel come on and since i have her so
[09:46] into this tug toy and i have her off
[09:48] leash
[09:48] i'm going to use this as a reward here
[09:50] do some more training good job
[09:52] you're doing great right now
[09:55] come on come lie down
[10:02] stay
[10:06] okay get it so we got some dogs in the
[10:09] distance what a good opportunity to
[10:11] practice
[10:11] off-leash training in the presence of
[10:13] other dogs if you've been following our
[10:14] series you'll understand that the
[10:16] ultimate distraction for
[10:17] inertia are other dogs so we're gonna go
[10:20] over here we're gonna walk up near the
[10:22] fence where she
[10:22] sees the other dogs over there in the
[10:24] distance she gave them a look
[10:28] okay come
[10:32] girl yes do you want this or do you want
[10:35] you want to just smell
[10:37] fine a nurse has just spotted another
[10:40] dog
[10:41] stay so i'm seeing a great opportunity
[10:44] to practice getting her more
[10:46] focused while in the presence of other
[10:47] dogs over here looks like i've got her
[10:49] attention
[10:50] hey you want to play frisbee come around
[10:52] ready go
[10:53] so i was able to get her attention off
[10:54] the dog onto me to play frisbee that's
[10:56] always good let's see if this continues
[10:58] i'm going to deliberately play at close
[11:00] range
[11:00] to these other dogs she hasn't forgotten
[11:02] about the dog you know she's still
[11:04] keeping track
[11:05] stay come around
[11:08] yes go it's one of the reasons i like
[11:10] activities like fetch and frisbee it
[11:12] gives them that outlet of running and
[11:14] chasing and jumping and biting
[11:15] all that kind of fun stuff they like to
[11:17] do and again another great opportunity
[11:19] to practice
[11:19]  while dogs are right behind me this
[11:22] is the most distracted she's been
[11:23] all day and she's really doing well
[11:26] remember a nurse is a very social dog
[11:29] she can be interested in the other dog
[11:30] there's nothing wrong with that
[11:31] she just can't run and chase them
[11:33] without permission if your dog will
[11:34] behave
[11:35] closer and closer range to the things
[11:37] that distract them you'll
[11:39] know that you're making progress on your
[11:41] training
[11:42] take a break lie down inertia can be
[11:45] great at taking breaks
[11:46] seek out opportunities like this where
[11:48] you can easily control
[11:50] the variables in your training so here
[11:52] we have the fences in place so she can't
[11:54] immediately access them
[11:55] i'm able to exercise her just prior so
[11:58] she's more receptive to listening in
[12:00] other words these are the things you
[12:01] have to do to set your dog
[12:02] up for success there's a group of young
[12:04] people over there
[12:05] in the adjacent field she also loves
[12:07] children
[12:08] inertia stay
[12:13] yes very good like that she reduced her
[12:15] posture there i'm gonna go ahead and
[12:17] give her a reward
[12:18] and since we have this group of kids
[12:19] over here i'm gonna put her back on lead
[12:21] here never be afraid to do that
[12:23] i'm gonna go do some training at closer
[12:24] range and even though we have a fence i
[12:27] still want to have her on lead here
[12:29] because i don't want her to experience
[12:31] running 50 feet away from me and not
[12:32] listening
[12:34] inertia come yeah
[12:37] good girl so she saw the dog again just
[12:40] uh you know
[12:41] she's more distracted by the dog than
[12:42] the kids i suppose let's see
[12:46] inertia here come good girl
[12:50] lie down the high-pitched sound of these
[12:52] children over here is definitely going
[12:54] to be a distraction
[12:58] come yeah good girl i'm going to try
[13:01] everything without the lead now
[13:03] lie down stay
[13:09] come
[13:12] doing great yes
[13:16] stick come
[13:20] lie down stay even if you've been on top
[13:23] of your training you have to keep in
[13:25] mind those outlier events can still
[13:27] happen i mean we're in alaska for
[13:28] example
[13:29] a moose or a bear or an excited dog more
[13:31] likely could show up at any time
[13:33] come i didn't even have to call that
[13:35] time okay the distractions are out in
[13:37] full bloom now that we've been out here
[13:39] a little bit
[13:39] so doing these initial practice sessions
[13:41] in areas that still have an extra layer
[13:44] of protection
[13:44] like a fence is really important when
[13:46] you're teaching your dog to listen to
[13:47] you no matter what happens
[13:49] most people are way too quick to let
[13:52] their dogs off leash in
[13:53] uncontrolled settings i see this
[13:55] especially with new puppy parents since
[13:57] most puppies naturally have the tendency
[13:59] to stay close and not wander off but
[14:01] most puppies
[14:02] also grow up really fast and they might
[14:04] stay with you on one day but suddenly
[14:05] get the urge to run and chase a bird the
[14:07] next
[14:08] your goal is to prevent your dog from
[14:10] ever experiencing getting away from you
[14:12] or at least as little as possible that's
[14:14] why you shouldn't be afraid to go back
[14:15] to the long lead if your dog suddenly
[14:17] becomes overwhelmed of course if your
[14:19] dog has managed to get away from you in
[14:21] the past you can still get this training
[14:22] done but you're going to have to be very
[14:24] consistent and very deliberate about
[14:26] your training and doing the kinds of
[14:27] exercises we've done today so if you're
[14:29] going to do this right you can see
[14:30] off-leash training requires extensive
[14:33] proofing
[14:33] and testing check out all of puppets

[00:10] and i'm going to show you how i train
[00:11] her from day one things definitely won't
[00:14] always go smoothly you can start from
[00:16] the beginning or you can pick up
[00:18] anywhere subscribe and hit the bell
[00:20] notification so you never miss an
[00:21] episode when you put into motion an
[00:23] approach based on love and respect your
[00:25] results will forever
[00:26] remain in motion this is inertia
[00:29] welcome to the dog training experience
[00:34] i will tell you this though the easiest
[00:36] and most efficient way to feed your dog
[00:38] is to make sure their food is always
[00:40] there wouldn't it be great if you could
[00:42] just choose your dog's food one time
[00:44] and just tell the universe how often you
[00:46] want the food to be there
[00:47] you can just go to pepflow and enter
[00:50] code zach30 when you check out and to
[00:51] make sure you love getting your pets
[00:53] food from petflow they're going to give
[00:54] you
[00:54] ten dollars off your first three
[00:57] automatic shipments
[00:58] i'll have that linked below you know it
[01:00] seems that most behaviors we don't like
[01:02] like hyperactivity
[01:03] barking and jumping or just generally
[01:06] not listening
[01:07] stem from a dog not having enough of a
[01:09] release for all of that energy
[01:10] but what if there was a way to quickly
[01:13] and concisely
[01:14] get all of that energy out of your dog
[01:16] and make them behave almost instantly
[01:18] like perfect pets there is well
[01:22] kind of anyway you guys have been
[01:23] watching me over the last year
[01:25] trying to train inertia to play a nice
[01:27] fluid game of fetch with me
[01:29] basically ever since i brought her home
[01:30] at eight weeks old it definitely has not
[01:32] gone smoothly the entire time
[01:34] but we made a lot of progress and i want
[01:36] to show you how she's doing and
[01:37] why it really matters since i'm going to
[01:40] ask inertia to do some rigorous exercise
[01:43] in a second
[01:43] i first want to get her warmed up i
[01:45] don't want to just encourage her to go
[01:46] straight into a sprint
[01:48] sit pretty is really good because it
[01:49] stretches out that spinal cord
[01:52] really gets her a little warmed up take
[01:54] a bow is another good trick
[01:55] look at her you can actually see her
[01:57] stretching right there i love it
[01:58] good girl weaving through the legs a way
[02:01] to get her moving nice and agile there
[02:03] you
[02:03] go good lie down come around get it
[02:07] by having her stand on her hind legs
[02:08] that really gets her hind legs warmed up
[02:10] as well so doing tricks like this can
[02:12] really just get your dog warmed up to
[02:14] decrease the chances of any unnecessary
[02:16] injuries now if your dog doesn't know
[02:18] tricks like this yet that's okay
[02:20] you can probably get them warmed up with
[02:22] a walk or even an off-leash hike before
[02:24] you do
[02:24] some serious exercise with them the
[02:26] thing is if you've got a dog with a lot
[02:28] of energy you're actually trying to give
[02:30] them a
[02:30] satisfying round of exercise so by
[02:32] teaching them a super
[02:34] fluid game of fetch you're gonna get the
[02:36] most bang for your buck i mean the idea
[02:38] is to get your dog to run in a straight
[02:39] line
[02:40] after the object that you're throwing
[02:41] today i'm using frisbee immediately
[02:43] after they get the item you want them
[02:45] coming back to you in a straight line
[02:46] you want them letting go and eagerly
[02:49] awaiting that next throw that's how i
[02:51] define a fluid game of fetch
[02:53] inertia's focus has been building over
[02:55] time and it's getting
[02:56] really good these days during fetch and
[02:58] the reason fetch like this is so great
[03:01] is because not only does she get to run
[03:03] and jump and catch something and get all
[03:04] that energy out
[03:06] but she's also working with a human
[03:08] being like me
[03:09] and at their core that's where dogs seem
[03:11] to be the most content when they get to
[03:13] work in harmony with a human being dogs
[03:15] have been
[03:16] selectively bred over the years to have
[03:18] so much
[03:19] stamina and so much endurance this
[03:21] really benefited hunters who were in the
[03:23] field with dogs or helped others manage
[03:26] livestock for hours on end but you know
[03:28] now that we don't use dogs in this
[03:30] manner as much it's so vital
[03:32] that we find ways to satisfy those still
[03:34] present genetics
[03:36] so the game of fetch not only gives your
[03:37] dog a physical way to rapidly dispense
[03:40] lots of energy in a short period of time
[03:42] but it also seems to satisfy their urge
[03:44] to work with a person
[03:45] and that's one of the things that really
[03:46] makes dogs super unique
[03:48] nice i don't think she has not missed a
[03:50] single frisbee today anytime inertia
[03:52] looks like she wants to take a break or
[03:54] i can tell she's starting to get a
[03:55] little bit winded
[03:56] i'm happy to let her do so when she
[03:58] naturally lies down is it to say okay
[04:00] i need to take a break i'll say
[04:01] something like take a break so over time
[04:04] she's really come to learn what
[04:05] take a break means and of course
[04:07] depending on whether i like to start a
[04:09] round of fetch with about four or eight
[04:11] throws somewhere in between there
[04:12] and then i'll encourage her to take a
[04:14] break this is really important
[04:16] a lot of people will play with their dog
[04:18] like we just have with inertia and then
[04:20] their dog's like
[04:21] i'm so tired i need to take a break and
[04:23] the person then just assumes
[04:25] well i guess the exercise is over but
[04:28] especially with those
[04:28] really energetic dogs it takes just a
[04:31] few minutes for them to recharge
[04:33] and be ready for another round so if
[04:35] you're really trying to give your dog a
[04:36] super satisfying workout the real trick
[04:39] is to do
[04:40] multiple rounds of fetch with short
[04:42] breaks in between
[04:44] usually i like to give a dog about five
[04:46] to ten minutes between rounds to give
[04:47] them a nice long break
[04:49] but it's important to also keep in mind
[04:51] that there's a big difference between
[04:53] your dog
[04:54] getting tired or getting winded or just
[04:56] getting bored
[04:57] and that's something you're gonna have
[04:58] to learn with your own individual dog
[05:00] for example if inertia was showing a
[05:02] lack of interest on my third throw of
[05:04] the day
[05:04] i would know she's likely not getting
[05:06] tired yet but more likely interested in
[05:08] other things so i've had to make things
[05:11] more exciting for her in order to build
[05:13] her interest in the game
[05:14] and if you've been keeping up with this
[05:15] series you'll know i've been dealing
[05:17] with
[05:17] exactly that issue virtually the entire
[05:19] time that i've had inertia but she's
[05:21] really starting to break through in
[05:22] recent months
[05:23] by the way here's a pro tip pick your
[05:25] home base when you're playing fetch with
[05:27] them in a shady spot
[05:28] most dogs naturally seek out shade when
[05:30] they want to take a break so the shade
[05:32] works kind of like a magnet to encourage
[05:34] your dog to lie down
[05:36] in the right place remember every dog is
[05:38] different in terms of how much exercise
[05:40] they'll need but in a nurse's case i'll
[05:42] typically do
[05:43] 20 to 40 minutes of cumulative exercise
[05:46] with five to ten minute breaks in
[05:48] between in addition to exercise there
[05:50] are still a lot of things we need to
[05:51] know to
[05:52] train our dogs and get them to listen to
[05:53] us i really detail
[05:55] virtually everything you would ever want
[05:57] to know about dog training in my books
[05:58] i'll have links below
[05:59] looks like she's recharged up so let me
[06:02] show you what else we can do
[06:03] come around you might have noticed that
[06:05] i have a nurse come around like that i
[06:07] get asked about that a lot the reason i
[06:09] do that is because i want inertia
[06:10] running in a straight line
[06:11] making as few turns or unnecessary
[06:14] movements as possible
[06:15] just as a review to teach this you know
[06:17] get them really into the toy
[06:19] teach them to come around and go and one
[06:21] of the benefits to playing in a field
[06:23] like this is that your dog gets in the
[06:25] habit of running away from you at full
[06:27] speed and then
[06:28] immediately coming back to you that's a
[06:30] really good thing for them to practice
[06:32] they also get used to listening to you
[06:33] at more vast
[06:35] distances which can be very valuable in
[06:37] the real world when you need to get
[06:39] control of your dog or get them to come
[06:40] back to you in certain situations like
[06:42] that you have the benefit
[06:44] of getting them to listen to you while
[06:45] they're in this really
[06:47] good mindset of playing and it's really
[06:49] likely to excel
[06:51] your results and training in general
[06:53] also just by nature of practicing in
[06:55] public places like this you're going to
[06:56] have organic distractions
[06:58] at usually pretty low levels for example
[07:00] we've got some people over here playing
[07:02] some catching she's having to pay
[07:03] attention to me with that going on in
[07:05] the background
[07:06] so it really allows you to phase in
[07:08] these moderate distractions while
[07:09] they're kind of far away
[07:11] so that your dog starts to get used to
[07:13] listening to you in a variety of
[07:14] situations so i
[07:16] embrace it when we have distractions
[07:17] like this you add to that that she's in
[07:19] a fatigued
[07:20] state therefore she's more likely to
[07:22] listen to me therefore the training is
[07:24] much more likely to stick
[07:26] you can see that heavy pant right there
[07:27] that's what i like to see
[07:29] no need to push her beyond a few throws
[07:31] so let's go take a break come on
[07:33] if your dog has not yet learned a
[07:35] reliable game of fetch or they're just
[07:36] generally unreliable on their training
[07:38] as many hyperactive dogs are
[07:40] because it can be tough to get through
[07:42] to them in an unexercised state
[07:44] and make sure you're using a long lead
[07:46] so that you can easily manage them now
[07:48] throughout the series i've shown you how
[07:49] i've used a long lead and how i'm
[07:51] phasing it into off-lease training with
[07:53] inertia we've been working for the last
[07:54] 15 months or so towards playing fetch
[07:56] off
[07:57] lead you wouldn't just start by playing
[07:59] off leash like this
[08:00] until your dog is reliable but that's
[08:02] the wonderful thing about this series
[08:04] isn't it you can actually go back and
[08:05] see how we taught
[08:06] every little thing just to get inertia
[08:08] playing fetch like you're seeing here
[08:10] today has taken a lot of time and
[08:12] patience it's been more challenging to
[08:14] train
[08:14] inertia how to do this basic skill than
[08:16] it has for some of my other dogs in the
[08:18] past but again that's the beauty every
[08:20] dog is completely unique
[08:21] and of course inertia has skills that
[08:23] some of my other dogs in the past didn't
[08:25] have as well for example i've never had
[08:26] a dog before that could do a somersault
[08:28] it's true that a lot of dogs especially
[08:30] watercolors are known to take to playing
[08:32] fetch relatively easily but there are
[08:34] always exceptions like with inertia so
[08:36] keep in mind with many dogs fetch is not
[08:39] the most natural thing for them even if
[08:40] that is their breed
[08:41] and what they're supposed to be able to
[08:43] do fetch can be an acquired taste
[08:46] to many dogs one great thing about this
[08:48] series is that i have the entire process
[08:50] of training inertia completely
[08:52] documented for you guys like we
[08:53] literally have the first time she ever
[08:56] caught a frisbee
[08:57] on video and that was an amazing moment
[08:59] for us
[09:00] inertia more than any dog i have ever
[09:03] had really struggled with getting hooked
[09:05] on the game of fetch she might show
[09:07] interest here and there but it wasn't
[09:09] completely reliable and it wasn't her
[09:11] favorite thing on earth to do
[09:12] but i really felt that if i just kept
[09:14] working with her that i could really get
[09:15] her to like this game and so far it's
[09:17] succeeding
[09:18] whoa i think that counts
[09:21] i think that yeah that was a catch first
[09:24] catch
[09:24] awesome that's so good i was really
[09:27] really hoping
[09:28] we would get her first catch on camera
[09:30] and we did bottom line
[09:31] if you really commit to teaching your
[09:33] dog this fluid polished game of fetch
[09:35] and you're giving them breaks and
[09:36] sufficient rounds you should find that
[09:38] virtually any dog
[09:40] is going to be the best behaved dog on
[09:43] earth

[00:29] to the dog training experience
[00:33] okay i've got to admit before we get
[00:35] into today's lesson there is one
[00:37] very important prerequisite and that is
[00:39] that your dog has an understanding of
[00:41] their very basic skills

[00:44] just need a refresher check out my free
[00:46] digital dog training course 30 day

[00:50] teach your dog all of the most important
[00:51] foundational skills they need to know

[00:56] program is actually based on the
[00:57] syllabus
[00:58] that i used to do when i taught real dog
[01:00] training classes

[01:09] extra training tips
[01:11] schedules and lists to help keep you on
[01:13] track and one of the coolest things is
[01:14] you get exclusive access to a private
[01:17] facebook community
[01:18] there's even an app so that you can have
[01:20] everything you need in your pocket at
[01:22] all times to reference on the go it's
[01:24] all totally free i swear i'll have a
[01:26] link in the description
[01:27] assuming your dog understands the very
[01:30] basic concept of
[01:31] come when called sit stay believe it and
[01:34] some other basic things
[01:35] you're ready to start training them in
[01:37] seconds at a time to listen to you when
[01:39] it
[01:40] really matters and in the real world so
[01:43] when you think about a typical
[01:44] dog training lesson you might think
[01:46] about sitting down with your dog and
[01:48] working on something brand new with them
[01:50] or working on something they already
[01:51] know right maybe you'll do that for
[01:53] 20 minutes at a time or so i mean think
[01:55] back to when you got your first puppy or
[01:57] your first dog
[01:58] you had to very deliberately sit down
[02:00] with them and walk them through
[02:01] just about everything when and where to
[02:04] do their business what's okay to chew on
[02:06] and what's not the basic concepts of
[02:08] life-saving skills like come
[02:10] and stay and if you're like most people
[02:12] it took pretty deliberate effort over
[02:14] the span of many weeks to just get
[02:16] basic versions of those things from your
[02:18] dog but at some point you really have to
[02:20] evolve your training mentality
[02:22] from this is my dedicated training time
[02:24] and start putting a much stronger
[02:26] emphasis
[02:26] on tiny spontaneous training sessions
[02:29] throughout the day
[02:29] now don't get me wrong longer dedicated
[02:32] training sessions definitely have their
[02:33] place
[02:34] and they're a completely necessary part
[02:35] of training a dog but as your dog
[02:37] demonstrates that they really are
[02:38] getting these basic versions you
[02:40] have to move on to more spontaneous
[02:43] training sessions
[02:44] for instance once you've really done a
[02:46] thorough introduction and shown your dog
[02:48] all of the parts of a basic skill like
[02:49] staying at an open doorway
[02:51] find times during the day while your dog
[02:53] is preoccupied with something
[02:55] randomly open the front door and ask
[02:56] them to stay on
[02:58] super short notice each instance of
[03:00] training like this can be significantly
[03:02] more profound than
[03:03] practice you would do in a more
[03:04] obviously set up training session
[03:07] because instead of being in a focused
[03:09] school state of mind
[03:10] your dog is in their regular day-to-day
[03:12] mindset because inertia has mastered a
[03:15] basic stay
[03:16] now she's at the point where sometimes
[03:17] throughout the day when she's
[03:19] not expecting it at all i might open a
[03:21] door and throw something really exciting
[03:23] out so that she learns to be really good
[03:25] about staying on very short notice
[03:27] right now i've got an impromptu lesson
[03:29] planned for inertia i want to be able to
[03:31] open the front door
[03:32] and the back door both i've never done
[03:34] this training exercise where i've had
[03:36] her stay with wide open doors
[03:38] over here stink
[03:45] back up good
[03:49] we even had someone walk by over here
[03:52] stay so this is brand new for inertia
[03:55] being able to leave the front door
[03:56] open like this while i have her stay but
[03:59] that's what we've worked
[04:00] up to over the last several months on
[04:01] this safety is always the number one
[04:03] priority so you wouldn't want to
[04:05] practice this until you've worked up to
[04:07] a reliable stay at the door so my goal
[04:10] is to make sure that no matter how
[04:12] exciting it is out there
[04:13] that she does not run out of the front
[04:15] door stay
[04:26] stay
[04:32] okay get it
[04:36] good job let go so watch this i'm gonna
[04:39] get her really into it right here at
[04:40] this door right here
[04:54] stay
[04:57] okay get it good job
[05:01] come lie down
[05:05] very good okay go get it
[05:12] so in this example you're practicing
[05:14] more than just the literal skill of
[05:16] staying at an open door
[05:18] you're also teaching your dog to perform
[05:20] that skill when they're in a very
[05:21] surprised
[05:22] state of mind that's the real value here
[05:25] after all that's when we want our dogs
[05:26] to listen to something as
[05:28] important as stay the most there are so
[05:31] many different ways to work on basic
[05:33] impulse control exercises minutes at a
[05:35] time i cover way more in my books than
[05:37] we'll have time
[05:38] for in this episode so if you want to
[05:39] check them out i'll have a link below
[05:41] here's another example a real-life
[05:42] leave-it when you very
[05:44] first train your dog to leave it you
[05:46] know you sit down with them for a few
[05:47] minutes and you hold a treat in your
[05:49] hand and teach them to leave it alone in
[05:51] a very focused way
[05:52] and that type of training lesson is a
[05:54] completely necessary step
[05:56] but it's a completely different context
[05:59] than
[05:59] leaving something alone in a more
[06:00] real-world circumstance but when you're
[06:02] making lunch or dinner initiate
[06:04] realistic
[06:05] short surprise tests for your dog if
[06:07] you're trying to train your dog how to
[06:09] stay off the counter
[06:10] and stop eating things when you drop
[06:11] them take four seconds to simulate a
[06:14] training session that closely mimics
[06:16] real life
[06:16] i've designed a brand new exercise for
[06:19] inertia she's never seen this one before
[06:20] so she doesn't know what to expect
[06:22] but you know say you're at your
[06:24] refrigerator right and you want to
[06:26] spontaneously surprise your dog and make
[06:29] sure that they
[06:30] understand a broad generalized leave it
[06:33] let's see we've got a piece of meat here
[06:38] leave it great
[06:41] that was some leftover steak i had for a
[06:44] inertia leave it
[06:46] of course you're going to need to phase
[06:48] in these pop quizzes with your dog you
[06:50] still want to make sure that you're
[06:51] prepared to intervene if you're teaching
[06:53] them a new concept or
[06:54] if this whole idea of spontaneous
[06:56] training sessions like this
[06:58] is new to them i'm not even having to
[07:00] say leave it
[07:01] what about some taco bell sauce
[07:05] you can probably tell we don't cook too
[07:08] much
[07:10] but i was at the grocery store the other
[07:12] day and they were selling this whole bag
[07:14] of real-life lobster claws
[07:18] and i was like i've gotta get that i
[07:20] only had to tell her leave it the one
[07:22] time hey
[07:22] i'm still paying attention to you maybe
[07:24] i'll remind her
[07:26] leave it alone please if your dog is
[07:28] more advanced though up the annie by
[07:30] asking them to
[07:31] leave it alone and also spontaneously
[07:33] come to you from across the room
[07:35] inertia come
[07:38] that's so funny she's like just being
[07:40] extra safe
[07:42] good girl stay
[07:46] come is that funny
[07:50] nice job yes here you go
[07:53] good that was so good i'm very proud of
[07:56] you and sometimes you
[07:58] step on the taco bell sauce and you
[07:59] still want your dog to leave it alone
[08:02] inertia come good girl oh look i was
[08:05] even able to get her to go through this
[08:07] time
[08:08] nice job it's okay come this way
[08:12] leave it
[08:16] yes basic impulse control exercises like
[08:20] this
[08:20] are going to come in very handy
[08:22] throughout your dog's life because think
[08:23] about how often your dog is suddenly
[08:25] presented with something that they want
[08:27] to get
[08:28] but they're not allowed to i remember
[08:30] one time training inertia and i
[08:31] accidentally dropped an
[08:32] entire bag of treats and this worked
[08:35] really well that's one of the many
[08:36] reasons we emphasize
[08:37] leave it so much there are accidents
[08:39] that happen in their surroundings all
[08:41] the time
[08:42] and this is a pretty harmless one if she
[08:44] were to get the treats but could be
[08:45] something more dangerous in the future
[08:47] let's cover another completely different
[08:48] example all right let's say that when
[08:50] you get home your dog is so excited to
[08:52] see you and they jump all over you
[08:53] because
[08:54] you've been away for a bit if this is
[08:55] something that you'd like to stop simply
[08:57] ignoring your dog for the first five
[08:58] minutes or so
[08:59] is a great way to discourage this type
[09:01] of behavior
[09:02] and at the end of five minutes give them
[09:04] all the love in the world if you do this
[09:05] over a couple of weeks or maybe more
[09:07] you'll probably notice that your dog
[09:09] actually gives you a chance to get your
[09:11] groceries inside the house without
[09:13] totally flipping out and jumping all
[09:14] over the place
[09:15] come when called is another one of my
[09:17] very favorite things to practice with
[09:19] inertia
[09:19] a few seconds at a time throughout the
[09:21] day you can see right now she's just
[09:24] walking around she sees mom with a
[09:26] camera over there
[09:28] and so i might just say inertia
[09:31] come and like before by teaching your
[09:33] dog to come to you while you and your
[09:35] dog are
[09:36] not in a rehearsed state of mind you're
[09:38] teaching them how to come to you on
[09:40] short notice think about it when do you
[09:42] want your dog to come to you the most
[09:44] it's not when they're completely focused
[09:46] on you in a dedicated training session
[09:47] but when their
[09:48] mind is wandering and they're focused on
[09:50] something completely different than you
[09:52] a dog is truly trained in these small
[09:54] moments
[09:55] and it's the little things that you do
[09:57] that are ultimately going to determine
[09:59] how well your dog listens
[10:00] throughout the day ask yourself what can
[10:02] you do for the next 30 seconds with your
[10:04] dog to establish or
[10:05] further your communication together
[10:07] short spontaneous training sessions like
[10:09] this are the key to cementing your dog's
[10:11] training in the real world
[10:13] so go ahead and get started on polishing
[10:15] up your basics by signing up for my

Description:

How I introduced Inertia to the Furbo: https://youtu.be/O_Iz_cJE3FY

TRANSCRIPTION:

[00:00] today we're gonna see what's new with
[00:03] one of the most interesting pieces of
[00:04] technology in the entire dog world the
[00:07] Furbo dog camera if you followed me
[00:10] you'll know that I've been using frobo
[00:11] dog camera for many years now I consider
[00:13] it one of the most valuable tools that I
[00:16] have Furbo is a camera that lets you see
[00:19] and actually talk to your dog anytime
[00:21] you want to you can give them treats
[00:23] remotely and you can get notified when
[00:25] they're barking it actually knows the
[00:26] difference between howling crying
[00:28] barking and continuous barking it can
[00:30] alert you if a person is in the house if
[00:32] your dog has been active for a while if
[00:34] a smoke or a carbon monoxide alarm is
[00:36] going off and basically automatically
[00:38] notify you of everything important that
[00:40] happens with your dog throughout the day
[00:42] and what fascinates me is how do they
[00:44] get this thing to do all of that to me
[00:47] one of the most stressful Parts about
[00:49] having a dog is not knowing exactly
[00:51] what's going on with them when you're
[00:52] not there Furbo really does solve this
[00:55] problem better than any product I've
[00:58] seen so far they gave me an awesome
[01:00] offer for you guys I'm going to have it
[01:01] in the description below let's look at
[01:03] what differentiates Furbo from other
[01:05] products on the market and you can
[01:06] determine if it's worth it one of the
[01:08] most obvious benefits of Furbo is that
[01:10] you can give your dog a treat from
[01:11] anywhere when you're not whole at one
[01:13] note when you first introduce for a boat
[01:15] to your dog you want to do it very
[01:16] cautiously and at a distance to really
[01:18] get your dog familiar with what it does
[01:20] so they don't have treats shooting at
[01:21] them from the sky all of a sudden I'll
[01:23] have a video below where I showed you
[01:25] how I introduce Furbo to inertia now you
[01:27] can put any kind of treats in here so
[01:29] you don't have to use some weird
[01:31] proprietary treat I actually like to put
[01:33] a mixture of things I have like kibble
[01:34] in here and then I have some
[01:35] freeze-dried sweet potatoes I like to
[01:38] mix things up in a nurse's case I really
[01:40] like her to be extra surprised you'll
[01:42] notice too that sometimes Furbo shoots
[01:43] out one treat sometimes it shoots out
[01:45] two or three treats or even more to
[01:47] really keep things super random for your
[01:49] dog Randomness is very effective when
[01:51] you're trying to get your dog to like
[01:52] something this is how it works you just
[01:54] launch the Furbo app on your phone we
[01:56] actually have two furbos we have one in
[01:58] Atlanta at our place there and then we
[02:00] have one in New Orleans which is right
[02:02] here so you can see there we are
[02:04] you just tap this right here and it'll
[02:07] launch treats
[02:08] and you can see naturally inertia is
[02:10] quite interested and inertia loves it
[02:12] when like four or five small treats come
[02:14] out and you can easily talk to your dog
[02:16] here through the app which is cool so
[02:18] I'm gonna go around the corner I'm going
[02:19] to call inertia and I'm going to reward
[02:21] her for coming to the Furbo all right
[02:23] this is cool inertia come
[02:26] so you can see she comes running let me
[02:28] go ahead and reward her for coming when
[02:29] called
[02:30] and I can just
[02:32] watch it
[02:34] at first glance the camera and the treat
[02:36] tossing ability really shine as standout
[02:38] features of the Furbo and they are but
[02:40] honestly the real-time smart alerts to
[02:43] me are what set the Furbo apart with a
[02:46] traditional webcam for example what do
[02:47] you have to do you have to like pull out
[02:49] your phone and manually check in to see
[02:51] how your dog is doing but Furbo is
[02:53] watching even when you aren't in
[02:54] particular the bark alerts are very
[02:57] useful we would know wouldn't we inertia
[03:00] don't look like you don't know what I'm
[03:01] talking about dogs bark and some
[03:05] more than others you guys know that this
[03:07] has been one of my dog inertia's biggest
[03:09] issues while I was able to get her
[03:11] barking under control when I was with
[03:13] her she really struggled to relax
[03:14] sometimes when we were away from her and
[03:17] this has been instrumental in making
[03:18] progress on that issue Let's test The
[03:21] Barking alert inertia speak
[03:24] that's very good
[03:25] speak again
[03:29] so right there you can see it just came
[03:31] up
[03:32] see that I mean that's pretty good I
[03:35] like that I get it on my watch too so if
[03:37] you have a smart watch that's pretty
[03:38] neat it's one thing to be notified when
[03:40] your dog is barking and that's extremely
[03:42] useful but on top of that Furbo allows
[03:44] me to actually train inertia how to be
[03:47] quiet by reinforcing moments of calm
[03:50] quiet Behavior which is the real trick
[03:52] to resolving unwanted barking so when
[03:55] inertia is playing around the house and
[03:56] being quiet I can offer her a treat so
[03:58] that she'll learn to equate that
[04:00] acceptable quiet Behavior with a fun
[04:02] reward so this really makes Furbo
[04:04] invaluable the artificial intelligence
[04:06] this has is extremely impressive I mean
[04:08] you can tell the difference between
[04:09] barking howling crying or continuous
[04:12] barking I think it's great that they
[04:14] distinguish between these different
[04:15] types of vocalizations because every one
[04:18] of those sounds can mean something
[04:19] different if your dog is howling or
[04:21] crying this might indicate that they're
[04:23] feeling more anxious than normal which
[04:24] can help you identify potential issues
[04:26] like separation anxiety it's also really
[04:29] helpful to see which things are more
[04:30] likely to make your dog bark like
[04:32] passing job for example learning what
[04:34] triggers your dog helps you address
[04:35] things like barking much more
[04:37] efficiently when you're training I've
[04:39] been using verbo for years now and I
[04:40] love how they take all of their user
[04:42] feedback into account and they're
[04:43] constantly making improvements by adding
[04:46] new features because of regular software
[04:48] updates Furbo just continues to get
[04:50] better the longer you have it so it's
[04:52] basically future proof and I really
[04:53] appreciate that because not a lot of dog
[04:56] Tech does that let's go over the dog
[04:58] activity alerts it can be very valuable
[05:00] to know how active or not active your
[05:03] dog is while you're away if your dog is
[05:04] getting active and getting the Zoomies
[05:06] all day as inertia sometimes does it's
[05:08] very nice to know that so this can help
[05:10] you know if you're giving your dog the
[05:11] right amount of exercise before you
[05:13] leave or if your dog is acting unusually
[05:14] tired maybe that means that they're not
[05:16] feeling well and might tip you off to a
[05:18] medical issue an interesting side effect
[05:20] of this device is that lots of pet
[05:21] parents have already been notified that
[05:23] their dogs are moving around only to
[05:25] discover that their dog got access to
[05:27] something that could be potentially
[05:28] dangerous getting alerted right away in
[05:30] those situations can be very important
[05:32] one of the really neat features about
[05:34] Furbo is that when your dog gets really
[05:36] close it'll snap a selfie of them so
[05:38] you'll get selfies throughout the day
[05:40] and who wouldn't want that it'll
[05:42] actually notify you as well when a
[05:43] person arrives at your house one thing
[05:45] you might not expect from a device like
[05:47] this is that it can identify the
[05:48] difference between a dog and a person so
[05:51] it has the added benefit of being a
[05:52] security camera too just in case you're
[05:54] not expecting a person to be at your
[05:56] house at a given time also sometimes
[05:58] it's really reassuring just to know that
[06:00] a family member or dog sitter has
[06:02] arrived to tend to your dog I'm
[06:04] expecting Furbo to come up with a play
[06:05] dead alert any day now you can even have
[06:07] it give you a daily highlight video so
[06:10] that you can quickly see what your dog
[06:11] did throughout the day so it's a really
[06:13] good way to get a quick Glimpse and see
[06:15] how your dog got along while you were
[06:16] away that's their doggy diary feature
[06:18] it's really cool when your dog is at
[06:20] home and you're away their safety is
[06:22] obviously always our biggest priority
[06:24] and concern if a fire alarm or a carbon
[06:26] monoxide alarm goes off Furbo will even
[06:28] detect that the smart alerts have saved
[06:30] the lives of over 500 dogs around the
[06:33] world already and ferbo is always adding
[06:35] new things I was just reading on their
[06:37] website that they're going to be adding
[06:39] dog emergency alerts which are coming
[06:41] soon apparently that's going to include
[06:43] choking alerts vomit alerts seriously
[06:46] and seizure alerts too The Barking
[06:48] alerts we talked about always going to
[06:50] be free and you'll get a free 30-day
[06:52] trial of all of the other smart alerts
[06:54] after that it's only 99 Cents for three
[06:56] months so that you can get a really good
[06:58] sample and determine if it's worth
[06:59] taking advantage of those features then
[07:01] it's only 6.99 a month or 69 a year so
[07:04] they really give you a chance to use
[07:06] this service extensively to see if it's
[07:08] right for you the bottom line is that
[07:10] frobo provides you with a mountain of
[07:12] data and information so that you can
[07:14] make decisions that are best for your
[07:16] dog so this is a way that you can
[07:18] actually be virtually with your dog no
[07:20] matter where you are and make sure that
[07:22] they're happy and safe no matter what is
[07:24] ferbo worth it ultimately you're gonna
[07:26] have to decide that but I think it's one
[07:28] of the must-have products for anybody
[07:30] with a dog if you want to try Furbo out
[07:32] they offer free returns for 30 days so
[07:34] there's absolutely no risk at all Furbo
[07:37] is having their biggest sale of the year
[07:39] right now I'll have my special link in
[07:41] the description where you can save get
[07:43] this 46 off of your Furbo dog camera if
[07:46] you have a Furbo tell me what the most
[07:48] interesting thing that you caught your
[07:50] dog doing when you're not at home in the
[07:51] comments below enjoy and we'll see you
[07:53] in the next video

[00:06] series
[00:06] so if you're trying to learn how to
[00:08] train your new dog you have come to the
[00:10] right place
[00:11] i'm zach george i'm a dog trainer meet
[00:13] my new project
[00:14] kona i've got just three weeks to train
[00:16] her and set her up for the most
[00:17] well-behaved life possible that means i
[00:19] need to work on the most common puppy
[00:21] issues like potty training how to
[00:22] actually pay attention
[00:24] stopping things like play biting chewing
[00:26] separation anxiety
[00:27] getting along with other animals leash
[00:29] walking and teaching her everything a
[00:31] good dog needs to know
[00:32] real dog training doesn't always go
[00:34] smoothly and that's why i'm going to
[00:35] show you
[00:36] every success and mistake and how i work
[00:38] through all the most
[00:39] challenging parts of raising a new puppy
[00:42] welcome to your new puppy survival guide
[00:47] hello oh my goodness look at her
[00:50] this is tristan's dog oh my god she's
[00:53] beautiful oh hi
[00:54] hey guys i'm tristan zack's video editor
[00:57] my wife kate and i recently got an irish
[00:58] doodle puppy named kona
[01:00] and we have a baby on the way so i want
[01:02] to make sure the puppy gets the best
[01:03] start possible
[01:04] good luck zach first thing i'd like to
[01:06] do is show a dog where to go potty and
[01:08] she's been on the road for about 45
[01:10] minutes probably
[01:11] so want to give her a chance to go potty
[01:13] oh isn't she adorable
[01:14] yes wow there's so much to train a new
[01:18] puppy
[01:19] but we've got to start somewhere how
[01:20] about with potty training
[01:23] nice potty training's going well so far
[01:26] that's good
[01:27] all right call as much as you want
[01:28] [Music]
[01:30] absolutely absolutely all right see you
[01:32] soon
[01:33] that's okay yeah you just walk out the
[01:35] door right now and look
[01:36] i'm told one of her issues is separation
[01:40] anxiety so that's something that we're
[01:42] going to be paying attention to
[01:43] as we get to know her but right now yeah
[01:46] there it is right there
[01:49] right right now our main focus is simply
[01:52] in
[01:53] and getting her comfortable with this
[01:55] new place hey what's going on i mean the
[01:57] second her dad walks out the door you
[01:58] can see that she's thrown off and oh
[02:00] hello
[02:00] i'm your new dad not really but i'm your
[02:03] caretaker for the next few weeks
[02:05] it's going to be okay looks like she
[02:08] accepted that pretty quick
[02:10] i think the fastest way to get her
[02:12] comfortable in this new place is to get
[02:13] her
[02:14] playing and get her really interested in
[02:16] me let her check out things we have
[02:17] a lot to do over the next 24 hours with
[02:20] her so
[02:21] i think we should get started when i'm
[02:22] working with a new puppy i prefer to use
[02:24] a harness with them
[02:25] so i want to get her used to wearing the
[02:27] harness although
[02:29] we haven't really gotten off to a good
[02:30] start here have we okay no
[02:32] you're supposed to wear this not what
[02:34] have i gotten myself into i need to get
[02:36] her comfortable with her harness let me
[02:38] see if i have some treats here from our
[02:40] bark box he's gonna love this
[02:42] what's the theme trick or treat check
[02:44] this out
[02:45] jack o lamb
[02:50] she's making herself right at home what
[02:51] is this
[02:54] is that good or what i'm trying to get
[02:57] her to poke her head through it like
[02:58] this
[02:59] there we go look at that what that was
[03:02] so
[03:02] slick so far yes good it's partially on
[03:06] let's give her a treat so we can
[03:08] keep her optimistic throughout the
[03:09] harness wearing process and
[03:11] i think that'll fit perfectly great look
[03:14] at that
[03:15] there we go good girl all right barkbox
[03:18] and super chew are monthly subscription
[03:20] boxes where they send you amazing treats
[03:22] and toys
[03:22] every month i mean you can see instantly
[03:24] i haven't even had a chance to take the
[03:26] tag off
[03:27] and she's into her candy corn she loves
[03:31] it let's see what other kind of toy do
[03:32] we have
[03:32] if i'm gonna get kona super comfortable
[03:34] with me there's no shame in showering
[03:36] her with gifts
[03:37] right away these treats have already
[03:38] come in handy she's been here less than
[03:40] five minutes and i've already been able
[03:41] to get her comfortable wearing a harness
[03:43] playing with toys
[03:44] and bark also sends you a chew but it
[03:46] looks like kona might want some tougher
[03:48] things to chew on i mean don't
[03:49] underestimate puppies that's what super
[03:51] chewers for
[03:52] this is a completely new level of
[03:54] toughness right here
[03:56] let go did we get lucky i think we did
[04:00] what's that all right awesome look how
[04:03] she's instantly kind of chewing on it
[04:05] for a teething puppy too a super chewer
[04:07] box can be really valuable
[04:09] that one's a lot tougher this one has a
[04:10] little more give let's see if she likes
[04:12] it
[04:13] hey what's this get it
[04:16] i love how she just like tries every new
[04:18] toy so we have plenty of supplies plenty
[04:20] of treats right now there should be
[04:22] nothing that we can't teach her and all
[04:24] of you are gonna get a free bark box or
[04:27] a free
[04:27] super chewer box just go to barkbox.com
[04:30] dog training or superchewer.com
[04:32] dog training you better hope that kona
[04:34] leaves a box for the rest of you
[04:36] now i've intentionally avoided meeting
[04:39] kona
[04:40] she's been with her new family for a few
[04:42] weeks right now but i really just wanted
[04:44] this to be as authentic and real as
[04:46] possible
[04:47] so i've just met her today she's going
[04:49] to be living with us for the next few
[04:51] weeks
[04:52] and i'm going to do my best to get her
[04:54] as far as we can get her
[04:56] to prepare her for an amazing life so
[04:58] she's going to have an amazing life
[05:00] either way
[05:01] what a good girl ah yeah okay so right
[05:03] off the bat i can see she needs to
[05:05] adjust her aim
[05:06] and know how to conduct herself ouch
[05:10] when she encounters human flesh so she's
[05:13] definitely
[05:13] a fighter especially when she's in a
[05:16] playful mood like this
[05:17] we're going to address biting for sure
[05:18] at some point over these next few weeks
[05:20] i'm also told that she has issues with
[05:23] separation anxiety she gets pretty
[05:24] anxious when left alone
[05:26] and she's not used to being in a crate
[05:28] so she sleeps with her parents
[05:30] and if she doesn't get to do that then
[05:32] she tends to
[05:33] be very upset by that so we're going to
[05:35] work on getting her comfortable with
[05:36] being alone over these next few weeks as
[05:38] well
[05:39] look at that that's a nice little tug oh
[05:42] man
[05:42] go get it let's see how her fetch is
[05:44] doing does she know how to bring it back
[05:47] i'll take it i think it was an accident
[05:49] but let's see if we can
[05:50] good get it good job
[05:54] so you know i mean my instinct
[05:55] immediately takes me to fetch with just
[05:57] about any dog
[05:58] because i guess my hypothesis is the
[06:00] faster i can get her
[06:02] playing with me the more likely it is i
[06:03] can have a really good bond with her
[06:06] and get her wanting to listen to me what
[06:07] a good girl you are you are so perfect
[06:10] let's see does she know let go or drop
[06:12] it let go
[06:13] drop it okay she doesn't appear to know
[06:16] what those mean yet
[06:17] what i'm gonna do to teach her to drop
[06:18] this toy so i'm just gonna make it kind
[06:20] of boring
[06:21] just hold it still and watch my hands
[06:26] let go get it i'm gonna immediately give
[06:29] it back to her
[06:30] right as she drops it do you know where
[06:31] it is
[06:33] look at that guys
[06:36] come on yeah good girl do you see that
[06:40] it looks like she really thought that
[06:41] one out she used her brain
[06:43] to go look for that toy that she was
[06:44] into let's work on drop it again or let
[06:46] go
[06:47] whatever you want to call it make it
[06:48] boring let go
[06:51] notice how i'm saying yes the moment she
[06:53] does anything i like i'm using a 10 foot
[06:55] leash by the way
[06:56] we have a pretty big area down here so
[06:58] it doesn't make sense to just let her
[06:59] off leash and go wherever she wants
[07:01] especially since she's in a new place
[07:02] she's not fully potty trained yet these
[07:04] are all things we have to work on
[07:06] so if you're trying to learn how to
[07:07] train your new dog you have come to the
[07:09] right place
[07:10] i am noticing a lot of biting ouch ouch
[07:14] ouch that's not working too well but
[07:17] every time she bites me i'm gonna really
[07:18] focus on redirecting her
[07:20] uh onto something that is acceptable you
[07:22] can
[07:24] good yes let go yes
[07:28] you know the temptation here when you
[07:29] have a puppy is to try to teach
[07:31] everything at the same time but you
[07:33] really have to pick your battles
[07:34] so i'm not gonna focus too much on the
[07:36] biting right now as much as i am gonna
[07:39] focus on really redirecting her onto the
[07:41] toy
[07:42] and keeping the mood of the play session
[07:44] upbeat and positive because that really
[07:46] is my goal
[07:49] yes good let go try not to get too
[07:53] caught up in specific orders of things
[07:55] to teach and really focus on what your
[07:57] dog is telling you and what needs
[07:58] attention
[07:59] and so on as you train a dog as you're
[08:00] going to see in this series we don't
[08:02] just resolve biting in one day or
[08:04] jumping
[08:05] we don't just teach fetch in one day so
[08:07] it looks like she's
[08:08] looking outside let's go give her
[08:09] another potty break right here
[08:11] for this next 24 hours i'm going to be
[08:13] really focused on showing her
[08:15] the right places to go potty i'm told
[08:17] she still needs
[08:18] some improvement on potty training the
[08:20] thing with potty training is
[08:21] take your dog out very very often give
[08:24] them lots of opportunities
[08:26] right now we've got some people taking a
[08:27] walk up here on the levee
[08:29] let her check that out so there's going
[08:31] to be a lot of this i mean just letting
[08:33] a new puppy
[08:34] check out the world is very important i
[08:36] didn't see her pee that time but that's
[08:38] okay i mean
[08:38] you don't want to think that your dog
[08:40] has to go pee or poop every single time
[08:43] you let them outside much better to let
[08:44] them out very often so for her i'm going
[08:46] to be letting her out
[08:47] every 20 to 30 minutes especially on
[08:49] this first day just to get her super
[08:51] comfortable with going in the correct
[08:53] place
[08:53] which in this case is outside you're
[08:55] doing a great job so far
[08:56] so maybe i'll give her a tour of the
[08:58] downstairs here we've done a pretty good
[09:00] job puppy proofing but
[09:01] obviously puppies are going to like
[09:03] shoes
[09:04] don't we all i'll try and keep those
[09:08] out of the way and put those up later
[09:09] even though i'm very good about
[09:11] controlling the environment of a new dog
[09:13] it's still important
[09:14] to puppy proof your home if you're an
[09:16] inexperienced person with dogs
[09:18] especially
[09:19] you'll want to go out of your way to
[09:21] really puppy-proof the house and make
[09:23] sure that they can't destroy things that
[09:24] could potentially be harmful to them or
[09:26] just harmful to your property so for
[09:28] example we have a trash can ours
[09:30] tends to tuck away which is nice but if
[09:32] yours didn't do this you would make sure
[09:34] that
[09:34] your dog didn't have free access to the
[09:36] garbage can that can
[09:37] be something that really is tempting for
[09:39] a dog be mindful things like
[09:41] electrical cords i see i've got some
[09:42] tissues here i should probably move
[09:44] those
[09:45] things like electrical cords can be very
[09:46] desirable to dogs
[09:48] i don't think she'll have access to that
[09:49] because she's going to be on leash
[09:51] and i mean it's really helpful to
[09:55] view the house from your dog's
[09:57] perspective
[09:58] they're down here what can they get into
[10:00] i see some cords over there that i might
[10:03] need to tuck away
[10:04] for example you guys might think i'm
[10:05] joking but i'm totally serious i mean
[10:07] you cannot and should not underestimate
[10:09] the intelligence and curiosity
[10:12] of a new dog or any dog for that matter
[10:15] never trust a puppy zach george
[10:18] let her check out the kitchen see what
[10:21] it's like no doubt she's smelling our
[10:23] other two dogs you might have noticed
[10:25] both indie and inertia have been put
[10:27] up right now we really want to give kona
[10:29] time to check out the place on her own
[10:32] without being distracted by dogs it's
[10:34] one of our offices over here
[10:37] we do have some of these gates placed
[10:39] throughout the house to really limit
[10:40] where she can and can't go if we do
[10:42] decide to let her off leash
[10:44] or let her run around so we have we're
[10:46] gonna have a gate here
[10:48] then i'm gonna have a gate here to put
[10:52] on the stairs so she doesn't go upstairs
[10:54] when you've got a new dog
[10:55] controlling where your dog can and can't
[10:58] go is
[10:58] everything because they're smart they're
[11:01] curious they have no idea what can harm
[11:03] them and what can't
[11:04] if you want to protect your property and
[11:05] keep things from getting destroyed and
[11:07] minimize
[11:08] potty accidents and really just
[11:09] accelerate your progress
[11:11] controlling the environment is key and
[11:13] that's a huge part of training a dog
[11:15] that even the most inexperienced trainer
[11:17] can do great with
[11:18] some of you might recognize this setup
[11:20] from our
[11:21] inertia series the dog training
[11:23] experience this is how i intend to
[11:25] keep her contained when i'm not tending
[11:27] to her when she needs to take her naps
[11:29] overnight and so forth
[11:30] i love this combination of having a
[11:32] crate and an exercise pen especially
[11:34] since
[11:35] she's not really crate trained she
[11:36] doesn't love being in a crate while
[11:38] alone
[11:38] this will give kona a lot more area to
[11:40] play with so it's not quite as daunting
[11:43] to her
[11:43] so that's actually my next order of
[11:45] business to see if i can get her
[11:46] comfortable
[11:47] going in and out of the crate i don't
[11:49] know if she already has like a negative
[11:50] association with it
[11:51] or what so that's what i'm curious to
[11:54] find out
[11:55] kona hey girl good
[11:58] i love how she came to me i said kona
[12:00] hey girl and i
[12:02] think she detected i had a treat with a
[12:04] young dog especially i want to go out of
[12:06] my way
[12:07] to pair desired behavior coming to me in
[12:10] this case
[12:11] with something that she really likes a
[12:13] bark box treat
[12:15] there we go good job i'm actually going
[12:17] to take off her
[12:18] leash for a second here what happens if
[12:21] i throw that in did she just go right in
[12:23] or she like
[12:24] okay good sign
[12:30] a little hesitant to go in remember
[12:32] she's not crate trained
[12:33] at all so try that there we go
[12:36] yes very good let's try something else
[12:39] here
[12:44] so getting her comfortable with the
[12:45] whole area
[12:47] not bad kona come here
[12:50] notice i haven't even closed the door
[12:51] come on i don't want her to feel like
[12:53] haha i trapped you
[12:55] i'm now closing the door and locking you
[12:57] in there forever
[13:00] want her to know that it's okay to go in
[13:02] there
[13:04] good job kona come
[13:08] yes good girl you're doing
[13:12] great yes it looks like she's starting
[13:15] to
[13:16] make the connection come
[13:20] yes really responsive to come right
[13:22] there i know her dad's been working with
[13:24] her a little bit on that so that's
[13:26] really good
[13:28] so here i'm gonna do this let her
[13:31] discover that it's closed for a minute
[13:40] kona
[13:46] okay good and i'm just going to let her
[13:48] out i just want to be
[13:50] really delicate because it can be a
[13:51] fragile thing when you're introducing a
[13:53] crate
[13:54] obviously i'm not going to get her fully
[13:55] comfortable with going in and out of
[13:56] crate and
[13:58] the first day necessarily but i want to
[14:00] give her
[14:01] as much of a good association with it as
[14:03] possible ideally
[14:05] the thing to avoid is just putting them
[14:06] in there and closing the door
[14:09] and seeing how they do i mean almost all
[14:11] dogs are
[14:12] going to not take that very well so
[14:14] anything you can get your dog doing
[14:16] voluntarily
[14:17] is much more likely to be successful it
[14:19] is so worth it to go out of your way to
[14:21] create this positive association with
[14:23] the crate
[14:24] and getting them comfortable with their
[14:26] area you don't just have to use treats
[14:27] either
[14:28] and remember any puppy-proofed area will
[14:30] do if a crate isn't realistic for your
[14:32] situation you might have like a laundry
[14:34] room or something that you've
[14:35] puppy-proofed or a spare bedroom or
[14:37] something like that it's important to
[14:38] really go out of your way to keep them
[14:39] extra safe
[14:40] so i'm gonna go ahead and close up the
[14:42] crate here for a minute now that i've
[14:44] got some
[14:45] fun toys in there for her i'm gonna let
[14:48] her just check that out while being in a
[14:49] controlled environment
[14:51] she's doing really well here i mean she
[14:52] hasn't been here very long at all and
[14:53] she's
[14:54] adjusting quite well but you can see
[14:56] she's like wait a minute am i locked up
[14:59] you can see she's like a little thrown
[15:00] off right now she's like wait a minute
[15:02] we were just partying having fun now
[15:04] you're walking away leaving me in this
[15:05] contained area
[15:07] before an episode of separation anxiety
[15:09] erupts i'm gonna let her out
[15:11] oh boy i really don't want her rushing
[15:14] out
[15:14] so we'll have to work on teaching her
[15:16] how to stay when i open the crate
[15:19] another time for this first 24 hours
[15:21] especially i want to be sensitive to the
[15:24] fact that it's going to take her some
[15:25] time to adjust and be herself and it can
[15:27] really take a few days for just about
[15:29] any dog to
[15:30] become used to a new environment
[15:32] sometimes they're extra hyper sometimes
[15:34] they're extra tired i mean different
[15:35] dogs react differently
[15:37] kona loves playing with other dogs i
[15:39] also happen to have a
[15:41] young dog that loves to play with other
[15:43] dogs so i was thinking
[15:44] it might be a great idea don't chew the
[15:47] carpet
[15:47] to have those two play together maybe
[15:49] get some energy out that might also help
[15:52] her adjust
[15:52] i see that we're gonna have to deal with
[15:54] a chewing issue so chewing and biting go
[15:56] a little hand in hand though they are
[15:58] separate issues so you can see i mean
[16:01] look at those look at these teeth can
[16:02] you see them look at those puppy teeth
[16:04] oh they're sharp sharp oh my gosh
[16:08] would you call that a bark what is that
[16:10] i was actually gonna wait until
[16:11] tomorrow to do this i'm feeling pretty
[16:14] good i think we can do it now
[16:15] this should be interesting i think i'll
[16:17] have them play outside and meet outside
[16:19] at first just to
[16:20] investigate each other and have a good
[16:22] time this is going to be exciting i'm
[16:23] pretty excited about this
[16:24] hey good girl you want to meet a puppy
[16:29] there's a puppy out here look what's
[16:31] look
[16:33] see the puppy
[16:39] good girl yes
[16:43] you can see kona is like whoa i wasn't
[16:45] expecting that
[16:48] let them smell each other inertia is
[16:51] looking excited but little pile of
[16:53] erection on inertia's part
[16:54] she's like whoa i wasn't expecting to
[16:56] see a dog right when i came out of there
[16:57] but
[16:59] so far so good and i love kona's body
[17:02] language here
[17:07] she's it's normal to be a little nervous
[17:08] there nice shake off
[17:13] yep is that a puppy it's okay
[17:16] it's a it's a stay good it's okay
[17:20] give her space i don't want to get back
[17:22] into a corner there there we go
[17:24] you can see conan is thinking about
[17:25] playing and it's normal for a young dog
[17:28] to be a little
[17:28] standoffish when they meet a new dog
[17:31] inertia has pretty good social skills so
[17:33] i remember inertia was just like this
[17:35] when she was about this
[17:36] age so really normal stuff so a nurse is
[17:39] coming on a little strong there but i
[17:40] think
[17:41] they're going to adjust okay and this is
[17:43] normal this is why socialization is so
[17:45] important with
[17:46] other dogs to get them comfortable with
[17:48] one another you can see
[17:49] that kona looks really interested in
[17:51] inertia but she's also guarded and like
[17:53] i don't know that's a big dog
[17:55] you can see she's looking at her she's
[17:57] like trying to go up to her
[17:59] a little hesitant there we go that's
[18:02] good look at that so
[18:04] this this is a good example here she's
[18:06] starting to
[18:07] get adjusted she didn't get up and run
[18:08] away like she did before
[18:11] she's like you can smell me good girl
[18:13] inertia and that's really normal puppy
[18:15] behavior on kona's part
[18:16] lying on her back like that looks like
[18:18] she's slowly opening up
[18:21] kona that is you can see kona's
[18:23] initiating some play behavior
[18:25] not only lying on her back but trying to
[18:27] play grab her with her mouth
[18:29] notice that inertia's pilo erection on
[18:31] her shoulders has gone down as well
[18:33] she's less thrown off let's bring them
[18:35] inside and see how they do
[18:36] i've got inertia and the crate here
[18:38] because again inertia keeps coming on
[18:39] strong we'll let her out in a second but
[18:41] i'm looking at kona's body language and
[18:42] she's like thinking about playing
[18:44] so i'm hoping that they'll open up to
[18:47] each other
[18:48] this is why introducing your dog to
[18:50] other dogs is really important so that
[18:51] they can
[18:52] gain social skills with other dogs and
[18:54] behave appropriately
[18:56] good girl lie down inertia can you lie
[18:58] down
[18:59] kona come here kona
[19:03] come and that's okay remember she
[19:06] needs time to adjust here so where's the
[19:08] toy good yeah
[19:10] good girl letting kona watch over there
[19:13] seems pretty healthy let go come around
[19:16] maybe i'll get some of this energy out
[19:18] of inertia inertia did have a lot of
[19:20] exercise this morning as well looks like
[19:22] she's caught her second wind
[19:24] and it looks like the strategy of having
[19:26] inertia focus on a toy
[19:27] instead of solely on the puppy is
[19:29] putting her a little bit more
[19:30] at ease good see how she's trying to
[19:33] catch a sniff
[19:34] lie down okay
[19:37] go get it it's really important in these
[19:39] early stages to give your puppy a place
[19:41] to feel comfortable make sure that you
[19:43] have another dog under control if you're
[19:45] introducing to one of your existing dogs
[19:47] like this
[19:47] let go so that they don't get
[19:50] overwhelmed lie down
[19:51] lie down is really good it puts them
[19:53] lower to the ground a little less
[19:55] daunting to a new puppy
[19:56] you can see she's starting to pant
[19:58] pretty good inertia so
[20:00] that might mean that she's going to come
[20:02] on a little
[20:03] less strong and don't be in a hurry to
[20:05] introduce a new dog to your pets either
[20:08] i mean you might notice we're
[20:09] introducing these two but our cat is
[20:11] somewhere
[20:12] in this house maybe we'll introduce her
[20:13] later just notice how kona is really
[20:16] kind of
[20:16] infatuated over here really watching
[20:19] every move
[20:20] that inertia makes this is also another
[20:22] reason that when you do training with a
[20:24] new dog
[20:25] you'll want to have your other dog up so
[20:27] you'll notice that we'll be doing a lot
[20:28] of that inertia won't always be present
[20:30] when i'm doing training
[20:31] with kona because obviously that's a
[20:33] major distraction right there
[20:35] and you want to teach your dog how to
[20:36] listen to you without major distractions
[20:39] initially and so this skittishness again
[20:41] completely normal i like how she's
[20:42] coming to me over here
[20:43] makes her feel safe it looks like i'll
[20:45] compliment a nurse's social skills here
[20:47] like
[20:48] she's not really coming on so strong to
[20:50] uh kona anymore she seems to be
[20:52] sensitive to that
[20:53] but she definitely wants to run and be
[20:55] energetic inertia is trying
[20:57] so hard to get kona to chase her and
[20:59] play with her right now
[21:01] and kona wants to i think she's going to
[21:03] open up we're just going to give her
[21:04] time to do so
[21:05] but just because a dog acts like this
[21:07] doesn't mean oh no they don't like other
[21:08] dogs or they're scared of other dogs
[21:10] you do want to go out of your way to set
[21:12] up ideal
[21:14] interactions right there i love how
[21:17] inertia really saw that kona was
[21:19] retreating and respected that was like
[21:21] okay
[21:22] and kona i can tell she's getting close
[21:24] to her first nap of the day
[21:26] which is going to be really helpful so
[21:27] i'll show you what i do when she passes
[21:30] out if she does out here imagine from
[21:32] kona's perspective there's so much to
[21:34] take in she's just been dropped off here
[21:36] with these new people
[21:38] and this new dog and this really weird
[21:41] guy who's gonna try to teach her things
[21:43] but remember i mean dogs are learning at
[21:45] every minute and just as she observes
[21:47] inertia running around
[21:48] with this toy here she's definitely
[21:50] processing that
[21:52] it's clear by her focus over here she's
[21:54] very interested
[21:55] she's starting to get a little brave
[21:58] maybe they'll bond over the toy as a
[21:59] matter of fact let's see
[22:01] if you did have a dog that was
[22:03] protective of toys you would want to be
[22:04] careful about
[22:05] doing what we're doing here inertia
[22:07] hasn't shown any signs of resource
[22:09] guarding toys around other dogs
[22:11] check out how kona sniffs in nurse's
[22:13] face here i think that might mean she's
[22:15] becoming more comfortable
[22:16] that's good she got a nice face sniff in
[22:19] there
[22:21] good job
[22:24] okay there's a play ball did you catch
[22:25] that that's our first play ball from
[22:28] kona that i've seen
[22:29] it's so fun to watch these guys open up
[22:32] before each other and
[22:33] start to get more comfortable with one
[22:35] another i'm really proud of inertia too
[22:36] she's doing a reasonably good job
[22:38] at dialing it back when she detects that
[22:41] kona is like
[22:42] yeah it's a little too much you know i
[22:43] didn't know what to expect i didn't know
[22:45] if they were just going to burst into a
[22:46] play session
[22:47] or if they were going to be thrown off
[22:49] but this is all pretty normal and i
[22:51] think this is really good right now and
[22:53] remember today is just all about getting
[22:55] kona
[22:56] acclimated and comfortable in this new
[22:57] place and you can just read her like a
[22:59] book too
[23:00] she's so funny right now she's just like
[23:02] what on earth
[23:03] is happening and hey this is great look
[23:06] how kona is going into the area
[23:08] here voluntarily it's a little deformed
[23:10] right now because we want the dogs to be
[23:11] able to play out here so we move this
[23:13] back a little bit
[23:14] but notice the door is still open over
[23:16] here so kona is free to explore it
[23:18] and actually it's almost like she
[23:20] prefers to engage inertia
[23:22] through the barrier okay looks like we
[23:24] just had our first accident she came in
[23:27] the crate
[23:28] and just peed oh my goodness
[23:31] a 12 week old puppy like kona is going
[23:34] to sleep a lot throughout the day
[23:36] so i would like to get her comfortable
[23:37] sleeping in there i'm thinking if i give
[23:39] her a really good chew
[23:41] that i might be able to encourage her to
[23:43] just come down and take her afternoon
[23:46] nap
[23:47] in her area i'm gonna give her a half a
[23:48] shoe and we're gonna feed her
[23:51] let's see if she's comfortable in there
[23:55] so let's see if she can get her to just
[23:57] relax in there and engage that for a
[23:59] little while
[24:00] because i don't want her to feel too
[24:02] confined that's why i have this extra
[24:03] big area i found that it makes the crate
[24:06] introduction process a lot better
[24:08] if you have like a crate plus oh hey
[24:11] what's going on
[24:11] show you something that i want to get
[24:13] your reaction to okay
[24:15] are you ready yes these are kona's
[24:17] parents
[24:20] oh my goodness oh so they actually an
[24:23] irish setter and a poodle like a 50 50
[24:25] combo
[24:26] yeah nice that's so cute yeah that is
[24:29] cute
[24:29] i love it i'm gonna also give her her
[24:31] food here
[24:34] let her get comfortable in there oh boy
[24:36] she's ready to eat look at her
[24:38] this is another really wonderful way to
[24:40] get your dog comfortable
[24:42] with being in their area whether it be a
[24:44] crate or a place like this
[24:45] feed them in that area give them fun
[24:48] things to do give them
[24:49] toys that are unlikely to be destroyed
[24:51] while they're in there so
[24:52] super chewer toys are a great example
[24:54] maybe avoid things like plush toys which
[24:57] you know they might rip apart if you're
[24:59] not supervising them it all depends on
[25:01] the dog though
[25:01] my hope is since she's doing so well
[25:03] she's shown no signs of anxiety so far
[25:05] while being in here
[25:06] i'm gonna give her a cool toy to engage
[25:09] with
[25:10] let her finish up her uh her breakfast
[25:12] there
[25:14] maybe encourage her to go on her bed the
[25:16] experiment that we're currently doing
[25:18] here is we're going to see if she just
[25:19] checks out and dozes off here in a
[25:21] little bit
[25:22] part of my goal over these next few
[25:23] weeks is to get kona more comfortable
[25:25] with being alone and this is going to
[25:27] start by getting her to be alone in a
[25:29] place that she feels
[25:30] is her own so she's looking a little
[25:32] anxious here my hope was that she was
[25:34] going to eat
[25:35] and then be like all right i'll take a
[25:37] nap but that doesn't look like what
[25:39] we're getting here
[25:44] oh there it is okay all right so let me
[25:47] put inertia up so i can deal with kona
[25:49] so i see she's relatively calm but she's
[25:51] showing potential of having another
[25:52] eruption of anxiety i think i'm going to
[25:55] let her out right now come
[25:59] yeah look at that good girl
[26:03] i'm going to give her a break outside oh
[26:06] look
[26:07] that's really good that's what we want
[26:08] to see
[26:11] quiet inertia good girl i love how she
[26:14] went pee the moment we came out that's a
[26:15] really good sign that she's
[26:17] starting to equate outside with being
[26:19] the appropriate place to go potty
[26:21] oh look oh my gosh is this the best day
[26:24] ever or
[26:25] what i mean we're getting a number one
[26:28] and a number two
[26:30] inertia is kind of chilling over there
[26:32] taking a break in her crate
[26:33] and i noticed that kona is starting to
[26:36] doze off a little bit
[26:39] so i'm wondering if i should pick her up
[26:42] and go and put her
[26:44] in the crate while she's in this relaxed
[26:45] state so that she can
[26:47] have some experience of being alone in
[26:48] that crate let's see how it goes
[26:50] you know there's a lot of trial and
[26:52] error when you're treading a new dog
[26:53] sometimes
[26:55] that she went in it's nice
[27:00] for another bit of her chew
[27:03] i'm just gonna walk away be over here
[27:05] still be within sight but
[27:07] just kind of play it cool so it was good
[27:09] she kind of looked at me like what's
[27:10] going on
[27:11] and then took interest in her bark box
[27:14] chew over there
[27:14] so this way i'm not just putting her in
[27:16] there walking out of the door or going
[27:18] to bed
[27:19] you know i'm like really giving her some
[27:21] time to see that i'm here
[27:22] she'll see me over here she can enjoy
[27:24] her chew
[27:26] she's in her big oversized area there
[27:29] she's had lots of play time at this
[27:32] point some training lots of stimulation
[27:35] and with her being a 12 week old pup i
[27:37] know she is due for a nap
[27:39] right around now so if i can just get
[27:41] her sleeping in there even if i'm right
[27:43] out of here i think that's gonna make
[27:46] major
[27:46] progress towards getting her comfortable
[27:48] being alone so that when she is alone
[27:50] for a few hours at a time she's likely
[27:53] to be more content easier said than done
[27:55] i mean we'll see how it goes every dog
[27:57] is different
[27:58] and separation anxiety especially with
[28:00] that of a puppy
[28:02] can take a lot of strategizing and
[28:05] troubleshooting
[28:06] in general i should probably have her
[28:07] harness off there but since i'm
[28:09] supervising her i think i'm okay with it
[28:11] right now
[28:11] so now she's done with the chew she's
[28:14] out of food in there
[28:15] this is where i'm curious to see if
[28:17] she'll just relax see there's a look of
[28:19] concern
[28:19] i'm just trying to be nonchalant over
[28:21] here it's always fun to experiment with
[28:23] dog behavior to see how each dog
[28:24] responds
[28:25] this is where it can get a little bit
[28:27] messy when you're trying to train a dog
[28:28] because on one hand you know you don't
[28:30] want to just put them in there
[28:31] and tell them to just deal with it but
[28:34] on the other hand
[28:35] she's really kind of borderline right
[28:36] now where i think that she could
[28:38] potentially lie down and relax and take
[28:40] a nap so i'm just going to give it a
[28:42] second it is interesting as i got
[28:45] closer the vocalization subsided i
[28:47] wonder if i hang out maybe over
[28:49] here on this couch if she's likely to
[28:53] feel a little more content as though
[28:55] there's a person closer by so we'll see
[28:57] so far so good it's best to do things
[28:59] like this
[29:00] when you are in a position to monitor
[29:03] them to be
[29:04] present rather than just crossing your
[29:06] fingers and leaving and
[29:07] doing it all in one fell swoop she's
[29:09] chewing on a beef tendon shoe right now
[29:11] and that seems to be preoccupying her
[29:13] this has the benefit of number one
[29:15] giving her something
[29:16] she likes while also secondly being in
[29:20] this confined area that she ultimately
[29:22] will need to be comfortable in
[29:23] so the hope here is that she chews on
[29:25] this for a little while
[29:26] she kind of remembers that she's tired
[29:29] and she takes a nap
[29:30] wouldn't that be great this is good i
[29:32] mean this is already a victory right
[29:33] here
[29:34] maybe if i can increase the distance now
[29:36] and go back over there
[29:38] and see if she continues to remain
[29:40] content that might be an interesting
[29:41] test
[29:42] she doesn't seem to be too concerned
[29:44] about me
[29:52] relax quiet
[29:58] so during moments of quiet i'm gonna go
[30:00] ahead and give her a treat see how that
[30:02] works
[30:03] good girl quiet yes
[30:07] so if i can get her to be quiet and calm
[30:09] i'll probably let her out again
[30:11] just because maybe i'm throwing too much
[30:12] at her so i'm really just trying to
[30:15] feel this out we're all learning
[30:16] together i think that's what makes this
[30:18] particular series interesting not
[30:20] everything works for all dogs
[30:22] quiet you're doing great i do want to
[30:26] avoid
[30:26] letting her out while she's barking
[30:28] while she's in that anxious state
[30:34] good girl see that nice settle see i'm
[30:36] torn though like
[30:37] i think i'm gonna let her out because on
[30:39] one hand i could be like all right she's
[30:40] showing signs of settling down maybe i
[30:42] should leave her in there
[30:43] on the other hand if i go when i sit
[30:45] down and she starts barking again well
[30:47] now
[30:47] she's risen to that undesired state so
[30:50] we'll go back to letting her just relax
[30:52] while on the lead here so she was
[30:55] starting to doze off here
[30:56] and relax she's definitely looking more
[30:59] well adjusted right now
[31:00] keeping her near me she's doing really
[31:02] well you can see how she just looked at
[31:03] inertia over there and she's
[31:05] really chilling out starting to adjust a
[31:07] little bit
[31:08] she looks comfortable we're not hearing
[31:10] any whining we're not seeing any frantic
[31:12] behavior
[31:13] so we've been just letting kona chill
[31:16] interact with inertia their behavior
[31:18] together is doing really well outside of
[31:20] the crate i've just put her
[31:22] back in i want to see how she does she
[31:24] slept for a total of like
[31:25] less than 20 minutes and we've had her
[31:28] six and a half hours so far
[31:30] she was down here chilling with brie
[31:31] while she was working well i got some
[31:32] stuff done upstairs
[31:34] but she didn't really fall asleep so i
[31:36] would have expected her to be more tired
[31:38] by now especially being 12 weeks old
[31:40] i see what the issue is here like she's
[31:42] actually reasonably well behaved i think
[31:44] she's going to go back into a sit
[31:46] or down yep inertia i want you in your
[31:50] crate you are
[31:51] interfering let's go so i'm going to put
[31:54] inertia up in her crate
[31:55] go on i'll let you out of it can you
[31:57] settle that's
[31:58] very good so i still have to do a lot of
[32:02] training with inertia she's not used to
[32:04] this dynamic of me working with another
[32:05] puppy
[32:06] while she's here but notice kona's
[32:09] behavior right now
[32:10] she's really good like this would be
[32:11] great if she was like this all the time
[32:13] but i'm gonna like walk to the front
[32:14] door
[32:15] and see if she becomes increasingly
[32:17] alarmed i just want to test here to see
[32:19] if this
[32:20] is indeed what's going on like do i have
[32:21] to be in sight or is it even if i'm in
[32:23] sight i still need to be close
[32:26] right there that's pretty good i think
[32:28] i'm actually just going to you know give
[32:29] her a treat it can't hurt anything i'm
[32:30] not really training her how to do
[32:32] anything
[32:32] rather i'm just trying to chip away here
[32:34] it can't hurt to give her a little bit
[32:35] of a treat when she is behaving calmly
[32:37] i'm not saying that that in and of
[32:39] itself is going to train her
[32:40] to be good but you know it's just one
[32:42] little thing that
[32:44] might make the process a little bit
[32:45] nicer if i'm going to ignore her i'm
[32:48] going to wait for calmness i mean i'm
[32:49] right here so it's not even like i've
[32:51] left her alone
[32:52] there we go yes you see how she
[32:56] here she went back to her chew toy that
[32:59] would be great if she would chew on her
[33:01] chew toy
[33:03] she may be feeling too anxious now
[33:10] just ignoring that
[33:16] nice job relax
[33:19] what's called relax
[33:22] so you know if i do this a few hundred
[33:26] times if i really go over there and
[33:29] give her some reinforcement for
[33:31] naturally relaxing
[33:34] then i'm hopeful
[33:38] that she'll begin to initiate relaxing
[33:40] on her own more often
[33:45] i mean we're already seeing that at an
[33:46] increasing rate relax
[33:49] yes every time i say yes
[33:52] or close to every time that i say yes
[33:56] i'm gonna make sure that i give her
[33:59] something
[34:00] something good you know maybe it's a
[34:02] play maybe it's a treat something higher
[34:04] value than just good girl
[34:06] praise in and of itself isn't the best
[34:09] reinforcer for the majority of dogs
[34:11] in my experience
[34:14] relax and you can see the telltale
[34:18] signs of anxiety there the
[34:21] dramatic yawn the whining
[34:25] all of that the idea here isn't that she
[34:27] doesn't experience
[34:28] any anxiety that's imminent with
[34:31] virtually all puppies the idea is that
[34:33] we have our experience
[34:35] as little as reasonably possible
[34:39] relax yes
[34:50] relax yes i'm really
[34:53] upping the rate at which i reward or
[34:56] give her a treat here to encourage some
[34:59] stability
[35:00] in the relaxed position
[35:07] relax so it looks like prioritizing
[35:11] teaching
[35:12] kona how to settle is going to be extra
[35:15] important for her
[35:16] i'm trying to really get a jump on
[35:18] things for tonight because
[35:20] i'm gonna sleep down here with kona
[35:22] maybe i can teach her this concept of
[35:24] relax before it's time to go to bed
[35:28] not likely but never too soon to start
[35:30] right
[35:33] see those vocalizations indicate she's
[35:35] still anxious
[35:39] listening for that particular
[35:41] vocalization that's like
[35:43] okay i'll do it
[35:51] [Music]
[35:54] you can see we have significant anxiety
[35:56] i'm like 15 feet away
[35:58] from her and she's like i've got to be
[36:01] closer to you and i'm in sight and
[36:03] everything
[36:03] so good girl relax
[36:07] good so i'm going to let her do her
[36:09] thing i'm just going to ignore and if i
[36:11] catch her relaxing
[36:12] i'll continue to reinforce relax
[36:15] the good behavior that i like here see
[36:18] her thinking about
[36:19] dosing off i mean i gotta say i was
[36:22] doubting my abilities for a second
[36:26] i'm gonna put her to sleep with this
[36:29] relax good girl at first i was just
[36:32] using the treat just to try and
[36:34] let her know the sky wasn't falling but
[36:36] the treats
[36:37] kind of really kept her more engaged
[36:39] rather than encouraging her to
[36:41] chill so i mean that's the line you have
[36:44] to walk because
[36:45] sometimes you want to give them
[36:46] something that makes them feel better
[36:47] maybe that'll cause them
[36:48] to behave better and then other times
[36:51] simply ignoring the behavior
[36:52] is what works those are the nuances that
[36:54] go into training a dog
[36:56] okay so she did really well she was in
[36:58] there for about 20 minutes or so
[37:00] and now i'm letting her back out to let
[37:02] her know she's not banished
[37:03] in her secured area forever but you
[37:05] might hear behind me our yard guys have
[37:07] just showed up and that can always be
[37:09] interesting if a dog isn't familiar with
[37:10] lawn mowers
[37:11] and the way our house is positioned the
[37:14] lawn mowers and leaf blower
[37:15] are going to come very close to her so
[37:17] she will see them
[37:19] and they're loud this is a great
[37:20] socializing opportunity
[37:22] i'm gonna try to do some conditioning
[37:23] here i'm gonna grab some treats
[37:25] just to get her associating the lawn
[37:27] equipment with good stuff
[37:29] all right so here comes the lawn mower
[37:32] look at that and this is pretty ideal
[37:34] because she's comfortable
[37:36] inside and she's definitely noticing it
[37:39] here
[37:39] okay what's this do you want this
[37:42] this is just out of an abundance of
[37:44] caution once a dog becomes nervous of
[37:46] something it takes a little bit more
[37:48] effort
[37:48] to get them to not be nervous of that
[37:50] thing so if i can
[37:52] just immediately pair good treats with a
[37:54] loud motorized vehicle
[37:55] then the hope is that she'll act just
[37:58] like this
[38:00] good girl there we go
[38:04] so i think she did a really good job
[38:05] there she reacted well within the range
[38:07] of normal
[38:08] you're gonna see that we're gonna have a
[38:09] strong emphasis over these next few
[38:10] weeks on introducing her to new things
[38:13] and really heavily socializing her to
[38:15] the world around her
[38:16] don't underestimate the significance of
[38:18] just letting your dog experience the
[38:20] world especially when something
[38:22] abnormal like that happens kona is used
[38:24] to
[38:25] sleeping with her parents from home and
[38:28] it's easy to see why
[38:29] but i really think that in order to get
[38:31] the separation anxiety under control
[38:33] we've got to
[38:34] get her comfortable with spending time
[38:35] alone and what better opportunity to get
[38:37] her to spend around
[38:39] eight hours by herself than when she's
[38:41] sleeping it's a really good way
[38:43] to introduce this concept of being alone
[38:45] when they're most likely
[38:46] to relax if you are getting a puppy and
[38:49] you do want them to be as independent as
[38:51] possible i think it's really a good idea
[38:53] to get them spending those first few
[38:55] nights alone
[38:57] actually their first few months of
[38:58] sleeping alone with inertia i didn't
[39:00] even have her start sleeping in our bed
[39:02] until she was many months old
[39:03] because i wanted her to be comfortable
[39:06] with being alone for
[39:07] hours at a time sometimes and so far
[39:09] it's proven to be pretty effective i
[39:10] mean we did struggle with a little bit
[39:12] of separation anxiety but we've pretty
[39:14] much overcome that nonetheless the whole
[39:16] point is that i'm going to be sleeping
[39:17] down here so that i can easily tend to
[39:19] her
[39:20] and let her outside in the middle of the
[39:21] night just to make sure that everything
[39:23] goes as smoothly as possible
[39:25] hopefully you don't hear that much from
[39:27] me overnight but
[39:28] i'm going to document everything that
[39:30] occurs and show you how i handle it
[39:32] and maybe it'll be helpful to you we'll
[39:34] see now that the grass
[39:36] is freshly cut let's go give her another
[39:38] socialization experience
[39:40] plus it's time for a potty break anyway
[39:41] remember dogs smell
[39:43] in a way that we can't even fathom i
[39:45] mean they see the world through smell
[39:46] in a way that is so different than
[39:48] people there's a major sense of theirs
[39:50] so
[39:50] imagine all the smells that have been
[39:52] kicked up by the lawnmower
[39:54] out there if we can smell it you know
[39:56] they smell at times a thousand fresh cut
[39:58] grass
[39:58] smells great good girl
[40:02] that's the second or third time today
[40:04] where i've let her out and she's peed
[40:05] within seconds of letting her out
[40:08] go pee yes yes here you go
[40:11] good you want this good girl and you
[40:14] know with a young dog getting
[40:15] uncomfortable walking on grass like this
[40:17] is also beneficial you'd be surprised
[40:19] how many city dogs i see
[40:21] that are uncomfortable with walking on
[40:23] grass so getting them walking on
[40:25] different surfaces
[40:26] even is a great thing to do with a brand
[40:28] new dog we brought inertia out it's
[40:29] getting close to bedtime for kona so i
[40:32] want her to just have a really good play
[40:33] session out here or just a free play
[40:35] session which basically means just
[40:37] letting her do what she wants to do
[40:38] maybe that means playing maybe that
[40:39] means just
[40:40] doing nothing but just really good time
[40:42] for her to explore her world oh looks
[40:43] like we're getting a little bit of rain
[40:45] too
[40:45] so kona is slowly warming up to inertia
[40:48] which is really good i know we talked
[40:50] about this earlier but i want to stress
[40:51] that it's not always a good idea to
[40:53] introduce
[40:53] a new pet this quickly but you know
[40:55] inertia is really good with dogs
[40:57] so now that she's freshly exercised i'm
[41:00] going to go ahead and give her some
[41:01] treats to go in there for a little bit
[41:04] i think she's more likely to relax a
[41:05] little bit while in here so i'm gonna
[41:07] put her back in here just for a few
[41:08] minutes just to get her
[41:10] slowly acclimated to her crate and
[41:12] containment area
[41:13] i'm also going to feed her because it's
[41:15] time for dinner so she's been in there
[41:16] for a little while eating your dinner so
[41:18] far reacting really well i like that
[41:20] inertia is chilling out as well
[41:21] i'm just going to ignore her still
[41:23] nearby she definitely
[41:25] freaks out more when i leave the room
[41:28] but
[41:29] if i stay here she's probably a little
[41:30] more likely to behave more comfortably
[41:33] and ideally so
[41:34] this is how we're slowly easing her up
[41:36] to being alone and
[41:38] unattended we do have a light bed we're
[41:40] gonna put in there
[41:41] but since she peed on it before we're
[41:43] washing it right now this is really good
[41:45] so far i think we're already starting to
[41:46] make progress on this
[41:48] relax good girl
[41:54] and we'll ignore her and i'll bet she'll
[41:55] doze off so far
[41:57] so good kona is just checking out right
[42:00] now
[42:00] doing a real good job she's not sleeping
[42:02] but she's behaving very acceptably
[42:05] that's true she's been quiet i didn't
[42:07] even realize
[42:08] yeah yeah she's acting like a regular
[42:11] dog
[42:12] i'm gonna let her out another time or
[42:13] two before we go to bed officially and
[42:15] i'll take her harness off and everything
[42:16] it's the first night with kona and
[42:20] i am so glad that we did that training
[42:23] earlier
[42:24] in the day i'm also glad that we
[42:26] exercised her
[42:27] um because look at her look how good
[42:30] she's doing she's just chilling right
[42:32] now
[42:32] but i'm still gonna hang out down here
[42:34] with her i still have to put her bed in
[42:35] the crate i'm gonna take her out
[42:37] uh probably one more time but we're
[42:39] winding down for the night
[42:41] inertia is just so captivated by her
[42:44] but um yeah should be an interesting
[42:46] night we'll see how it goes
[42:48] taking kona out now i'm gonna go on her
[42:52] last potty break i've got inertia in our
[42:54] potty area over here
[42:55] so i'm pretty optimistic that we're
[42:58] gonna have a
[42:59] a good night tonight i think she's gonna
[43:01] do really well
[43:02] let me see if i can get her being
[43:04] playful come on
[43:06] no you were so playful earlier now you
[43:09] just don't want to move huh
[43:11] oh there it is sweet girl i know
[43:14] you miss your parents no that is
[43:17] tempting to let you sleep and cuddle
[43:18] tonight but
[43:20] we're on a mission to teach you how to
[43:22] be alone
[43:23] kona all right come on come on let's go
[43:28] good okay are you serious is
[43:31] that really happening i just took her
[43:33] out
[43:34] and it looks like we have a proper
[43:38] accident it happens it happens i'll be
[43:41] looking for it to become a pattern
[43:43] i mean this is part of potty training
[43:45] they don't always know where to go and
[43:47] where not to go
[43:48] we'll let her replace the water she just
[43:50] expended
[43:52] and i'm gonna go clean that mess up i've
[43:54] got kona in the other room right now
[43:57] and i thought you know it's probably a
[43:59] good idea to go ahead and put down
[44:02] a couple of pads here all right so i'm
[44:04] gonna go get conan now
[44:06] oh okay can we relax
[44:11] good girl i'm gonna try and let her out
[44:12] during moments of quiet
[44:15] good girl okay come on let's go all
[44:18] right so we've got her up for the night
[44:20] and so far so good on the bat she
[44:21] doesn't appear to be digging at them or
[44:23] anything
[44:25] see if she sees me put them down i felt
[44:27] like she'd be more likely to want to
[44:28] play with them
[44:29] and view them as a toy now they're just
[44:32] boring and stuck on the ground
[44:34] oh i forgot to put her bed in there
[44:35] that's right okay now she's all ready
[44:37] for bed i've taken her harness off
[44:39] i've got her bed ready her pads are
[44:41] ready
[44:42] and inertia is trying to say goodnight
[44:44] too i guess but keep in mind this is a
[44:46] brand new place to her
[44:48] so we want to be really understanding of
[44:50] that she's really starting to get the
[44:52] hang of it though look how much better
[44:53] that is
[44:54] than earlier even though she's a little
[44:57] anxious it's
[44:58] slowly getting better hopefully we'll
[45:00] stay on this current rate of progress
[45:02] so i went to go get ready for bed i
[45:04] noticed that kona had a bit of an
[45:05] outburst and now that i've returned
[45:08] she's doing better but when i came back
[45:10] in the room i was just like
[45:11] i'm not even paying attention to you i'm
[45:13] just not gonna look at you
[45:15] and after doing that for about 60
[45:18] seconds
[45:20] she did that and you can see the anxiety
[45:23] while present seems to be subsiding a
[45:25] little bit
[45:29] she's a really good girl it's 8 15
[45:33] and she's still a little antsy as you
[45:36] can see
[45:37] the puppy pads are still intact that's a
[45:39] good sign
[45:43] so she's whining a little bit there we
[45:46] go
[45:46] relax nice job girl
[45:52] i know it's hard for her goodnight kona
[45:54] we're off to a good start
[45:56] it looks like she's falling asleep now
[45:59] she's being calm like honestly i think
[46:02] there's a good chance she would be just
[46:03] fine if i wasn't down here
[46:05] at this point but i'm not sure of that
[46:07] so i need to get to know her a little
[46:09] bit better
[46:10] okay she's been sleeping solidly
[46:13] for an hour and i am dozing off so i
[46:15] just wanted to
[46:17] check in one more time and
[46:20] show you how she's doing she looks good
[46:22] to me
[46:25] she just whined a little bit and she's
[46:27] up and walking around
[46:29] now i'm gonna see if she settles back
[46:32] down
[46:33] and she does i think she may have just
[46:35] woken up and been like where am i
[46:37] now she seems recalibrated she's dying
[46:42] like
[46:44] 20 minutes resting and then
[46:47] a minute or two
[46:48] [Music]
[46:52] so i may let her out if she
[46:55] continues to do this pattern i'm gonna
[46:58] see how it goes i've decided i am gonna
[47:01] take her out one more time her
[47:03] rate of crying and whining is increasing
[47:05] a little bit
[47:06] i'm really trying to only let her out
[47:08] when she's behaving acceptably even if
[47:10] it's just for a short period of time
[47:13] oh look at that she's going pee how
[47:16] about that
[47:18] she did have to go after all
[47:22] nice long one good girl you have to go
[47:25] poop are you ready to go inside
[47:28] okay let's see how she does now
[47:33] exploring her crate a little bit
[47:37] oh interesting little sneaky dog there's
[47:40] a bowl up there there's no food in it
[47:43] i might go ahead and give her a little
[47:45] extra food
[47:46] i only said because she was really cool
[47:48] about
[47:49] chilling and now she seems a little more
[47:52] animated
[47:53] i just gave her some food and boy
[47:56] she does scarf it down maybe she's not
[47:59] feeling
[48:00] anxious at all maybe she's just a little
[48:02] extra hungry
[48:04] so interesting getting to know each doll
[48:06] i'm way too interested in this
[48:09] looks like she's settled down again so
[48:12] at this point if she cries again i'm
[48:14] probably just gonna let her cry
[48:16] because i've let her out multiple times
[48:18] i've given her food we've given her
[48:20] water and
[48:20] you know what worst case if she has an
[48:23] accident
[48:23] it's easy to clean up so i reserve the
[48:26] right to change my mind but that's what
[48:27] i'm thinking as of right now
[48:29] so it looks like she did go potty over
[48:32] here
[48:33] so i'm going to clean that up right now
[48:35] because that stinks
[48:36] she's having a little bit of a tough
[48:38] time tonight so far that's okay
[48:40] i thought i'd give her a little bit of
[48:41] infection you know
[48:44] she's uh no doubt missing her mom and
[48:47] dad
[48:50] she's being super sweet ready to go back
[48:53] to bed
[48:55] okay she is sleeping now
[48:58] going back to sleep i think that
[49:00] actually helped to uh
[49:01] give her a little bit of love i don't
[49:03] know everything's gonna be okay
[49:04] good girl kona relax good morning
[49:08] really how'd it go
[49:13] it was kind of rough she woke up all the
[49:15] time yeah i heard you
[49:18] hello hello

[00:00] this is kona's third day with me and
[00:01] it's time to attempt some actual
[00:03] training at least i hope so
[00:06] i'm zach george i'm a dog trainer meet
[00:08] my new project kona i've got just three
[00:11] weeks to train her and set her up for
[00:12] the most well-behaved life possible that
[00:14] means i need to work on the most common
[00:16] puppy issues like potty training how to
[00:18] actually pay attention stopping things
[00:20] like play biting chewing separation
[00:22] anxiety getting along with other animals
[00:24] leash walking and teaching her
[00:26] everything a good dog needs to know real
[00:28] dog training doesn't always go smoothly
[00:30] and that's why i'm going to show you
[00:31] every success and mistake and how i work
[00:34] through all the most challenging parts
[00:36] of raising a new puppy welcome to your
[00:38] new puppy survival guide
[00:42] guys it has been three days now that
[00:44] we've had kona and i think she's finally
[00:46] really adjusting i mean i think it's
[00:48] fair to give a dog a few days to adjust
[00:50] i think it's about time that we get
[00:51] started on kona's obedience training
[00:53] today we're going to go over some of the
[00:54] most fundamental things that every
[00:56] person and every puppy should know
[00:58] puppies are growing so fast and a lot of
[01:00] you might not realize this but puppies
[01:02] need a very specific type of puppy food
[01:05] needless to say this is not the time to
[01:07] experiment with homemade diets at all
[01:09] that said you still want to give your
[01:11] puppy premium ingredients in their food
[01:13] the nutritional science behind this
[01:16] solid gold dog food
[01:17] is extremely impressive anytime you're
[01:19] looking at a food look at the
[01:20] ingredients they list them from most
[01:22] abundant to least abundant so the first
[01:24] three ingredients on this one are bison
[01:26] ocean fish and brown rice
[01:29] okay
[01:30] let's see what kona thinks of this
[01:34] i promise we've been feeding her okay
[01:37] kona definitely loves solid gold food
[01:39] and solid gold has a whole line of
[01:40] high-end foods and supplements for your
[01:42] dog like bone broth and these c-meal
[01:44] supplements are great for their coat and
[01:46] their overall health save 30 on select
[01:48] solid gold products by going to my
[01:50] special link
[01:52] solidgoldpet.com that link will be in
[01:54] the description kona has had three days
[01:57] with us by design i've just been really
[02:00] letting the focus of our efforts be on
[02:02] getting her to adjust getting or
[02:03] comfortable with inertia and indie and
[02:05] this new environment and me and bri but
[02:07] i think it's about time since i only
[02:09] have three weeks with her to really get
[02:11] started on some of her core obedience
[02:14] that every dog really needs to know i
[02:16] mean if you think about it one of the
[02:17] fundamental things that our dogs have to
[02:19] know are the difference between yes and
[02:21] no or this is okay and that's not okay
[02:25] now i do want to say before we get into
[02:26] that particular part of the lesson that
[02:28] you'll find that you'll get much better
[02:30] results and training will be much more
[02:32] enjoyable if you let the emphasis of
[02:34] your training be on yes
[02:36] i think one of the best ways for a dog
[02:39] to learn the difference between yes and
[02:41] no is by teaching them how to leave
[02:42] something alone but by the end of this
[02:44] lesson kona will know how to leave a
[02:46] real piece of chicken alone when we drop
[02:48] it in front of her
[02:50] leave it alone let's make sure she
[02:53] doesn't know that so you know that she's
[02:54] learning this for the first time
[02:56] leave it
[02:58] so we clearly have some work to do i'm
[03:00] going to start this training by just
[03:02] using a dog treat to make it a little
[03:03] bit easier for her and we're going to
[03:05] work up to that you'll find that it's a
[03:06] really powerful thing when you can get
[03:08] your dog to do something organically
[03:10] from the inside out
[03:12] ouch
[03:16] look at that look how hard she's biting
[03:17] you see those little pin pricks that
[03:19] hurts
[03:20] i'm letting her know the treat is there
[03:21] and i'm gonna close my hand now the
[03:23] second she turns her head away i'm gonna
[03:25] go ahead and give her the treat to let
[03:26] her know i like that even if it's by
[03:27] accident so here's the treat
[03:32] yes
[03:34] good every time i say the word yes i
[03:36] really want to provide a positive
[03:38] outcome see that when she goes for it i
[03:40] close my hand because she doesn't have
[03:42] permission to get that yes
[03:44] good
[03:45] i'm gonna run through this a few times
[03:46] until i feel like she's getting it
[03:50] yes
[03:51] very good i mean you can see her
[03:53] brainstorming she's like maybe when i
[03:55] don't try he'll give it to me so she's a
[03:57] real smart girl you can see how she's
[03:58] really starting to pick this up quickly
[04:01] so now look at this
[04:03] let me i'm not even going to close my
[04:05] hand this time
[04:16] yes
[04:17] good
[04:18] really good job there you can see the
[04:20] wheels are turning she's demonstrating
[04:22] that she's understanding the concept
[04:24] right
[04:26] yes
[04:27] very good
[04:28] so now let me put a little closer
[04:31] yes
[04:36] no so you'll see i'll gently say no when
[04:39] she goes for
[04:40] no no should never come from a place of
[04:42] frustration when you're training your
[04:44] dog yes
[04:46] good
[04:47] now i think we can start introducing the
[04:49] basic word to her of leave it she's not
[04:51] necessarily going to absorb what the
[04:52] term leave it means in one lesson but
[04:54] you got to start somewhere so leave it
[04:58] yes
[05:02] leave it
[05:03] yes
[05:05] leave it i'm just using some soft dog
[05:07] treats today and i'm breaking them up
[05:09] into little pieces so i can get lots of
[05:11] extra use out of them
[05:15] leave it
[05:19] yes
[05:22] good
[05:23] all right so so far pretty good right
[05:25] now let's make this a little bit more
[05:27] challenging for her let's see if we can
[05:29] give it motion you might know that
[05:31] things that move
[05:32] really get our dog's attention a lot
[05:34] more
[05:35] so
[05:36] as demonstrated by the by the toy the
[05:38] same is true with a treat notice even if
[05:40] i say leave it
[05:42] and i drop it she's almost certainly
[05:44] going to go for it because we changed a
[05:46] variable there did you see that we made
[05:48] it move we're not just holding it that's
[05:49] harder for a dog to lay off something
[05:51] that's moving i'm going to have it move
[05:53] a little bit less this time
[05:55] and when she goes forward i'm going to
[05:56] cover it up we haven't had to say no too
[05:58] much here and that's how it should be
[06:00] you want the emphasis of your training
[06:01] to be on the word yes on what your dog
[06:03] is doing right this isn't a magic trick
[06:05] about teaching your dog how to leave a
[06:07] treat alone this is showing them the
[06:09] basics of impulse control so the treat
[06:11] is just a metaphor for the squirrel for
[06:14] the dog for other things that cause them
[06:16] to get excited in the future you know
[06:18] teaching them how to leave something
[06:19] alone that they want to go after is a
[06:22] really basic concept that every dog
[06:24] needs to understand yes good so a lot
[06:27] more restraint that time did you see
[06:28] that yeah you can see her getting it
[06:30] right when you look at her body language
[06:32] and her eyes you can see she's really
[06:33] trying to process it it's a beautiful
[06:35] thing to watch a dog learn something new
[06:37] like this
[06:38] leave it
[06:39] yes
[06:40] good girl
[06:42] leave it
[06:44] see it's hard it's like why would i
[06:45] leave that alone it's right there
[06:48] this is a really fundamental thing when
[06:51] it comes to establishing communication
[06:55] now i'm adding time i'm asking her to
[06:56] leave it alone for a period of time here
[06:59] yes
[07:00] leave it alone let's go ahead and up the
[07:02] annie a little bit let's see if we can
[07:03] make this a little bit more challenging
[07:04] for her just so that she really gets it
[07:07] i've got a piece of chicken breast that
[07:09] i use for training right here so since
[07:11] this is dramatically better tasting to
[07:13] her i'm going to start from square one
[07:14] again so changing a variable this time
[07:17] leave it
[07:18] yes
[07:18] this is probably her first time i would
[07:21] guess of ever having real chicken as
[07:22] well so she's gonna like this yes
[07:27] leave it
[07:28] yes look how quick she's learning i mean
[07:30] we've been doing this minutes
[07:32] leave it
[07:38] i can't emphasize how important this is
[07:41] for your long-term training so take your
[07:43] time on this one leave it
[07:46] good girl yes
[07:48] so i'm gonna go ahead and give her a
[07:49] treat from over here i think it's a
[07:51] little bit more clear if you give them
[07:53] the treat than if they get reinforced
[07:54] from picking up the stuff you don't want
[07:56] off the ground i told you by the end of
[07:58] this lesson you can teach any dog to
[08:00] leave something alone without force and
[08:02] i really do mean every dog in this case
[08:05] i mean i remember in some cases when i
[08:07] would teach classes and i would do this
[08:09] it could take up to seven eight
[08:10] sometimes ten minutes maybe with some
[08:12] really tough dogs but i mean what's 10
[08:14] minutes most dogs learn this within just
[08:16] a minute or two so it's a really
[08:18] exciting thing to teach a dog now i want
[08:20] to emphasize don't get too excited or
[08:23] too cocky here just because your dog
[08:24] will leave a piece of meat alone when
[08:26] you drop it in front of them does not
[08:27] mean they have generalized leave some
[08:29] garbage alone on a walk or leave my
[08:31] dinner alone when i set it on the table
[08:33] so it still takes a lot of training in
[08:36] those specific contexts to really teach
[08:38] a dog how to understand this concept but
[08:40] this is where you start leave it alone
[08:43] yes
[08:44] and for those of you with a new dog get
[08:46] both of my books they're really going to
[08:48] be a great reference guide and they go
[08:50] along with my youtube videos really well
[08:52] i'll have a link in the description
[08:54] potty training with kona has been going
[08:57] pretty well i do have to admit she's had
[08:59] a couple of accidents so far and both of
[09:02] those are absolutely my fault for
[09:04] letting her run around this immediate
[09:05] area while i was checking an email or
[09:07] something so i'm gonna get better with
[09:08] that just being honest with you i
[09:10] thought something that might help would
[09:12] be to have these whiz smart pads by the
[09:14] door so that she's like really
[09:16] conditioned to at least start going
[09:17] towards an exit when she feels the need
[09:19] to go on her first night these pads came
[09:22] in really handy she actually pooped on
[09:24] one which was great if you live in a
[09:26] high-rise building where it's difficult
[09:27] to go outside or if you just want your
[09:29] dog to be able to use a pad when you
[09:30] travel or when the weather's bad it just
[09:33] gives you options one of my favorite
[09:34] features you see that those stay put
[09:36] tabs one of the reasons that they're so
[09:38] absorbent is because they're made from
[09:40] recycled baby diapers
[09:43] unused baby diapers i'll have a link in
[09:45] the description wizsmart.com zach and
[09:48] you can use code zac 10 to get 10 off
[09:50] and get free shipping too so now we're
[09:52] going to teach kona how to look at me
[09:55] when i ask look at me is really
[09:57] important because it's really your dog
[09:59] just demonstrating that they're paying
[10:00] attention to you so if you can't get
[10:02] your dog's eyes on you in a certain
[10:04] situation that means you don't really
[10:05] have their attention we can start off a
[10:07] couple of ways so i could do something
[10:09] like
[10:10] yes
[10:11] once i had eye contact there i said yes
[10:13] so
[10:17] do you have any eyes in there
[10:19] yes
[10:20] so i really want her looking to my eyes
[10:22] because i'm going to be able to more
[10:24] easily communicate with her when she's
[10:26] looking at my face
[10:27] and i'll be able to read her better as
[10:29] well so it's a really good thing to
[10:31] teach now if your dog is less responsive
[10:33] another thing you can do is just hold up
[10:34] a treat to your eyes
[10:36] see that yes
[10:40] look at me yes
[10:42] i skipped the head a little bit there
[10:44] but i i could just kind of feel she was
[10:45] gonna do it because i like to phase in
[10:48] hold up a treat
[10:50] to
[10:52] look at me
[10:53] yes to that hand signal once you get
[10:55] them looking at a treat you can really
[10:57] easily face in the hand signal pointing
[10:58] to your eyes look at me do you notice
[11:00] i'm on the ground too it's really a lot
[11:03] easier to communicate
[11:04] with a dog especially a new dog when
[11:06] you're close to them look at the
[11:08] distance between our eyes it's you know
[11:10] just a little over a foot right now here
[11:13] look at me
[11:14] yes
[11:16] look at me
[11:18] yes
[11:19] so she's really coming to appreciate
[11:21] that word yes
[11:23] yes
[11:26] and as before when you're teaching the
[11:28] term look at me it's going to take a a
[11:30] few training sessions for her to really
[11:32] grasp that concept but do be very
[11:34] deliberate when you use the term in
[11:36] other words which you really have a
[11:37] committed look at me before saying it
[11:40] just so she can really start to
[11:42] internalize what that request means look
[11:44] at me using a high-pitched voice like
[11:46] that can be helpful yes nice long look
[11:49] at me there duration matters if you can
[11:51] start getting increased focus and
[11:53] duration like that that's always a good
[11:54] thing i'm using really small pieces of
[11:56] chicken by the way really got her
[11:58] attention
[11:59] look at me
[12:03] look at me
[12:05] yes i got two look at me i said yes
[12:08] after the second one
[12:09] i'm following that up with a reward so
[12:11] this is the beginning of throwing in
[12:13] some random reinforcement here and there
[12:16] so sometimes you know cheating and
[12:17] stealing a look at me and getting two
[12:19] for the price of one is always nice when
[12:20] they're young so we've gone over leave
[12:22] it we've gone over look at me
[12:24] now one of my absolute favorite things
[12:27] to teach any dog it's the first thing
[12:29] that you really teach your dog that just
[12:30] feels magical we're gonna combine leave
[12:33] it and look at me i call this the leave
[12:35] it look at me combo
[12:37] i know very original title isn't it
[12:40] we're gonna distract her and then we're
[12:41] gonna say
[12:42] look at me
[12:45] yes good girl not only did she leave it
[12:48] but i was able to get her attention on
[12:50] my eyes leave it
[12:53] look at me
[12:55] look at that guys
[12:56] see that
[12:58] yes
[13:00] so there's something she really wants
[13:02] just to make it clear she's aware that
[13:03] it's there
[13:04] look at me yes
[13:06] there's something that she really wants
[13:08] real chicken and i'm able to get her
[13:10] eyes off of the thing she wants a 12
[13:13] week old puppy and onto my eyes
[13:16] look at me
[13:18] yes
[13:22] she might just be a genius she's
[13:24] learning that what pays
[13:26] is to pay attention to me and not the
[13:28] chicken fundamental exercise right here
[13:31] easy to teach this is the kind of thing
[13:33] that when you teach your dog this you
[13:34] really start to get traction on your
[13:36] communication leave it
[13:38] oops
[13:40] shoot
[13:41] oh boy okay
[13:43] leave it
[13:46] good girl
[13:47] look at me
[13:50] yes
[13:51] once we have this we can really build on
[13:53] top of it she's really off to a good
[13:55] start so i'm excited so her stamina is
[13:58] doing pretty good i'm not seeing many
[13:59] signs of frustration out of her at all
[14:01] right now i think we can keep going with
[14:03] this that's another benefit to positive
[14:05] reinforcement training if you're really
[14:06] patient and you go at your dog's pace
[14:09] you'll find that their attention span
[14:10] should
[14:11] go a pretty long time the next thing i
[14:13] want to cover with you is something we
[14:15] call lure training lord training is
[14:17] where you coax your dog into a specific
[14:20] physical position by getting them to
[14:22] follow a treat with their nose so we can
[14:25] actually teach a lot with lore training
[14:28] for example right now i'm hoping to go
[14:29] over with kona sit lie down
[14:32] up maybe stand and maybe even a trick or
[14:35] two i don't know let's see what we can
[14:36] do make sure you're using a treat your
[14:38] dog likes i guess we'll stick with the
[14:40] chicken here
[14:41] kona
[14:42] i'm gonna make it difficult for her to
[14:44] get the whole thing and i'm comfortable
[14:45] with her nibbling i mean she does have
[14:47] sharp teeth but let's see if we can lure
[14:49] her into a sit
[14:50] yes
[14:52] the second her butt hit the ground i
[14:54] said yes all right if you're comfortable
[14:56] with them nibbling like that that's the
[14:58] way to do it down yes
[15:00] good girl in other words what a lot of
[15:02] people will do is they'll keep it a few
[15:04] inches from their dog's nose and that
[15:06] that can work as you saw there but if
[15:08] you're really having trouble you want
[15:10] them you want to keep it glued to their
[15:11] nose and go real slow
[15:14] sit
[15:15] good i'm releasing a little bit as she
[15:16] hits the desired position down it'll
[15:19] release the rest of it there up
[15:22] down i mean you can see how simple it is
[15:25] how willing a dog is to follow down good
[15:28] girl
[15:29] you can call it up or you can call it
[15:31] sit in this case sometimes i'll call it
[15:33] up because it is a different motion than
[15:35] sitting from this position
[15:40] sit
[15:41] yes good girl i really should just focus
[15:43] on yes right here
[15:45] yes
[15:49] yes now let's see if we can get her to
[15:50] go and do a stand on all fours
[15:53] yes
[15:54] nice
[15:56] so sit
[15:58] down
[16:00] up
[16:02] stand
[16:04] pretty amazing yes
[16:06] there's a whole art to luring i mean you
[16:08] can get real notice how my wrist is
[16:10] twisting and turning trying to find that
[16:12] sweet spot for a particular trick can be
[16:14] a lot of fun i like that it's kind of a
[16:16] precursor to a bow right there so i'm
[16:18] choosing to reward her for following the
[16:20] lure i'm trying to get those
[16:22] feet to go back into that bow yes good
[16:26] and i'm saying yes and pulling the treat
[16:28] away before she has a chance to go into
[16:30] a down here yes because that's going to
[16:32] be the tendency if i just keep it there
[16:34] she's going to plop into a down
[16:40] like that and see that's where i've
[16:41] gotta make sure i really focus on the
[16:44] timing of the treat
[16:46] yes
[16:47] good in other words i'm happy to have
[16:48] her hit a quarter of a second bow as
[16:51] your dog begins to understand the
[16:52] concept you'll start phasing out the
[16:54] lure you might do something like that
[16:56] sit so you can see how the lore
[16:58] gradually evolves into a hand signal
[17:00] eventually you'll just be able to say
[17:01] sit down up stand it's important to kind
[17:04] of teach your dog both hand signals and
[17:07] actual words they both come in handy in
[17:09] different scenarios and so you might
[17:10] notice too since she's doing so well
[17:12] with this sometimes i'm rewarding after
[17:14] the third thing that she does because
[17:16] she's doing it so reliably now if she
[17:18] wasn't doing it as reliably i'd be a
[17:19] little bit more liberal so sit down
[17:23] yes i gotta sit and a down for a treat
[17:25] this is the kind of thing that you'll do
[17:27] five minutes here five minutes there
[17:28] throughout the first few weeks of
[17:30] training as your dog gets better and
[17:31] better with this you start increasing
[17:33] the distance at which you ask them to do
[17:35] it so your goal after a few days of
[17:37] working on this might be to have your
[17:39] dog sit
[17:41] yes
[17:43] have your dog sit while you stand up now
[17:45] i think if i said lie down
[17:48] she doesn't quite know what i mean there
[17:50] but if i just take a step back and i do
[17:52] that down good she knows so find where
[17:55] the communication is effective and kind
[17:57] of work at that range so right there
[17:59] she's thinking about popping back up but
[18:01] if i do this she does yes that's the
[18:04] fine line in space that you've got to
[18:05] identify and build from there if that
[18:07] makes sense and then stand
[18:12] yes second she comes up into that stand
[18:15] i want to reward her there good job girl
[18:17] lie down
[18:19] yes
[18:21] really good improvement
[18:22] you can tell there's a puppy in the
[18:24] house because my shoes are untied lure
[18:27] training is a fantastic way to get your
[18:29] dog to start understanding physical
[18:32] positions that they'll need to be going
[18:33] into when you ask them to like sit lie
[18:35] down up and and so forth
[18:38] naturally every single dog should know
[18:40] their name right i mean for exactly this
[18:43] reason i've got to be able to get her
[18:44] attention easily off that rug she's not
[18:46] allowed to chew on the rug so i find
[18:48] that introducing a dog's name to them in
[18:50] a high-pitched voice can be very
[18:52] effective so let's try kona
[18:55] yes see that see how she came right up
[18:57] to me when i said kona now you can
[19:00] gradually phase in a more normal tone of
[19:02] voice well why would you want to we've
[19:04] been training quite a while here and
[19:05] she's starting to wander coda
[19:08] yes so as she starts to walk towards me
[19:11] there i'm gonna do that i mean this is
[19:13] the beginning of burning in a really
[19:15] good come when called or a recall but it
[19:17] really is that simple just pairing their
[19:19] name with a tree kona
[19:21] yes
[19:25] good girl
[19:28] i'm going to let her attention drift
[19:30] again and give you one more example
[19:32] kona
[19:34] yes
[19:35] there you go good job so these are the
[19:38] things you should be working on first
[19:39] you don't necessarily train these all in
[19:41] one day if you really focus on refining
[19:43] the things we went over in this lesson
[19:45] leave it look at me their name lore
[19:48] training potty training and giving them
[19:50] a great diet you should be very pleased
[19:53] with how quickly your dog learns just
[19:55] remember to be patient and always
[19:57] customize your particular training
[19:59] program to your individual dog taking
[20:01] into account their particular strengths
[20:03] and weaknesses
[20:04] alright she's had plenty of training now
[20:06] and it's really important to balance
[20:08] play with training for a young puppy and
[20:10] you'll remember that kona was initially
[20:12] pretty nervous of inertia you can really
[20:15] start to see her come out of her shell
[20:16] now it's so much fun to watch two dogs
[20:19] truly open up to one another for the
[20:21] very first time i think this looks like
[20:23] really good play right here perfectly
[20:25] measured i'm really pleased with how
[20:27] inertia isn't playing too rough so
[20:29] yesterday kona showed some glimmers of
[20:32] bravery but during this play session i
[20:34] feel like we caught the exact moment
[20:36] that kona really got confident with
[20:37] inertia you can tell by her playful body
[20:40] language and her play vows and just her
[20:42] overall behavior i think one of the
[20:44] absolute best things you can do with a
[20:45] young puppy is to get them interacting
[20:47] with other dogs in a way that both dogs
[20:49] feel comfortable with sometimes that
[20:51] means rambunctious play but other dogs
[20:53] might want to just go and chill out and
[20:55] take a nap by really encouraging this
[20:56] kind of behavior now we're improving the
[20:58] odds that they'll acquire really good
[21:00] social skills to use with other dogs in
[21:03] the future at least that's the hope this
[21:05] is so healthy for kona as well to like
[21:07] get some experience with a really active
[21:09] dog like inertia play biting is good
[21:12] all right guys so this is night three
[21:15] with kona i'm gonna stay down here at
[21:17] least one more night she did really much
[21:20] better last night than
[21:23] the night before so that's good
[21:25] nonetheless we're gonna see how she does
[21:27] tonight still got the mattress set up
[21:28] down here probably gonna let these guys
[21:31] sleep upstairs so they're less
[21:32] distracting to her but she's doing
[21:34] really good in the crate
[21:36] so right off the bat she is
[21:39] pretty relaxed straight away
[21:43] oh what a girl
[21:45] well
[21:46] she did excellent
[21:48] she's getting very comfortable
[21:51] we're gonna take her outside
[21:53] the first thing i'll do in the morning
[21:54] is let her outside and then i'll let her
[21:56] run around and play with inertia for a
[21:58] little bit both dogs are really enjoying
[22:01] their play sessions i'm so encouraged by
[22:03] this this is something i'm going to
[22:04] continue to do every single day that i
[22:07] have kona although i've got to be honest
[22:09] right now it looks like my dog inertia
[22:11] is the only one getting any energy out
[22:14] here so check out solid gold's puppy

[00:00] all right we've got some dogs coming by
[00:01] over here
[00:05] i'm zach george i'm a dog trainer meet
[00:07] my new project
[00:08] kona i've got just three weeks to train
[00:10] her and set her up for the most
[00:11] well-behaved life possible that means i
[00:13] need to work on the most common puppy
[00:15] issues like potty training how to
[00:16] actually pay attention
[00:18] stopping things like play biting chewing
[00:20] separation anxiety
[00:21] getting along with other animals leash
[00:23] walking and teaching her
[00:24] everything a good dog needs to know real
[00:27] dog training doesn't always go smoothly
[00:28] and that's why i'm going to show you
[00:30] every success
[00:31] and mistake and how i work through all
[00:33] the most challenging parts of raising a
[00:35] new puppy
[00:36] welcome to your new puppy survival guide
[00:41] today is absolutely huge for kona it's
[00:43] going to be her
[00:44] very first public training experience
[00:46] let's see what pup box sent us
[00:48] this month pop box is an awesome product
[00:50] because they send you
[00:51] training supplies treats and toys based
[00:54] on your dog's
[00:55] specific age one of the things that
[00:57] really separates pup box is that they
[00:58] send you a training guide like this
[01:00] every single month so that you know what
[01:02] you should be working on
[01:03] so we're gonna get some training treats
[01:05] i know we're gonna need those
[01:06] in fact what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna
[01:08] put some of those in here right now
[01:10] this is an awesome ball it actually
[01:11] lights up when it's dark so you have
[01:13] these little stars that go in the moon
[01:15] once she figures it out dogs really love
[01:17] pulling those little squeaky toys out of
[01:19] the
[01:20] bigger toy there so you can see she's
[01:22] immediately into that one that's gonna
[01:23] be a lot of fun
[01:24] a new toy can really jump start a new
[01:26] training session with your dog and get
[01:27] them super excited
[01:28] and with young puppies they need to
[01:30] teeth so these teething rings are really
[01:32] good
[01:32] so you'll find that getting a pup box
[01:34] every month is really helpful for
[01:36] keeping your training
[01:37] extra interesting not only for your dog
[01:39] but for you too and pop box is going to
[01:40] give everyone 50
[01:42] off of your first pup box when you sign
[01:44] up for a three six or 12 month
[01:45] subscription go to pupbox.com and enter
[01:49] discount code zach the details will be
[01:50] in the description
[01:52] so today is really a special training
[01:54] day for kona we are in public
[01:56] for the first time this is a public park
[01:58] out here this is going to be kona's very
[02:00] first
[02:00] screensaver training lesson we kind of
[02:03] coined these sessions screensaver
[02:04] sessions because
[02:06] it really just allows her to let the
[02:08] world go past her let her observe things
[02:10] things that she hasn't seen before or
[02:12] maybe things that she's seen but
[02:14] isn't quite sure of so there's a lot of
[02:16] value in these for
[02:18] young dogs people tend to think of
[02:19] socializing their dog with people
[02:21] and other dogs which is important for a
[02:23] young dog but socializing them to places
[02:26] is extremely important and sometimes
[02:28] that gets overlooked
[02:29] kona has gotten the clearance from her
[02:31] vet to go out in public
[02:33] and just out of an abundance of caution
[02:35] i'm taking her to this less
[02:36] populated park which happens to be right
[02:38] behind our house
[02:40] which is why i bought this house it's a
[02:42] great place to train a dog
[02:44] this path right here i find to be very
[02:46] valuable
[02:47] for introducing a new dog to the world
[02:49] because you have a steady stream of
[02:51] walkers you get some dogs here and there
[02:53] you get bicycles of course you have all
[02:55] of the smells coming off of lake
[02:56] pontchartrain which is actually quite
[02:58] nice
[02:59] believe it or not well most of the time
[03:01] anyway
[03:02] now there's a bike coming by over here
[03:04] it looks like it's got her attention
[03:06] so i'm just gonna let her check it out
[03:08] hopefully she'll react well
[03:11] look at that oh yeah how about that good
[03:13] job
[03:14] and see there's an exposure she got to
[03:16] see something go by that she
[03:18] hasn't seen before she reacted well kona
[03:22] yes good girl nice and again
[03:26] in public i'm going to reinforce that
[03:28] recall when she comes to me i mean as
[03:30] close to 100
[03:31] as possible it's such a vital skill coda
[03:37] good girl come what
[03:40] i feel like i just hit a grand slam
[03:42] right there she saw those bikes i don't
[03:44] know if you could
[03:45] see her glancing at it i noticed she
[03:46] looked at me so i'm like i'm going to
[03:48] try and get a free when called here
[03:50] while she's mildly distracted by this
[03:51] new thing so come when called already
[03:54] looking good i mean
[03:55] i wasn't going to insist that she come
[03:56] to me when i call her in this new place
[03:59] but since she's doing so well why not
[04:01] nice
[04:02] job girl kona come on
[04:10] nice kona
[04:14] yes good girl fantastic
[04:18] a plus so far all right we've got some
[04:20] dogs coming by over here so she's going
[04:22] to get some good exposure
[04:23] to dogs she hasn't seen before and
[04:25] they're going to walk by i'm not going
[04:26] to let her socialize with them right now
[04:28] but dogs don't have to interact with one
[04:30] another to
[04:32] gain some socializing experience so
[04:36] so she's a lot more interested in the
[04:38] dogs on the treat here
[04:39] see i can't even give her a treat
[04:40] because she's like whoa those are
[04:42] interesting hi how are you
[04:44] nice dogs
[04:50] i know so here i'm just happy to let her
[04:53] bark and acknowledge them
[04:55] but i wanted to show you that she was
[04:56] not interested in a treat because
[04:57] something like a dog
[04:59] is super exciting to a puppy and that's
[05:02] okay i'm not going to insist that she'd
[05:03] be
[05:04] the perfect dog right now in this
[05:06] training lesson
[05:07] hey what's this good see now i can get a
[05:11] sit now i can get her attention that's a
[05:12] really good example by the way
[05:14] of how dogs become more compliant the
[05:17] more distance there is between them
[05:19] and the thing they're interested in so
[05:20] as the dogs got farther away
[05:22] you saw that i was able to get her to be
[05:24] more compliant that's normal
[05:26] and of course over time your focus is to
[05:28] shrink that distance but again the point
[05:29] of today's lesson
[05:30] isn't to get strong obedience out of her
[05:32] point of today's lesson is to say hey
[05:35] there's a planet out here that you might
[05:36] want to check out there's some things
[05:38] you need to know about it
[05:40] so that's what we're hoping to make a
[05:42] dent in we have a dog coming up over
[05:44] here
[05:44] so if she seems receptive to it i'm
[05:46] going to try and ask for some basic
[05:48] attention like a look at me
[05:49] and if i can do that i'm going to
[05:50] reinforce it with a treat because
[05:52] ultimately
[05:52] getting your dog's attention around
[05:54] other dogs is one of the tougher things
[05:58] yes kissy sound was successful in
[06:00] getting her attention nice job girl
[06:03] yes good girl i'm just giving her small
[06:06] bits of treat here
[06:08] hi how are you uh well i'm doing some
[06:11] training with her right now so
[06:12] i'm afraid she's going to lose her mind
[06:15] so
[06:16] thank you for offering those really nice
[06:19] you know there's a time and a place for
[06:20] everything and right now we're focused
[06:21] more
[06:22] on general exposure so by the way
[06:25] you notice how she just has been sitting
[06:26] here the whole time yes
[06:28] good girl very good there's a time to
[06:31] socialize a dog with other dogs and
[06:33] there's a time to say hey we're not
[06:34] going to go up to every dog we see and
[06:36] so i guess my instinct there was
[06:38] i don't want to set a precedent of oh
[06:40] you see a dog we're going to go and play
[06:41] with that dog
[06:42] i wanted to know that look sometimes
[06:44] dogs go by and they just go
[06:46] oh here come the dogs again these are
[06:48] the two dogs she saw last time
[06:49] so here we're a little bit farther away
[06:51] maybe we'll get more polite behavior out
[06:53] of her
[06:53] again this really underscores how
[06:55] important distance is when you're trying
[06:57] to teach your dog to behave acceptably
[06:59] and even if she does bark here
[07:01] it's okay but she's baby well yes you
[07:04] want this
[07:05] see that isn't that funny took a second
[07:07] for her to take the treat
[07:09] because she was so fixated on the dogs
[07:11] it's okay you can look at the puppies
[07:15] oh what well-behaved dogs by the way huh
[07:18] look at them
[07:19] they're checking around yes good girl
[07:23] so you can see what i mean by screen
[07:25] saver dog training here right i mean you
[07:27] get the occasional distraction coming by
[07:29] the occasional dogs you have the waves
[07:31] and the smells in the background
[07:32] but we're not overwhelming her or
[07:34] inundating her with
[07:35] every distraction in the world it's just
[07:37] hey here's a little slice of the world
[07:39] what do you think oh here comes the bike
[07:41] again
[07:42] hey what's up nice job girl
[07:47] yeah good and so
[07:50] really i'm not really focused on
[07:51] training her even though i'm giving her
[07:53] a treat i'm more just trying to
[07:54] condition her that hey that thing came
[07:56] by
[07:57] you were good you got something you like
[07:59] i'm just trying to chip away and seal in
[08:01] those
[08:01] more desired behaviors where i can when
[08:04] they happen organically like that
[08:06] that's why we've got to get out in the
[08:07] real world we've got to train with our
[08:08] dogs but you can do this
[08:10] just about anywhere i mean you know look
[08:12] around your own community what makes
[08:14] sense
[08:14] surely you can find a bench at a park or
[08:16] even if you live in a big city you can
[08:18] go off the beaten path
[08:19] and let your dog observe all of the
[08:21] activity at a reasonable distance
[08:23] so you might have noticed the lake right
[08:24] here let's go give her a closer look at
[08:26] that and see what she makes of it
[08:28] experiencing the sound of the waves and
[08:30] looking at them up close
[08:31] is likely to have some value okay we
[08:33] have a jogger coming by let's let her
[08:34] observe the jogger
[08:35] dogs are generally attracted to people
[08:38] running more than they are walking
[08:40] yes konak
[08:44] kona come on you're making me look too
[08:47] good here
[08:48] we have a dog training series to do give
[08:50] me something to train you
[08:52] come on i'm not really focused on leash
[08:54] manners right now
[08:55] remember now imagine what this might
[08:57] look like to a dog as
[08:58] as this big body of water tends to fill
[09:01] their vision
[09:02] as they approach it i mean you can see
[09:03] she's even being a little guarded as we
[09:06] get close it can be daunting i mean even
[09:07] to a person it's like man
[09:10] that's a lot of water kona come on
[09:15] oh look at that now see unexpected i
[09:18] thought she might have
[09:19] walked up a little bit more
[09:21] enthusiastically but she's like
[09:23] let me let me check that out for a
[09:24] minute there are the bikes good girl
[09:28] see that like past at close range
[09:32] yes come on here
[09:36] okay remember the environment counts as
[09:38] reinforcement too
[09:39] if that's what your dog is interested in
[09:41] at that particular moment
[09:43] and so there's recently been water up
[09:45] here so a lot of different smells from
[09:47] the water have washed up but now she
[09:49] look at her she's like wait a minute
[09:52] she's noticed the waves
[09:55] she's decided to wrap herself up in a
[09:57] leash and bite her tail as a consequence
[09:59] what are you doing let's see what she
[10:01] wants to do
[10:03] look at that you think isn't that
[10:06] interesting
[10:07] screensaver training it's like
[10:09] meditation only better
[10:11] on a session like this it's a fine line
[10:14] between enforcing
[10:15] leave it and just letting them smell and
[10:18] explore but right now the emphasis is
[10:20] definitely on exploring but let's get
[10:22] her away from
[10:23] the stuff here i think it's a good
[10:24] opportunity as well since we're out here
[10:26] to put some movement to the screensaver
[10:29] maybe we can
[10:30] walk around a little bit since we're on
[10:31] the lead again this is more of a free
[10:33] walk than anything you'll recall that a
[10:35] free walk
[10:36] is just letting your dog walk on their
[10:38] own terms
[10:39] provided they're safe and on a long lead
[10:41] like this of course
[10:42] that's opposed to a training walk which
[10:44] has a bit more structure to it where we
[10:45] keep our dog a lot closer to us
[10:48] kona come on
[10:51] yeah good girl
[10:54] [Applause]
[10:55] hey i'm over here i think she forgot
[10:58] about me halfway through
[11:00] but i mean you just look at her you can
[11:01] see she's like oh i want to see what
[11:02] this is i want to see what that
[11:03] is good work good girl
[11:07] yes when she checks in with me like that
[11:10] or when she gives me any attention
[11:12] voluntarily i want to
[11:14] reinforce that by giving her a treat as
[11:15] long as she's taking him and she's like
[11:17] cool i'll take that
[11:18] i'm happy to give it to her that'll make
[11:20] future training a little bit easier as
[11:21] well
[11:22] so here cona is just like hey i'm going
[11:24] to take a break i'm going to lie down
[11:25] and
[11:25] appreciate these waves and this person
[11:28] exercising let's see if she'll come to
[11:30] me kona
[11:32] come come on come on
[11:37] no see that see how she didn't come
[11:40] because she's
[11:41] really distracted good morning
[11:48] good girl i really wanted to get that
[11:50] out of her there did you see how she
[11:51] didn't pay attention to me
[11:52] as the woman was getting closer but then
[11:54] again as the distance reached a certain
[11:56] point kona is like all right i'll pay
[11:58] attention to you now over time we of
[12:00] course
[12:00] want to minimize those instances and
[12:02] teach her to listen to us no matter how
[12:04] close
[12:05] something is but one step at a time okay
[12:08] kona has had some time to adjust and
[12:10] take everything in so i think we can
[12:11] practice some basic training while in
[12:13] this
[12:13] screen saver environment now i have to
[12:16] be pretty flexible on today's lesson i
[12:18] don't know what i'm going to get out of
[12:19] it i don't know what our attention is
[12:20] going to be like
[12:21] there are five things that i want to go
[12:23] over today that i
[12:24] really like to make sure that every new
[12:26] pet parent really understands when it
[12:28] comes to training a dog
[12:30] because they're not always that obvious
[12:32] probably the first thing that i tell
[12:33] anyone new to training a dog is keep
[12:36] your expectations realistic
[12:38] it's normal not to know how long it
[12:40] takes to get a dog up to speed and how
[12:42] to get them trained and everything
[12:43] depending on how far you want to take
[12:46] your training with your dog it can take
[12:47] a good couple of years to really get
[12:49] them to understand
[12:50] everything you want them to listen to in
[12:52] a broad variety of contexts and settings
[12:55] that doesn't mean you can't get amazing
[12:57] results in just a few weeks and really
[12:58] start to get them
[12:59] understanding you but it probably will
[13:01] take longer than you're originally
[13:03] thinking to get your dog trained
[13:05] and i tell you this because i really
[13:06] want your mindset to be the most patient
[13:08] possible
[13:09] in other words you'll probably find that
[13:11] the slower you go
[13:12] with training your dog the more
[13:13] methodical you are the better results
[13:16] you're going to get
[13:17] long term so right now you might notice
[13:19] that she's a little distracted she's
[13:21] chewing on the grass and i'm calling her
[13:23] periodically i'm really focused on
[13:24] getting rough drafts of all of her basic
[13:27] skills
[13:27] in a variety of circumstances kona come
[13:32] on good girl yeah i mean that's a good
[13:35] example
[13:36] it wasn't a perfect come win call but
[13:38] she did come to me
[13:39] so it's kind of a rough draft version
[13:40] you see what i mean focus on really
[13:42] refining those skills over time
[13:44] kona yes good girl
[13:49] you can see we have a long 50 foot lead
[13:51] just to keep extra good control of her
[13:53] and give her a reasonable amount of
[13:54] freedom
[13:55] to explore this new place too that was
[13:57] really good i love that she came to me
[13:59] in this public environment that's always
[14:00] a good sign puppies are living thinking
[14:03] beings so don't
[14:04] expect linear progress either with them
[14:07] in other words they might really be
[14:08] excelling on a particular skill but then
[14:10] all of a sudden
[14:11] well they start not doing as well on
[14:12] that skill as they once were
[14:14] potty training is a good example of this
[14:16] it's normal for a puppy to say have a
[14:18] few consecutive days of success and then
[14:20] they might have accidents a few days in
[14:22] a row
[14:22] that's all normal so when that happens
[14:24] be prepared to take a step back and
[14:26] repair
[14:27] the skill and walk them through the
[14:29] steps a little more thoroughly so they
[14:31] have a better understanding of how you
[14:32] want them to behave
[14:34] now with a puppy it can often be
[14:35] tempting to get frustrated with them
[14:37] when they're not behaving how we want
[14:38] them to behave
[14:39] and i notice a lot of people fall into
[14:41] the trap of blaming their dog rather
[14:43] than
[14:44] taking accountability and saying you
[14:45] know maybe i could do something a little
[14:47] bit better or
[14:48] maybe i could break this down into
[14:50] smaller steps to help them understand
[14:52] so really avoid falling into the trap of
[14:54] blaming your dog when they don't behave
[14:56] how you want them to behave
[14:58] this is one of my my golden rules when
[15:00] it comes to training dogs
[15:02] dogs learn best after exercise
[15:05] see when a dog is able to get their
[15:06] energy out especially if it's in a
[15:08] structured way like fetch or even a long
[15:11] walk
[15:11] they seem to be much more primed to
[15:13] absorb new concepts
[15:15] so it's a really good idea to exercise
[15:17] your dog before training them something
[15:19] new you know especially things like
[15:21] leash walking or being calm in an
[15:23] exciting environment so that's why i'll
[15:25] have an emphasis
[15:26] on exercising her and teaching her fetch
[15:29] because i think it really will
[15:30] accelerate her training progress overall
[15:33] now
[15:33] she's not perfect at fetch yet but let's
[15:36] see how she does with fetch training
[15:37] and again i'm trying to keep my
[15:39] expectations realistic here i'm not
[15:41] expecting a perfect fetch
[15:42] i don't even care if she ignores it but
[15:44] i just want to do some testing and see
[15:46] what this individual dog is like
[15:48] [Music]
[15:51] so i could see squeaking it there she
[15:53] looked at it but she's like i want to go
[15:54] smell around instead
[15:55] let's see maybe she wants to play with
[15:57] this toy go get it
[15:59] nice
[16:02] come on coda good girl yeah
[16:06] good let's give her a little tug because
[16:08] she likes that remember you don't want
[16:09] to just take the toy from your dog when
[16:11] you're playing fetch with them
[16:13] you want to give them some enjoyment ah
[16:14] there we go go get it
[16:16] if you've got an energetic dog that
[16:18] doesn't mean there's something wrong
[16:19] with them in fact that probably means
[16:20] they're a very well-bred dog with
[16:22] fantastic genetics i mean remember we
[16:25] selected for dogs that had endless
[16:26] stamina energy and endurance over the
[16:28] last several centuries
[16:29] now many of us don't necessarily have a
[16:32] need for all of that energy but we still
[16:34] have to meet those genetic needs
[16:36] so especially those of you with higher
[16:37] energy dogs have a strong focus
[16:39] on creating structured ways to release
[16:42] that energy
[16:43] preferably early in the day so that you
[16:45] can have a more sane day
[16:46] and i think you'll be very happy with
[16:48] the results that you get over
[16:49] time so so far plan a is working very
[16:53] well
[16:53] i'm getting come when called i'm getting
[16:55] some basic fetch out of her
[16:56] and the reason i'm so thrilled and
[16:58] surprised is because
[17:00] i am in a new place and i know from
[17:01] experience that the fastest way to
[17:04] cause a dog to be thrown off or act
[17:06] uncharacteristically or stop paying
[17:07] attention to you is to change their
[17:09] surroundings
[17:10] we have done so in dramatic fashion here
[17:12] and she's really
[17:13] adjusting and adapting very well kona
[17:17] here come
[17:20] come here wet nose sit good nice ah
[17:23] that's great i that's so good the fact
[17:26] that she
[17:27] is being this attentive in this
[17:30] environment i mean inertia wasn't this
[17:31] intentive
[17:32] in this environment next be flexible
[17:35] your training plan is rarely going to go
[17:37] exactly as you intend it to go
[17:40] so you have to be prepared to make
[17:42] adjustments on the fly when you're
[17:43] training a dog
[17:44] and be able to work with them maybe you
[17:46] had a plan to go into the city and take
[17:49] a walk with them but you see that
[17:50] they're barking and they're overwhelmed
[17:52] well it might be a better job to sit off
[17:53] to the side and do a screensaver
[17:55] training lesson like we're doing today
[17:57] and just let them observe things from a
[17:58] more acceptable distance where they
[18:00] don't feel as overwhelmed there are a
[18:02] million examples of ways that you'll
[18:04] need to adjust your training
[18:06] expectations
[18:07] as time goes on just understand that
[18:09] that is completely normal and
[18:11] build that into your training strategy
[18:13] overall oh real life leave it
[18:15] see this leave it look at me
[18:19] here yes good girl we talked about
[18:22] dropping a treat and saying leave it
[18:24] like that
[18:26] as i've said before just because a dog
[18:27] leaves a treat alone doesn't mean
[18:29] they're going to leave everything alone
[18:30] in the natural environment so you're
[18:32] going to encounter things like garbage
[18:33] where they're like oh i don't think i
[18:34] have to leave that alone i just have to
[18:36] leave the treat alone when i'm asked so
[18:37] it's a good opportunity to stop and
[18:39] really zoom in on those things and
[18:40] practice
[18:41] leave it when the opportunity presents
[18:43] itself like that
[18:44] kona come yes okay
[18:48] i'm gonna quit while i'm ahead on that
[18:49] one so there i was able to get a
[18:50] reluctant leave it
[18:52] and get her to come to me as i called
[18:53] her and she ran past the debris there
[18:56] so good job girl let's see how she's
[18:57] doing on sit and down and things like
[19:00] that that we've been working on
[19:01] let's see if she's able to do them out
[19:03] here ready sit
[19:05] yes gotta sit there
[19:08] okay good let's try again let's do a sit
[19:12] and how about a lie down
[19:16] wow really good
[19:19] and on a windy day on top of that wind
[19:22] makes things challenging very often
[19:23] because of all the scents that are
[19:25] coming off the water and everything else
[19:27] remember dogs really
[19:28] experience the world through scent in a
[19:31] way that we just can't fathom or
[19:32] completely understand
[19:34] is it down
[19:38] yes okay good girl that was a nice
[19:41] lightweight training session for kona
[19:43] now we're back in the house and we're
[19:45] gonna let
[19:45] kona and inertia duke it out and play a
[19:48] little rough right now but their play
[19:50] just continues to get more and more
[19:51] confident
[19:52] every day you remember kona was
[19:54] initially very reserved
[19:56] with inertia and now hinders has met her
[19:59] match i think
[20:00] but it's important for kona to get this
[20:02] physical activity
[20:03] with another dog i mean this is how dogs
[20:05] learn so much about one another their
[20:08] social cues and how to use the
[20:10] appropriate amount of force when playing
[20:12] so i mean you can see she's biting on
[20:14] her collar right there and hershel will
[20:15] probably let her know hey don't bite me
[20:16] that hard
[20:17] well the thing about inertia is she's so
[20:19] super tolerant
[20:20] but aderson likes to put kona in her
[20:22] place in her own way
[20:24] all right so the next thing i have
[20:26] planned for us training wise
[20:27] today is to teach kona how to do the
[20:30] stairs this is something i get a lot of
[20:32] requests for
[20:33] i think it's a good way for her to learn
[20:35] how to use her body she's going to
[20:36] encounter stairs many times in her life
[20:39] so why not get started now but just to
[20:41] establish
[20:42] kona if i say kona
[20:48] like you can see she appears to want to
[20:50] come up but she's like wait a minute i
[20:52] don't know how to get up those things
[20:54] good girl very good so
[20:58] i love the metaphor of teaching a dog to
[21:00] go upstairs it's
[21:02] one step at a time so let's see if we
[21:04] can get her on this one stair
[21:06] good job right you gotta do one stair
[21:08] before you can do two
[21:09] here get it good yes
[21:13] did you see that beyond the mechanics
[21:15] you're teaching your dog how to be more
[21:16] confident and how to encounter this
[21:18] world
[21:18] with a little more optimism perhaps yes
[21:22] good you see that that's good i'm gonna
[21:24] actually get over here behind her
[21:28] come here yeah good girl so hey pretty
[21:32] good start
[21:33] you can see it's a little awkward for us
[21:36] yes
[21:37] look at that i'm just luring her here
[21:40] yes
[21:40] good girl and i'm gonna make sure i'm
[21:42] here to protect her and you know that
[21:44] she
[21:44] slips or gets uncertain it might seem
[21:47] silly but it really is important
[21:49] to be extra safe when it comes to
[21:51] teaching your dog how to do stairs
[21:54] yeah she did it good girl
[21:57] very good and so we're gonna encourage
[21:59] her to go
[22:01] yes good just giving her a spot there
[22:03] yes
[22:04] good girl very good
[22:07] and so you gotta love that i mean her
[22:09] confidence is so strong
[22:11] good work all right i think she's ready
[22:13] to go higher i hadn't really intended to
[22:15] have her go up the entire staircase but
[22:17] she seems to really be catching on so i
[22:19] don't see why we wouldn't keep going
[22:21] yeah look at this see once they get it
[22:24] they get it very often come on
[22:28] kona wow wow okay i didn't expect it to
[22:32] go this quickly she's doing great
[22:34] kona oh okay there she goes and you can
[22:37] see how she's being
[22:38] awkward okay oh boy
[22:41] i have awoken the sleeping dragon can
[22:44] you make it all the way to the top no no
[22:47] yes come on let's go
[22:50] she's thinking she's like all right how
[22:52] do i move my legs to do this
[22:54] tada good job girl
[22:58] look at her nice
[23:04] yeah good girl you did it
[23:08] good job wonderful but again i do want
[23:11] to emphasize that's why this is going to
[23:12] be important because we don't want her
[23:14] having access to this staircase
[23:16] unsupervised certainly not in her time
[23:19] with me
[23:19] if your puppy seems a little more
[23:20] nervous than kona is that's totally fine
[23:23] be content with them just looking at the
[23:24] stair or just going up one stair
[23:26] or even two stairs or something like
[23:28] that kona's progress is
[23:29] really accelerating i'm so proud of her
[23:32] and for the rest of you get 50

[01:20] out of the car
[01:21] look at her i just kinda wanna see if
[01:23] she brainstorms on getting out overcomes
[01:26] a fear and she does good work girl
[01:29] little things like that really build a
[01:31] puppy's confidence in the new world now
[01:33] today we are at city park in new orleans
[01:36] and we are going to
[01:37] give kona some exposure to a brand new
[01:39] place this is one of my favorite places
[01:41] to socialize and train a dog anytime you
[01:44] go into public with a dog it is
[01:45] impossible to predict
[01:47] all of the experiences they're going to
[01:48] have and all of the training
[01:50] opportunities that you'll encounter look
[01:52] at her
[01:52] looking around smelling the ground
[01:55] gathering information
[01:56] got her on a 10 foot lead today because
[01:58] our primary objective today is just to
[02:00] get her to explore this new place
[02:02] secondarily if she seems to open up and
[02:04] she seems to be comfortable i might go
[02:06] over some of her training
[02:07] but i'm not going to rush the
[02:08] socialization process here this is
[02:11] extremely valuable for a 13 week old dog
[02:14] we're walking that fine line here where
[02:16] she's going to encounter
[02:17] scents on the ground but i would prefer
[02:19] her not to get totally fixated on them
[02:21] like we're seeing
[02:22] here so let's go ahead i'm just gonna
[02:25] block it
[02:27] okay come on there we go so i was able
[02:29] to block the scent encourage her to move
[02:31] along and she did wonderfully
[02:33] one of the really interesting things
[02:34] about this park are the fact that you
[02:36] have many different kinds of birds here
[02:38] and birds seem to be very
[02:39] interesting to dogs you might remember
[02:41] she saw the ducks pretty recently and
[02:43] she reacted
[02:44] so well when encountering ducks for
[02:45] probably the first time
[02:47] okay and i mean there you go you have a
[02:48] bird flying
[02:50] you can see how that's gotta trip a dog
[02:52] out if they're not familiar with that
[02:54] nice job good girl tona
[02:59] yes just letting you know i got that so
[03:02] i am going to let her know i have treats
[03:04] available kind of keep her centered and
[03:05] grounded here
[03:06] sit yes
[03:10] look at that oh more ducks what is that
[03:16] i was excited there because i got to sit
[03:18] in a brand new place if you get your dog
[03:20] complying even with something easy like
[03:21] sit in a brand new place
[03:23] especially when they're this young
[03:24] you're ahead of the game that's really
[03:26] good
[03:27] because all of that is secondary right
[03:29] now so you really don't want to
[03:31] insist on too much obedience training or
[03:34] compliance
[03:34] right out of the gate when you're coming
[03:36] into a new place with an inexperienced
[03:38] dog
[03:38] i should point out too we've come out
[03:40] here early in the morning it's not too
[03:41] busy yet so this is all in the interest
[03:44] of just
[03:44] gradually phasing in more and more
[03:46] distracting environments
[03:48] look at this piece of garbage not you
[03:51] this leave it alone
[03:54] good opportunity to practice so real
[03:55] life leave it leave it
[03:57] here kona look at me perfect
[04:01] yes i mean because this is exactly the
[04:03] kind of thing that many dogs will
[04:04] encounter
[04:05] so you want them to be familiar sit good
[04:08] and
[04:09] leave it look at me
[04:12] wow yes
[04:15] okay come on let's go a little training
[04:17] exercise like that takes less than 10
[04:19] seconds
[04:20] and it gives him an experience of
[04:22] leaving a piece of garbage alone that
[04:23] you encounter of course
[04:25] i do think we should probably throw it
[04:26] away huh
[04:28] city park has the largest collection of
[04:30] live oak trees anywhere in the known
[04:32] world to my knowledge so we don't know
[04:33] exactly
[04:34] how this old tree got this way but you
[04:36] can see it's growing sideways
[04:38] let's see if we can get her comfortable
[04:39] with walking up here look at her yeah
[04:42] girl what is this come on let's go
[04:45] look at this come on let's go can you do
[04:48] it
[04:49] come on come on you can do it
[04:52] you can do it come on there we go she
[04:55] did it
[04:56] at this age dogs are really learning how
[04:58] to use their body in many different ways
[05:00] and
[05:00] it's always gratifying to see them do
[05:02] something like that for the first time
[05:03] because when she first encountered it
[05:05] she's like huh i don't know if i can do
[05:06] anything with that and then
[05:07] she eventually just jumped right over it
[05:09] and look at this second time it's
[05:10] nothing
[05:11] she goes right over it look at that
[05:13] adventure dog
[05:14] nice work girl here
[05:18] what's this so i'm luring her with the
[05:21] treat again another benefit to lore
[05:23] training here you can easily guide them
[05:25] look at you being so confident
[05:30] and you can see she's having to
[05:32] fine-tune her balance yes
[05:34] let's go back the other way kona just
[05:36] little exercises like this go a long way
[05:38] towards teaching your dog how to be more
[05:40] confident in the real world and you get
[05:42] so much bang for your buck when you do
[05:44] this
[05:44] with a young puppy come on girl yes
[05:47] good job i'm just giving her a treat for
[05:51] an added bonus there let's go see what
[05:53] else we can get into
[05:54] wildlife is one of the more interesting
[05:55] things to train your dog around because
[05:58] they have erratic interesting movements
[06:00] to dogs although look she's she's just
[06:02] like eh okay
[06:03] men they're birds whatever really
[06:04] healthy reaction to the birds right now
[06:06] pretty good really good reaction to
[06:08] people walking by i mean
[06:09] very interesting she started to walk
[06:11] towards them i didn't even need to
[06:12] restrain her though she's like
[06:13] i'll stay over here which is good i like
[06:16] the fact that she's staying near me
[06:18] we'll see if that sticks over time
[06:20] let me see if i can get her attention on
[06:21] me around these birds here
[06:23] just so i know where i stand as a
[06:24] trainer with her right now
[06:26] yes i mean i just got into her area
[06:29] she's like oh there's that man again
[06:30] when i see him he gives me treats and
[06:32] that's really the kind of
[06:33] logic and part that we're trying to
[06:35] build into our dog here like look pay
[06:37] attention to me good things are going to
[06:38] come your way
[06:39] but you can also chill out and observe
[06:41] the world too ultimately as your dog
[06:43] matures and gets older you want them to
[06:45] listen to you in places like this but
[06:46] it's not really reasonable to expect
[06:48] them to listen to you reliably if
[06:50] they're not used to being in places like
[06:52] this but if they've been seeing
[06:53] parks and interesting settings like this
[06:56] their entire life
[06:57] then they're far more likely to be
[06:58] compliant now if you have an older dog
[07:00] and you haven't gone through this
[07:02] effort that's okay it's never too late
[07:03] to start dogs of any age can benefit
[07:06] from
[07:06] socialization you can see she was a
[07:08] little thrown off by that dog for
[07:10] example
[07:10] that's normal but she reacted well
[07:14] yes good girl it's okay nice
[07:17] it looks like somebody has left actual
[07:20] lettuce out here for the birds
[07:22] might be fun to practice a leave it with
[07:25] this
[07:25] organic matter kona
[07:29] here good girl took her second leave it
[07:32] look at me yes
[07:35] good leave it look at me combo right
[07:37] there good girl
[07:39] leave it i'm just blocking access notice
[07:42] i'm really doing my best to avoid
[07:43] pulling her back on the leash here i
[07:45] really want her to think
[07:46] from the inside out okay nope too much
[07:49] there see
[07:50] we have a passing crowd over here so i
[07:52] mean that was an example where i tried
[07:54] to get her attention she's a little too
[07:55] distracted i'm going to let that one
[07:57] slide right now
[07:58] again given that she has so much
[08:00] inexperience in an environment like this
[08:02] okay let's move on leave it
[08:10] come on let's go good very good an
[08:12] example there where she was trying to
[08:14] lag behind she was really interested in
[08:16] the lettuce i didn't pull her i got to
[08:18] voluntarily come now there would be no
[08:20] harm in assisting your dog physically
[08:21] and saying come on let's go already
[08:23] but if you're feeling extra patient and
[08:25] you can get your dog to go through the
[08:26] motions
[08:27] all by themselves with a little bit of
[08:29] encouragement it's probably going to be
[08:30] a more potent training instance
[08:32] training a puppy is far more than sit
[08:34] stay come down potty training
[08:36] stop biting and stop jumping it's also
[08:38] about getting compliance in the real
[08:40] world
[08:41] but before you can get compliance out
[08:42] here they have to know what it is
[08:44] they have to exist within it if you're
[08:46] new to raising a puppy or training a dog
[08:48] it's really easy
[08:49] to intuitively take big steps in your
[08:52] training in other words come out here
[08:54] run through everything you think they
[08:55] know that they do at home and expect
[08:57] them to comply just as they do in your
[08:59] living room and that's not always
[09:00] realistic because environment remember
[09:02] we'll throw a dog off more than anything
[09:05] kona yeah good girl
[09:11] good job and so in this case rather than
[09:15] giving her a treat
[09:16] she was content to keep exploring and
[09:18] that was like exciting enough to her
[09:21] let me give you guys an update on her
[09:22] potty training and how that's going
[09:24] so i think potty training could be going
[09:26] better than it currently is and i blame
[09:28] myself completely for that
[09:29] so most of the accidents that she has
[09:31] had inside the house occur well number
[09:34] one when we're filming and i'm a bit
[09:35] distracted
[09:36] but i've been letting her and inertia
[09:38] and indy
[09:39] play so much while in the house that a
[09:42] number of accidents have occurred when
[09:44] i've
[09:45] kind of let my guard down and they're
[09:46] playing together normally i'll keep a
[09:48] dog on leash and under very strict
[09:50] supervision
[09:50] in the house but with her being the age
[09:52] she is and her
[09:54] inertia hitting it off so well i really
[09:56] think that social experience
[09:58] with an older dog is so incredibly
[10:01] valuable to her
[10:02] so i've been letting her get in a
[10:03] disproportionate amount of play time
[10:05] with inertia too so what i'm doing to
[10:07] fix that is i'm going to encourage their
[10:09] play sessions to occur more
[10:10] outside or when i do have her inside i'm
[10:13] going to have her on a 10 foot tie out
[10:15] because they've been learning how to
[10:16] kind of play with that limitation in
[10:18] place and they've been doing pretty well
[10:19] the less range she has to get around the
[10:21] house the less likely an accident is to
[10:23] occur but the lesson i've taken from all
[10:25] of this
[10:25] are puppies are fast but they pee even
[10:29] faster
[10:30] one of the things that's helping us out
[10:32] a little bit too is that i've put the
[10:34] wiz smart p
[10:35] pads down so that she has easy access to
[10:38] those
[10:38] that combined with her 10-foot tie-out
[10:41] while in the house
[10:42] means she has very obvious access to the
[10:44] p-pads right she really gravitates to
[10:46] those pads because we've been
[10:48] introducing them to her from a young age
[10:50] i have definitely become a fan of pad
[10:52] training because it does give you a lot
[10:54] of options moving forward like bad
[10:56] weather
[10:56] or if you live in a high rise you really
[10:58] have that extra option
[11:00] for your dog to go potty and dogs can
[11:01] learn to do both they can learn to go on
[11:03] the pads and go outside so it only gives
[11:05] you options
[11:06] and you know that i'm a huge fan of
[11:07] creating lots of options
[11:09] if you're wondering what kind of pads to
[11:10] use i definitely recommend whiz smart
[11:12] pads once you get them you'll see what i
[11:13] mean they're the thickest most absorbent
[11:15] pads around they stick on the ground
[11:17] and really hold their position pretty
[11:19] well so i'll have a link in the

[11:27] so the other day we were teaching kona
[11:28] how to go up and down stairs
[11:30] but stairs are a thing that actually
[11:32] trip up a lot of puppies they don't know
[11:33] how to deal with them
[11:34] it might sound funny but giving them
[11:36] practice and experience with stairs
[11:38] is quite important here's a real life
[11:40] example let's see if she has general
[11:42] eyes doing stairs yet you can see she's
[11:44] like hyper aware of her environment here
[11:46] look at see it's a little awkward for
[11:47] her to do stairs
[11:49] but she's doing it good girl yeah
[11:52] you can tell she's just learned how to
[11:54] do stairs good i even got a
[11:56] free sit right there ah now let's do
[11:58] these other stairs
[12:02] i want to make sure she doesn't go
[12:03] jumping in the water though
[12:06] come on
[12:11] good girl you did it you
[12:14] did it in here we'll let her go up to
[12:16] the edge and at least
[12:17] see what she can discover and take in
[12:19] about this water here she's just
[12:21] interested in it so coming down the
[12:22] stairs is one thing let's see if she can
[12:24] remember how to go up the stairs
[12:26] can you oh nothing to it look at that
[12:30] some puppies take a little longer than
[12:31] normal to learn this but
[12:34] good job she goes right up there nice
[12:37] job girl
[12:38] this is a fun little section right here
[12:39] because we have joggers running by we
[12:41] have the occasional dog walking by we
[12:43] have birds over here and
[12:44] just general moderate distractions so i
[12:47] think we've been here long enough and i
[12:48] think
[12:48] kona has somewhat adjusted we're gonna
[12:51] find out
[12:52] so i'd like to go through some of her
[12:53] basic training right here and see how
[12:55] she's doing
[12:56] we can start with leave it because she's
[12:58] eating grass
[12:59] kona yes good work you
[13:04] oh man that good
[13:09] sit okay come
[13:13] good so that was a nice sit stay and i
[13:16] come when called at a very short
[13:17] distance
[13:18] in public that counts girl come here
[13:24] she's still see it's a balance here this
[13:26] is where you have to really watch your
[13:27] frustration she was very compliant a
[13:29] second ago
[13:30] and now she's like wait a minute i gotta
[13:32] check this out and that out and
[13:34] you know that's the give and take you
[13:35] have to balance when you're training a
[13:37] dog but we can't eat grass leave it
[13:39] come here girl yeah there we go got her
[13:41] back so sit
[13:42] how about a lie down oh can you lie down
[13:46] yes good work can we get a roll over
[13:50] with a lure
[13:52] yeah kind of how about it this way good
[13:54] job girl
[13:56] a little messy but the fact is she's
[13:57] really complying here and that's what we
[13:59] look for
[14:00] so proud of her sit stay
[14:06] okay come good girl nice job
[14:10] so i'm loving how that looked i mean
[14:11] that looked like a professional sit stay
[14:13] and come and i was even able to put the
[14:15] leash down but i feel pretty confident
[14:16] she's not going to bolt on me in this
[14:18] particular section of the park
[14:19] comm is looking good stay is looking
[14:21] good i like to test those pretty often
[14:23] because they're potentially life-saving
[14:25] skills
[14:25] let's talk a little bit about the proper
[14:27] mindset to have when you're teaching a
[14:28] dog like kona
[14:29] it's really important to summon genuine
[14:32] optimism even when your dog
[14:34] isn't behaving exactly as you want them
[14:36] to they learn extremely quickly and they
[14:38] can tell when you're being authentic
[14:40] versus
[14:40] being fake or impatient or non-genuine
[14:43] think about the different relationships
[14:45] you had when you were a kid maybe
[14:47] some teachers were easier to get along
[14:49] with and communicate with than others
[14:51] maybe you had one parent that was more
[14:53] permissive than another parent
[14:54] and you learned how to behave
[14:56] contextually in that particular
[14:58] instance right dogs are no different i
[15:00] mean keep in mind kona has been on this
[15:02] planet less than four months and that's
[15:04] not a lot of time so whenever you're
[15:05] struggling with your dog really put
[15:07] yourself in their position to the best
[15:08] of your ability and
[15:09] ask yourself is it really reasonable for
[15:11] them to be doing what you're asking them
[15:13] to do
[15:14] with their current level of experience
[15:16] but i think that you'll find when you
[15:17] really summon that genuine energy when
[15:19] you're working with your dog
[15:20] that you'll get much better results so
[15:23] some of the tips i like to give people
[15:24] who are new to training dogs are
[15:26] use a quiet voice you'll find that when
[15:28] your dog has to really focus on you that
[15:30] they're probably going to perform better
[15:32] speak normally and intelligently when
[15:34] you're talking to your dog
[15:35] try to avoid thinking that your dog can
[15:37] only understand really simple words or
[15:38] phrases
[15:39] in fact dogs can understand thousands of
[15:41] words naturally you won't want to
[15:42] overwhelm them and there's nothing wrong
[15:44] with teaching a basic concept when
[15:45] they're young but you can
[15:47] really evolve that communication and
[15:49] over time they'll learn to understand
[15:50] very complex concepts
[15:52] one thing i'd like to work on here see
[15:53] if we can get her to
[15:55] sit hold her stand i like when a dog can
[15:58] stand on all fours
[16:00] stay and i'm working on teaching her to
[16:02] stand without
[16:03] advancing these feet so you see how i'm
[16:05] like creating discs because she's so
[16:07] fixated on the treat right now which is
[16:08] normal
[16:09] we're just trying to build a little bit
[16:10] more time to get her to hold that stand
[16:12] i think it's important for dogs to know
[16:14] how to stay in a variety of positions
[16:16] whether that's sit or lie down or stand
[16:18] so that's something you can work on to
[16:20] like teach your dog to generally
[16:22] understand
[16:23] stay in different positions so like
[16:24] really trying to zoom in
[16:26] on those half second successes is
[16:28] something that's not very natural
[16:30] as people if we're not used to this
[16:34] we we tend to insist on more than as
[16:36] reasonably possible look at how these
[16:38] feet are not advancing forward
[16:40] stay yes yes
[16:44] yes a little bit longer
[16:48] yes
[16:51] yes and she's just getting tiny nibbles
[16:53] of the treat here
[16:54] huh yes i like how she took a step back
[16:57] even though she went into a sit
[16:59] yes
[17:03] yes okay good girl
[17:07] that was i mean excellent so we were
[17:09] struggling there for a minute but
[17:10] ultimately we got a two or three second
[17:12] stand stay in a new environment which is
[17:14] just icing on the cake
[17:16] oh we got some dogs coming by
[17:19] good job girl really healthy reaction
[17:22] there
[17:23] love it this counts as socialization
[17:25] because your dog's still getting
[17:26] experience with dogs walking by and
[17:28] she's learning that there's more of her
[17:30] out there
[17:31] so i think we had a great experience
[17:33] with koda today it's a lot of fun to get

[00:00] so right now we're obviously having a
[00:01] play biting episode she's really ouch
[00:04] what is it with you puppies always
[00:05] trying to get my shoes i'm zach george
[00:08] i'm a dog trainer
[00:09] meet my new project kona i've got just
[00:12] three weeks to train her and set her up
[00:13] for the most well-behaved life
[00:15] possible that means i need to work on
[00:16] the most common puppy issues like potty
[00:18] training how to actually pay attention
[00:20] stopping things like play biting chewing
[00:22] separation anxiety
[00:24] getting along with other animals leash
[00:26] walking and teaching her everything a
[00:27] good dog needs to know
[00:29] real dog training doesn't always go
[00:30] smoothly and that's why i'm going to
[00:32] show you
[00:32] every success and mistake and how i work
[00:35] through all the most
[00:36] challenging parts of raising a new puppy
[00:38] welcome to your new puppy survival guide
[00:43] today i'm hoping to make some progress
[00:45] on fetch maybe with the frisbee with
[00:47] this beautiful
[00:48] young lady let's see what we've got in
[00:49] our pup box here for those of you that
[00:51] don't know pupbox is a monthly box that
[00:53] you get where they send you
[00:54] toys and supplies based on your dog's
[00:57] specific age so that you know what you
[00:59] should be working on with your dog
[01:01] you get this really detailed training
[01:03] guide both front and back
[01:05] you'll find that they immediately get
[01:06] interested in these toys i mean look at
[01:08] this
[01:09] and so you can see how she went from
[01:10] relatively subdued to oh my gosh
[01:12] that's amazing right there and it
[01:14] matches you too i love that
[01:16] you don't just get toys with pup box you
[01:18] also get really useful things like this
[01:20] water bottle right here
[01:22] check this out you can actually pour
[01:24] water into it by squeezing it so you
[01:26] always have water with you on the go
[01:28] really useful thing to have with you and
[01:30] you get really good quality chews i mean
[01:32] you can see that's
[01:33] some part of an animal but dogs
[01:35] definitely love it so that's something
[01:36] she can gnaw on while she's going
[01:38] through the teething phase here what i
[01:40] love about this toy right here
[01:41] you have this kind of jelly rubbery type
[01:44] texture which a lot of dogs really like
[01:46] to sink their teeth into and then you
[01:47] have this classic
[01:48] nylon rope texture it's a really great
[01:51] way to keep a toy multi-dimensional and
[01:53] keep a dog interested
[01:54] pup box puts a ton of thought into the
[01:56] type of toys that they include in their
[01:58] boxes they're toys that are really
[01:59] designed to keep a dog interested and
[02:01] engaged
[02:02] we also have some great treats so i'll
[02:04] be using these to train kona as well
[02:06] you can't have too many treats around
[02:08] the house all of you can get 50
[02:09] off of your first pup box when you sign
[02:11] up for a multi-month subscription just
[02:13] go to pupbox.com or discount code zack
[02:16] i'll have the details in the description
[02:18] remember kona is going to be a big dog
[02:21] so i want to make it a huge priority to
[02:23] keep any unwanted jumping at bay
[02:26] right now this is pretty good by the way
[02:28] this is the tie out we have her on with
[02:29] her potty pads over here if she needs to
[02:31] go
[02:32] but we're being as proactive as possible
[02:33] whenever kona shows non-jumping behavior
[02:35] at meal
[02:36] time i want her to know that i like that
[02:38] so what happens if we walk over here
[02:40] yes oh so right there she jumped
[02:44] still a lot better but nonetheless we
[02:46] want to make sure that we give her some
[02:47] obvious communication in that case it
[02:49] was oh the food
[02:50] goes away i go away you don't get what
[02:51] you want but you can kind of see in her
[02:53] eyes right here
[02:54] she's starting to really understand okay
[02:56] i guess i better be good if i want to
[02:58] get that food
[02:58] i'm just giving her one or two kills at
[03:00] a time here for this
[03:02] but it's when i go into motion that she
[03:04] tends to get excited as you saw a moment
[03:05] ago so let me continue to walk back and
[03:07] forth here
[03:10] yes i'm going to continue to reward her
[03:13] when she's being compliant
[03:16] when i say yes i'm following it up with
[03:18] something good
[03:20] yes very good i'll give her a little
[03:23] extra for the sit
[03:24] i like that coda come
[03:28] nice job sit
[03:32] yes good girl what's up
[03:36] hey kona hey what's going on yes
[03:40] the logic here is if she'll behave while
[03:41] i get even more exciting then that tells
[03:43] me we're really making progress
[03:44] i mean you can see this is night and
[03:46] dame kona come here sweetheart
[03:48] wow she's really learning isn't she
[03:52] what a brilliant young lady yes another
[03:54] thing we've been continuing to work on
[03:56] is preventing resource guarding
[03:58] with kona you'll uh oh wait wait you
[04:01] were just doing so well
[04:03] give her a second to think yes
[04:08] sometimes you just gotta let your dog
[04:09] think it through ah
[04:12] good girl yes she's like i want the bowl
[04:15] resource guarding is where dogs tend to
[04:17] protect things especially food bones
[04:20] toys things that they really value
[04:21] i really want her to be comfortable and
[04:23] at ease when human hands are near her
[04:25] bowl
[04:26] so here just letting her eat out of the
[04:28] bowl good girl
[04:31] yes here you go
[04:34] being able to put my hand in the bowl
[04:36] like that
[04:38] and then give her something we're just
[04:39] trying to show her that hey just because
[04:41] hands are over here doesn't mean you're
[04:42] not gonna get fed sometimes human hands
[04:44] feed you
[04:45] this is a way that we've been using meal
[04:46] time to try and get some extra benefit
[04:48] she's obviously highly motivated at meal
[04:51] time so it's a good time to work on
[04:52] basic behaviors like not
[04:54] jumping all over people and so we'll
[04:55] want to build on this as she encounters
[04:57] guests or
[04:58] other exciting situations we'll want her
[05:00] to tap into these past experiences she's
[05:02] had
[05:03] when she's had to hold her sit or her
[05:05] down when
[05:06] in an excited state of mind hey good
[05:09] girl that's your whole meal
[05:11] kona and inertia have actually been
[05:12] sharing their water bowl and
[05:14] everything which is really good it's
[05:15] been nice to see that
[05:17] so far she's shown a complete
[05:19] willingness to be tolerant
[05:21] and to share stuff that she really
[05:22] values with other dogs and people
[05:24] that's what we want by the way if you
[05:26] are struggling with resource guarding
[05:28] jumping or any other number of
[05:30] problems check out my books this one's
[05:32] very detailed on training
[05:33] and then dog training revolution is
[05:35] really detailed
[05:37] on overall dog raising advice including
[05:39] a lot of training too
[05:40] i'll have links to both of these in the
[05:42] description below so i talked about a
[05:43] little while ago how we have the tether
[05:45] here as
[05:46] a way to control her yet still give her
[05:49] some level of freedom out here in the
[05:50] main part of the house
[05:52] over the crate for example this is
[05:53] another way that we contain her she's
[05:54] been sleeping here overnight
[05:56] obviously this is all going towards a
[05:58] specific goal of being able to have her
[06:01] just be good
[06:02] and exist within the house without being
[06:04] controlled at all at some
[06:06] point here but i do want to give you an
[06:07] update on crate training because you
[06:09] might remember in early episodes i told
[06:10] you how it was important to get your dog
[06:12] to be accepting
[06:13] and to really enjoy being in the crate
[06:16] so i want to show you where we are on
[06:17] that
[06:18] all right oh i bet you're gonna like
[06:20] these little duckies
[06:22] you give me a sit thank you yes
[06:26] okay good job so at no point am i
[06:28] forcing kona to go in the crate at all i
[06:31] mean
[06:31] every time i come up to the crate so far
[06:34] i've been throwing treats in there
[06:35] to get her to voluntarily go in and out
[06:38] kona come on
[06:39] good job and then go back in so you can
[06:42] see she's very willingly
[06:43] going in there and then if i wanted to
[06:45] close the gate i could do so like this
[06:48] and i could say kona can you sit good
[06:51] job
[06:52] you're seeing no real obvious signs of
[06:54] stress or
[06:55] hating the fact that she's in there she
[06:57] seems to enjoy it pretty well
[06:59] can you lie down
[07:04] yes just let him think about it in those
[07:06] instances
[07:08] good girl i don't want her rushing out
[07:10] of that gate that's because we don't
[07:11] want her rushing out you never know
[07:12] what's going on out here maybe it's not
[07:14] appropriate
[07:15] to rush out of the crate okay good job
[07:18] so you can see she's really showing the
[07:19] willingness to stay in the crate until i
[07:21] give her
[07:22] permission to come out and when i tell
[07:23] you i've never forced her in here i'm
[07:25] talking about zero percent of the time
[07:27] once you do that it's not that your dog
[07:29] won't be able to recover you'll be able
[07:30] to eventually get them to go
[07:32] involuntarily if you've already made
[07:33] that mistake it's a common one
[07:35] but if you can just have the discipline
[07:37] to have treats available so that every
[07:39] time it's time to go in the crate
[07:40] you're prepared to take a second to
[07:42] encourage them to go in
[07:44] you know you can even use their food or
[07:46] their kibble of course whatever it takes
[07:48] to get them
[07:49] to go in there go
[07:52] close make sure she's comfortable
[07:56] and wait
[08:04] how about that stay huh looking really
[08:06] good
[08:08] okay come on girl kona
[08:11] what's this hey i got a treat right here
[08:15] you know
[08:15] good job girl nice so that's an update
[08:18] on crate training all this is going
[08:20] really well
[08:20] today's day 12 of having her and you can
[08:23] see she's really starting to come around
[08:25] on a ton of her basics
[08:26] it's amazing what a dog can learn in
[08:28] such a short period of time isn't it so
[08:30] i just got a question
[08:31] actually right as we're shooting that i
[08:32] think is worthy of addressing right now
[08:34] someone asked me if i was against board
[08:37] in trains that's where a dog trainer
[08:39] takes on a dog
[08:40] tries to get them trained for their new
[08:41] family and so on kind of what we're
[08:43] doing here
[08:43] with kona i'm definitely not against
[08:46] boarding trains what i am against though
[08:48] is people dropping their dog off to a
[08:50] dog trainer and hoping that that's going
[08:52] to fix the dog and now the dog is
[08:54] programmed and will be
[08:55] robotic and well-behaved for eternity i
[08:57] mean i think that's the impression a lot
[08:59] of people have
[09:00] when they drop their dog off for a few
[09:02] weeks with the dog trainer you're still
[09:04] going to have to put in the work with
[09:05] your dog maybe the trainer
[09:06] got you started and got things going but
[09:09] there's still a lot of work to do and
[09:11] that's true with kona too i mean she'll
[09:13] learn this stuff
[09:14] but if for some reason her family
[09:15] started just shoving her in the crate
[09:17] when they were frustrated which they
[09:18] wouldn't do
[09:19] i know them well she would very likely
[09:21] start to have a relapse and be like i
[09:22] don't know about that
[09:23] if they weren't consistent about working
[09:26] with her on her basics like
[09:27] sit down and stay and being very
[09:29] consistent about taking her out with
[09:30] potty training we could expect relapses
[09:32] completely on
[09:34] everything so no magic answer board and
[09:36] trains can be good but just have
[09:37] realistic expectations should you ever
[09:39] decide to do that really good question
[09:41] from
[09:41] instagram make sure you guys are
[09:42] following us over there now
[09:44] tooth brushing that can be the nemesis
[09:47] of many dogs
[09:48] i don't think kona is too used to tooth
[09:50] brushing right now she's obviously in a
[09:52] good mood i want to keep it that way
[09:54] but i think she thinks this is a toy
[09:56] which it is not this is not a toy
[09:58] this is to keep your teeth clean it's a
[10:00] good idea to brush your dog's teeth as
[10:02] often as you reasonably can
[10:04] once a day is ideal so she seems pretty
[10:06] comfortable with it that's that much i'm
[10:08] happy of now
[10:09] we have to get her happy with me
[10:10] touching her gums there we've been
[10:12] working a little bit on that
[10:13] because we want to be able to expose
[10:14] those teeth so that we can brush them at
[10:16] some point
[10:17] and again for this training lesson i'm
[10:18] not even focused on actually brushing
[10:20] her teeth
[10:21] as much as i am just getting her
[10:23] comfortable with the brush but we'll see
[10:24] how far we get
[10:25] yes good right there she let me lift up
[10:28] that gum i like that a lot
[10:32] so see that yes
[10:36] good i like that not pushing her i'm
[10:38] going really slow here
[10:43] oops little yes back it away a little
[10:46] but let's keep it upbeat there
[10:51] yes good girl
[10:54] i mean this is good the way she's
[10:55] reacting right now
[10:58] yes she's reacting so well you guys
[11:00] notice i'm not pushing her to failure
[11:02] i'm not just like going and going i'm
[11:04] just really trying to get in a couple
[11:06] here a couple there
[11:08] yes good if you notice your dog is
[11:11] pulling away a lot that probably means
[11:13] you're moving too fast
[11:14] for this exercise let's try the rear
[11:16] teeth and see what happens
[11:21] yeah wow did you hear that it was like
[11:23] stroke stroke stroke
[11:25] pretty awesome stick with the back here
[11:27] this is the kind of thing you build on
[11:28] you spend 30 seconds a minute at a time
[11:31] doing this
[11:32] over the first few weeks you have a dog
[11:33] really ease them into it it is well
[11:35] worth taking your time to get them
[11:37] used to tooth brushing and we want them
[11:40] to enjoy it
[11:41] as kona seems to be doing so right now
[11:44] we're obviously having a play biting
[11:46] episode she's really
[11:48] ouch feeling eager look at that i mean
[11:51] ouch she's into it um
[11:54] but we want to discourage that i
[11:56] definitely young lady and
[11:58] i mean she just wants to play she
[12:00] doesn't understand that
[12:01] this can be painful what is it with you
[12:03] puppies always trying to get my shoes
[12:05] so remember with play biting we have a
[12:07] couple of choices so in this
[12:09] case i'm going to ask her to do
[12:11] something incompatible
[12:12] with biting doing a down stay
[12:16] because really when your dog is biting
[12:17] you like that they're really just saying
[12:18] i want to play i want to interact let's
[12:20] do something you're being
[12:21] boring that's why it's important to try
[12:24] to engage them now you can't always do
[12:26] that and when you can't engage them
[12:27] you're like look you got too much energy
[12:29] it's time to put you up you can go right
[12:31] in there goodbye
[12:34] of course you don't want to do that as
[12:35] your default method because
[12:37] it'll just get worse over time if your
[12:38] dog isn't getting lots of attention and
[12:40] training wait
[12:43] okay good girl and sit lie down
[12:49] good stay
[12:52] and stay
[12:55] leave it look at me yes
[13:00] good job that's just a mini example of
[13:03] dealing with play biting another thing
[13:04] you could do is you could say all right
[13:05] you want to bite i'll give you something
[13:07] to bite on and break out that toy
[13:09] and use that to keep them engaged maybe
[13:11] use that to refine your tug and let go
[13:13] but i should say
[13:14] you know it's okay for dogs to mouth and
[13:17] be a little bitey
[13:18] the main thing we want to teach them at
[13:20] this age is not to break our skin and
[13:21] not to bite so hard
[13:23] that it hurts i mean they have to know
[13:24] the proper pressure with which to bite
[13:26] so
[13:27] you may even want to consider while
[13:28] they're being a puppy when they are
[13:29] biting soft or when they're licking be
[13:31] tolerant of that and in fact maybe
[13:33] encourage it just a little bit
[13:34] so that they understand that okay you
[13:36] can use your mouth like that but you
[13:38] can't use it to chomp down you
[13:39] definitely have to be consistent on this
[13:41] one
[13:42] for many weeks your idea is to slowly
[13:45] reduce it over time
[13:46] not eliminate it all at once in short
[13:49] though you have three ways to deal with
[13:51] puppy biting you can
[13:52] transition into a training session by
[13:54] breaking out the treats asking them to
[13:55] do something incompatible with biting
[13:57] you can break out a toy
[13:59] encourage them to bite but bite on the
[14:00] correct thing and make a game of it
[14:02] perhaps get them extra stimulated
[14:04] mentally and physically
[14:06] or if you just don't have time at that
[14:07] particular moment you can put them up in
[14:09] their crate or other area where they're
[14:11] comfortable
[14:11] and just have them take a timeout for
[14:13] about a minute or two then bring them
[14:14] back out and resume
[14:15] so that's all there is to it okay you're
[14:17] not gonna bite me anymore right kona
[14:19] ow
[14:23] the last time we introduced the brush to
[14:24] her we were really methodical we
[14:26] do a gentle stroke like that give her a
[14:29] treat
[14:30] let her smell it know what it's about so
[14:32] we can also
[14:34] maybe let her nibble on these look at
[14:36] that look at this
[14:38] yes so here i've got a treat in my hand
[14:42] and that's keeping her kind of
[14:44] stationary and she's reacting
[14:46] really well to the brushing here look at
[14:49] that look at that
[14:50] beautiful hair of hers let's get that
[14:53] head she's even doing well with her head
[14:55] and her ears look at that
[15:00] so she's adjusting very well
[15:04] let's get those paws love these paws
[15:09] get those tail feathers look at that
[15:12] skinny little tail
[15:13] there's no hair on that tail there's
[15:15] nothing to brush so she's doing really
[15:16] well and brushing and that's an update
[15:18] on that
[15:18] i mean kona is doing so well today so i
[15:20] don't know why we shouldn't keep going
[15:22] this is a dremel right here this is to
[15:24] trim her nails
[15:25] and this can freak a lot of dogs out so
[15:27] we want to do our best to be careful
[15:29] so i'm going to hold it at a distance
[15:32] and then turn it off it was only on for
[15:34] just a quick second
[15:36] we don't want her to have time to be
[15:37] like oh my gosh that thing's crazy we
[15:39] wanted to hear
[15:40] oh that went on i got a treat cool
[15:45] look at that yes good girl
[15:51] what is that
[15:54] girl nice job and now we don't just want
[15:57] to turn it on and
[15:58] trim her nails remember we want to make
[16:00] sure she's comfortable with her feet
[16:02] being touched we've been working on that
[16:03] a little bit so she's quite comfortable
[16:05] with that
[16:05] so then we want her comfortable with us
[16:08] touching it to her feet and there's a
[16:11] nail so we're just trying to work up to
[16:13] it
[16:13] and we would just touch it right there
[16:15] good girl yes
[16:17] gonna put it on low now
[16:20] so she doesn't appear scared of it or
[16:21] anything that's good
[16:24] can you lie down kona
[16:29] sit lie down
[16:34] yes she's got a little weird there so
[16:36] let me go ahead and
[16:37] keep things locating and hey come here
[16:41] can you sit
[16:45] lie down yes
[16:51] weird oh that thing is weird huh
[16:56] come here then turn it off it's getting
[16:59] a little apprehensive
[17:00] it's normal so when your dog acts like
[17:02] that we'll just take a step back
[17:04] sit
[17:07] lie down yes reward for something easy
[17:10] like lie down
[17:12] do that here you go
[17:15] yes so that time she didn't back away so
[17:18] we're
[17:18] regaining that trust a little yes
[17:22] i want to try something a little bit
[17:24] different since she's getting a little
[17:26] a little apprehensive she likes a chew
[17:28] that came with her pup box here so let
[17:29] me see something sit
[17:32] stay
[17:39] yes good girl
[17:44] yes good girl so that's a good place to
[17:47] stop right there but
[17:48] i thought that by giving her something
[17:50] that was really likely to keep her
[17:51] attention there it might make the
[17:52] process a little smoother i'm happy to
[17:54] get a really good example of
[17:56] trimming one or two nails there and with
[17:58] your own dog don't be in a hurry at all
[18:00] there's no rush to get their
[18:01] nails done immediately or anything it's
[18:02] important to really get them comfortable
[18:04] with it because if you just go out of
[18:05] your way to get your dog comfortable
[18:06] with something they're a lot more likely
[18:08] to be tolerant of it lifelong
[18:10] try to keep your mind focused on the big
[18:12] picture when you're raising a puppy well
[18:14] it's been a minute since we have done a
[18:16] check-in
[18:16] on kona's fetch abilities so i think we
[18:19] should check in and see how she's doing
[18:21] on that and see if we can troubleshoot
[18:22] see if we're encountering any issues
[18:24] and hopefully improve her overall fetch
[18:26] game remember the first step of teaching
[18:28] fetch is tug of war we talked about that
[18:30] before with her so ideally you want to
[18:32] teach this whole game of fetch in
[18:33] reverse so it starts with tug of war
[18:36] really getting them into it then let go
[18:38] the way we teach let go is by simply
[18:40] making the toy boring
[18:41] yes good and then we get all excited
[18:44] again
[18:44] and then throw it and then run from them
[18:47] to get them to chase us come on girl
[18:49] there we go and then once they get back
[18:52] to you repeat the process
[18:53] let them know hey this is fun
[18:57] good tug all right let go
[19:01] yes go perfect
[19:05] good girl so you can see how wild she is
[19:07] i mean fetch is a great way to
[19:09] curb a lot of hyperactive behaviors and
[19:11] her tug is looking good
[19:13] can you let go
[19:16] still struggling a bit with let go
[19:19] yes good ready go get it
[19:22] i'm gonna toss the toy good girl come on
[19:25] good girl and see how she's running back
[19:27] to me dogs really like
[19:29] tug i mean you can use it as a reward
[19:31] and to keep the game very exciting
[19:33] don't think of tug of war as your dog
[19:35] trying to keep something from you this
[19:36] is a gratifying game
[19:38] they're happy to let go as long as you
[19:40] go through the effort of teaching them
[19:41] to let go so over time you're really
[19:42] teaching your dog that when they let go
[19:44] during a game of tug of war that the fun
[19:46] game continues on i mean think about it
[19:48] a lot of people just assume you should
[19:50] throw the toy first
[19:51] and then hope your dog just kind of
[19:53] figures out that they're supposed to
[19:54] pick it up and bring it back
[19:55] as you can see that doesn't go so well
[19:57] all the time so that's why it's
[19:58] important to teach your dog to play tug
[20:00] of war and let go
[20:01] and then maybe fetch at really short
[20:03] distances fetch is a really good way to
[20:06] satisfy your dog mentally and physically
[20:07] so that's why you see us doing it so
[20:09] often
[20:10] in these videos and take your time
[20:11] understand a perfect fluid game of fetch
[20:13] can take a little while to perfect
[20:15] anywhere between a few weeks and a few
[20:16] months depending on how serious you are
[20:18] about training it how often you can get
[20:20] to training so at first she was a little
[20:21] reluctant
[20:22] now she's really coming around nice work
[20:25] that's just looking great look at that
[20:27] run
[20:27] our pup box came in very handy today get
[20:30] 50
[20:30] off of your first putt box when you sign
[20:32] up for a 360 or 12 month subscription

[20:47] in the next episode where kona
[20:49] is definitely not gonna bite me one time
[20:52] and she's gonna be perfect from here on

[01:31] see how this day of trading with kona
[01:33] is going to go wish me luck good morning
[01:38] youtube how are you just woke up
[01:41] and first thing i've got to do is take
[01:44] this beautiful lady
[01:46] outside so it's like you know 7 a.m ish
[01:50] i'll let them out to go potty here i'll
[01:52] give them a little bit of time to have
[01:54] some
[01:54] fresh air and we will get started with
[01:57] our day
[01:57] and hopefully it'll be an interesting
[01:59] day where we can make a lot of progress
[02:01] and hopefully kona will continue on her
[02:03] amazing trajectory
[02:05] of rapid progress so there's number two
[02:08] this is good the dogs are extra wired
[02:11] this morning and ready to go
[02:14] all right so check this out because
[02:15] she's barking this is this is something
[02:17] we don't
[02:18] really do excessive working i mean
[02:27] making high-pitched sounds of course
[02:28] inertia comes running good girl kona
[02:31] all right so now that they've had their
[02:32] break i'm gonna put her back in the
[02:34] crate i'm gonna go get ready and we're
[02:36] gonna get started with our day
[02:38] oh i know you you do you do have a clue
[02:41] don't you
[02:42] come on can you get in your crate
[02:45] you still want some assistance with
[02:47] getting in your crate huh
[02:49] it's fine with me as long as you go in
[02:51] voluntarily
[02:53] see how she's not trying to get out too
[02:55] i like that a lot
[02:57] being much more accepting of her crate
[03:01] all right getting camera ready here
[03:05] just for you guys all right so i've
[03:08] gotten ready you can see she's
[03:10] really ready to get outside ready to
[03:12] come out
[03:14] wait oh struggling with that weight this
[03:17] morning
[03:18] isn't she
[03:28] a little tougher to summon the
[03:29] discipline here first thing
[03:34] okay good girl stay
[03:40] okay okay good girl so even though
[03:43] they've already been out this morning to
[03:44] do their business it's a little bit
[03:46] later now
[03:46] i want them to just kind of get some
[03:48] fresh air walk around
[03:50] they've got to relieve themselves
[03:51] further as kona is doing right now
[03:53] that's fine as well
[03:54] this is a good way for kona to start her
[03:55] day just to romp around with another dog
[03:57] if possible or if you didn't have
[03:59] another dog you could get out there and
[04:00] play with them maybe
[04:01] do some fetch we may do some of that
[04:02] later as well she's had a good night's
[04:04] sleep it's just a really good
[04:05] opportunity for her to calibrate to
[04:07] today
[04:08] and get in a good mood indy you want to
[04:10] come out you just want to stand there
[04:11] watch
[04:12] indy just likes to have her own time
[04:13] she's like when those crazy young dogs
[04:15] settle down i might come
[04:16] out inertia really seems to be enjoying
[04:19] kona for the most part
[04:20] she's getting a little rougher in her uh
[04:22] play and corrections look at that
[04:24] you see this look at those teeth man
[04:26] inertia i understand though conan is a
[04:28] little obnoxious huh just think back to
[04:30] the first day when they first met and
[04:31] how nervous
[04:32] kona was she was like i don't know about
[04:35] this and now
[04:36] if anything a nurse is like man you come
[04:39] on strong leave me alone it's kind of
[04:41] funny to see
[04:42] that role reversal nonetheless this is
[04:44] really good interaction for both dogs to
[04:45] have with each other i mean kona being
[04:47] so young
[04:48] getting these social skills in with a
[04:49] slightly older dog and inertia who's
[04:51] only 18 months old hasn't played with
[04:53] every dog in the world or anything so
[04:54] it's yet
[04:55] another good experience for her to get
[04:57] social time in with a puppy so it's all
[04:59] good i'm loving it i'll probably sit out
[05:00] here for at least 20 minutes with them
[05:02] just to let them really adjust to the
[05:04] day kind of calm down get that initial
[05:06] layer of curiosity out of their system
[05:08] if you spend too much time indoors with
[05:10] a dog they are going to be extra excited
[05:13] in many cases at least when you go
[05:14] outside and it's going to be really
[05:16] challenging to communicate with them
[05:18] it's as though inertia has detected that
[05:20] kona is growing like three inches a day
[05:23] and it's just trying to stay on top of
[05:24] her to make sure she can still win these
[05:26] play battles
[05:26] because it's getting harder every day
[05:28] for inertia you can see i mean kona is
[05:30] just
[05:31] gripping her skin and inertia's being
[05:33] super tolerant inertia you're allowed to
[05:35] knit better you know measured
[05:36] corrections are something that conor
[05:38] probably needs a little bit more of
[05:39] last night tona was going up to indiana
[05:41] who isn't quite so accepting of this
[05:44] youthful behavior and gave kona a really
[05:46] good
[05:47] measured correction we just happened to
[05:48] catch it on video which is nice
[05:54] conan responded really well she backed
[05:56] off and even though she started barking
[05:58] she wasn't being quite as physical with
[06:00] indy so she seemed to get the point
[06:02] that kind of communication between dogs
[06:04] is wonderful
[06:05] a lot of people will use the logic that
[06:07] you know a dog might forcefully correct
[06:08] another dog and nip at them or something
[06:10] like that and a lot of humans
[06:12] have taken that to mean that oh well
[06:14] that means
[06:15] we should use force on dogs in order to
[06:17] get them to comply but
[06:18] i want you to keep in mind that we are
[06:20] human beings we're a little bit smarter
[06:22] than these guys
[06:23] and we've come up with more effective
[06:25] ways that really keep training fun and
[06:27] enjoyable for dogs that don't require us
[06:30] to be overly physical and primitive with
[06:31] them but as far as dog to dog
[06:33] corrections go those social skills are
[06:34] quite important
[06:35] this is an area where kona has been
[06:37] coming over here and kind of digging
[06:39] away
[06:39] at the dirt it's the only spot i've seen
[06:41] so far where she's done that and i've
[06:43] been trying to intervene but she's quite
[06:45] fascinated by this particular soil over
[06:47] here
[06:47] i'm a little extra tolerant to puppy
[06:49] digging because they're learning how to
[06:50] use their paws and dig at the world and
[06:52] explore it but the digging can really be
[06:53] a habit that gets out of control so
[06:55] you'll want to
[06:56] redirect them consistently so in this
[06:58] case i'll redirect her and say kona come
[06:59] on over here girl
[07:01] and get her to go away and get her mind
[07:03] on something else like
[07:04] inertia or whatever puppies think about
[07:07] what do puppies think about and so this
[07:10] is a real part of starting the day
[07:12] just getting a dog mentally right
[07:13] getting them mentally satisfied that
[07:15] they've gotten to do some stuff on their
[07:17] own before we put them in school
[07:18] and ask them to do certain behaviors in
[07:21] certain places
[07:22] kona leave it yes good girl
[07:25] nice real life leave it and i've got
[07:27] trees out here just on standby you know
[07:29] i mean you can get multiple bags of
[07:31] treats and
[07:32] have them all over pupford has such a
[07:34] variety of different treats these are
[07:36] freeze-dried sweet potatoes kona
[07:38] loves them as you can see easy
[07:41] don't see the jumping is getting better
[07:44] but that was a good example over there
[07:45] yes she's pretty good if i'm sitting
[07:48] still but if i'm moving she's like i
[07:50] want to jump all over you
[07:52] so the idea is to intervene before that
[07:54] before the jumping occurs and she's so
[07:56] predictable i mean she's a puppy you can
[07:57] read these guys like a book
[07:59] there you go look at that nice work okay
[08:02] come
[08:03] and get in your crate
[08:06] a little confused all right let's give
[08:07] her a little bit of help
[08:10] there we go one kibble does it yes
[08:13] staying in there gets her her entire
[08:15] meal there
[08:16] i think it's a really good idea just ask
[08:18] your dog to do two or three easy things
[08:20] when you're gonna feed them in the
[08:21] morning
[08:21] maybe later in the day you might
[08:22] consider doing a whole training session
[08:24] out of a meal
[08:25] so today before we go out i'm going to
[08:28] put a variety of different treats in my
[08:30] pouch i like to mix it up just to keep
[08:32] her guessing and
[08:33] you know just like people sometimes
[08:35] she's more in the mood for meat
[08:37] sometimes she's more in the mood for
[08:38] potatoes right and if you're like me
[08:40] sometimes you're just in the mood for
[08:41] both
[08:42] so she doesn't know how to hop into the
[08:43] crate that we have back here
[08:45] in the car yet so i'm going to give her
[08:46] a little bit of encouragement
[08:48] come here let's see do you want to hop
[08:49] up here what's this yes
[08:52] good girl
[08:56] a little awkward for her to hop in there
[08:58] which is fine but i do want to put some
[08:59] treats in there
[09:00] that ought to encourage her to walk
[09:01] right in which i appreciate
[09:04] and now we're going to go into the real
[09:05] world and see how puppy training goes
[09:08] so kona is loaded up i want you to
[09:10] notice how quiet she's being right now
[09:12] she's chilling out which is really good
[09:14] so we're headed out to a place called
[09:16] ottoman park right now it's an iconic
[09:18] place in new orleans it's a great place
[09:20] to train a dog so yesterday when we took
[09:23] her to the park she
[09:24] whined and cried quite a bit and i did
[09:26] my best to condition her by giving her
[09:28] treats when she was quiet and trying to
[09:30] alleviate the stress by giving her
[09:32] something that she liked but today
[09:34] no whining right no no yeah so far i
[09:37] mean we still have to go home but we'll
[09:38] see
[09:38] this just suggests to me that she's
[09:40] really adjusting well to everything
[09:42] all right let's let her out okay come on
[09:44] i'm gonna definitely secure that harness
[09:47] with my hand
[09:48] and then make sure i definitely secure
[09:49] her i want to be so extra safe
[09:51] it is 100 our responsibility to keep
[09:55] control of our dogs in public that's why
[09:57] you'll often see me with a leash clip to
[09:59] me
[10:00] i don't know how long this can last but
[10:02] i love how she is on leash
[10:04] why couldn't i get inertia to do this
[10:06] kona
[10:08] what's this yes
[10:11] this is a nice house and apparently kona
[10:15] feels right at home here she's got good
[10:17] taste
[10:19] sometimes puppies will do this though
[10:20] right they'll just lie down
[10:22] so maybe i can inspire her to continue
[10:25] on with the walk let's give it a shot
[10:27] here
[10:28] kona come on yes
[10:32] i'm gonna offer her a treat let's see if
[10:34] she'll take a treat i don't know
[10:36] what's this no
[10:40] right there i just wanted to test i see
[10:42] she's not receptive to taking treats
[10:44] right now
[10:45] and honestly my primary science
[10:47] objective for this particular
[10:49] training session is to give her exposure
[10:52] to new environments
[10:53] we were at another park recently but
[10:55] this is a completely different
[10:56] park in a dog's case it's not really a
[10:58] matter of if you've seen one you've seen
[11:00] them all
[11:01] every one is kind of a completely new
[11:03] world to them so in the long run
[11:05] at some point you do hope that they
[11:07] start to
[11:08] generalize and act normally
[11:11] at a variety of different parks but the
[11:13] way we ensure that is by showing them
[11:15] lots of parks often
[11:17] good job okay we've got some barking
[11:19] dogs over here
[11:20] i'm gonna bring her off to the side just
[11:23] to give her some room we have a lot of
[11:25] dogs
[11:25] coming up over here easy
[11:29] that's very good
[11:32] hey nice job girl isn't that cool that's
[11:35] a dog
[11:36] it's good for dogs to get desensitized
[11:37] to audio like this here we have a
[11:39] chainsaw going off back here they're
[11:40] doing some tree work
[11:42] i mean she notices that and if she
[11:44] notices it while in a relaxed
[11:46] calm state of mind even better i'm also
[11:49] happy to let kona take breaks along the
[11:51] way she's still very young
[11:52] so it's beneficial for her to take two
[11:54] five ten minute breaks here and there
[11:56] it's just great that she's able to
[11:58] absorb everything that's going on around
[11:59] her we've got fast-moving people
[12:01] we have chainsaws we have people on
[12:04] devices with two wheels that they're
[12:06] pedaling and she's just looking at it
[12:08] all
[12:08] i mean if you really look into her eyes
[12:10] right now you can just really get a
[12:12] sense
[12:13] that she's captivated by these things
[12:15] around her she's doing so well i'm gonna
[12:17] bring her a little bit closer and let's
[12:19] do some screen saver training over here
[12:21] the reason i like to select a place like
[12:23] this is because you get pretty
[12:24] significant and heavy distractions
[12:26] at close range if you want them there or
[12:28] you can get far away and let your dog
[12:30] take in those distractions from a
[12:32] distance and then if you want to kick
[12:33] the distraction level up one more notch
[12:35] you cross this path
[12:36] and we have lots of birds she's been
[12:38] doing really well with her bird
[12:39] desensitization which is so important
[12:42] in this part of the world because
[12:43] they're everywhere you see how wonderful
[12:45] a place like this can be for a young dog
[12:47] who's extra sensitive
[12:49] to new things believe it or not this
[12:51] relaxed calm behavior right here
[12:54] is absolutely perfect for an environment
[12:56] like this because
[12:57] this tells us she can take in
[12:59] distractions while in a relaxed state of
[13:01] mind meaning she can just chill out
[13:04] kona look at me
[13:07] come yes
[13:11] good even with a bike riding by i gotta
[13:14] sit on the first request
[13:16] and okay there's a
[13:20] fast-moving dog yeah
[13:23] i don't know rollerblades what
[13:26] why don't we go walk past the birds and
[13:28] just verify that she is
[13:30] going to act acceptably i think we'll
[13:32] just pass by over here
[13:35] a little distracted come on kona
[13:39] going to gently encourage her to keep
[13:41] moving didn't have to do much
[13:43] encouragement
[13:47] look at that i'm just gonna give her
[13:49] some space here
[13:51] she looked at him and now she's back to
[13:53] just looking around
[13:54] everything she encounters she's like i
[13:56] guess this is just normal stuff this
[13:58] world just keeps throwing all sorts of
[13:59] weird things out there and the way she
[14:00] responds to them has just been really
[14:02] favorable look at how close she is to
[14:04] the bird
[14:05] and she's not chasing the bird that's so
[14:08] far again i need to say so far and
[14:10] everything
[14:10] good girl yes kona good
[14:14] she offered attention there so i decided
[14:16] to seize on the opportunity and call her
[14:18] over to me
[14:19] it was a good opportunity to get some
[14:20] compliance around something that is
[14:22] potentially distracting
[14:24] squirrel you can see her body language
[14:26] is now pretty alert i don't want to over
[14:28] excite her by getting too close to the
[14:29] squirrel but we'll let her look at it
[14:30] bree often jokes that
[14:32] squirrels are just designed dog toys
[14:35] they're little fluffy tails that wiggle
[14:37] so abruptly i put a long lead on kona i
[14:39] thought i might see if she wanted to do
[14:41] some free play here or even play a game
[14:43] of fetch what do you think let's see if
[14:44] we can give her an outlet that's more
[14:46] acceptable than chasing squirrels
[14:51] she goes a little half-heartedly but
[14:55] that's fine she may not be in the mood
[14:57] for fetch right now i guess we can test
[14:59] a frisbee
[15:05] what's all this stuff kona
[15:09] kona come
[15:13] yes good girl very good
[15:16] i definitely want to practice come when
[15:17] called out here in this setting
[15:20] got a dog over here come
[15:23] good look at that that is
[15:26] nice nice work gonna sit
[15:34] yes rather than repeat sit sit sit you
[15:38] know give them a chance to think about
[15:39] it they're young
[15:41] okay good girl kona
[15:45] come yes her recall
[15:49] is just getting better and better all
[15:50] the time
[15:54] kona come good
[15:57] sit lie down
[16:02] yes very good she's got it
[16:06] she's already getting an audience let's
[16:07] see if we can have a breakthrough on
[16:09] rollover
[16:11] rollover yes very good
[16:14] let's see if i can get her to go yes
[16:19] good sit lie down
[16:25] yes good now i got what i asked for that
[16:28] is a breakthrough
[16:29] on that one example i had to do an
[16:32] obvious lure in a
[16:33] less obvious way so that was cool
[16:37] yes good girl
[16:40] yes fun and let's try one more i'm just
[16:44] trying to get a bunch of reps in while
[16:46] she's doing so well right now
[16:48] yes there you go i mean that was her
[16:50] best rollover of all time
[16:52] right there good girl you're so great
[16:55] and at no point so far has she attempted
[16:57] to
[16:57] lunge or bark or anything doesn't mean
[17:00] she won't though i'm not gonna let my
[17:01] guard down i don't ever trust you
[17:03] puppies
[17:04] ah let go look at me
[17:07] yes my logic there to get her to leave
[17:10] the pine straw loan was to get her to
[17:12] look at me voluntarily and if you're
[17:14] feeling really brave
[17:16] and you want to really tackle this
[17:17] head-on get a handful of debris maybe
[17:20] leave it look at me yes
[17:24] give it movement movement's more
[17:26] distracting for dogs and
[17:28] stuff that stays still leave it
[17:32] kona yes perfect
[17:35] that was yet another really great way to
[17:38] practice here
[17:38] dogs walking by multiple distractions at
[17:41] different ranges from her and still
[17:43] being able to get that attention
[17:44] i'm now going to try and because she's
[17:47] fixated on these people walking by i'm
[17:48] going to try and get her to
[17:49] come this way kona come
[17:53] yes that just really verifies me that
[17:55] she's interested in something
[17:56] and that i can semi reliably get her
[17:58] attention off that thing and on to me so
[18:00] that i can
[18:01] direct her and guide her okay come on
[18:03] let's go home
[18:05] there's a squirrel a crow an egret
[18:08] and you're just walking being a good
[18:11] girl what a pleasurable walk in the park
[18:13] it is with you today young lady
[18:14] oh easy kona come
[18:20] that's the closest thing to a lunge
[18:22] we've had kona
[18:27] come on yes oh i lost her i wasn't able
[18:31] to get her to come to me i'm still going
[18:32] to try but
[18:33] that happens sometimes i don't want to
[18:34] push her when she's in the state of mind
[18:36] i'd rather make it easier for her so
[18:37] hey kona sit look at me
[18:41] yes come come on
[18:45] come on let's go yes
[18:48] i was able to get her back there but
[18:50] you've got to be careful about the level
[18:52] of requests you throw at a dog when
[18:53] they're not yet prepared because you
[18:54] don't want to condition them to just
[18:56] ignore that time and time again if you
[18:58] called them and they didn't come to you
[18:59] they're like oh i guess that one must be
[19:00] optional so you want to keep those to a
[19:02] minimum but you can never know for sure
[19:03] if your dog is going to reply that's why
[19:05] you have to practice so much
[19:06] and try to reinforce and use requests
[19:09] like come and stay when you're
[19:11] reasonably confident they're going to do
[19:12] it when you catch them succeeding they
[19:14] learn oh that is how i live my best life
[19:16] big truck right here look at this it's a
[19:19] big dumpster moving do that
[19:23] wow see how she does
[19:28] come on okay that was really good
[19:32] you can hear how loud that is
[19:35] she reacted so appropriately
[19:39] really productive session here i think
[19:40] we can move on and continue with our day
[19:43] time to go home we're gonna put her back
[19:46] in the crate here
[19:47] throw some treats in give her something
[19:49] to look forward to so she walks in there
[19:51] so we're back home now
[19:53] kona is super excited i'm gonna go let
[19:56] her outside
[19:57] first thing because we've just been on
[19:59] the road for 20 minutes or so so may as
[20:01] well be extra careful since
[20:03] potty training is important here we are
[20:05] back in the backyard
[20:07] this is a really good place for the dogs
[20:08] to decompress and do their potty breaks
[20:10] and
[20:11] rump around if they decide to so to me
[20:13] this is like a transition
[20:14] time in the day where we just had a lot
[20:16] of stimulation a lot of playing a lot of
[20:19] checking out a new place
[20:20] practicing her training and now i really
[20:22] want her to just kind of rest and fall
[20:24] asleep
[20:25] and take a nap and since one of our
[20:26] objectives is to get her more
[20:27] comfortable with
[20:28] being in a house without having
[20:30] accidents i'm going to encourage her to
[20:33] take a nap outside of the crate this
[20:34] time or i suppose she could take a nap
[20:37] right there
[20:38] so i'm going to give her a second to see
[20:40] if she naturally relaxes i'm not even
[20:41] going to tell her to do anything
[20:45] oh goodness there's a screen there all
[20:47] part of the learning experience huh kona
[20:50] this is the spot where she often does
[20:52] settle down naturally i'm gonna see
[20:55] if she decides to lie down on the cold
[20:57] floor
[21:00] and she does see i'm getting to know her
[21:02] this is good
[21:03] as you get to know your dog they become
[21:05] pretty predictable don't they so i
[21:06] really like to go out of my way when i
[21:08] notice that she's going to likely be
[21:10] good outside of the crate
[21:11] let's really build that up and give her
[21:13] that experience of
[21:14] being good outside the crate i think
[21:16] with all the stimulation she's had today
[21:18] she's very likely to just pass out and
[21:20] relax for a few hours
[21:21] which means i can focus on getting me
[21:23] things done
[21:26] and as moments arise like this where she
[21:28] starts barking we have
[21:30] a vehicle in the back right there it's
[21:32] important to be able to snap into
[21:33] training mode when your dog does these
[21:35] these are called secondary training
[21:37] sessions
[21:38] and these will happen all the time okay
[21:42] i'm gonna try to get her attention kona
[21:43] come
[21:45] here yes good work sit
[21:48] lie down yes good job very good
[21:52] so you know a number of situations like
[21:54] that might arise where
[21:56] your dog gets focused on something and
[21:57] has an outburst and you want to
[21:59] contain that inertia come
[22:04] good girl yes i like that you're being
[22:06] quiet
[22:08] i like that you came and i like that
[22:10] you're old and beautiful
[22:13] so now i've got to get her back into the
[22:15] subtle position
[22:16] inertia come inertia isn't helping
[22:18] matters she's being a little barky so
[22:20] i'm going to put her up too
[22:21] look at the irony i'm having to put
[22:23] inertia up in the crate
[22:25] and trying to give you time alone kona
[22:28] come
[22:32] settle
[22:36] good girl relax it's very good
[22:41] why can't you guys just be like indie i
[22:43] think order has been restored at least
[22:45] for
[22:45] the moment so that's good throughout the
[22:48] day you've seen us do a lot of primary
[22:49] training sessions that's where i'm being
[22:51] very deliberate about the things that
[22:52] i'm training for example we worked on
[22:54] rollover
[22:55] and we worked on and stay and
[22:58] general
[22:58] obedience out at the park but here was
[23:00] an unplanned training session the dogs
[23:02] got thrown off we had an outburst of
[23:05] barking
[23:05] and we had to address that to try to
[23:08] show them how to behave in the moment
[23:09] we call those secondary training
[23:11] sessions so the lesson here is know the
[23:12] difference between your primary training
[23:14] sessions
[23:15] and your secondary training sessions so
[23:18] she's had a good
[23:19] long nap and she has slept every second
[23:22] of
[23:23] i mean at least two or three hours i do
[23:25] want to point out too we're gonna let
[23:27] her out
[23:27] immediately right after she gets done
[23:29] with her nap because potty training is a
[23:30] major concern of ours so
[23:32] there we go
[23:38] yes let's go pee
[23:41] good job good start she may have to go
[23:45] again there just because your dog goes
[23:46] especially her just because she goes one
[23:48] time
[23:49] doesn't mean she's done sometimes we'll
[23:51] go two or three times out here
[23:52] so especially after a long nap like that
[23:55] i'm gonna give her ample opportunities
[23:56] to pee
[23:57] multiple times to poop to do all that
[23:59] fun stuff
[24:00] a lot of you will be wondering well how
[24:02] often are you supposed to let
[24:03] a puppy in potty training outside to to
[24:06] relieve themselves and the answer is
[24:08] if you have to ask it's probably time to
[24:10] let them out
[24:11] in other words i'd rather see you let
[24:13] them out way more times than they need
[24:15] to
[24:16] just to really make sure that they have
[24:18] ample opportunities
[24:19] i mean twice an hour easy for a puppy i
[24:22] would say if possible that doesn't count
[24:23] when they're sleeping
[24:24] taking their naps sleeping overnight but
[24:26] if they're up and thinking and
[24:28] playing they're probably also
[24:30] considering peeing or pooping in your
[24:31] house too so
[24:33] yeah that's the world i'm living in
[24:35] right now let's go inside and see if we
[24:37] can teach her a new trick i've got the
[24:39] perfect one in mind
[24:40] kona come
[24:44] yeah there you go love that come wind
[24:47] called
[24:47] looking good i want to teach her a new
[24:49] trick
[24:50] that she's actually on the right track
[24:52] except for the biting part i thought we
[24:54] had this under control
[24:56] seriously look at this let's redirect
[24:58] her into a sit
[25:00] good girl that's very good i do want to
[25:02] say before i teach this that remember
[25:04] the reason we teach tricks to
[25:06] ouch a puppy is so they have something
[25:08] to do other than bite you
[25:10] all the time no the real reason we teach
[25:12] tricks because
[25:13] it brings us closer together and we can
[25:16] learn so much more about one another
[25:18] so one thing i want to teach her is
[25:20] pause up
[25:22] taught great pause up is where your dog
[25:25] jumps up and rests their
[25:27] their paws on something of course that's
[25:28] not exactly how i want to do it
[25:30] kind of let's see if we can just lure
[25:32] her up here yes
[25:34] i want her paws to stay on my knee there
[25:36] yes
[25:38] yes yes
[25:41] okay good girl so right there i mean
[25:44] that was a really good first attempt
[25:46] and did you notice the rapid fire
[25:47] succession of three treats as she was
[25:49] maintaining the position
[25:51] we wouldn't always do that but sometimes
[25:53] getting in multiple
[25:54] tiny treats can be more effective than
[25:56] just giving them one and it may really
[25:58] help them understand the concept
[25:59] much better yes
[26:02] good work very good yes
[26:06] pause up is cute for posing for pictures
[26:10] or is a cute trick because you can teach
[26:12] them to probably do it on something like
[26:13] a chair i don't know let's see
[26:16] pause up stay
[26:20] okay good girl nice work
[26:25] pause up yes good
[26:28] and okay i'm letting her know it's over
[26:30] so she doesn't just wonder do i just
[26:32] stay up here forever
[26:33] or what she's trying to be very clear
[26:35] with her now
[26:36] some of you might be wondering if this
[26:38] is going to conflict with teaching or
[26:40] not to jump
[26:41] i'm not saying she might not experience
[26:42] a little bit of confusion but you ought
[26:44] to easily be able to work through that
[26:46] to me anything with permission is okay
[26:48] including jumping up on things assuming
[26:50] you give them permission to do so and
[26:51] this is a great way to build
[26:52] communication
[26:54] stay yes okay
[26:58] good girl i mean does she catch on
[26:59] instantly or what
[27:01] that went incredibly smoothly now let me
[27:03] show you why i
[27:05] personally wanted to teach that it's
[27:07] kind of a prerequisite to this next
[27:09] easy trick and i don't know how this is
[27:11] going to go we've not done it i want to
[27:12] teach you how to give me a hug
[27:13] get her attention with a treat that's a
[27:15] little awkward whoa
[27:17] yes okay good girl
[27:20] so similar thing right teaching her to
[27:23] put her
[27:23] paws on my shoulders it's a good
[27:25] opportunity to practice stay
[27:27] in a different way too stay
[27:31] gotta kind of contort yourself here we
[27:33] go
[27:34] stay yes oh yeah
[27:38] yes yes
[27:44] here yes okay good girl
[27:48] getting her attention over here i'm
[27:50] gonna go ahead and give her a reward for
[27:51] listening
[27:52] to the end of that request too which was
[27:54] basically get down
[27:56] here let's just stay
[28:01] i love my life okay good girl
[28:05] come on stay
[28:09] and i should mention you notice how my
[28:10] other dogs aren't present right now
[28:12] that's because i want to give kona
[28:14] a lot of one-on-one time during this
[28:15] particular training session right i
[28:17] don't want her to easily be
[28:18] distracted during training apparently my
[28:21] shoe is enough distraction
[28:23] and of itself she gets plenty of social
[28:25] time with the other dogs throughout the
[28:26] day in fact i'm about to do that right
[28:28] now but when i'm really focused
[28:30] on training her something new i want to
[28:31] keep the environment
[28:33] as easy as possible around her that's
[28:35] why we're doing it inside and not
[28:36] outside as she gets better we would
[28:38] graduate to the more challenging
[28:40] environment
[28:41] kona here yes
[28:44] thank you for looking at me when i asked
[28:46] for your attention i want to just check
[28:48] in on bao real quick
[28:51] yes yes
[28:56] stay okay come on almost almost
[29:00] yes yes
[29:04] yes okay good girl
[29:07] all right so you can see bao definitely
[29:10] coming along nicely and one of my
[29:11] favorite puppy tricks to teach
[29:13] it's so cute it's easier to teach than
[29:15] you might think i mean
[29:16] dogs are quite willing to go into that
[29:18] bowel position assuming you can get the
[29:20] lure right
[29:20] the hardest thing about it that was
[29:22] releasing them before they put their
[29:24] butt down so that's something i'm trying
[29:25] to get better at with her so believe it
[29:27] or not
[29:27] it's been many hours since she's had a
[29:29] play session with the dogs because
[29:32] she had her one-on-one time at the park
[29:33] we did some training here she's had a
[29:35] long nap
[29:36] so it's time for more recess and free
[29:38] time for her
[29:39] in general as long as i get those two
[29:41] main training sessions in a day where
[29:43] i'm teaching him something new
[29:44] then i really just want her to be a dog
[29:46] for the rest of the day so
[29:48] that's kind of my plan here letting her
[29:50] chill exist in the house
[29:51] play with the dogs and just casually
[29:53] exist because i don't want to overwhelm
[29:55] her you know
[29:56] it seems that that's where dogs really
[29:57] absorb all of these new things is in
[30:00] that down time
[30:01] so really walk that line finally with
[30:03] your own dog
[30:04] and be prepared to adjust accordingly so
[30:06] it's about time for bed conan's had a
[30:08] really
[30:09] nice active day more or less she's been
[30:11] pretty good about sleeping through the
[30:12] night
[30:13] the last four nights in a row or so it's
[30:15] time to go to bed
[30:17] yes nice job so she's getting into the
[30:20] routine and
[30:22] more importantly she's getting
[30:23] comfortable with being alone
[30:25] i can't emphasize that enough that's
[30:26] really my primary objective with her
[30:28] i'm gonna go to bed now i hope you guys
[30:30] have found this helpful
[30:32] seeing what a day in the life of
[30:33] training a puppy is like for me
[30:35] and as i said before every day is
[30:38] completely different every dog is
[30:39] completely different
[30:40] but i think you get the idea of the
[30:42] spirit of what we
[30:43] try to do when we're working with a dog

[00:02] you can see how she's like borderline
[00:03] can i really get her attention right now
[00:05] when she's frazzled like that
[00:06] i'm zach george i'm a dog trainer meet
[00:09] my new project
[00:10] kona i've got just three weeks to train
[00:12] her and set her up for the most
[00:13] well-behaved life possible that means i
[00:15] need to work on the most common puppy
[00:16] issues like potty training how to
[00:18] actually pay attention
[00:20] stopping things like play biting chewing
[00:22] separation anxiety
[00:23] getting along with other animals leash
[00:25] walking and teaching her everything a
[00:27] good dog needs to know
[00:28] real dog training doesn't always go
[00:30] smoothly and that's why i'm going to
[00:31] show you
[00:32] every success and mistake and how i work
[00:34] through all the most
[00:35] challenging parts of raising a new puppy
[00:38] welcome to your new puppy survival guide
[00:41] today i'm hoping to tackle some of the
[00:44] toughest
[00:45] puppy issues with kona the irish doodle
[00:47] for example kona definitely needs help
[00:50] on not
[00:50] digging and picking up potentially
[00:52] harmful things in our yard
[00:53] because with kona that's kind of out of
[00:55] control right now if i'm being honest
[00:57] come yeah
[01:01] good job i also really want to improve
[01:04] her leash walking skills especially in
[01:06] new places and we're going to work on
[01:07] some other stuff too
[01:09] i'm losing control of this series by the
[01:11] second
[01:12] things were going well in training i
[01:14] promise pop box is a very different kind
[01:15] of subscription monthly box
[01:17] they send you specific items and
[01:19] training advice based on your dog's
[01:22] specific age so it's all about training
[01:24] and raising your dog and getting through
[01:26] that first year of life with a new pup
[01:28] kona i need this to train you gosh let
[01:31] go
[01:32] thank you look at this these holy
[01:34] rollers are awesome right here this is a
[01:36] fun toy because it's kind of a hybrid
[01:37] between a tug toy there's a lot of give
[01:39] to it but it also serves as a great
[01:41] fetch toy
[01:42] i love this toy because it's a good
[01:44] squeaky toy
[01:45] but it's super tough you know oh and
[01:48] some venison
[01:48] jerky look at that that is quality stuff
[01:51] right there for training and of course
[01:52] the obligatory staple squeaky tennis
[01:55] ball
[01:55] kona you can't just steal things out of
[01:57] the box
[01:59] don't worry you'll get this later coda
[02:01] clearly likes the roasted beef steak i
[02:02] think that might be her favorite item
[02:04] ever
[02:04] if you need trading help like i
[02:06] obviously do right now get fifty percent
[02:08] off of your first pup box when you sign

[02:15] code
[02:15] zack link below i do want to address a
[02:18] question that a few of you have asked i
[02:19] think it's a really good question
[02:21] some of you have wondered well zack why
[02:23] aren't you using the clicker
[02:24] with kona during this series like you
[02:26] did with inertia for those of you that
[02:28] are new a clicker looks something like
[02:29] this
[02:30] it makes a clicking sound like that and
[02:32] we condition our dogs to understand that
[02:34] that sound means
[02:35] good dog i like what you just did here's
[02:37] something amazing
[02:38] in the hopes that that inspires them to
[02:40] want to repeat the behavior we just
[02:42] marked by clicking i don't think a
[02:44] clicker by any means is required for
[02:46] training a dog but it can be a great
[02:48] tool especially for beginners
[02:50] to really get their timing down and
[02:52] there's no harm in using a clicker
[02:54] at all i've opted to not use it in this
[02:56] series so far
[02:57] because i know it's an objection that a
[02:58] lot of people have when training their
[02:59] dog they feel like they're always going
[03:01] to need it so i wanted to show you that
[03:02] it's definitely not required
[03:04] for training a dog i got this clicker
[03:05] from doggone good clicker company you
[03:07] can look them up so let me show you how
[03:08] you can quickly and i mean
[03:10] quickly condition your dog to understand
[03:13] what the click
[03:13] means in this case it will mean good dog
[03:16] i like that
[03:17] you win an awesome treat i'm not gonna
[03:19] tell her to do a thing watch this
[03:21] i'm gonna click i'm gonna give her a
[03:24] piece of meat
[03:26] i'm gonna click i'm gonna give her a
[03:28] piece of meat
[03:29] now one thing i'm gonna be looking for
[03:31] over these next several clicks
[03:33] is an automatic sit in other words she's
[03:35] already equated hey when i sit
[03:37] or lie down i get a treat so i'll be
[03:39] looking for it to automatically do
[03:41] one of those things click
[03:44] treat see that's all i'm doing not
[03:45] asking her to do anything at this point
[03:49] there it is yep told you it was coming
[03:52] so that's a sign that they're making the
[03:54] connection that okay every time that
[03:56] click goes off
[03:56] i'ma get a treat
[04:00] good so in our case we've been saying
[04:02] yes and you might be wondering what's
[04:03] wrong with that
[04:04] nothing sometimes though the artificial
[04:06] sound of the clicker can be really
[04:08] catchy for a dog and it also
[04:10] gives you as the human a button in your
[04:12] hand to press the moment your dog does
[04:14] what you like let me give you an example
[04:16] of how you might use this
[04:17] in a day-to-day scenario so we would go
[04:19] sit
[04:21] for the treat the second her butt hit
[04:23] the ground we clicked
[04:25] for lie down we would click the moment
[04:29] she gets in that lie down position and
[04:31] follow it up with a tree now of course
[04:32] you can give some genuine heartfelt
[04:34] encouragement and praise here along the
[04:36] way
[04:37] let's see how that rollover is looking
[04:40] roll over yeah we're gonna teach her
[04:42] something brand new using the clicker in
[04:44] just a second so i can show you how that
[04:45] would look as well
[04:47] but for now what have we done we've
[04:48] conditioned her to the clicker we've
[04:50] clicked and given her a treat every time
[04:51] that we make the sound so she
[04:52] understands
[04:53] we've shown her that hey when you sit or
[04:56] comply with a request
[04:58] the clicker's going to go off and you're
[05:00] going to get a treat i'll take that
[05:02] love the compliance now it's important
[05:04] to remember what the clicker is not it's
[05:05] not a button
[05:06] to call your dog even though that may
[05:08] work we don't want to rely on that
[05:09] because
[05:10] it's going to quickly dilute the meaning
[05:12] of the clicker it's not a tool to signal
[05:14] your dog to do something in advance
[05:15] remember it happens when a behavior
[05:17] occurs not before behavior occurs
[05:19] now one trick that i've been wanting to
[05:21] teach her
[05:22] is crawl so we're gonna see how that
[05:24] goes this is another trick where we'll
[05:26] use luring
[05:27] yes oh she's already doing it you guys
[05:30] look at that look at that look at those
[05:32] legs in the back they're in the crawl
[05:33] position almost
[05:35] so we're just gonna lure her yes
[05:38] notice how i'm clicking like at any hint
[05:42] of the final motion i'm not asking her
[05:44] for a refined perfect crawl for five
[05:46] seconds before i click
[05:47] and reward if she shows me she's going a
[05:50] mill a step
[05:50] in the right direction i'm going to go
[05:52] ahead and click her and follow that up
[05:54] with a reward every time
[05:58] good and i'm you may not see it but i am
[06:00] releasing the treat after i click
[06:04] see that look at this how do you learn
[06:07] so
[06:07] fast lie down good go ahead and reward
[06:11] on the lie down there
[06:16] yes good and right there since she's
[06:19] uh i'm and right there what did i do
[06:21] when she got up i pulled the treat away
[06:23] that made the treat get real far away
[06:25] once she got out of the crawl position
[06:27] did you see that she went back down i
[06:30] like that she's trying to
[06:32] keep the session going so basically i
[06:35] mean you can't use the clicker too much
[06:36] if you're thinking hey i like what
[06:38] you're doing there
[06:38] click and give a reward if you're good
[06:44] yes good girl can i get another inch or
[06:47] two let's see
[06:49] god of course you may have to consort in
[06:52] all kinds of ways to teach your dog
[07:00] yes
[07:02] good girl nice correction there with
[07:04] those hind legs not dragging
[07:06] good work
[07:11] hug yes i'm gonna go ahead and continue
[07:14] to click
[07:15] and treat for duration too even though
[07:17] she's already done the hug
[07:19] there we go good girl okay hug is
[07:21] looking pretty good too
[07:23] here so let me plant the seed for a
[07:24] future trick like figure eights through
[07:26] the legs that's a really fun flashy one
[07:28] and again
[07:29] just to remind you we don't train tricks
[07:31] to be entertaining though it's okay if
[07:32] you do but we really train tricks like
[07:34] this to keep our dogs
[07:36] engaged it's kind of like teaching
[07:37] advanced math to them it really
[07:38] stimulates their brain helps them
[07:40] understand broader communication with
[07:42] human beings and it's just a really
[07:44] great way to increase your dog's quality
[07:46] of life by understanding how to work
[07:48] with us
[07:48] better good she's following that lure
[07:50] very well notice how the lure isn't
[07:52] right at her nose keep going
[07:55] good so right there i really asked her
[07:57] to make several moves
[07:58] uh before i decided to click because
[08:00] she's getting the hang of it she's
[08:01] following the lure well and over time
[08:02] your dog is like what do i have to do to
[08:04] make that clicker go off right it's a
[08:06] really great way to
[08:07] make training a little more interesting
[08:08] for some dogs maybe it makes it more
[08:10] interesting for you as well i think
[08:11] that's a great introductory session on
[08:13] crawl and weave through your legs it's
[08:15] just a way to plant the seed we're not
[08:16] trying to
[08:17] master a new trick all in one step
[08:19] obviously
[08:20] but just a great way to keep our
[08:22] thinking teach you how to really follow
[08:23] that lure
[08:24] and as i said a great way to build
[08:26] mutual communication
[08:28] which is what dog training is all about
[08:29] to this point kona's leash walking
[08:31] skills have been
[08:33] impressive so far she's done beautifully
[08:35] at several different parks
[08:36] she's doing well on neighborhood walks
[08:38] and just yesterday we were in the city
[08:40] of new orleans and she did pretty well
[08:42] today we're at historic bayou st john
[08:45] and we're going to do some leash
[08:46] training with kona today and while there
[08:48] are many historic facts about this
[08:50] by you the fact that real life pirates
[08:52] used to go up and down
[08:54] it is pretty crazy and plus some people
[08:56] think it's haunted
[08:57] i don't know what i hope to accomplish
[08:59] today is to
[09:00] verify that kona's leash walking
[09:02] abilities are improving and getting even
[09:05] more reliable
[09:06] in this type of setting and it may be
[09:08] time to start planting the seed for a
[09:10] proper heal later on
[09:12] this is really good here i mean the
[09:14] barking is fine here i'm not too
[09:16] concerned about it actually because
[09:17] we have a loose leash while she's
[09:19] barking she's more nervous than she is
[09:21] like lunging at them
[09:23] so i want to make sure that i give her
[09:25] plenty of room to go back here watch
[09:27] this
[09:27] kona come good
[09:32] good job yes so i'm still easily able to
[09:35] get her under control
[09:36] even in that circumstance it's normal
[09:39] for young puppies to react and bark at
[09:41] other dogs like that because they're
[09:42] interested in dogs you know they don't
[09:44] know the context
[09:45] what are those dogs coming over here for
[09:47] who knows what they're thinking some
[09:48] people might react by correcting their
[09:50] dog or
[09:51] putting tension on the leash which
[09:52] really tends to aggravate the situation
[09:54] with a lot of dogs
[09:55] and the fact that i was able to get her
[09:57] attention on me was evidence that she
[09:58] wasn't too overly stimulated
[10:01] that's a dog that's interesting isn't it
[10:03] see those puppies
[10:06] i know kona
[10:09] look at me yes hey that was really good
[10:12] that was a really good balance of
[10:15] letting her satisfy her curiosity
[10:18] i'm going to continue to let her do it
[10:20] by looking at him
[10:21] vocalizing a little i mean you know i
[10:23] got to watch that maybe that turns into
[10:24] excessive barking later but
[10:26] that's not the priority right now the
[10:28] priority is it was acceptable
[10:29] and she was evaluating the dogs and i
[10:33] was still able to get her attention on
[10:34] me at some point there by asking for it
[10:37] we've been out here just a few minutes
[10:39] and she's adjusting
[10:40] beautifully let's continue on our way
[10:42] here see how she does
[10:43] let her continue adjusting but she's
[10:46] doing pretty good
[10:46] kona is typically the kind of dog that
[10:49] adjusts within like 10 or 15 minutes
[10:52] which is really nice but if it took your
[10:55] dog longer
[10:56] that's totally fine too every dog is
[10:59] different let me
[11:00] verify that i can get her attention on
[11:02] me right now
[11:03] because if i can get her attention on me
[11:04] that means she's probably ready to train
[11:07] right now she's interested in this
[11:08] vegetation kona
[11:11] look at me little tough right now
[11:15] yes she ought she was a little late on
[11:18] the look at me i'm still going to go
[11:19] ahead and give her a treat right now
[11:20] just to see
[11:22] you want more of that or not if she goes
[11:24] back to doing what she's doing she's
[11:25] probably not yet adjusted and i should
[11:27] probably give her some more time
[11:29] let me just test just to see kona
[11:34] okay looks like i'm able to get her
[11:36] attention there intermittently so she's
[11:38] starting to come through
[11:40] let we'll see one more time kona
[11:44] sit okay we've got her into a sit that's
[11:46] pretty good
[11:47] we can get her attention right now it's
[11:49] more intermittent though so she's not
[11:51] quite fully adjusted
[11:52] i mean it's a fine line here in trying
[11:54] to seize those opportunities
[11:56] when your dog is voluntarily giving you
[11:58] their attention to get the most out of
[11:59] that particular training instance and on
[12:01] the other hand they still need to check
[12:02] out these purple plants to see what
[12:04] they're all about i mean i don't blame
[12:05] her they're really neat
[12:08] there's a barking dog in the house there
[12:10] she's aware of it
[12:11] that's fine she kept moving i like that
[12:14] kona
[12:15] come that's it so i'm looking to find
[12:18] just kind of a
[12:19] small stretch of street or sidewalk to
[12:22] work on here
[12:23] hey this looks as good as any look at me
[12:25] yes
[12:29] here kona let me see if i can get her to
[12:33] look at me while moving
[12:37] kona look at me
[12:41] yes delayed but perfectly fine she needs
[12:44] time to process
[12:46] okay come on yeah kona
[12:49] look at me
[12:54] whoa i got a little glance yes come on
[12:57] let's go back here
[12:59] yeah come on look at you
[13:04] yes good
[13:08] and
[13:13] come on here yes
[13:18] really good i mean you can't ask for any
[13:20] better than that from a 14 week old
[13:21] puppy you just can't
[13:23] that's amazing hey look at me good oh
[13:26] yes that's what i was hoping for that
[13:28] little movement let me try and get
[13:30] another one
[13:31] here kona look yes
[13:34] there we go yes
[13:39] here look at me here
[13:42] yes good okay that was a pretty exciting
[13:45] moment for me
[13:46] because she was looking up at me for
[13:47] more sustained periods of time
[13:49] and it almost looked like she was really
[13:51] comfortable doing this mini puppy heel
[13:53] i think we should at least start
[13:54] planting the seed for a future heal
[13:56] today yes good just trying to see how
[14:00] flexible she is
[14:01] on going into a position there you might
[14:04] know with my dog inertia i trained her
[14:06] how to
[14:06] spin into the heel on either side of me
[14:08] which is a really useful thing if you go
[14:10] the extra mile
[14:11] to train something like that but the
[14:13] first thing i really want to do is i
[14:14] just want to see if she can do a half
[14:15] circle
[14:16] so yes that was pretty good i mean
[14:18] that's so that's what it looks like in
[14:19] the beginning a little rough
[14:21] but if i can like have her stay
[14:24] yes stay yeah i'm going to go ahead and
[14:28] reward for duration here for a second
[14:30] on stay yes
[14:34] this is yes just letting her get a
[14:36] little lick of the treat in
[14:38] yes not treating her as much as it looks
[14:41] like here
[14:43] but that's getting her to hold the
[14:44] position you see that yes and then over
[14:46] time
[14:47] yes good yes
[14:51] i'll do it a little bit slower
[14:54] yes and that's kind of how you get
[14:56] traction that's a really good
[14:58] visual example so oftentimes when you
[15:00] see those rapid fires those are for
[15:01] early early attempts and early successes
[15:04] now that she's in the stand
[15:06] let me see if i can lure her yeah that's
[15:09] how it looks
[15:10] that's how it looks right there yes
[15:12] stick
[15:19] yes good okay take a break i mean that
[15:21] was a really good moment right there it
[15:23] was a pretty
[15:24] clean spin we're gonna take a break here
[15:26] walk down a little bit
[15:28] you can see how she wants to stop and
[15:29] smell the flowers i hear you're supposed
[15:31] to do that every once in a while
[15:33] okay enough smelling come
[15:36] how are you how good are you here we go
[15:39] let me see
[15:41] yes there we go look at me
[15:44] yes i'm trying to get in a half a step
[15:47] or a step
[15:48] here yes good right there
[15:52] see i'm trying to keep her in this
[15:53] position
[15:55] come on yes good
[15:58] here come on yes
[16:04] just trying to since she's so willing to
[16:06] follow that lure back in into position
[16:08] i'm just going to encourage her to do
[16:09] that here
[16:13] kona look at me
[16:17] yes
[16:21] look at me yes
[16:25] you know what let's just take a step
[16:26] back here and let's just see if we can
[16:27] get her comfortable with taking a treat
[16:28] in this position right here that's where
[16:30] her nose needs to be
[16:31] so let me just play here for a minute
[16:33] see if i can get her to understand that
[16:36] you can start to see just the glimmers
[16:38] of a heel there see that right there
[16:40] just
[16:40] really the point here isn't to teach a
[16:42] heel i just want to let her know it's
[16:44] possible
[16:45] to exist in this part of the world right
[16:48] here
[16:49] right by my leg yes look at that come
[16:52] here
[16:53] here kona look at me
[16:56] yes oh boy i almost had her there i did
[17:00] push her a bit
[17:01] so i'm content that she did at least
[17:03] that well on her very first heel session
[17:06] not bad at all girl let's continue to
[17:08] walk with her here
[17:09] so you can see how we're doing this kind
[17:11] of hybrid training session here when she
[17:13] gives me her attention and she seems
[17:14] really into it
[17:15] we're going to take that opportunity to
[17:17] do some training and when she wants to
[17:19] just sniff around and explore we're
[17:20] going to let her do that too
[17:21] and the reason we're doing that is
[17:22] because she's at that very important
[17:24] socialization period in her life so
[17:26] socialization is everything not just
[17:28] playing with dogs and people right it's
[17:30] getting to know the entire world there's
[17:32] a dog who's just trying to say hi to her
[17:34] as we walk down the street
[17:35] okay come on yes good
[17:38] come on come on
[17:42] yes you're just gonna let the
[17:45] environment be the reward there she's a
[17:47] little frazzled
[17:49] again keep trying to do my best to keep
[17:51] the leash loose here
[17:53] just so she can feel like she has
[17:55] freedom of movement
[17:56] can really process what's going on i
[17:58] mean that's a little weird to her she's
[18:00] like wow there's a dog
[18:01] over there coming from somewhere i can
[18:04] smell the dog i can hear the dog but i
[18:06] can't see the dog
[18:07] you can see how she's like borderline
[18:08] can i really get her attention right now
[18:10] when she's frazzled like that
[18:11] kona come
[18:16] yes good this is a case where when i
[18:19] called her she didn't really respond to
[18:21] me but when she looked up at me
[18:22] i was able to encourage her with my body
[18:25] language to come towards me so you've
[18:26] got to kind of think about
[18:28] all those nuanced ways that we
[18:29] communicate with our dogs
[18:31] and try to tap on those to the best of
[18:33] your ability so here i'm really trying
[18:35] to push to get a little bit more
[18:36] out of that heel training session this
[18:38] is what we have to watch for as trainers
[18:40] sometimes that's a good idea sometimes
[18:42] not so much so here in the case we have
[18:43] a barking dog it's
[18:45] really throwing her off it's far more
[18:47] beneficial to let her process the
[18:48] barking dog in this new place than it is
[18:50] to insist
[18:51] on trying to get those last few steps of
[18:53] progress out of her
[18:54] heel training session does that make
[18:55] sense always be flexible and prepared to
[18:57] change your game plan on a moment's
[18:59] notice
[18:59] for kona she's actually starting to pull
[19:02] a little bit here
[19:03] that's a little bit new for her normally
[19:06] she's been good about walking a bit
[19:07] slower but
[19:08] perhaps she's getting more confident now
[19:10] and more eager to explore her
[19:11] surroundings
[19:13] so i'm gonna i'm gonna try to do my best
[19:15] to
[19:16] keep that at bay that pulling by doing a
[19:20] little
[19:20] impromptu lesson here real quick kona
[19:22] here
[19:24] come come let's go what's this
[19:27] yes good you can see that yes works
[19:31] really well with her
[19:33] here kona
[19:39] kona come
[19:44] yes good girl very good all right
[19:48] so several times throughout this walk
[19:50] kona has tried to get into the
[19:52] vegetation and smell things and i've
[19:54] been trying to let her do that but then
[19:55] her
[19:56] recall is so reliable that i'm able to
[19:58] call her off of those things
[19:59] at a really consistent rate i want to
[20:01] maintain that for a while i'm not just
[20:03] going to assume oh she just listens to
[20:05] come when called now
[20:06] i want to continue to give her a reason
[20:08] to listen to that one
[20:09] for an extended period of time at least
[20:11] a full year of life so it's really
[20:13] seared into her brain that she always
[20:16] listens to that one so i'd love to take
[20:18] a moment right now to talk to some of
[20:19] you who have
[20:20] dogs who are just constantly grabbing at
[20:22] everything on a walk whether it's
[20:23] garbage or vegetation or plants or
[20:25] whatever
[20:26] i want to definitely acknowledge what
[20:28] you're going through because i know
[20:29] personally how overwhelming that can be
[20:32] with a new puppy
[20:33] do you understand that that is normal
[20:34] puppy behavior there's nothing wrong
[20:36] with you or your dog if they're doing
[20:37] that
[20:37] you're not doing irreversible damage by
[20:39] letting your dog get away with
[20:41] picking things up on a walk of course
[20:43] you do want to address it but
[20:45] there's a time and a place and there's a
[20:46] lot of communication you have to build
[20:48] with your dog in those first few weeks
[20:50] so
[20:50] that really is the bigger picture here
[20:52] one of the ways that i really like to
[20:54] address the issue of dogs grabbing
[20:55] everything when you go on a walk is to
[20:57] be pre-emptive for example
[20:59] in this case she's had a lot of training
[21:00] today a lot of activity she's not in a
[21:02] super wired frame of mind
[21:04] this is a really good time to reinforce
[21:06] good behavior so this is
[21:07] a typical item right that a dog might
[21:09] want to grab at on the sidewalk if they
[21:11] encountered it let's do a training drill
[21:13] that closely mimics real life here
[21:15] in fact exceeds it a little bit it's
[21:16] going to fall from the sky
[21:18] as we walk and we're going to see if she
[21:19] leaves it alone or not
[21:21] kona come she has no idea it's coming
[21:25] leave it kona come ah
[21:30] looks like we failed on that one
[21:33] so right there i mean when she was in
[21:35] that surprise state of mind
[21:37] she hasn't generalized this concept of
[21:39] leaving a foreign object alone
[21:41] good example i have work to do there i'm
[21:43] going to be a little more deliberate
[21:44] rather than just doing the same thing
[21:46] this time to really help her understand
[21:48] so kona leave it
[21:52] conor come on let's go leave it
[21:56] okay nope not there yet so i'm clear
[21:59] whoa
[22:00] i'm clearly taking steps that are too
[22:02] big here so let's practice
[22:04] leave it look at me yes
[22:11] leave it look at me perfect
[22:14] really good job girl okay now we got
[22:17] that
[22:18] kona leave it
[22:21] coda come yes a little bit easier
[22:25] let's go let's go leave it
[22:29] come yes that's what we're looking for
[22:33] just doing small exercises like that can
[22:35] be super beneficial super easy and super
[22:37] helpful for your dog
[22:38] your mindset is like the most important
[22:40] thing when you're training a dog
[22:42] by finding a pleasant place to work and
[22:43] train with your dog you're more likely
[22:45] to have
[22:46] a more productive training session with
[22:47] your dog and i understand that you can't
[22:49] always do that but just a tip
[22:51] so you know when you let your dog out
[22:52] and they're biting stuff or they're
[22:54] digging at the ground and you just
[22:56] want them to not behave that way i mean
[22:57] you can see our lawn's taking some abuse
[23:00] and
[23:00] if we've been practicing a recall we do
[23:02] this
[23:03] kona come yes
[23:06] sit good girl in other words we do an
[23:09] incompatible behavior if she's running
[23:11] to me
[23:12] she can't be digging a hole plus that's
[23:14] one of the most valuable skills that any
[23:16] dog could have
[23:17] and if she would go right back to it i
[23:18] would do the same thing in fact she
[23:19] probably will here in a second but the
[23:21] idea is to create the habit of okay
[23:23] every time i go over there i end up
[23:24] getting distracted from it that's
[23:26] probably for good reason but this is why
[23:27] we supervise outdoor play sessions and
[23:30] if your dog isn't coming to you when you
[23:32] call them then that's just your cue to
[23:33] take a step back and practice
[23:35] come when called exercise in a lot of
[23:37] different places and distracting
[23:39] situations the more you just take
[23:40] advantage of your downtime with your dog
[23:42] like this the more likely it is to
[23:43] listen to you and more
[23:44] complicated and distracting situations
[23:47] kona
[23:47] and remember she's a teething dog but
[23:49] you can't do that
[23:50] kona come yes
[23:54] good love it that is what i'm talking
[23:58] about good girl
[23:59] so in that case again her recall has
[24:01] been so strong because i've made it a
[24:03] point every
[24:04] time she comes to me i'm going to make
[24:05] her life good the obvious question here
[24:07] is
[24:07] am i reinforcing her chewing on the
[24:09] stick by giving her the treat in other
[24:11] words
[24:12] does she equate picking up the stick
[24:14] with getting a treat and that's what we
[24:15] want to avoid so i think i need to be a
[24:17] little more thorough and purposeful with
[24:19] my communication here
[24:20] that's it leave it
[24:25] look at me hey
[24:28] okay she's very high value object in her
[24:32] life at this moment sit
[24:35] stay leave it
[24:38] see this leave it alone look at me
[24:41] yes the first exercise was a really good
[24:44] example of
[24:44] redirecting her and getting her
[24:46] attention on me instead of the things
[24:48] she's interested in
[24:49] in this exercise where i'm dropping the
[24:51] sticks in front of her i'm really trying
[24:53] to communicate with her in a more
[24:55] obvious way as it relates to this
[24:56] particular item
[24:58] then over time you hope to pair those
[25:00] two skills together
[25:01] until your dog really starts to put one
[25:03] in one together potty training
[25:05] looking good this is another benefit to
[25:07] getting your dogs outside and playing
[25:08] together we're doing pretty good on
[25:10] accidents i think it's been three maybe
[25:11] even four
[25:12] entire days without an accident so just
[25:14] because she came here in those two
[25:16] instances doesn't mean kona will never
[25:18] try to dig at the ground again or that
[25:20] she'll just suddenly start leaving
[25:21] sticks alone either
[25:22] it takes a lot of consistency i mean you
[25:24] gotta do this at least dozens of times
[25:26] probably hundreds of times so whether
[25:28] your dog is digging picking up things
[25:30] they
[25:30] shouldn't getting into your garden or
[25:32] even barking at the fence
[25:34] your ultimate goal is simply to get
[25:35] their attention on you start small
[25:37] as needed and increase difficulty over
[25:40] time
[25:41] as they improve get 50 off of your first

[01:55] if i'm being honest yes i am a little
[01:58] emotional that today is kona's last day
[02:00] i mean she's been my
[02:01] obsession for the last three weeks and
[02:04] i've enjoyed
[02:04] just about every moment of it maybe some
[02:07] of the sleepless nights were
[02:09] a little tough and so even though it's
[02:11] the last day with kona i still have some
[02:13] things planned with her that i
[02:14] really want to button up and make sure
[02:16] that i'm doing my absolute best
[02:18] to teach her there are still some
[02:20] unresolved issues she's
[02:21] a bit of a hole digger we have a fresh
[02:23] hole over here she was digging at and
[02:25] i've been relying on redirecting her by
[02:27] calling her to me because she has such a
[02:29] strong recall
[02:30] honestly a lot of this digging is super
[02:32] normal for a puppy i'm not too concerned
[02:33] about it being a lifelong habit unless
[02:35] she's not getting enough exercise or
[02:37] general training in her life because
[02:38] that's usually where
[02:39] digging tends to be a problem as long as
[02:41] we're consistent about calling her off
[02:43] of
[02:44] digging or picking up sticks or doing
[02:46] anything else we don't want her to do
[02:47] that she'll learn pretty quickly and
[02:49] because inertia
[02:50] and kona have enjoyed each other so much
[02:51] i really want to give them as much time
[02:53] as possible
[02:54] together you'll remember on day one kona
[02:56] was really apprehensive really nervous
[02:58] of inertia inertia was coming on
[03:00] super strong and they've almost
[03:01] completely reversed roles it seems
[03:04] because sometimes kona just like
[03:05] launches her body into inertia and
[03:07] inertia has been so
[03:08] tolerant this reciprocal play that we
[03:10] are seeing so much of how they like
[03:12] trade positions sometimes inertia will
[03:14] plop on her back other times
[03:16] kona is so easily willing to go down and
[03:18] let inertia be on top of her
[03:20] really really healthy behavior you want
[03:22] to make sure that both dogs
[03:23] are enjoying it when they're playing
[03:24] together so sometimes when dogs are
[03:26] playing really rough and putting their
[03:28] teeth around the neck of another dog it
[03:29] can be concerning to some people but if
[03:31] both dogs generally appear to be having
[03:33] a good time this is just a natural way
[03:35] for
[03:36] dogs to communicate with one another and
[03:38] play with one another i mean they don't
[03:39] have hands like we do so that's how they
[03:41] grab
[03:41] each other and play when your dogs rest
[03:44] like that all by themselves
[03:46] this is the sign that you are doing your
[03:48] job as a pet parent to satisfy your dog
[03:50] you'll remember the single biggest issue
[03:52] that kona had when she came to me
[03:54] was separation anxiety she couldn't get
[03:56] through the night if you walked out of
[03:58] the room she would immediately start
[03:59] crying
[04:00] and that's the type of issue that does
[04:01] take a significant amount of time to
[04:03] resolve but we have made incredible
[04:05] progress so i've been having to wake up
[04:06] between
[04:07] zero and one time a night which is a
[04:10] tremendous improvement because on the
[04:11] first couple of nights at least i had to
[04:13] probably let her out every 90 minutes or
[04:15] so
[04:16] so i want to give some last minute
[04:18] attention to her separation anxiety
[04:20] throughout kona's life she's going to
[04:21] need to be alone in two main capacities
[04:23] when she's out and about in the house
[04:25] eventually and she's going to need to be
[04:26] alone
[04:27] in her crate where she's comfortable at
[04:29] least over the next year because
[04:31] she's not gonna be completely reliable
[04:34] to be left alone while you go to the
[04:35] store or whatever for
[04:36] a good bit i'm gonna give you the recipe
[04:38] for teaching your dog to be completely
[04:40] reliable
[04:40] over the long haul when you leave them
[04:42] alone in the house and remember in
[04:44] kona's family they have a new baby on
[04:45] the way so
[04:46] they're going to be times when she just
[04:48] needs to check out while they tend to
[04:50] the new baby right
[04:51] kona will go in this crate without a
[04:54] treat
[04:54] don't make a liar with me come on corner
[04:56] get in the crate
[04:58] go on yes
[05:01] good girl stay but
[05:04] i would still say for the next many
[05:07] weeks
[05:08] if your dog were in a similar situation
[05:10] like you've got them going in the crate
[05:11] don't be afraid to keep them going in
[05:14] the crate by throwing a treat in we keep
[05:16] treats by the crate at all times with
[05:18] puppies
[05:18] because we want there to be as little
[05:20] friction as possible when it comes to
[05:22] getting them to go in there we want them
[05:24] to like
[05:24] going in there and as you can see
[05:27] inertia
[05:28] is a fan of going in a crate as well
[05:30] good job guys
[05:31] i want to do my best here to emulate
[05:34] that like we're taking a break
[05:36] can you settle good
[05:40] very good yes love that inertia
[05:42] understands the concept of settle pretty
[05:44] well
[05:44] and kona is really starting to learn
[05:47] i've been kind of using a combination of
[05:48] relax
[05:49] or settle to kind of calm her down and
[05:52] when she barks like that
[05:53] i almost never let her out i always
[05:57] insist on
[05:58] a relaxed mindset before i even do that
[06:01] so i think i mean she's generally
[06:02] actually pretty good in the crate but
[06:04] right now we're seeing a little bit of
[06:05] that barking mainly because we're
[06:06] probably just doing some
[06:08] food training and she's a little excited
[06:10] by that so
[06:11] i think if i just give it a second here
[06:13] she'll dial out
[06:14] and and settle hey
[06:17] can you relax
[06:19] [Applause]
[06:23] a little frustration there she probably
[06:25] needs a little bit more exercise to feel
[06:27] completely content i can see she's a
[06:29] little worked up there but
[06:30] there are times when you've got to be
[06:32] able to focus on you and you need to
[06:34] know that you can put them in the crate
[06:35] and that they'll be comfortable
[06:37] i've worked really hard on this with
[06:38] inertia and this is kind of what
[06:40] a settle in real life should look like
[06:43] so she's gotten them out
[06:46] kona is in the process of getting the
[06:47] memo
[06:49] settle
[06:49] [Music]
[06:53] that's right good girl but in the
[06:55] interest in moving on with this training
[06:56] session while she's being good i'm gonna
[06:58] go over here
[06:59] and let her out this is exactly what you
[07:01] would do you know see how she's like not
[07:02] being pushy not being
[07:04] loud good girl now when i open it i want
[07:07] to make it clear
[07:08] stay but she doesn't rush out of the
[07:11] crate
[07:14] stay
[07:20] [Music]
[07:23] and then rather than just having her go
[07:25] out and ever come to me
[07:28] come sit
[07:31] good girl lie down
[07:36] yes good relax i mean keep in mind kona
[07:40] at this point still has her baby teeth
[07:41] so she's going to be teething for
[07:43] several months and even though she's
[07:45] doing really awesome
[07:46] she still doesn't have enough life
[07:47] experience to be left alone in the house
[07:49] and not to chew on a couch or a shoe or
[07:52] something that's been left out for
[07:53] example
[07:53] so now and over the next few months
[07:55] kona's family is really going to have to
[07:57] lay
[07:58] that foundation a strong foundation of
[08:00] getting kona
[08:01] to behave acceptably while inside the
[08:04] house and
[08:04] outside of her crate one of the bricks
[08:06] that i put in this foundation here
[08:08] is i've been having this 10 foot indoor
[08:10] tile when i'm supervising her i'll put
[08:12] her on this and inertia will come over
[08:14] here and play with her
[08:15] sometimes they'll take a nap but the
[08:17] point is she's comfortable but she's
[08:19] still managed
[08:19] and it's a little bit more freedom than
[08:21] the crate for example allows her to walk
[08:23] around a little bit
[08:24] settle
[08:27] relax thank you appreciate that
[08:31] a real world natural settle is the best
[08:33] thing ever i mean of course you've got
[08:34] to meet your dog halfway by giving them
[08:36] the stimulation and exercise they need
[08:38] but dogs like kona are just so happy to
[08:40] chill out
[08:41] and relax for a good bit she's pretty
[08:43] low-key you can start to really see her
[08:45] getting the concept that settle doesn't
[08:47] just mean lie down settle is more about
[08:50] a state of mind a relaxed frame of mind
[08:52] basically
[08:53] whereas lie down is a physical position
[08:55] i think she's just repositioning here
[08:56] let's see if she goes back into a
[08:57] natural settle
[08:59] because i've gotten to know her pretty
[09:00] well and i think that's what's about to
[09:02] happen
[09:03] she may want a cooler area yeah or
[09:06] whatever good job girl you're relaxing
[09:09] you're settling
[09:10] it's still important to supervise your
[09:11] dog when they are on a tie out like this
[09:13] so you want to make sure that you don't
[09:15] leave them unattended this is really
[09:17] good because you're in a great
[09:18] position to acknowledge what you like
[09:21] when they're behaving
[09:22] well settle yes settle is just such
[09:25] a super valuable skill i really
[09:27] recommend that you teach this
[09:28] with your own dogs too and by observing
[09:30] her body language you can see she
[09:32] does appear to be in a very genuinely
[09:34] relaxed
[09:35] state of mind so i'm gonna take kona off
[09:37] lead let her play a little bit with
[09:39] inertia right now she was doing great on
[09:41] settle
[09:42] he'll probably do this for a second
[09:44] which is really its own brand of
[09:45] entertainment right then i'm gonna
[09:47] attempt to verify that i can get kona
[09:49] and then off leash
[09:51] settle and relax here in the living room
[09:53] kona come
[09:54] all done kona still wants to play with
[09:57] inertia but i still want to make sure
[09:58] that i can get her to shift gears when i
[10:00] need to this will be a good opportunity
[10:02] to practice
[10:02] so i'm gonna have to restrain her a
[10:04] little bit because this is a little bit
[10:05] too much for her
[10:06] let me get inertia in her settle now
[10:09] that inertia is stable
[10:10] i can restrict kona's access to inertia
[10:13] by standing between her and really
[10:15] encouraging her
[10:16] to relax over here come on relax
[10:22] good girl chill
[10:26] settle the general road map
[10:29] moving forward with kona is to really
[10:31] manage her in these three main ways get
[10:33] her comfortable with being in the crate
[10:34] get her comfortable on the tie out with
[10:36] the aim of making that a way to ease in
[10:39] being comfortable in the house when
[10:42] unattended eventually and just the other
[10:43] day we went grocery shopping we left her
[10:45] alone
[10:46] for like 30 or 40 minutes she was doing
[10:48] really well
[10:49] she's improved by like a thousand
[10:51] percent on her separation anxiety
[10:53] she rarely starts barking when i leave
[10:55] the room at this point and if she does
[10:57] there's a good chance she's either got
[10:58] to go outside
[10:59] or she's hungry or thirsty okay one more
[11:02] thing that i want to do
[11:03] is give kona a bath so that she smells
[11:05] delightful when her family
[11:07] picks her up she did really well in her
[11:09] very first bath training session with me
[11:11] i'm not just going to assume because
[11:12] that first bath went well that she's
[11:14] just going to be great now i mean maybe
[11:15] she's had time to process it and she's
[11:17] thinking
[11:18] what was i thinking being tolerant of
[11:20] that let's see i'm going to
[11:22] throw a treat in advance so she gets
[11:23] focused on that
[11:25] these are jerky treats we got in our pup
[11:27] box i'm just throwing crumbs down there
[11:29] she's doing great with that i'm gonna
[11:31] turn that on i'm gonna turn it off just
[11:33] in case she gets nervous but so far so
[11:35] good
[11:41] we'll wait for the water to warm up this
[11:43] is a good time to
[11:44] go ahead and condition her she doesn't
[11:45] care if those treats get a little bit
[11:47] wet
[11:47] look how muddy she is from playing oh my
[11:50] gosh
[11:51] we have some peanut butter on this mat
[11:53] right here that i'm hoping
[11:54] will help i'm going to go ahead and
[11:56] stick it to the bath
[11:58] yeah it's on there that's going nowhere
[12:00] and you can see how it's textured there
[12:02] so that's pretty cool it really
[12:03] keeps her attention i'm going to test
[12:05] her just by going slow here
[12:08] making sure that i'm extra
[12:11] nice see we've got a pretty good flow
[12:13] going on she's not getting too nervous
[12:15] i'm gonna give her a moment to see if
[12:16] she gets fixated back on that
[12:18] peanut butter you're so predictable dog
[12:22] i'm going to gently pour some water on
[12:26] her see that that's all it is
[12:28] let her check it out if she's curious no
[12:30] rush here
[12:31] it's only the second bath i've given her
[12:33] so
[12:34] yes good do you see how she's not trying
[12:37] to get out of the tub or anything right
[12:39] now
[12:39] looks like she might be a little thrown
[12:41] off on me pouring that on her so i'm
[12:42] just gonna
[12:45] head her here like this here i'm giving
[12:48] her access to more and more of it as i
[12:50] pour you see that so it really keeps her
[12:53] interested
[12:55] nice she's doing so well i'm going to
[12:57] try and get this whole picture poured
[12:59] all over her
[13:02] with those hind legs get her nice
[13:06] and wet want to be really delicate
[13:09] around her head
[13:10] i can always wipe her head down if i
[13:11] have to or her ears or whatever
[13:13] by the way the shampoo came from a past
[13:15] pup box and i'm still using it
[13:17] i got this with a nurse's pup box a
[13:19] while ago
[13:21] so you can see how carefree she is when
[13:22] there are treats involved i
[13:24] get that shampoo everywhere she keeps
[13:26] going to my stash over here which is
[13:28] okay because she's not trying to jump
[13:29] out
[13:30] get that tummy tummy tummy gotta get
[13:32] that tum
[13:33] oh man you sneaky dog gosh
[13:36] who's being careless with their treats
[13:38] today
[13:41] oh yeah i love how easily that shampoo
[13:43] rinses off
[13:44] look at that i'm gonna throw some treats
[13:47] in here when we're done
[13:48] as well just to keep it an all-around
[13:50] great experience
[13:51] now what are we gonna do with you we
[13:52] gotta get you dried there's a shake off
[13:56] you look so clean now i'm really trying
[13:59] to put myself
[14:00] in the mindset of kona's family right
[14:03] like what would they expect
[14:04] kona spent this time with this dog
[14:06] trainer for the last three weeks
[14:08] i feel like if i were them there are
[14:09] three things that i'd really want to
[14:10] make sure that she did really well
[14:12] first of all i'd be getting her
[14:13] attention when i asked for it and then
[14:14] having her come to me reliably i'd also
[14:16] wanted to stay reliably kona
[14:18] come nice sit good
[14:23] look at me good eye contact there stay
[14:31] come and the automatic sit really nice
[14:35] touch at the end
[14:36] so pretty good basic come when called
[14:38] but that's been one of kona's strong
[14:39] points she's got a fantastic recall
[14:42] and the secret to that with a puppy is
[14:43] going the extra mile
[14:45] and reinforcing when they do come to you
[14:47] by giving them a positive outcome to
[14:49] that action
[14:50] so if you're giving them a treat they
[14:51] really love or a great toy
[14:53] that's much more likely to inspire them
[14:55] to want to come to you
[14:56] later on in the training process we
[14:58] phase out the treats but
[15:00] right now we get the behaviors any way
[15:01] that we can kona come
[15:04] good so even here i mean she's really
[15:06] not supposed to be running all over the
[15:08] house right now i should have a restrain
[15:09] but
[15:10] it's nice to know that she will come
[15:11] running to me uh when she does get out
[15:13] of sight i really like that
[15:15] so i would also expect her to be able to
[15:16] stay with a variety of different
[15:18] distractions so stay
[15:21] look at me come nice work
[15:25] good now that's one type of distraction
[15:27] that's a pretty easy one
[15:28] but we're gonna try a more significant
[15:30] distraction this is a real world
[15:32] application of stay while distracted
[15:34] because you'll know that just simply
[15:36] being outside is heavily distracting to
[15:38] a dog
[15:39] so i'm going to give her a very short
[15:40] notice first attempt today
[15:42] stay let me get her warmed up just to
[15:45] make sure
[15:46] stay yes
[15:49] see how her eyes are coming up at me i
[15:51] like that a lot stay
[15:57] look at me
[16:00] i would like to be able to know that i
[16:02] can call her away from a distraction in
[16:04] this case
[16:05] outside a car is about to pass
[16:11] i got her attention come yeah
[16:14] good girl she is really doing well
[16:16] overriding her desires to go and
[16:18] investigate the outdoors and pay
[16:20] attention to me instead
[16:22] [Music]
[16:24] look at me
[16:27] yes took her a second but she focused
[16:30] stay look at me
[16:34] being able to get that kind of focus
[16:37] with that level of distraction you hear
[16:38] those cars going by out there that is
[16:40] why we teach this
[16:41] your dog's safety is not guaranteed if
[16:44] they get out of that front door
[16:45] and even though she's doing so well with
[16:47] this i want you to take note of the fact
[16:48] that she's on leash right now
[16:50] there's no shame in making sure that
[16:52] your dog is always under control
[16:54] especially when they have unrestricted
[16:56] access to the entire planet like this
[16:58] your parents are going to be here in a
[17:00] little bit so i want to see if there's
[17:01] any last-minute issues i can address
[17:03] with brushing her right now she's
[17:05] feeling a little bitey with the brush
[17:06] oh okay see stop that can we sit
[17:10] yes good
[17:13] very good stay
[17:18] wait can you sit there leave it alone
[17:21] yes so we'll just direct her attention
[17:24] onto the treat so she doesn't bite the
[17:25] brush
[17:26] it's normal for puppies to want to bite
[17:28] at the brush i mean how they know it's
[17:29] not just another toy
[17:30] so really by diverting their attention
[17:32] to the treat there
[17:34] we're in good shape she's doing so well
[17:36] i mean if you can just get them like
[17:38] focused on something else and go real
[17:40] slow
[17:41] you might remember we want her to check
[17:42] out the brush you don't want to be
[17:44] sneaky about it or mysterious you just
[17:46] want to be as transparent as you can
[17:49] and here she's happy to just hold still
[17:51] if i release little bits of treat here
[17:53] as i brush her
[17:54] look at that even her legs are doing
[17:56] great this came in a past pup box
[17:58] actually
[17:58] so it's really nice here look at that
[18:00] hair you're not so curly when you're
[18:02] brushed are you
[18:03] of course you're not always going to
[18:04] have to do this this is the first many
[18:06] times you're getting them used to
[18:07] something
[18:08] like a brush let's see what happens if
[18:09] we do that yes
[18:11] so i'm able to kind of pull it away and
[18:13] then give her a reward
[18:15] good girl look at that yes i also like
[18:18] how she's
[18:18] defaulting into a stand right now i'm
[18:20] not even having to ask for it i mean i'm
[18:22] kind of
[18:22] encouraging her to hold the stand by
[18:24] putting the treats at her nose here it's
[18:25] easier to brush a dog when they're in a
[18:27] stand that's one of the main reasons i
[18:28] like teaching a dog to stand on all
[18:29] fours let's see
[18:32] she's willingly following the treats and
[18:34] see this is really what you want you
[18:36] want your dog
[18:37] in a good mood when you're doing things
[18:39] like grooming or bathing them to the
[18:40] best of your ability you want to go out
[18:42] of your way
[18:43] to try to make them as enjoyable as
[18:45] possible for your dog i mean see them
[18:46] from your dog's perspective they're not
[18:47] used to a brush they don't know why this
[18:49] prickly thing needs to be touching them
[18:50] you can also see she's not biting me too
[18:52] much or anything like that
[18:54] so lots of slow steady progress
[18:57] on puppy biting for sure i'll be honest
[19:00] with you even though
[19:01] i'm done training her for now her puppy
[19:02] biting still needs to be addressed but
[19:04] we are making tons of progress you can
[19:06] see she's licking there for example
[19:08] which is a nice ouch okay she's biting
[19:10] there
[19:11] but as long as a dog has those baby
[19:14] teeth like that
[19:15] they're definitely going to be in a
[19:16] bitey phase our goal is to minimize it
[19:18] and really communicate with them when
[19:20] the biting is excessive versus
[19:22] when it's tolerable all right you rock
[19:24] star i think you're ready to go home i'm
[19:27] gonna miss you so much
[19:29] we've made a ton of progress with kona
[19:31] but i do want to remind you
[19:32] it really takes a good couple of years
[19:34] to fully train a dog where you really
[19:36] get them listening to you in a huge
[19:38] variety of situations
[19:40] and get that really as close to perfect
[19:42] behavior as we could ever hope for
[19:44] during these first few weeks of training
[19:45] with a puppy like this you're really
[19:47] laying the foundation and trying to
[19:49] teach them basic language and then once
[19:51] you teach them
[19:52] that basic language you can really build
[19:54] on that
[19:55] and there are so many different things
[19:56] you can teach them but they do need
[19:58] life experience so a dog is not trained
[20:01] in three weeks
[20:02] but you can make incredible progress in
[20:04] that time nonetheless
[20:05] so as long as kona's family really keeps
[20:07] up with training
[20:08] and they will because i know them kona
[20:11] is going to have an amazing life
[20:13] it's time
[20:16] look who's here hey guys
[20:20] come on in look who's here say hi
[20:24] oh my goodness she's been playing all
[20:26] day too and look at this energy
[20:28] it's great wow she just goes right on
[20:32] mama's lap too
[20:33] after she gets that initial burst out oh
[20:37] i can tell she missed you she's like i
[20:38] don't know who to love more now
[20:44] i can't wait to show you guys everything
[20:46] that she's learned over these last few
[20:48] weeks

[20:51] you sign up for a three six or 12 month

TRANSCRIPTION:

[00:00] this is moira a 10 month old rescue dog
[00:03] who grew up on the streets of new
[00:04] orleans because she is
[00:06] a very strong german shepherd but she's
[00:08] also 50 plus pounds of raw energy
[00:11] that's enough whoa chill
[00:14] relax with a desire to how do i say this
[00:18] enthusiastically interact with her
[00:20] surroundings
[00:21] this is exactly the kind of behavior
[00:22] that can scare a lot of people if that
[00:24] was a dog
[00:24] she would be like i'm not paying
[00:25] attention to you i'm paying attention to
[00:27] that okay there's
[00:29] yes okay i have to be totally honest
[00:33] with you i am feeling a little bit
[00:35] overwhelmed
[00:36] so much for the tie out huh she's
[00:38] looking for a new home and i've been
[00:39] given two weeks to teach her how to be
[00:40] better behaved
[00:42] oh geez that's my mic there is no way
[00:45] see not as easy as it looks but if she
[00:47] keeps making first impressions like this
[00:49] she could have a hard time okay we have
[00:50] a situation no
[00:52] this is going to take longer than two
[00:54] weeks moira loses complete
[00:56] composure anytime she sees a dog there's
[01:00] virtually no chance she's going to
[01:02] disregard a dog
[01:04] anywhere within 50 yards of her this is
[01:06] going to be a relatively
[01:07] unconventional dog training lesson how
[01:09] am i going to get through to her
[01:10] this polling is insane i think i've made
[01:13] a miscalculation
[01:14] jumping on the furniture is definitely a
[01:16] problem with moira if she keeps behaving
[01:18] like this
[01:18] nobody is going to adopt her and it's
[01:20] going to be my fault we have to address
[01:22] this biting this biting
[01:24] must stop she is way too old to be doing
[01:27] this kind of biting
[01:29] i will teach this dog
[01:31] [Music]
[01:32] oh my gosh how about this way look at
[01:35] her a whole cluster of dogs over there
[01:37] look at this loose leech right now here
[01:39] come on
[01:40] good girl much better yes
[01:44] come is she getting trained
[01:52] look at me
[01:56] [Music]
[01:59] yes okay thank goodness i'm able to
[02:02] teach her something
[02:04] number one dog training channel on
[02:06] youtube right here
[02:11] [Music]
[02:17] good luck oh boy you did pan on me when
[02:19] i was like having the
[02:20] thought of how on earth are we gonna get
[02:22] this done yeah th this is
[02:24] this is why i'm supposed to get ready
[02:25] before we shoot
[02:27] that's how i looked

[00:00] this is going to be one of the rockiest
[00:03] training sessions i've had
[00:04] in a very long time moira no ma'am
[00:07] this is moira and i'm zach george moira
[00:09] the german shepherd dog is looking for a
[00:11] home and i've only got
[00:12] two weeks to teach her how to behave so
[00:14] that someone will be willing to adopt
[00:16] her
[00:16] okay we have a situation and as you can
[00:19] see it's
[00:20] not going to be easy she jumps
[00:22] excessively
[00:23] lunges at almost any distraction moira
[00:26] loves to bark and she
[00:28] definitely pulls on leash and uses her
[00:30] teeth to interact with the world
[00:32] a little too inappropriately i am
[00:34] feeling a little bit overwhelmed
[00:36] if that was a dog she would be like i'm
[00:37] not paying attention to you i'm paying
[00:39] attention to that
[00:41] i will train this dog look at this loose
[00:45] leash right now
[00:46] shake yes much better yes
[00:49] look at me she getting trained this is
[00:52] reality
[00:52] dog training
[00:54] [Music]
[00:56] there's no doubt that moira is a very
[00:58] high energy dog and high energy dogs
[01:00] like this can be a
[01:01] lot to handle but remember these
[01:03] high-energy dogs can be some of the
[01:04] easiest dogs in the world to train that
[01:06] is
[01:07] once you get some traction which can be
[01:09] the most challenging part
[01:10] let's see what's in our pop box this
[01:11] month that's hopefully gonna help with
[01:13] that
[01:14] this go dog dinosaur toy is right up her
[01:17] alley it's extra floppy dogs love it and
[01:19] it's made of really tough fabric as you
[01:21] can see by this german shepherd dog
[01:22] playing with it this is gonna be useful
[01:24] oh
[01:25] boy she's gonna love this she likes
[01:27] these really durable rubbery toys and i
[01:29] love the fact that they
[01:30] last a long time you gotta earn it here
[01:32] give me a sit
[01:34] stay okay pup box will send you training
[01:37] supplies and treats based on your dog's
[01:40] specific
[01:40] age and what's really cool about pup box
[01:43] is they give you this detailed training
[01:45] guide and advice on raising your dog
[01:47] it's front and back there's a lot more
[01:48] information on here than you might
[01:50] realize so between pup box and these
[01:51] training videos you should be set nice
[01:54] natural chew here she's gonna love this
[01:56] i'm gonna save this for later when i put
[01:58] her up
[01:58] and hopefully she'll sleep all night
[02:00] again i like the safety light
[02:03] really important for young dogs that
[02:04] they're easy to see at all times of day
[02:06] we got some treats today for you too i
[02:08] wonder how many things we're going to be
[02:09] able to teach you with these
[02:11] all of you can get 50 off of your first
[02:13] pup box when you sign up for a
[02:14] multi-month subscription at pupbox.com
[02:17] zach and enter code zack i'll have the
[02:18] details below in the description
[02:20] today we're going to work on some of the
[02:22] most important things that any dog needs
[02:24] to know not the least of which
[02:25] is leash walking moira super hard
[02:28] challenge on leash walking
[02:29] come and stay as well as something that
[02:31] i really want to focus on with her and
[02:33] that's
[02:34] also not the easiest task this dog is
[02:36] like 100 miles an hour he just goes and
[02:38] goes
[02:39] and the minute we start our training
[02:41] session we're presented with a dog
[02:43] walking by
[02:44] this is going to be one of the rockiest
[02:47] training sessions i've had
[02:49] in a very long time looks like we have a
[02:51] puppy coming by i'm gonna hold her and
[02:53] manage her
[02:54] good girl no not now relax
[02:57] no wow you're so tall
[03:01] today we're gonna really focus on those
[03:03] life-saving skills
[03:04] come and stay for this first lesson of
[03:06] the day and i'm hoping to make some
[03:08] progress there now
[03:09] one thing i definitely know about moira
[03:12] is that she just
[03:12] loves to play fetch so i think i've got
[03:14] an idea as a way
[03:15] to really reinforce come when called
[03:18] with her
[03:19] come good that's look at that let go do
[03:23] you see that
[03:24] i love teaching dogs to come when called
[03:25] when playing fetch i mean it's a great
[03:27] way to kill two birds with one stone
[03:29] you're giving your dog a great way to
[03:31] release
[03:32] all of that energy while at the same
[03:34] time they're in this fantastic mood
[03:36] because they love playing fetch
[03:37] and they're running back to you that's
[03:39] the mindset you want your dog in when
[03:41] you're teaching them
[03:42] and i've got a nice long 30 foot lead
[03:44] today what i love about
[03:46] reinforcing come when called like this
[03:48] is that she's not just walking to me
[03:50] she's enthusiastically running to me and
[03:52] we love that
[03:53] so even though it looks like we're
[03:54] playing fetch right now and we are the
[03:56] emphasis on this lesson is really on
[03:58] teaching moira to come to me when i call
[04:00] her there are many ways to teach a
[04:02] recall and this is just one of them not
[04:03] every dog likes fetch
[04:05] that's okay but this one certainly does
[04:07] that's why i'll continue to use this as
[04:09] a training strategy
[04:10] good girl now if at any point she starts
[04:12] to veer off like that
[04:14] there she lost interest she wants to go
[04:16] on a sniff break moira
[04:18] come yes i'm gonna go ahead and keep the
[04:22] lead shortening here just
[04:24] in case she changes her mind so she
[04:26] doesn't get away with running away from
[04:27] me and not listening
[04:29] and there's no harm in reeling them in
[04:30] there sometimes sometimes you just have
[04:32] to do that
[04:32] in order to really enforce the rules
[04:37] moira come
[04:41] yes look at this come when called is
[04:44] looking really good so far at least in
[04:46] this context i'm sure we have a long way
[04:48] to go in other contexts but we got to
[04:50] start somewhere but how about
[04:52] stay i mean you remember stay is
[04:53] something that i'm training and proofing
[04:55] in a variety
[04:56] of different situations i mean she's
[04:57] learned stay at the doorway she's
[04:59] learned stay for a period of time in the
[05:00] living room but
[05:01] learning to stay while we play fetch out
[05:03] here in this new environment tour is
[05:05] quite a different thing let's change up
[05:07] our currencies a little bit and see if
[05:08] we can get her a little more engaged
[05:10] stay yes stay
[05:13] let me see if i can do that from farther
[05:15] away though yes
[05:18] good
[05:22] stay i want to be very clear about stay
[05:25] with her
[05:28] i want to get her warmed up nope let's
[05:31] see if we can fix that
[05:32] here we go sit stay
[05:36] being very clear with my stop sign hand
[05:40] yes
[05:50] stay
[05:54] stay i'm going to reiterate stay only
[05:56] one additional time i want to avoid
[05:58] saying
[05:59] stay stay stay but there are times where
[06:02] you can
[06:02] give your dog a gentle reminder and i
[06:04] also don't want to keep her in
[06:06] an eternal state either lyra okay yes
[06:09] so i want to give her an end that was
[06:11] pretty good so we have stay for period
[06:13] of time we have stay while we walk away
[06:14] in this new environment
[06:16] let's see if we can make some progress
[06:17] on a more significant stay while
[06:19] distracted
[06:20] stay no
[06:24] all right okay it looks like i got to
[06:27] get her warmed up not reliable on stage
[06:28] just yet
[06:29] sit stay
[06:32] okay okay good borderline right there
[06:36] she started a break but did you see how
[06:38] she thought better of it
[06:39] good so i'm gonna go ahead and give her
[06:41] a free toss there for that one i like
[06:42] that
[06:43] sit stay let's see if we can
[06:46] button that up let me make it easier
[06:51] here okay good girl
[06:54] nice job and i'll release her there from
[06:56] this stay so this is a really good
[06:58] example of
[06:58] sticking with your dog and really
[07:00] teaching them from the inside
[07:02] out stay well distracted is the kind of
[07:04] thing that requires
[07:05] months and months of reinforcement with
[07:06] your dog but this is where we start
[07:08] stay
[07:10] [Music]
[07:14] moira come ah i love that wild card
[07:18] okay good you can go get the toy if you
[07:20] want that was a really good example
[07:21] right there
[07:22] combining stay income i had her stay
[07:24] while distracted i then called her
[07:26] away from the toy in the other direction
[07:28] which is something you really want to be
[07:30] able to do to get your dog away from
[07:31] something
[07:32] and believe me teaching moira to walk
[07:34] away from a dog
[07:36] when we're on a walk is at the absolute
[07:38] top of my priority list
[07:40] she looks like she's really into that
[07:41] other toy now maybe we can use that as a
[07:43] distraction
[07:44] let's see if we can go nuts sit
[07:48] stay
[07:54] stay
[07:57] come yes sit
[08:02] is she getting trained is this happening
[08:04] right now
[08:06] yes good girl as she continues to do
[08:09] better and better with this exercise i'm
[08:11] going to continue to challenge her by
[08:13] doing the same exercise but from farther
[08:15] and farther away
[08:16] in general the farther we are from our
[08:18] dogs the more
[08:19] fragile our communication becomes so we
[08:21] have to work hard to strengthen that
[08:23] communication this is how you do it
[08:25] good girl i'll go ahead and give her an
[08:27] enthusiastic tug of war here
[08:29] just to keep training up let her know i
[08:31] love that energetic dogs like this
[08:33] definitely a lot to take in a lot to
[08:35] work with but they can be
[08:36] so bright once you start getting through
[08:38] to them they're so motivated to exist in
[08:41] this world and have a good time
[08:42] so we just have to take that into
[08:44] account when we're training them
[08:45] energetic dogs are super misunderstood
[08:47] in that way
[08:48] so if your dog is like this use things
[08:49] like this to your advantage
[08:51] good girl and she's really understanding
[08:53] the concept of yes and no here
[08:55] two concepts that she didn't seem to
[08:57] fully understand just a couple of days
[08:58] ago
[08:59] okay get it good girl let go
[09:02] i want to give her a few tosses in a row
[09:04] right now because i want it to stay fun
[09:05] i don't want it to be like stay throw
[09:07] the toy stay throw the toy
[09:09] stay okay okay get it
[09:13] i like how she wants to make sure that
[09:15] i'm really sure about okay that's
[09:17] pretty cool too so i want to be really
[09:18] obvious about what okay means
[09:21] stay really close to her that time love
[09:24] how she's looking at me
[09:26] throw the treats at her this treat bag
[09:30] stay she wasn't expecting that
[09:35] come get it good girl
[09:39] so i'm real pleased with that i'm gonna
[09:40] continue to work on that throughout the
[09:41] day but that's where our stay
[09:43] and recall lessons are right now i'd
[09:45] love to be able to go on a walk with her
[09:47] and see how she does too i'm gonna give
[09:49] her a little bit of a mental break right
[09:50] now that's important
[09:51] not to throw too much on your dog at one
[09:53] time and then we're gonna go on a walk
[09:55] and see how she does
[09:56] now look throughout this series many
[09:57] people have commented that i need to
[09:58] throw a choke chain or a prong collar or
[10:00] an electric collar and get this dog
[10:02] under control
[10:03] as if that is what it's going to take
[10:05] for a dog like this to learn
[10:06] we're really starting to see glimmers of
[10:08] these advanced concepts like
[10:10] stay when distracted for example without
[10:12] having to use leash pops or
[10:14] excessive leash pressure or electrical
[10:17] stimulation
[10:18] with a special e-collar and modern
[10:19] science has shown us that our guiding
[10:21] principle as
[10:22] dog training professionals needs to be
[10:24] to use the least
[10:25] aversive or least harsh method that's
[10:28] likely to get the job done
[10:30] when we avoid using these quick fix
[10:31] methods in exchange for a thoughtful
[10:34] approach that goes a layer
[10:35] deeper it may take a minute to see
[10:37] actual results but at least you're
[10:38] getting a true
[10:39] authentic result rather than something
[10:41] that has the
[10:42] illusion of a result for example let's
[10:45] say
[10:46] i gave moira a firm leash pop with a
[10:48] prong collar
[10:49] for going after a distraction and
[10:50] training she would likely stop
[10:52] lunging at least in that instance for a
[10:54] moment to avoid that unpleasant feeling
[10:56] around her neck right but she could also
[10:58] start to associate those very
[10:59] unpleasant corrections with her overall
[11:01] training sessions with me
[11:02] or even things around her like other
[11:04] dogs or even people
[11:06] because of the high risk of side effects
[11:07] and the fact that every scientific study
[11:10] i've been able to find tells me that
[11:11] these training methods are not worth the
[11:13] risk
[11:13] i prefer to take the time to show her
[11:15] what i actually want her to do
[11:17] like come when i call her or stay in the
[11:19] face of a distraction
[11:21] not because she fears the result but
[11:23] because she understands the concept
[11:25] bottom line choke prong and electric
[11:27] collars are super basic they're
[11:28] superficial and i've never encountered
[11:31] once in my entire dog training career an
[11:33] instance
[11:34] where using those tools was the least
[11:36] aversive method that was likely to work
[11:38] i know all of you love science so i'm
[11:40] going to have a lot of sources in the
[11:41] description of this video to back all of
[11:43] this up
[11:44] more as leash manners what
[11:47] what leash man moira doesn't have any
[11:49] leash manners
[11:50] she's only just had her first outing in
[11:52] public last episode which was kind of a
[11:55] complete nightmare
[11:56] i mean look she was actually doing
[11:57] pretty good that is until she saw a dog
[11:59] that was like two miles away
[12:02] and i can tell you spoiler alert that's
[12:04] definitely going to be the biggest issue
[12:05] in this training session
[12:07] stay i feel genuinely honestly in the
[12:10] bit that i've been working with her
[12:12] today that we're actually just now
[12:13] having
[12:14] serious breakthroughs like we're really
[12:16] starting to be able to talk to each
[12:17] other i'm pretty happy now with where we
[12:19] are but i hope i didn't just jinx this
[12:21] lesson
[12:22] yeah i totally just jinxed this lesson
[12:26] okay nice job girl it's normal to feel
[12:29] disconnected in those first few days
[12:31] it can be challenging to build that
[12:33] initial communication and to teach your
[12:35] dog something as basic as
[12:36] yeah that's good and no let's not do
[12:38] that which is what we've been focused on
[12:40] along with some basic skills so you can
[12:42] ask them to do incompatible behaviors
[12:44] with things you don't like like when
[12:46] they're jumping you can ask them to sit
[12:47] and stay for example
[12:48] okay i'm on a tangent we gotta go leash
[12:50] training come on let's go
[12:52] i've elected to go without her muzzle at
[12:55] this point because
[12:56] there aren't too many distractions out
[12:58] here yesterday we went to one location
[13:00] to do dog training it wasn't very busy
[13:02] and moira did basically okay i mean she
[13:04] definitely had some issues and outbursts
[13:06] but
[13:07] more or less she did well and then we
[13:08] went to a second location it had just a
[13:10] few more distractions and moira was
[13:13] extremely
[13:14] challenging to work with in that
[13:15] environment so i figured this park
[13:17] is a little bit of both like we have the
[13:19] occasional dog the occasional walker
[13:21] this is kind of a hybrid between the two
[13:23] places we went to yesterday
[13:24] see the puppy yes
[13:29] here it's an excited puppy too here as
[13:32] this dog approaches i want to do a test
[13:34] and see if moira is receptive to taking
[13:36] a treat so i'm going to offer her one
[13:38] right at her nose but as you can see
[13:40] she's a lot more interested in watching
[13:42] that dog than she is in my tree
[13:44] so here my communication has completely
[13:46] broken down because
[13:48] she's over her threshold the next best
[13:50] thing i can do here is manage her and
[13:52] increase the distance and i can do that
[13:53] by letting the dog get farther away or
[13:55] escorting her farther away
[13:57] i think now the dog is getting far
[13:58] enough away where i can communicate with
[14:00] her
[14:02] okay moyra let's go you read my mind
[14:05] a little aroused but at least she's
[14:06] going wrong yes good girl
[14:08] here that was wonderful do you want this
[14:12] good job it seemed as though she was
[14:14] saying
[14:15] i really want to look at that puppy as a
[14:17] beginner i have to be okay with that to
[14:18] a degree we have to let our dogs be dogs
[14:21] and so even though she was acting really
[14:22] excited there the fact that she was
[14:24] moving away from the puppy
[14:25] definitely worth rewarding and
[14:26] acknowledging so as soon as the dog got
[14:28] farther away moira started to get more
[14:30] receptive to listening to me this
[14:32] is a step in the right direction so
[14:34] right off the bat there we had a little
[14:35] bit of an issue but i'm still pretty
[14:36] encouraged it's already better than
[14:38] yesterday
[14:40] and just when i thought i was far enough
[14:42] away moira had another outburst
[14:44] as someone walked past moira moira
[14:47] no ma'am hey here
[14:51] here come on yes good
[14:54] sit ideally that we don't want that
[14:58] outburst happening
[14:59] so i want to prevent it yes i want to do
[15:01] it before she has another one
[15:03] see what i mean sit good
[15:07] stay look at me let's go
[15:11] yeah nice job there's a car coming by
[15:14] the police like to
[15:15] patrol the levee here so it's a police
[15:17] vehicle coming by so far she hasn't
[15:18] really been reactive to vehicles but
[15:21] maybe she's like those aren't supposed
[15:22] to be here
[15:24] because they are unusual to see
[15:27] there we go hey good job let's go
[15:32] trying to see if i can get her in play
[15:33] mode we have a couple of dogs coming
[15:35] here
[15:36] whoa go get it maura can't focus on me
[15:38] toys treats or
[15:40] anything else if she detects a dog
[15:42] anywhere
[15:43] on planet earth the other dog is quite
[15:45] excited as well so i want to make sure i
[15:46] have a good grip on her want to keep
[15:48] full control
[15:49] when you're doing early leash training
[15:51] sessions with a dog like this the
[15:52] process can be
[15:53] very bumpy to say the least it's hard to
[15:55] keep your dog's sustained attention at
[15:57] times for sure
[15:58] you can see me trying here and failing
[16:00] miserably at times but i'm not gonna
[16:02] give up
[16:02] oh my gosh so you can see
[16:07] i'm going to try and create some
[16:08] distance here
[16:10] let's go come on girl
[16:14] what i also like about this training
[16:16] location is that i can very easily
[16:18] create as much distance as i need to in
[16:21] order to gain a better
[16:22] understanding of her working distance
[16:23] that is the distance from a distraction
[16:25] where she's still
[16:26] able to listen to me you can see she's
[16:28] just unruly here
[16:30] so this is what i'm gonna do i got her
[16:31] attention come on let's go
[16:33] here come and my goal is to get her to
[16:35] walk towards the dog and
[16:37] away from the dog while i ask her while
[16:39] we're teetering at the edge of our
[16:40] working distance
[16:42] and take note of how far away that dog
[16:44] actually is from us
[16:45] pretty far yes good job
[16:48] good work my goal for this lesson is
[16:51] just to see if i can walk and get
[16:52] into a groove with her where i feel like
[16:54] she's starting to understand the concept
[16:56] of walking nicely on a leash
[16:58] which we haven't really seen a ton of
[17:00] yet
[17:01] and you know with these types of lessons
[17:03] you have to pick your battles
[17:04] there's a little bit of tension on the
[17:06] leash from time to time but more or less
[17:08] i mean she's walking okay right now so i
[17:10] want to let her know i appreciate that
[17:12] by letting her continue to walk moira
[17:15] here
[17:16] yes good girl nice job there we go
[17:20] so if you feel like when you're training
[17:21] your dog to walk on leash that there's
[17:23] no
[17:23] end in sight understand that's a
[17:25] completely normal feeling i was feeling
[17:27] it yesterday
[17:28] i was almost having a meltdown oh my
[17:30] gosh what if we don't get moira trained
[17:32] what if she doesn't learn anything
[17:33] youtube's gonna cancel me but no in all
[17:36] seriousness i
[17:37] can tell that maura is a very smart girl
[17:39] and even if she didn't show a lot of
[17:41] progress or success i would be
[17:42] completely
[17:43] fine with that because we have to accept
[17:44] our dogs for who they are i'd love to
[17:46] get up here to the
[17:47] path so i can get her used to walking on
[17:49] the pedestrian path let's go this way
[17:53] okay right now complete lack of focus
[17:57] i'm just going to stop right here let
[17:59] her come to terms with reality for a
[18:01] second
[18:02] and then ask for her attention before i
[18:04] proceed good girl here
[18:06] yes now i got her attention i just had
[18:08] to wait it out
[18:09] i'll take the sit okay let's go come on
[18:11] one major part of training your dog to
[18:13] walk on a leash is to make sure that you
[18:14] can quickly and easily turn directions
[18:16] in case you have to for whatever reason
[18:18] you don't want to be negotiating with
[18:19] your dog like that
[18:20] moira yes let's go this way it's a great
[18:24] way to reliably get their attention once
[18:26] they get good at it
[18:26] so there she gave me her attention i
[18:28] gave her a treat i let her continue to
[18:30] sniff
[18:31] pretty loose leash right now moira come
[18:33] on
[18:35] good girl she's more interested in the
[18:36] environment than she is a treat right
[18:38] now that can be a reinforcing event for
[18:40] her because bottom line she's not
[18:41] lunging at anyone
[18:42] and she's not pulling too obnoxiously
[18:44] right now so as long as she's generally
[18:46] good the walk continues
[18:47] let me test her attention again
[18:50] moira here
[18:54] i give that a c minus
[18:58] no doubt this training session has been
[19:00] very challenging for both moira
[19:02] and me when you and your dog are
[19:03] struggling like moira and i were
[19:05] at the beginning of this training
[19:06] session it can be really hard
[19:08] to see the light at the end of the
[19:09] tunnel but it looks like our last
[19:11] several days of training are about to
[19:13] start paying off
[19:14] moira yes good
[19:18] moira this way
[19:21] good like those circles sit
[19:24] yes good
[19:28] good girl okay it looks like moira
[19:31] is really focused in right now i'm gonna
[19:34] give my complete
[19:35] attention to her as i walk i'm just
[19:37] going to let this play out
[19:38] uncut for a while and just let you guys
[19:39] watch how it looks
[19:41] yes any attention i'm going to reward
[19:43] while we're moving
[19:46] moira yes
[19:53] yes
[19:58] i think at this point i've done zillions
[19:59] of leash walking training sessions with
[20:01] dogs and it's rare when they start off
[20:03] like this one did to have any hope of
[20:05] success
[20:06] during that particular lesson at least
[20:08] any dramatic success
[20:09] girl yes
[20:13] really on a roll right now here
[20:16] this way good it's normal to have an
[20:20] absolutely terrible training session and
[20:22] the very next day
[20:23] things go completely different as long
[20:25] as you're really consistent and you keep
[20:27] things positive and fun for your dog
[20:29] while you're training them there's no
[20:30] reason they won't continue to learn at a
[20:32] pretty fast rate
[20:33] and always make an effort to connect
[20:34] with your individual dog
[20:36] no two dogs are really the same so you
[20:38] have to cater your approach to your
[20:41] dog not somebody else's
[20:44] gonna a little sniffing is fine
[20:49] but that's enough come on wow
[20:54] i'm just blown away right now
[20:58] you might notice the rapid rate of
[20:59] reinforcement right now because with a
[21:01] high drive dog like this a lot of you
[21:02] will know this just because you have
[21:04] treats doesn't mean they're going to pay
[21:05] attention to it so
[21:06] you really have to take advantage of
[21:08] those moments in the beginning when
[21:09] they're really receptive to try and get
[21:11] in there and then you don't want to
[21:12] overdo it either you know you want to
[21:14] make sure that they
[21:15] have time to be a dog and do the weird
[21:17] things that dogs like to do
[21:18] let's test it here we've been doing this
[21:20] for a minute
[21:21] moira come on
[21:26] good girl yes
[21:29] i'm doing fewer rewards right now
[21:33] here good girl
[21:39] isn't this good let's pick up the pace a
[21:41] little what do you do if i jog
[21:43] look at that prance here
[21:46] yes what this is our best leash training
[21:49] session to date
[21:50] right now here moira too much
[21:56] here
[21:58] you're doing so well right now i can't
[22:00] believe it
[22:01] okay this is good but you remember those
[22:03] dogs from earlier you know the ones that
[22:05] made
[22:05] moira completely freak out yeah they're
[22:07] coming back so
[22:08] hey what a great training opportunity it
[22:10] looks like we're gonna get another
[22:11] chance
[22:12] okay these are the same dogs that passed
[22:14] by earlier that moira just went
[22:16] crazy over so we were wrapping up this
[22:18] lesson but i'm like let me give it one
[22:20] last shot to see if i can get her
[22:21] attention
[22:22] at all as these dogs got closer because
[22:25] she is so
[22:26] sensitive the second she sees a dog
[22:28] she's just tuning everything out i think
[22:30] a lot of you will know what i'm talking
[22:31] about
[22:32] laura here yes sit
[22:36] no yes good girl
[22:40] yes
[22:43] yes yes
[22:49] yes watch this
[22:53] okay come on good girl once your dog has
[22:57] a significant barking and lunging
[22:58] outburst towards whatever it is
[23:00] your training has stopped at that moment
[23:02] that's when we fall back on management
[23:03] just try and get your dog under control
[23:05] and away from the thing that's causing
[23:07] them to react if possible consider
[23:09] picking them up that diffuses a lot of
[23:10] dogs if you can
[23:11] your goal when working with a reactive
[23:13] dog is to try and get as many
[23:15] successful instances of compliance as
[23:17] possible even when they're micro seconds
[23:19] in the beginning
[23:20] acknowledge yes i like that you're not
[23:22] barking at that dog whereas you've
[23:23] demonstrated that you would easily bark
[23:25] at that dog just a couple of days ago
[23:27] you know so i really want to let her
[23:29] know in no uncertain terms yes
[23:30] i love that and what else are we doing
[23:32] we're also counter-conditioning her
[23:34] in other words we're giving her really
[23:36] good treats there to let her know hey
[23:38] when you see a dog you get treats you
[23:40] pay attention to me
[23:41] life is just really really great we're
[23:43] about halfway through this experience
[23:45] and i've seen a
[23:46] huge shift in what moira has learned i
[23:48] want to remind you guys she
[23:50] started this series completely untrained
[23:53] literally the only thing that she knew
[23:54] how to do was to sit
[23:56] there's still so much to do though like
[23:58] her jumping on guests and her biting
[24:00] which we're going to address

[00:00] we've got to get serious about our
[00:01] training today this jumping and biting
[00:03] is one of the main reasons that moira's
[00:05] had a difficult time getting adopted
[00:07] these habits must go this is moira and
[00:10] i'm zach george
[00:11] moira the german shepherd dog is looking
[00:12] for a home and i've only got
[00:14] two weeks to teach her how to behave so
[00:16] that someone will be willing to adopt
[00:18] her
[00:18] okay we have a situation and as you can
[00:20] see it's
[00:21] not going to be easy she jumps
[00:23] excessively
[00:24] lunges at almost any distraction moira
[00:28] loves to bark and she
[00:29] definitely pulls on leash and uses her
[00:32] teeth to interact with the world
[00:33] a little too inappropriately i am
[00:35] feeling a little bit overwhelmed
[00:37] if that was a dog she would be like i'm
[00:39] not paying attention to you i'm paying
[00:40] attention to that
[00:43] i will train this dog look at this loose
[00:46] leash right now
[00:47] shake yes much better yes
[00:51] look at me she getting trained this is
[00:53] reality dog training
[00:56] as promised we've got to make up some
[00:58] serious ground here because we are eight
[01:00] days into our two week training process
[01:02] do you know we could not find a full bag
[01:05] of puffer treats anywhere in my house
[01:07] which is crazy because we get them for
[01:08] free and i get them shipped to me
[01:10] all the time puffer treats do not go
[01:12] unused in my house
[01:13] look at the sweet potato treats i like
[01:15] using them to get a dog to go into a
[01:16] crate voluntarily so i'll take a small
[01:18] handful and just toss them in there to
[01:20] mix things up throwing in freeze-dried
[01:21] salmon sometimes can be really effective
[01:23] in my training
[01:24] these are just straight up freeze dried
[01:26] meat when you're serious about training
[01:27] you want to have those high value
[01:29] currencies on standby everywhere if you
[01:31] decide to check out pup retreats use my
[01:32] link i'll have it below in the
[01:34] description
[01:34] i just love this dog and how awesome her
[01:36] personality is but holy cow
[01:38] this biting we really need to get this
[01:40] play biting under control i mean
[01:42] seriously this is a huge problem with
[01:44] adult rescue dogs it's leftover puppy
[01:46] biting but since they didn't have a
[01:47] traditional family to raise them during
[01:49] those first few months of life they have
[01:51] to understand that they can't interact
[01:52] with the world
[01:53] with their mouth in the way that they
[01:54] might want to and like we've established
[01:56] before
[01:56] dogs use their mouth like this because
[01:58] that's how they grab things i mean they
[01:59] don't have hands like we do so we have
[02:01] to show them how to behave
[02:02] stopping clay biting 101 is about
[02:05] redirecting your dog's attention onto a
[02:07] treat or a toy as we've done
[02:08] many times in the past but there's more
[02:11] to stopping play biting than just that
[02:13] so today rather than focusing on
[02:15] redirection
[02:16] constantly i want to kind of teach her a
[02:19] little bit about bite inhibition
[02:20] she does love being pet but as we just
[02:23] saw you can't pet her without her
[02:25] going a little crazy so that is the
[02:27] thing that i really want to address
[02:29] her pursuing a human hand with her mouth
[02:32] open
[02:32] with adult clay biting sometimes it can
[02:34] take a little bit longer
[02:36] because it's more habitualized they've
[02:37] been doing it for a longer period of
[02:39] time
[02:39] so it can take a minute be patient with
[02:41] them i'm also hoping to desensitize her
[02:43] to the human touch
[02:44] so that she doesn't feel the need to
[02:46] just say hey let go of me every time i
[02:48] grab her harness or something
[02:49] sit nice see that
[02:53] sit and granted you shouldn't rush up to
[02:56] a dog to do that but
[02:57] doesn't mean it won't happen from time
[02:59] to time and
[03:01] teeth on human flesh from a dog that
[03:02] looks like this can very easily get
[03:04] misinterpreted by a lot of people
[03:06] so i'm gonna break out the chicken here
[03:08] number one just to get her
[03:10] in food mode when dogs are in food mode
[03:12] they're a little less bitey
[03:13] they tend to be a little more licky so
[03:16] i'm gonna use some treats here and
[03:18] look how good her behavior becomes when
[03:20] these treats are out that's really a
[03:21] good start
[03:23] good girl now we're not gonna have to
[03:24] use treats all the time this is just to
[03:27] motivate her in the short term to
[03:28] understand what we're looking for here
[03:30] sit
[03:31] lie down good girl hey that lie down's
[03:34] looking great
[03:35] that's something she didn't do when she
[03:36] first came here very good so what
[03:39] yes very good i want to be able to touch
[03:42] her right here under her chin without
[03:43] her being chompy
[03:44] good girl that's a good start
[03:48] yes i love the lick that's what i'm
[03:50] looking for like anytime she's licking
[03:52] where she was otherwise biting i'm gonna
[03:54] reinforce that
[03:55] say a three-year-old comes up to her
[03:56] head uh-huh
[03:58] yes i like the licking that's what i
[04:00] want to see yes good girl
[04:03] and dogs don't like being pet in the way
[04:05] that i'm doing here but she still needs
[04:06] to be very tolerant of that no matter
[04:08] what
[04:09] so i'm just trying to get her
[04:10] comfortable and short bursts
[04:12] of aggressive human touching because
[04:14] that really is what gets her going when
[04:16] you start roughhousing with her or
[04:18] petting her vigorously she can get real
[04:20] bitey sit
[04:21] yes just giving her very small treats
[04:26] yes very good
[04:29] what happens if i grab her foot yeah i'd
[04:31] rather you give me your foot
[04:32] here she knows shake we've taught her
[04:35] that
[04:36] good do you see the licking she's
[04:38] starting to get the picture but it's
[04:39] hard for her to resist the biting
[04:41] let me see if i can get her on her back
[04:43] for a belly rub
[04:44] yes good
[04:47] girl see look that look at all this
[04:50] licking that's happening
[04:52] there's still a little bit of biting
[04:53] there but it's starting to shift towards
[04:55] licking and i've got her on her back
[04:56] here because i've noticed this is when
[04:58] she tends to get the most playful
[04:59] you touch these feet this is actually
[05:01] quite relevant right now
[05:04] because i'm going to be trimming her
[05:05] nails hopefully successfully
[05:07] in a moment that's why i wanted to do
[05:09] this exercise first so she doesn't
[05:10] become bitey
[05:11] but look how i'm able to like touch her
[05:13] feet right now i'm kind of distracting
[05:14] her with the treats
[05:16] just to make sure she's really into it
[05:17] but now let's do it separately
[05:20] yep that was a lick as well she
[05:22] addressed my hand but she didn't put
[05:23] teeth
[05:24] on my hand that's really what i'm going
[05:25] for here yes i love the licking
[05:29] and so this is just kind of an example
[05:30] how a very quick
[05:32] training session might look when you're
[05:33] trying to address the biting in those
[05:35] first few weeks of having a dog whether
[05:37] they're an adult or a puppy or whatever
[05:38] this doesn't get resolved in one
[05:40] training session this is something i'm
[05:41] gonna do with her over the next week and
[05:42] hopefully we'll cut way back on it
[05:44] and of course as a reminder it's okay
[05:46] for your dog to bite with permission too
[05:49] right so she loves playing with plush
[05:51] toys like this
[05:53] and that gives her a satisfaction of
[05:54] biting so it's okay for dogs to bite
[05:56] only with permission and in certain ways
[05:59] do you see what i mean
[06:00] let's just do a quick check in on her
[06:01] let go i'm so proud of her let go
[06:03] let go
[06:08] yes good girl so super proud of that
[06:12] good
[06:13] teaching maurya how to conduct herself
[06:14] with her teeth is super important but
[06:16] also important is her impulse control
[06:19] especially
[06:20] with a dog with some serious play drive
[06:22] like moira i want to continue to
[06:24] surprise her with artificial
[06:26] distractions
[06:27] regularly i'm also trying to keep her
[06:29] pretty sharp with her surprise
[06:30] stays that is stay on short notice when
[06:34] she's really excited
[06:35] okay you can do it okay sometimes she's
[06:38] a little confused on okay
[06:39] oh wow i'd even landed in the crate love
[06:41] that she went in the crate to get it
[06:42] this is the kind of thing you just do
[06:44] all the time with the dog in many
[06:46] different ways
[06:47] stay and then
[06:50] okay come getting her to come to me i'm
[06:53] gonna give her a treat for that
[06:54] yes at some point in the future i'm
[06:56] hoping to
[06:57] make her recall a little more advanced
[06:59] by having her come
[07:00] right past something that she's
[07:02] distracted by to me but if there's
[07:04] something that she likes and it's
[07:05] between me and her she's very likely to
[07:07] choose the thing i mean
[07:08] yesterday i work on calling her away
[07:10] from a distraction which also has its
[07:12] whole host of benefits but i still want
[07:14] her to come to me even if she's gotta
[07:15] pass something that's an inch away from
[07:17] her
[07:18] between her and me stay
[07:22] okay come not quite see it's hard for
[07:26] her she's like i'll get to pick up this
[07:27] thing that i like on the way
[07:29] but we don't want that that's a
[07:30] distraction let go
[07:34] sit stay
[07:42] okay come yes trying to lean her away
[07:44] from the distraction
[07:45] the problem seems to be when it's like
[07:47] directly in her path if i have it
[07:49] slightly off to the side it's a little
[07:50] bit easier for her but i want
[07:52] a cat to be able to run right in between
[07:54] us and her come to me instead
[07:56] okay clearly we're far away from that
[08:01] okay thank you i appreciate that she's
[08:04] like i'll just go get another one
[08:05] so this is a nice distraction i like
[08:07] this one she's into it look at that
[08:09] moira is even more intense about this
[08:11] toy which means she wants it even more
[08:13] than the last one and it would be really
[08:15] nice to be able to call her attention
[08:17] off something like that that she's
[08:18] really excited about as we continue to
[08:20] work up to getting her attention
[08:22] off of dogs in the future so basically
[08:25] we're trying to get her to come to me
[08:26] while drawing on that
[08:27] leave it experience she's had in the
[08:29] past in a few different contexts okay
[08:31] come
[08:32] ah sit stay
[08:37] okay you can see this is extremely hard
[08:41] for her we're having a tough time right
[08:42] now i thought i'd be able to get through
[08:44] to her on this
[08:45] let me make a little bit easier for her
[08:46] stay
[08:51] uh-uh here like she's into that look at
[08:54] me
[08:56] okay come i'm gonna do it a real short
[08:58] range right here all right so by getting
[09:00] a little bit closer to her
[09:02] she's more likely to listen to me that
[09:03] supports the hypothesis of the small
[09:06] training bubble so that is the closer
[09:07] you are to your dog the more likely they
[09:09] are to listen to you at first
[09:10] let's give this a shot again look at me
[09:13] okay
[09:15] come yes much better that's so good
[09:18] it seems when i really break it down for
[09:20] her and i make it extra easy she's much
[09:22] more likely to listen to me let me see
[09:23] if i can get a couple of successes here
[09:25] sit stay
[09:30] okay come yes just using different body
[09:33] language there
[09:34] very obviously showing her that i wanted
[09:37] to come in this direction
[09:38] slightly away i mean it makes a
[09:40] difference
[09:41] stay
[09:45] okay come much better all right so we've
[09:48] got some work to do there
[09:50] but she's starting to do better with
[09:53] coming to me when there's a distraction
[09:55] between us i want to set expectations
[09:57] and make it clear
[09:58] that teaching your dog to come and stay
[10:00] with heavy distractions in a variety of
[10:02] contexts
[10:03] is something you focus on for the first
[10:04] two years you have them the idea is that
[10:06] you get
[10:07] 80 there in pretty short order and then
[10:09] it's that last 20
[10:11] where they're thrown wild cards in
[10:12] various situations that you have to
[10:14] really
[10:14] make sure they're prepared for and we do
[10:16] that by having them on lead controlling
[10:18] their environment making sure
[10:20] they're not in a position to get away
[10:21] from us that's why we're always
[10:22] practicing in different settings and
[10:24] situations
[10:25] it's time to give moira a quick break so
[10:26] i want to give you guys a quick update
[10:28] on how moira has been doing when i leave
[10:29] her alone you'll remember that we've
[10:31] been working on moira's separation
[10:32] anxiety and so far that anxiety seems to
[10:35] be
[10:35] limited to crate anxiety so i've been
[10:38] leaving her alone in a larger enclosed
[10:40] area
[10:41] that has an open crate in there that
[10:42] seems to be helping her stress levels
[10:44] remain low while also desensitizing her
[10:47] to being alone let me show you what i do
[10:49] that's been making the process
[10:50] a little bit easier i've got some kibble
[10:53] here
[10:54] and so i'll just pour like a quarter cup
[10:57] kind of just on the floor there just to
[10:59] get her focused on
[11:00] being comfortable in here she's come to
[11:02] look forward to this for the day so
[11:04] she's pretty preoccupied there
[11:10] then i'll keep an eye on her i've got a
[11:12] couple of cameras in there
[11:14] we'll see how she does this might be one
[11:16] of my favorite devices on earth if
[11:18] you're looking for an
[11:18] excellent dog camera that also allows
[11:20] you to give your dog treats then you
[11:22] need a furbo
[11:23] it's super advanced it has tons of smart
[11:25] alerts like barking alerts and even
[11:27] safety alerts so it keeps you updated on
[11:29] how your dog is doing even when you're
[11:31] not
[11:31] actively looking at them on your phone
[11:33] i'll have a link in the description
[11:34] where you can check out verbo dog camera
[11:36] by the way
[11:37] pupford treats fit perfectly in here
[11:40] moira jumped on me
[11:41] this morning and i was noticing how long
[11:43] her nails were we're going to talk more
[11:44] about jumping later but
[11:46] getting your dog comfortable with basic
[11:48] things like a nail dremel can be very
[11:50] important if this is how you choose to
[11:51] maintain their nails there's a motorized
[11:53] sound in here it can be a little
[11:54] ticklish or
[11:55] off-putting to them so i'm hoping to
[11:57] introduce her to this right now
[11:59] very good see i'm just letting her smell
[12:01] it see that
[12:02] yes so i'm going to show it to her give
[12:06] her some chick
[12:07] she's so sh so far she obviously likes
[12:08] it maybe a little too much
[12:10] i'm going to turn it on real quick just
[12:11] for a sec stay
[12:18] here sit no
[12:21] okay a lot of dogs get really frightened
[12:23] over that moira so far is very intrigued
[12:25] by it why am i not surprised
[12:27] come here girl sit stay
[12:31] leave it uh-uh leave it nope
[12:34] leave it alone yes with her it seems
[12:38] pretty effective to have some treats
[12:39] right here
[12:40] easy i like that she's licking not
[12:42] biting too hard
[12:44] yes so here i can have it on high
[12:47] she's still interested in the treats
[12:49] whoa easy you remember
[12:50] lie down let me see if i can put her
[12:51] into a more stable position here
[12:54] good girl
[12:58] yes good i i like that she's not scared
[13:01] by it
[13:05] remember shake
[13:08] shake yes
[13:12] see here now i'm going to touch it to
[13:14] her nail leave it alone leave it
[13:18] lie down yes uh-uh
[13:22] leave it all right i need to take a step
[13:24] back here we have to work on leave it
[13:26] leave it yes
[13:30] here look at me yes
[13:34] leave it alone look at me yes
[13:38] leave it alone here look at me
[13:42] yes come
[13:45] yes very good i mean just connecting the
[13:48] dots here
[13:49] stay yes
[13:53] good girl leave it
[13:56] yes good
[13:59] yes oh boy okay sit
[14:03] she did not like that at all so i'm
[14:05] gonna stop right there because i think
[14:06] we're gonna make it worse i barely
[14:07] touched her with it i thought she was at
[14:09] that point because she was leaving it
[14:10] alone she was behaving acceptably
[14:12] while it was off i mean who knows what
[14:14] her background is on this but clearly
[14:16] she has a ways to go on the dremel so
[14:18] i'm going to hold off on that for now
[14:20] and these are the critical moments i
[14:21] mean when you see that your dog has gone
[14:23] too far with something give them a break
[14:25] take a step back and reevaluate so
[14:27] that's what i'll be doing with the
[14:28] dremel what i don't want to do is force
[14:29] my way through and neither should you
[14:31] because you don't want to make
[14:33] an issue that's potentially bad even
[14:35] worse so i'm going to introduce her
[14:37] to these instead some more traditional
[14:39] nail clippers come here girl
[14:41] we'll see how she does hopefully this
[14:43] will get a little more smooth see this
[14:45] you want to smell these
[14:47] she's like whatever good
[14:51] good touching our nails here notice i'm
[14:53] letting her nibble on the chicken a
[14:55] little bit here too
[14:56] good sit
[15:00] shake good
[15:04] nice all right her foot's a little bit
[15:05] sensitive let me try
[15:07] something else to make this even lower
[15:09] stress for her we have this mat here
[15:11] from pup bird which is really great for
[15:14] things like this i'm hoping this might
[15:15] help us
[15:16] there's some peanut butter spread out
[15:17] you see all these grooves so it makes it
[15:19] last a longer time so
[15:21] hopefully this will get her a little
[15:22] more at ease with having her nails
[15:24] trimmed
[15:24] so far she's doing really well and since
[15:26] she is so
[15:27] focused on this peanut butter i think
[15:29] i'm just gonna take my chances and dive
[15:31] into it here
[15:33] so here we're counter conditioning her
[15:34] like getting her to be more tolerant of
[15:36] something that she typically isn't
[15:38] and she's getting a good experience of
[15:39] eating that peanut butter at the same
[15:41] time and she's like hey i don't mind
[15:42] this so much so we'll cater our approach
[15:44] to her
[15:45] you're doing so great yes
[15:50] her back ones look pretty short actually
[15:52] so i think we're okay there
[15:54] but really good first nail trimming
[15:56] experience for her
[15:57] some dogs are gonna be more comfortable
[15:59] with certain approaches versus others i
[16:01] mean that's the lesson we've learned
[16:02] here right the dremel
[16:03] too overwhelming for her but the
[16:05] traditional nail clippers she was fine
[16:07] with those so we'll take it
[16:08] good job girl i'll have a link to the
[16:10] pup for lick mats in the description
[16:12] we got a dog right out here okay we
[16:14] gotta jump into a secondary training
[16:15] session she's dog reactive but i'm in a
[16:17] golden opportunity here to make some
[16:19] progress on this
[16:20] because i'm inside the dog is outside
[16:22] she's likely not going to be as
[16:23] stimulated as if we were on a walk so
[16:25] it's kind of an
[16:26] in-between session where i might be able
[16:28] to get a victory let me see if i can get
[16:29] her to come to me when i call her while
[16:30] that dog is out there that would be huge
[16:33] laura here yes good
[16:36] sit yes okay you want to go look let's
[16:40] look
[16:40] i don't want her totally repressing her
[16:42] desire to check out the dog
[16:44] okay moira come yeah good girl
[16:47] nice job okay good
[16:50] good moira come yes
[16:55] that's a good example of a secondary
[16:57] training session where you just have to
[16:58] snap into training mode okay
[17:00] um and really address the issues so
[17:02] right there i saw it was a great
[17:04] opportunity to practice a strong recall
[17:06] in the presence of a dog albeit
[17:08] a lot easier for her see we're in here
[17:10] right now if we were outside
[17:12] inches away from the dog it wouldn't
[17:14] have been as easy but you have to get it
[17:16] right here before you can get it right
[17:18] out there
[17:19] this is a good example of being
[17:20] consistent and you want to do this
[17:22] wherever possible
[17:23] and just as a reminder we don't want to
[17:24] rely on training sessions like this
[17:27] to completely train our dog these are
[17:28] just supplementary we still have to go
[17:30] out of our way to do training sessions
[17:32] and the presence of dogs in the distance
[17:34] much like we did just yesterday with
[17:36] moira but
[17:37] that's very good she is getting smarter
[17:39] exponentially by the day
[17:41] as far as her jumping goes that's
[17:43] something we really want to get under
[17:44] control she's doing really well with me
[17:46] because
[17:47] we've been working together a lot and
[17:49] right now she's pretty into the training
[17:50] session but you saw just a moment ago
[17:52] she was really excited right now i'm
[17:53] giving her a treat to really reinforce
[17:55] the calm behavior so i like that
[17:57] a lot i mean if you think about it at
[17:59] its simplest
[18:00] teaching a dog not to jump on you is
[18:02] just getting them to sit and stay when
[18:04] they're excited right
[18:05] i've done a number of those drills with
[18:07] her throughout this last week or so
[18:09] but when she sees someone new it's a
[18:12] little bit more tempting and you might
[18:13] remember that brianna's mom
[18:15] was over here pretty recently and moira
[18:17] was just a little too out of control for
[18:20] my liking she's coming over in a little
[18:22] bit i'm hoping we can use her as a real
[18:24] life training distraction
[18:25] this is something that most of you can
[18:27] do as well if you've got a friend of the
[18:28] family or a relative or
[18:30] anyone who can come over to help you
[18:32] with teaching your dog not to jump
[18:34] on other people that's always nice
[18:36] hoping to make some progress with her
[18:38] on that teaching her how to sit and stay
[18:40] when genuinely excited
[18:42] by someone other than me i have two main
[18:44] tips number one
[18:45] exercise your dog literally just before
[18:48] they come over
[18:49] you want your dog tired and preferably
[18:52] panting
[18:52] as your guest walks up to the door so
[18:54] they've had some recent fulfillment
[18:57] secondly have your dog restrained or on
[18:59] leash
[19:00] so that you can easily manage them if
[19:02] they are a little too
[19:03] out of control so i'll be doing that
[19:05] with her as well as we go through this
[19:06] jumping lesson
[19:07] the goal is going to be to have bree's
[19:10] mom my mother-in-law
[19:11] pet her without getting jumped on you
[19:14] think you can do this
[19:16] not really sure how this is going to go
[19:18] i don't know if this is a good idea
[19:20] moira please be nice to her i really
[19:23] need her to like me okay
[19:24] there's chicken in it for you if you do
[19:26] well okay come on in deb
[19:28] oh this is gonna be crazy you wanna go
[19:30] say hi let's go say hi
[19:32] good okay so right there that's why we
[19:34] have him on leash and see
[19:35] is deb a pro or what she knows exactly
[19:37] what to do
[19:38] it's as though we've known each other
[19:40] for almost a decade
[19:42] good girl back here so i'm gonna
[19:43] actually back off a little with her and
[19:45] you can step back
[19:46] maybe just a little bit very good good
[19:49] girl but you can see her
[19:51] desire here is to immediately jump and
[19:53] greet her at the face
[19:54] you're a big scary german shepherd
[19:56] though you can't do that
[19:57] the bottom line here is that they are
[19:59] going to get the attention they want
[20:01] as long as they keep all four paws on
[20:02] the ground and if they jump
[20:04] then whatever it is they want whether
[20:06] it's treats the other person
[20:08] a toy or anything that goes away that's
[20:11] how we provide an
[20:12] unpleasant consequence to undesired
[20:14] behavior but we don't have to be overly
[20:16] harsh about it
[20:17] that's usually good enough alright so
[20:19] why don't you try and come in slowly
[20:21] to to pet her under the chin and if she
[20:23] looks like she's about to jump just back
[20:25] off
[20:26] yes i'm going to just go ahead and
[20:27] reward if she's not jumping yet
[20:29] yes good yes good i'm trying to prevent
[20:32] the jumping
[20:34] yes from happening this is really good
[20:36] look loose leash
[20:38] let's quit while we're ahead i'm gonna
[20:39] have you back away now yes
[20:41] good girl even got it down there but you
[20:44] can see
[20:46] how delicate that stay is in that
[20:48] situation
[20:49] i'm having to keep that treat right at
[20:50] her face but let's see if we can improve
[20:52] that a little bit having fun so far
[20:54] yeah doing a great job thank you stay
[20:57] okay you want to say hi we say hi gently
[21:02] yes and moira okay come
[21:06] all right that's what i'm gonna do this
[21:08] time before she starts jumping i'm gonna
[21:10] call her away so she has some experience
[21:13] of being called away from something
[21:14] exciting
[21:15] say hi hey good girl okay come
[21:18] see that so we're interrupting the
[21:20] behavior before it occurs
[21:22] when you have company coming over if you
[21:24] don't feel like going through all this
[21:25] have your dog in another room
[21:27] and then bring your dog out once
[21:28] everyone is settled and say look i need
[21:30] like five minutes to train my dog and
[21:32] see if you can get someone to help you
[21:33] out like this but if your attention
[21:35] is divided then you can't really hope to
[21:37] train a dog
[21:38] even better i'll take this behavior all
[21:40] day long so here she is
[21:42] flopping on her back hey sweetie yes if
[21:45] you have a willing guest who's willing
[21:46] to help you then they might be able to
[21:48] achieve some results as well but i want
[21:50] to make sure that you
[21:51] know how to deal with this because
[21:52] ultimately it's your responsibility your
[21:54] dog to keep them in a sit stay
[21:56] stay yes
[21:59] yes yes
[22:03] so there i was able to reward a little
[22:06] less frequently than the first time
[22:08] where i had to be constantly there but
[22:10] still pretty rapid
[22:10] just to get the point across yes
[22:14] sit stay
[22:17] don't jump yes that's good i'm nice
[22:21] good stay good girl you're being such a
[22:25] good girl
[22:26] yes you can see it in her eyes she's
[22:28] like i want to jump but i really
[22:31] also want that treat right there if
[22:33] you've got an exuberant jumper
[22:34] this is exactly why you want to have
[22:36] them on leash i know it's weird having
[22:38] your dog on leash inside the house but
[22:40] it's even weirder to have your dog
[22:41] tackling your guests
[22:43] what you'll find with most dogs is they
[22:45] will eventually settle down after just
[22:47] 10
[22:47] 20 minutes tops so if you can just kind
[22:50] of be on them and teach them for that
[22:51] first few minutes
[22:52] there's a very good likelihood that
[22:54] they're going to chill it's just that
[22:55] real initial greeting
[22:56] when most dogs meet other people where
[22:58] they just lose their mind so try to
[23:00] avoid having your dog
[23:01] up in a room too long give them the
[23:03] opportunity to experience being around
[23:06] people where possible
[23:07] if they tend to be excessive jumpers
[23:09] i've got a real
[23:10] stable down stay here let's see how
[23:13] stable it is
[23:15] i'm giving her little treats here just
[23:16] to encourage the duration
[23:18] again by being low to the ground we're
[23:20] discouraging jumping
[23:22] stay
[23:25] so look at that and this is great but
[23:27] i'd still like moira to be able to
[23:30] sit politely while being greeted while
[23:32] deb stands
[23:33] yes nice job
[23:36] and so very good i'd say a lot of
[23:38] progress here nice job moira
[23:40] good girl that's how we greet people
[23:42] it's how we interact with them by not
[23:44] jumping you're such a good girl you stay
[23:47] a little more exuberantly such a good
[23:51] girl
[23:51] yes oh i love you baby
[23:54] can you switch your shoes moira's not
[23:56] only sitting politely but she's also not
[23:58] play biting either
[23:59] and those are two things she definitely
[24:01] would have been doing just a few hours
[24:02] ago
[24:03] okay come i'm gonna quit while we're
[24:04] ahead there to make sure we end
[24:06] on that successful moment because
[24:08] training dogs is all about getting those
[24:10] minor moments at first and then building
[24:12] on those this is her first formal
[24:14] training session
[24:15] on not jumping on other people outside
[24:18] of me
[24:19] so i think she did pretty well we'll
[24:21] continue working on this clearly this
[24:23] isn't something that happens in one
[24:24] training session but this is what you do
[24:26] over and over and over until your dog
[24:28] starts to realize oh
[24:29] okay i guess these are the rules thumbs
[24:31] up for deb check out puffer's
[24:33] exceptional training treats and furbo
[24:35] dog camera too
[24:36] subscribe to my channel follow us on
[24:38] instagram tick tock and even facebook

[00:00] what you're about to see is probably the
[00:02] single biggest mistake i have made
[00:04] with moira so far the single most
[00:06] controversial part of this entire series
[00:08] this is certainly not my proudest moment
[00:10] as a dog trainer
[00:11] girl this is moira and i'm zach george
[00:14] moira the german shepherd dog is looking
[00:15] for a home and i've only got
[00:17] two weeks to teach her how to behave so
[00:19] that someone will be willing to adopt
[00:21] her okay we have a situation
[00:22] and as you can see it's not going to be
[00:25] easy she jumps
[00:26] excessively lunges at almost any
[00:29] distraction
[00:30] moira loves to bark and she definitely
[00:33] pulls on leash and uses her teeth to
[00:35] interact with the world a little
[00:37] too inappropriately i am feeling a
[00:39] little bit overwhelmed
[00:40] if that was a dog she would be like i'm
[00:42] not paying attention to you i'm paying
[00:43] attention
[00:44] to that i will train this dog
[00:48] look at this loose leash right now shake
[00:51] yes
[00:52] much better yes look at me is she
[00:55] getting trained
[00:56] this is reality dog training
[00:58] [Music]
[01:01] moira has been really reactive to birds
[01:03] in fact you might recall that before she
[01:04] came to me she had
[01:06] actually killed a couple of chickens but
[01:08] i feel like we have made a lot of
[01:09] progress lately so i'm hoping to take
[01:11] her out to a park that has a whole bunch
[01:13] of different birds
[01:15] but understanding why dogs like moira
[01:17] like to chase other animals is really
[01:19] critical too that's why i've been making
[01:20] sure that moira has an outlet for her
[01:22] desire to run after things chase them
[01:24] and
[01:25] yes even bite them something that's
[01:26] really been working for us is making
[01:28] sure that moira has lots of new and
[01:30] exciting things to run after and chase
[01:32] this really seems to keep her interest
[01:33] and satisfied both super chewer and
[01:35] barkbox are monthly subscription boxes
[01:37] and they'll make living with your dog
[01:39] much more pleasant for
[01:40] both of you moira is definitely a super
[01:42] chewer dog and the theme of this box is
[01:44] best of super chewer
[01:45] you can see how heavy-duty some of these
[01:47] toys are if you get a super chewer box
[01:49] just cancel your gym membership you just
[01:51] lift these
[01:52] oh i remember this one and so you can
[01:54] put treats and things in there
[01:56] and the robot classic i know moira loves
[01:58] the robot toys
[01:59] in this box you get two chews super
[02:01] chewers for dogs who require more heavy
[02:03] duty toys
[02:04] and bark boxes for dogs that are a
[02:06] little easier on their toys but
[02:08] they're still pretty tough don't get me
[02:09] wrong this is best of bark box
[02:12] look at this there's nachos i challenge
[02:15] you to find any more original dog toys
[02:17] on the planet than bark toys
[02:19] both boxes include really top-notch
[02:21] high-quality treats every month too i'm
[02:23] gonna definitely give this to my own dog
[02:25] their attention to detail is incredible
[02:27] all of you can get a free barkbox super
[02:28] chewer box or both when you sign up for
[02:30] a monthly subscription using my special
[02:32] links superchewer.com
[02:34] dog training or barkbox.com dog training
[02:37] i'll have a link below in the
[02:38] description
[02:39] we're here at a park in new orleans it
[02:41] must be migration season because we got
[02:43] more than we bargained for today
[02:44] all right well we wanted to come and
[02:46] train around birds today because she has
[02:48] an issue with impulse
[02:50] control uh i think we've come to the
[02:52] right
[02:53] place do we know new orleans or what
[02:56] when moira arrives at a new place she is
[02:58] pretty anxious and she pulls a lot on
[02:59] her leash and i'm generally pretty
[03:01] tolerant of this with a dog who's pretty
[03:03] neuter training like moira is
[03:04] but it is a sign that she's a little
[03:06] worked up here so i'll be keeping an eye
[03:08] on that but you know
[03:09] you would expect a high energy dog to be
[03:11] wound up and pulling right now at this
[03:12] point in their training
[03:13] so we're surrounded we're like on an
[03:15] island of birds right now
[03:17] we've got them over here i don't know
[03:19] that she's detected all these birds over
[03:21] here
[03:21] so i think this is going to be my sweet
[03:23] spot that i want to work at because
[03:25] it's the farthest away from the birds
[03:27] and right now she can see these birds
[03:29] being pretty good so
[03:32] i'm pretty encouraged the real trick is
[03:35] going to be
[03:36] okay can i get her to pay attention to
[03:37] me while we're out here so that's what
[03:39] we'll find out
[03:39] soon enough but you're going to take a
[03:42] minute to acclimate young lady and i
[03:44] really feel like moira and i are hitting
[03:46] our stride right now i feel like we're
[03:48] getting through to one another we're
[03:49] starting to understand how each other
[03:51] works a little bit better
[03:52] and so i'm optimistic that we can have a
[03:54] successful training session today
[03:56] but i'm not giving our tests anything
[03:58] like this yet
[03:59] so this will be interesting i mean you
[04:01] can just look at the ground it's covered
[04:03] in feathers and
[04:04] bird poop so since we've only been out
[04:06] here for a few minutes i
[04:07] really want to make sure that moira can
[04:10] sniff around
[04:10] and check it out before i just start
[04:12] asking her to do things
[04:14] but i don't want you to eat bird poop
[04:17] here come on let's go this way come on
[04:20] good pretty good she was cooperative
[04:23] right there i didn't even offer her a
[04:24] treat or anything
[04:26] so that's nice good
[04:30] i think she heard what i said you mean i
[04:32] can get a treat of course you can
[04:35] so that's good right there i'm not i
[04:36] didn't ask for it she offered her
[04:38] attention when your dog
[04:39] offers their attention like that let
[04:41] them know that you appreciate it
[04:44] so i have not seen a significant
[04:46] outburst today not one so far from her
[04:49] and one of my goals for the remainder of
[04:50] this training time
[04:51] is to make sure that i'm training in a
[04:53] variety of different places so that's
[04:54] why we're here she also
[04:56] is very intrigued by dogs as we've seen
[04:58] but again i put myself in a position to
[04:59] be farther away from the dogs you see
[05:01] this
[05:02] moira's not the only dog interested in
[05:04] ducks
[05:05] here yes
[05:08] i'll take it i mean they're pretty far
[05:10] away but that's what i want
[05:12] okay come whoa all right i just led her
[05:15] to some ducks i guess
[05:17] i feel like she's adjusted now so why
[05:18] don't we get into training
[05:20] and see how she does can she come can
[05:22] she stay can she listen to her basics
[05:24] will she do her tricks
[05:26] in a place like this that remains to be
[05:28] seen let me see i'm trying to read her
[05:29] right now i feel like if i were to say
[05:31] moira come
[05:32] that she wouldn't be too motivated i'm
[05:34] going to ask her to do something easier
[05:36] than coming to me while she's distracted
[05:38] by the ground i'm gonna ask for a
[05:40] look at me
[05:44] cute yes look at me
[05:48] yes very good just easy stuff right you
[05:50] know
[05:51] maybe you would ask your dog to sit
[05:52] she's doing really good with stan
[05:54] stay yes stay
[05:58] yes give me a sit good
[06:01] just kind of going with the flow here
[06:03] this is really good she's demonstrating
[06:05] that she's willing to pay attention
[06:07] let's see how her recall is doing when
[06:09] i've got her dead focused on me let's
[06:11] see
[06:11] uh-oh that bird has definitely given our
[06:14] drone
[06:14] a look moira here sit
[06:18] stay yes
[06:23] here okay come good sit
[06:27] stay yes good girl nice work i'd like to
[06:30] see how her lie down is doing as well
[06:33] hand signal no treat in this hand
[06:37] yes i'll take it let me see if i can get
[06:39] that looking a little bit sharper
[06:41] i'm really encouraged because we're in
[06:42] this highly distracting place we even
[06:44] have dogs over here
[06:46] that are walking by here and of course
[06:47] we have that drone flying around it's an
[06:49] added distraction and she's doing really
[06:51] well with that
[06:53] well we did have a drone flying around
[06:55] the drone just crashed over here let's
[06:57] see what's happening
[06:58] whoa wow these are damaged here i don't
[07:02] know where that one went
[07:03] okay let's go replace these propellers
[07:05] and get that drone back up so you can
[07:07] have a full appreciation of this
[07:09] challenging environment
[07:10] this goes to show literally anything can
[07:12] happen i mean a drone can
[07:14] fall out of the sky during one of your
[07:15] training sessions and the better your
[07:17] communication is with your dog and the
[07:18] more experience that you've purposefully
[07:20] given them the more likely it is that
[07:22] those types of events
[07:23] won't throw them off she was pretty
[07:25] distracted by it all but she's doing
[07:27] quite well with the drone i'm glad we
[07:28] introduced it well
[07:29] i see there's some birds over here i
[07:30] want to practice getting our attention
[07:32] on me
[07:32] around those birds right there if
[07:34] they'll stay put i don't know we'll find
[07:36] out i don't want to get right on top of
[07:38] them so right here i'm struggling to get
[07:39] her attention i mean she's really
[07:41] intrigued by this new patch of grass
[07:43] over here now throughout this lesson
[07:44] you're going to see tension on the leash
[07:46] sometimes now because this is sometimes
[07:48] confusing i want to make it very clear
[07:49] here that i'm using her leash and
[07:51] harness just to keep control of her and
[07:53] i'm not using it as a tool to deliver
[07:55] corrections
[07:56] so i've got a couple of choices i could
[07:57] sit here let her take it in for a little
[07:59] bit but i think i've given her enough
[08:00] time today so i'm going to opt to
[08:02] try to get her attention on me back here
[08:04] where it's a little bit easier
[08:07] moira here good yes
[08:10] good
[08:13] here yes
[08:16] good i'm gonna up my rate of
[08:18] reinforcement here because i'm losing
[08:20] her very easily
[08:21] yes i'm using real small treats so i can
[08:23] rapidly reward her when she's compliant
[08:26] in this borderline state come this way
[08:30] good good girl i love her enthusiastic
[08:33] jog there
[08:34] moira now you can see that moira is very
[08:36] distracted here and i'm resisting the
[08:38] urge to pull her towards me
[08:40] come yes just trying to read her yeah
[08:42] good girl
[08:44] see how she got in the heel position
[08:45] there that was pretty nice those ducks
[08:47] are still there they're quite patient
[08:48] i'm gonna try to park her right about
[08:50] here as we get closer
[08:52] the fact that she's ignoring them is
[08:56] well she was ignoring them oh
[08:59] no all right there's our first lunge i
[09:01] want to
[09:02] not have that happen again stay good
[09:06] girl yes
[09:08] good girl yeah you got it you know what
[09:10] yes means so look at our working
[09:12] distance from the ducks here pretty good
[09:14] she's getting a little excited here sit
[09:17] yes
[09:18] very good and here i'm gonna let her
[09:21] look at the birds
[09:22] and then here yes look at me
[09:25] good you're so smart moira seems to be
[09:28] doing pretty well at this distance so
[09:30] far so i'm thinking we can probably get
[09:31] a little bit closer
[09:32] this looks like a good spot here
[09:34] noticing the ducks again
[09:36] fine with that so here i'm really
[09:37] practicing allowing moira
[09:39] to look at the ducks and then i'm
[09:40] practicing calling her away from the
[09:42] ducks
[09:43] it's also a really great way to proof
[09:45] her training in general here so
[09:47] combining an exercise like leave it with
[09:49] a treat along with a real world
[09:51] distraction
[09:52] like ducks is a fantastic way to
[09:55] strengthen her
[09:55] impulse control look at me
[10:00] so we're combining distractions
[10:01] artificial distractions with real world
[10:03] distractions
[10:04] and so really key here is to get her to
[10:06] voluntarily walk away from that kind of
[10:08] distraction which i'm going to try to do
[10:10] here
[10:10] stay here okay this way
[10:14] good that's what you want to see look
[10:17] loose leash over here
[10:18] walking away didn't have to pull her
[10:19] away this is huge for moira you can see
[10:22] that she's
[10:23] really tempted by all of those birds
[10:25] around her but the fact that she's able
[10:26] to bring her focus back to me is a
[10:28] giant leap in the right direction
[10:30] especially when you consider she's been
[10:32] the type of dog who has
[10:33] at times been unmanageable around birds
[10:37] any attention i voluntarily get from her
[10:39] happy to reward that right now
[10:41] and so we're trying to counter condition
[10:42] her to understand that when she sees a
[10:44] bird
[10:45] if she pays attention to us life is
[10:47] going to be better than just lunging and
[10:48] being frustrated by pulling out the bird
[10:50] of course this is something that needs
[10:51] to go on for a long time this is how it
[10:53] looks in the beginning
[10:54] if things are going well if your dog
[10:56] looks like they're thinking about it
[10:57] there's a good chance they might so be
[10:59] patient after you give a request like
[11:01] that
[11:02] yes i love the voluntary sit
[11:06] we have some other ducks that have moved
[11:07] in here's our wild card
[11:09] stay even here she was doing sit stay
[11:13] and come really well
[11:14] until she started to veer off at which
[11:16] time i didn't hesitate to put a treat
[11:18] right at her nose in order to get her
[11:20] attention on me
[11:21] and there's nothing wrong with that
[11:22] going back to square one that is in dog
[11:24] training we have to be prepared
[11:26] to take a step back whenever needed and
[11:28] you might notice i also shortened my
[11:30] leash
[11:30] just to make sure i could keep her from
[11:32] going after the ducks
[11:34] should she react but i'm still trying to
[11:35] avoid having any tension at all
[11:37] on the leash so that moira can make this
[11:39] decision on her own
[11:41] while moira is in the zone here i'm
[11:42] gonna rapid fire some stay in drills
[11:44] while we have these ducks at an
[11:46] ideal distance and right now moira is so
[11:49] zoned in that we can work at a rapid
[11:50] pace
[11:51] when you start getting instances of that
[11:53] it's a pretty good sign that you're on
[11:54] the right track and with a dog like
[11:56] moira can really help keep their
[11:57] attention and
[11:58] optimism up in training if you move at a
[12:00] faster pace like this
[12:01] now look just because she listened to me
[12:03] there you can see her attention now is
[12:05] drifting back
[12:06] onto these ducks over here and over here
[12:08] oh and there's a dog well
[12:10] welcome to the real world lyra here come
[12:12] on
[12:14] here yes there was the slightest amount
[12:18] of tension there but she was super
[12:20] responsive to it
[12:21] sit yes stay
[12:24] and this is great too she needs a lot of
[12:26] practice with dogs
[12:27] yes did you see that natural look at the
[12:30] dog and then she looked at me
[12:32] fly down
[12:35] do you remember lie down no you just
[12:38] needed a reminder that's all
[12:39] good girl and look at that she had
[12:41] trouble with lie down even though that's
[12:43] something she knows
[12:44] almost flawlessly at home don't get
[12:46] frustrated with your dog when they seem
[12:48] to not do things that they should know
[12:50] when you're in a different environment
[12:52] that's normal just means you need to
[12:53] give them some more time and practice in
[12:55] environments like that more often
[12:56] here you remember shake
[12:59] yeah oh you are such a rock star young
[13:03] lady
[13:03] look at these birds we got more than we
[13:06] bargained for today
[13:11] okay moira here all right see how she's
[13:14] completely tuning me out that's always
[13:15] our cue
[13:16] too much let's go back and make it
[13:17] easier again yep a little
[13:20] little questionable let me let her
[13:21] evaluate from a distance here moira come
[13:24] stay oh my gosh
[13:29] moira here come on
[13:33] sit no okay
[13:36] wow look at that
[13:42] sit okay there's my sit i'll take it
[13:45] good job girl
[13:45] nice work right there i mean i tried to
[13:48] get that extra set i probably should
[13:49] have been content
[13:50] just to reward her instantly when she
[13:53] came to me i mean that
[13:54] is a heck of a bird distraction notice
[13:56] no reaction no lunging
[13:58] distracted yes trying to kill the birds
[14:02] no check come yes
[14:05] notice no force there at all we're
[14:07] getting her to think from the inside out
[14:09] that's always
[14:10] the preferred way to go so i mean this
[14:12] is kind of the pattern that we're going
[14:13] to be running through
[14:14] over the next many days with her until
[14:16] hopefully she's able to completely
[14:18] tune them out when i ask for her but
[14:20] this is really nice
[14:21] good girl moira i'm really pleased with
[14:24] her progress
[14:25] on listening to me around distractions
[14:27] such as birds and even dogs in the
[14:29] distance
[14:30] what are you doing why are you doing
[14:31] that
[14:33] all right i should probably teach her
[14:34] it's not okay to just start digging and
[14:36] biting the ground
[14:37] she's pulling up an entire route okay
[14:40] moira okay come on let's go
[14:42] good curl yes i think right now she's
[14:44] happy to take the food but she'd rather
[14:46] be playing right now that's what i'm
[14:47] reading into all of this behavior so i
[14:50] need to make sure i'm giving her an
[14:51] outlet and what a great opportunity to
[14:52] practice
[14:53] a critical skill like fetch and a brand
[14:55] new place for her
[14:56] i just gave her a bark box toy she has
[14:58] nuts over these slowly reeling her in i
[15:01] don't want to
[15:01] kill her buzz right now by just reeling
[15:04] her in abruptly
[15:05] good girl let's see how all of her steps
[15:07] of fetch are looking
[15:08] interesting toy check that's good let go
[15:12] let go okay better than it was sit
[15:16] stay okay yes go
[15:20] good girl chasing it returning it in a
[15:23] straight line let's see
[15:25] come on yes good
[15:28] eagerly let's go and awaits the next
[15:30] throw let's find out let go
[15:35] stay eagerly awaits the next throw
[15:38] for sure okay she did not know how to
[15:41] fetch when she came here just a week ago
[15:42] she's picked this up at light speed by
[15:45] the way notice how she's tuning out
[15:47] all the distractions of her environment
[15:49] looks like she wants to get around to
[15:50] zoom he's in right now
[15:52] happy to let her do that sometimes you
[15:54] just need to let your dog be happy and
[15:55] be a dog right
[15:56] in the beginning like this it's a fine
[15:57] line between saying i want you to play
[15:59] by the rules
[16:00] versus i want you to have a good time
[16:01] too so they need a second to absorb all
[16:03] the rules of fetch
[16:05] go love that she's playing fetch out
[16:08] here getting a dog to play fetch in a
[16:10] new place can be a challenge with her
[16:12] not so much focus like this in this type
[16:15] of environment with
[16:16] known distractions like birds to moira
[16:18] which are a really high level
[16:19] distraction to her traditionally
[16:21] the fact that moira is paying attention
[16:22] to me and paying attention to this
[16:24] toy and she's focused and she's into it
[16:26] and she's making no attempt
[16:28] to chase birds or dogs in the distance
[16:30] is extremely encouraging here
[16:32] if your dog is that focused on a toy
[16:34] understand that that is all you need in
[16:36] many cases
[16:37] to teach them virtually anything sit
[16:41] stay
[16:44] okay go get it okay nice
[16:48] really good stay there huh so i like to
[16:50] throw in basic requests like sit and
[16:52] stay
[16:53] here and there during batch but not
[16:54] constantly it's a really good way to
[16:57] build value with the fetch toy because
[16:59] she clearly loves it come
[17:01] we continue to practice come when called
[17:04] when she's returning the toy which is a
[17:06] great way to burn in their brain what
[17:07] that means
[17:09] good girl here's a good chance to
[17:11] practice a long distance recall
[17:13] moira come yes
[17:17] good girl i was really enthusiastic
[17:20] there because i wanted to get it on the
[17:22] first attempt
[17:23] i didn't want to start calling her over
[17:24] and over again so that's why i really
[17:26] went the extra mile got on the ground
[17:28] started acting playful with her since
[17:30] she kind of veers
[17:31] left i kind of go right and that
[17:33] encourages her to come closer to me
[17:35] but i gotta catch that toy
[17:40] where's your toy come
[17:44] yes good girl
[17:49] you notice something she left her toy
[17:50] behind i called her
[17:53] she came to me i chose to acknowledge
[17:56] that
[17:56] rather than trying to get her to bring
[17:58] the toy back when your dog comes
[18:00] to you especially in a place like this
[18:02] you've got to really let him know that's
[18:03] the right decision
[18:04] so be flexible in your training and be
[18:06] prepared to acknowledge those things
[18:08] from your dog
[18:09] look at the promise she is showing if
[18:11] you have a dog that is
[18:12] this focused on a toy you can teach them
[18:15] virtually anything as long as you're
[18:17] patient
[18:17] you work with them and you're
[18:18] understanding with them but when we play
[18:20] fetch with a dog we're really appealing
[18:23] to what dogs are
[18:24] at their core they're a species that we
[18:26] essentially created to work
[18:28] in partnership with us so they have it
[18:30] in them to really listen and fetch
[18:32] satisfies both that physical
[18:33] and mental desire that dogs like moira
[18:36] often have you'll also find that if you
[18:38] can get your dog's energy out on your
[18:39] terms your schedule they're going to be
[18:41] a lot more
[18:42] compliant in day-to-day life what do you
[18:43] think she's going to do when we go home
[18:45] tonight she's going to pass out and
[18:46] she's going to sleep
[18:47] great if you have a high energy dog it
[18:50] really is
[18:51] worth your while to put in the effort to
[18:54] train them a really solid reliable fetch
[18:56] that is
[18:57] chasing after a toy in a straight line
[18:59] bringing it back in a straight line
[19:01] letting go and eagerly awaiting the next
[19:03] throw if you have a dog doing that the
[19:05] sky is the limit
[19:06] moira is showing incredible promise to
[19:09] learn how to heal
[19:10] heels basically where your dog just
[19:11] stays right next to you when you walk
[19:12] they stop when you stop they go when you
[19:14] go
[19:14] and it's a nice way to be able to have
[19:16] your dog behave in urban situations
[19:18] or if you're seeing another dog and you
[19:20] want them close if you've seen my other
[19:22] videos you may have seen my own dog
[19:23] inertia do this in a variety of
[19:24] scenarios but remember heal isn't the
[19:26] way to just give your dog a walk it's
[19:28] reserved for
[19:29] special training and special
[19:30] circumstances okay
[19:32] come here so we're going to keep it
[19:36] super casual here there we go i'm just
[19:38] luring her into position i'm gonna start
[19:39] on the right side i think
[19:41] take one step yes i took a half a step
[19:43] and i'm rewarded
[19:45] yes giving her small treats
[19:48] yes not asking her to heal for a half
[19:51] mile straight away
[19:52] what are you doing that's not deal
[19:53] you're all over the place let's redirect
[19:55] her back into position here
[19:56] good just you see that lower motion look
[19:59] how responsive she is
[20:02] not quite i'll take it so at first with
[20:05] heel i like to start just
[20:06] one step at a time and then as they
[20:08] demonstrated they're understanding that
[20:10] they're taking a step
[20:11] and they're waiting for their treat and
[20:12] they're looking up then i'll try and
[20:14] take two or three steps
[20:15] now here comes the test what if we can
[20:17] get her to go really slow
[20:20] wow good girl
[20:24] yes careful
[20:27] easy here at this point you might notice
[20:29] that i'm really holding that treat super
[20:31] obviously in order to make this
[20:33] exercise as easy as possible and i don't
[20:35] mind that she's just looking at the
[20:37] treat here at all
[20:38] trying to keep her from getting too far
[20:39] ahead but i don't want to be too picky
[20:40] right now i'm just really trying to get
[20:42] her to show any kind of restraint while
[20:44] staying on one side of me and paying
[20:45] attention to me i don't care if she's
[20:47] looking at a treat or
[20:48] what it's just trying to get the action
[20:49] right now so she can understand what i'm
[20:51] asking for
[20:52] dogs are not born knowing that humans
[20:54] want them to walk right here next to
[20:55] them so it's a delicate maneuver
[20:57] yes good here i'm going to try and vary
[20:59] my speed what happens if i go really
[21:01] fast
[21:02] that seems to get her more interested
[21:03] and look at that she is really really
[21:05] focused on me right now that's
[21:07] everything
[21:11] yes there are moments where you and your
[21:13] dog are just so dialed into one another
[21:15] that you can start to take more steps
[21:17] here let's go stay yes
[21:22] it's clear that moira is really soaking
[21:24] a lot of this training up
[21:25] thank goodness that is just incredible
[21:27] she's looking so good on heel i love the
[21:30] way a german shepherd looks when they
[21:31] heal
[21:34] okay good job nice work you guys
[21:38] know that dog reactivity is one of
[21:40] moira's most significant issues
[21:42] i really want to set this up because
[21:44] what you're about to see is probably
[21:45] the single biggest mistake i have made
[21:48] with moira so far and i already know
[21:50] this is
[21:51] most likely going to be the single most
[21:53] controversial part of this entire series
[21:55] because
[21:56] of the trainer error you're gonna see
[21:58] from me and i know that you guys
[21:59] understand that this series is about
[22:01] showing
[22:02] what the actual reality of training dogs
[22:05] is
[22:05] all about coming off the training
[22:07] session that you just saw
[22:08] i have to tell you i was feeling so
[22:10] encouraged by her progress
[22:12] i mean moira was actually starting to
[22:14] listen to me with dogs
[22:16] that she could see in the distance and i
[22:17] was incredibly proud of this
[22:19] and so with only six days left with her
[22:21] i was hoping
[22:22] to squeeze in one more awesome success
[22:25] with her
[22:26] so there's this dog park right across
[22:28] the street from where we're training
[22:30] hold on it was closed on this particular
[22:32] day but what i liked about the scene was
[22:35] that there were
[22:36] smells of dogs that had recently been
[22:37] there and there was also
[22:39] pretty frequent traffic of dogs walking
[22:41] by on the path
[22:42] near the dog park so i was hoping to do
[22:44] some testing with moira so that she
[22:46] could be in an environment where dogs
[22:48] had recently been
[22:49] plus where dogs currently are albeit at
[22:52] a distance
[22:52] okay all right all right so oh
[22:55] boy ra come on over here girl come on
[23:01] she sees a dog across the street i mean
[23:02] so clearly she still has
[23:04] some issues we need to contend with let
[23:07] me create some distance over here
[23:09] dogs coming closer and that distance was
[23:12] a little bit closer than what you saw in
[23:13] the last lesson but again i'm trying to
[23:16] keep progress moving
[23:17] i mean after all my goal in the very
[23:19] limited time that i have with her is to
[23:21] desensitize her to other dogs and to
[23:23] reliably be able to get her attention on
[23:24] me
[23:25] in the presence of other dogs so that
[23:27] when she goes to her new home
[23:28] that person will have some basic control
[23:31] of moira
[23:32] in a situation like this now for this
[23:33] training session my expectations were
[23:35] certainly far from perfection but what i
[23:37] was hoping to get from moira was a
[23:40] sit a stay a look at me as dogs walked
[23:43] by
[23:43] several feet away but i uh i seem to
[23:46] have
[23:47] underestimated this particular challenge
[23:49] for moira
[23:51] girl chill relax girl
[23:54] i'm waiting for the dogs to clear out so
[23:56] we can get back to our car so right now
[23:57] i'm staying over here
[23:59] to say that moira was not ready for this
[24:01] is clearly
[24:02] an understatement and this was one of
[24:04] those instances where moira saw the dog
[24:06] and she just completely lost it she was
[24:10] way over threshold there was no
[24:12] consoling her at all in that moment
[24:14] and the mistake that i made here is that
[24:16] i put her in a situation
[24:18] that she was not yet ready for and by
[24:20] doing this this could potentially set
[24:22] back
[24:22] not only the progress we've made today
[24:24] but the progress we've made in recent
[24:26] days
[24:26] and i know i've seen other people even
[24:28] other trainers make the same exact
[24:29] mistake after all can be really tempting
[24:31] to just
[24:32] keep pushing through when you think that
[24:34] your dog is ready for it
[24:36] that's enough girl that's enough here
[24:40] loira here come when she first reacts
[24:42] like this i haven't quite given up i'm
[24:44] still trying to get her attention on to
[24:46] me
[24:46] so she's clearly over threshold right
[24:48] here i mean i'm trying to create
[24:50] distance to keep her from feeling even
[24:51] more overwhelmed but
[24:53] moira just goes bananas i mean she's
[24:56] absolutely the worst that i have ever
[24:58] seen her in my time with boy
[25:00] no ma'am come here
[25:04] come on back here let's go
[25:08] over here knowing that moira is not
[25:11] teachable in these moments i'm not going
[25:13] to choose to have a battle with her and
[25:15] physically correct her here
[25:16] instead my goal is to simply keep
[25:18] control of her manager
[25:20] from getting away from me and choose to
[25:22] work on this another time
[25:23] and so to me here the least aversive
[25:25] method that's likely to keep her
[25:27] from further reacting is simply to
[25:29] manage her and wait for those dogs to
[25:31] clear out since we don't really have an
[25:32] escape route this is certainly not my
[25:34] proudest moment as a dog trainer but
[25:36] i think it's so incredibly important for
[25:38] us all to learn from these moments so
[25:40] that
[25:41] more people don't make the same mistake
[25:43] this was by far the worst outburst i've
[25:45] seen from her to this point and i'm
[25:47] determined to make it the last one
[25:49] so in the coming lessons i'm going to
[25:50] show you what i do differently to
[25:52] prevent that type of behavior
[25:54] while also making progress and doing so
[25:56] by using
[25:57] the least aversive method that is likely
[25:59] to work

[00:01] it would be a fantastic idea to recap
[00:04] every single thing that we've taught
[00:05] moira in two weeks
[00:07] one thing that makes a huge difference
[00:09] when you're working on a project like
[00:10] this is always having the best toys and
[00:13] treats available

[00:17] are not that hard on toys

[01:28] dog training and barkbox.com dog
[01:30] training i'll have a link below
[01:32] if you're really serious about training
[01:34] your dog you really should watch this
[01:35] entire series but today
[01:37] i'm going to give you an overview now
[01:38] that everything is complete
[01:40] you'll recall when we first got moira
[01:42] she was completely untrained with the
[01:44] exception of sit
[01:45] she didn't know how to sit and my goal
[01:47] was to build enough communication with
[01:50] her
[01:50] over the two weeks that i had available
[01:52] so that she would have a basic
[01:53] understanding of how to communicate with
[01:55] people as a whole
[01:56] at least at a basic level but it was
[01:59] completely evident on my first day with
[02:01] moira
[02:02] this was going to be a lofty goal i had
[02:05] no reason to believe that this was going
[02:06] to be
[02:07] a smooth process you're crazy i will let
[02:09] you hold this bag
[02:10] you can just set that on the ground
[02:16] sit you taught her down you said i just
[02:18] sit oh okay
[02:19] sit very good oh she's perfect she's
[02:23] great
[02:23] now going into this project me and brie
[02:25] were so excited and i knew
[02:27] there was a ton that i wanted to
[02:28] accomplish but i also knew
[02:30] that we didn't have forever to
[02:32] accomplish those goals with that
[02:34] preliminary time that i had initially
[02:36] met moira i could tell she was going to
[02:38] be extremely challenging
[02:40] good girl do you know how to let go
[02:43] but i could also tell that she was a
[02:46] very
[02:46] sharp cookie and she would prove me
[02:48] right on that point throughout this
[02:49] series
[02:50] so on day one we had our foster mom drop
[02:52] her off and immediately she was all over
[02:54] the furniture she was obviously very
[02:56] excited
[02:57] that's why we filmed okay you need to
[02:59] work on your furniture
[03:00] jumping i see and then after she got
[03:02] settled a little bit i took her
[03:04] on a walk and things got interesting
[03:06] okay moira is so
[03:08] worked up bree and inertia are down
[03:10] there but moira is like
[03:11] really really wound up
[03:14] so you can see we've got a lot of work
[03:17] to do here
[03:18] and i knew that moira had killed a
[03:20] couple of chickens in the past
[03:22] she had this strong desire to approach
[03:25] birds
[03:26] oh my gosh gosh
[03:30] girl no ma'am come on over here
[03:33] so what i need to do is i need to create
[03:34] distance right there i was definitely
[03:36] concerned about this but my best
[03:38] hypothesis
[03:39] so far anyway was that she was just a
[03:41] dog that had a lot of drive
[03:43] she liked to chase things run after them
[03:45] and yes bite them
[03:46] and so she needed some guidance on how
[03:48] to constructively fulfill her inner
[03:50] drive
[03:51] and that's why the first thing that i
[03:52] decided to teach her was tug of war
[03:54] before i go to bed tonight i'm going to
[03:56] get her a little bit more tired by
[03:58] playing
[03:58] she's also getting me a little more
[04:00] tired as well boy you got to watch that
[04:02] bite right there
[04:03] you want to be careful when you're
[04:04] teaching an adult dog like this how to
[04:06] play tug-of-war
[04:07] because their aim isn't always the best
[04:09] i really wanted her to understand
[04:11] yes you can play vigorously yes you can
[04:13] bite things
[04:14] certain things that is and yes it's
[04:16] going to be a lot of fun when you
[04:17] interact with me
[04:18] we had a pretty reasonable first night
[04:20] and moira did pretty well but i remember
[04:22] thinking like
[04:23] holy cow there is so much to do what
[04:26] have i done
[04:27] i have to be totally honest with you i
[04:29] am feeling a little bit overwhelmed she
[04:31] has a lot of bad habits that
[04:33] a lot of people don't want to deal with
[04:35] i mean this is one of the issues with
[04:36] rescue dogs very often they have a
[04:39] history of getting away with things
[04:40] jumping on people or
[04:42] running after wild animals or anything
[04:44] like that
[04:45] that can be really difficult to manage
[04:47] once the habit has been established on
[04:49] day two it was clear i needed to shape
[04:51] up and i needed to do it fast because
[04:53] this dog was going to get out of control
[04:55] if i didn't start giving her structure
[04:56] immediately
[04:57] moyra's tied to me now why you asked
[05:02] this is why so much for the tie out huh
[05:06] i could not believe how fast moira went
[05:08] from not understanding the leave
[05:10] it look at me combo leave it
[05:15] okay so she didn't listen to me to doing
[05:18] a
[05:18] super impressive version of leave it and
[05:21] look at me
[05:21] in her first training session leave it
[05:26] look at me yes that was a magic moment
[05:29] right there
[05:29] this was further illustrating how smart
[05:32] and sharp this dog really is if you
[05:34] haven't taught your dog the leave it
[05:35] look at me combo do it it is so fun
[05:37] and so practical for other areas of
[05:39] teaching them training a dog like moira
[05:41] while also
[05:42] producing a series and currently filming
[05:45] a series
[05:46] is definitely a couple of full-time jobs
[05:48] believe it or not so it was
[05:50] really important that we were able to
[05:51] work in downtime
[05:53] for moira while bri and i did our day
[05:55] job right now we
[05:57] are previewing a video making notes
[06:00] while also you may notice filming a
[06:04] video
[06:11] it's funny because you're wearing the
[06:12] same outfit so it's like
[06:14] zach and a red hoodie stacking a red
[06:16] hoodie and a cam over there
[06:18] real life sack still in his red hoodie i
[06:21] cannot even handle all the universes
[06:23] that are touching right now
[06:24] simultaneously it's messing with my head
[06:26] looks like she found a toy to play with
[06:28] my communication she'd be okay and
[06:30] that's something we're really trying to
[06:32] do with these series moving forward
[06:34] really show you what training a dog is
[06:36] like in day-to-day life
[06:38] not just having a dedicated training
[06:39] lesson and moving on to the next one and
[06:41] i was so anxious to get into training
[06:43] moira but she obviously had some
[06:45] other leftover puppy habits that really
[06:48] had to be dealt with and probably the
[06:50] most significant of those that was
[06:51] immediately apparent is that she would
[06:53] bite
[06:54] all of the time i mean those puppy teeth
[06:56] are long gone those are actual
[06:58] grown up german shepherd dog teeth this
[07:00] is exactly the kind of behavior that can
[07:02] scare a lot of people so even though
[07:04] this hurts it is just play biting
[07:06] but a german shepherd even play biting
[07:08] hard can still have
[07:09] unwanted consequences so many rescues
[07:12] have this issue of adult puppy fighting
[07:13] because they don't always have someone
[07:15] who is there to show them exactly the
[07:17] right things to bite on
[07:19] so with moira i really focused on
[07:21] redirecting that desire to play into
[07:23] something
[07:24] more productive like a training session
[07:26] or maybe even tug of war
[07:27] some type of game which also had the
[07:29] added benefit of being able to show her
[07:31] how to better interact with people
[07:34] i want to let her know biting is okay
[07:35] but only with permission and only with
[07:37] approved items i immediately got to work
[07:39] on teaching moira how to sit
[07:41] lie down and stand up this basic
[07:43] training is something that you can teach
[07:44] a dog
[07:45] really quickly it's also another great
[07:47] way to redirect their
[07:48] puppy energy when they start biting on
[07:50] you when she gets it she
[07:52] really gets it and night two was a lot
[07:54] rockier with moira than the first night
[07:55] so she was definitely more restless and
[07:57] i also knew i was really throwing a lot
[08:00] at her
[08:00] in terms of asking her to learn new
[08:02] things given that we have such a limited
[08:04] amount of time together
[08:05] i'm gonna try one more thing i'm just
[08:08] gonna ignore her for five straight
[08:09] minutes
[08:10] and if after five minutes she's still
[08:12] feeling frantic i'll probably adjust my
[08:14] strategy
[08:15] let her sleep on the tie out next to me
[08:17] where she has a little bit more room
[08:18] but i don't want her to continue to
[08:20] stress though i mean if you're wondering
[08:22] why i'm doing this
[08:23] it's because a crate can often make it
[08:26] easier to manage a dog
[08:28] and i like to use really oversized
[08:29] crates so for a crate this is pretty big
[08:32] but the more and more that i'm watching
[08:34] her the more i'm realizing
[08:36] that a crate really might not be for her
[08:39] i just let her out so i don't think she
[08:40] has to relieve herself
[08:41] five minutes can seem like an eternity
[08:43] when you're timing things like this
[08:46] all right i'm gonna call it and we're
[08:48] gonna tie her out
[08:50] but part of training a dog is having a
[08:51] comfortable well-rested dog
[08:53] too and moira just was so at
[08:56] ease when she got up on the mattress and
[08:59] laid down next to me
[09:00] so i committed the ultimate dog trainer
[09:02] sin and had her sleep next to me
[09:04] in my bed for the next couple of nights
[09:07] number one dog training channel on
[09:08] youtube
[09:09] right here and over the next several
[09:11] days i would discover that she had some
[09:12] issues with the crate
[09:14] so i graduated her to a
[09:17] safe area for her to be in that wasn't
[09:19] quite as enclosed as a crate and she did
[09:21] really well with that
[09:22] part of being a good trainer to your dog
[09:23] and good teacher to them is being
[09:25] flexible and always being able to change
[09:27] your game plan
[09:27] moira is throwing so many curveballs at
[09:30] us i'm having to
[09:30] change protocol all over the place to
[09:32] adapt to her of course overnight wasn't
[09:35] our only
[09:36] issue maura did surprise me with some
[09:38] rather robust barking
[09:40] outbursts in her first few days with us
[09:42] even if i still was in my pajamas
[09:44] i don't want a cave i just go over there
[09:46] this is really like
[09:48] demanding
[09:52] a fraction of quiet and then i'm gonna
[09:54] go acknowledge the fight yes
[09:56] fraction of quiet quiet good girl okay
[09:59] the jumping is another thing
[10:01] we've got to work on yes good girl
[10:04] so i'm gonna reward the quiet there good
[10:07] girl
[10:08] that's how i looked yeah gosh of course
[10:12] i wanted to make sure to work with her
[10:13] extensively
[10:14] on one of the most important skills that
[10:17] every dog should know
[10:18] stay and so we really broke down stay
[10:20] into three categories
[10:22] stay for a period of time sit
[10:26] good you can see her focus is good let
[10:29] me let me just test look at me look at
[10:30] me
[10:32] yes good took her a second there but
[10:35] that's good i just wanted to measure
[10:37] stay while we walk away i'm gonna walk
[10:39] away
[10:40] then i'm gonna come back here see how
[10:43] our attention was waning there
[10:44] good girl stay walking away
[10:48] notice how i'm not releasing her from
[10:49] the stay over here she's doing really
[10:51] well with this
[10:53] very good i'm coming over here now i'm
[10:55] gonna say
[10:56] okay come on yes good
[11:00] and then stay while distracted which was
[11:03] definitely
[11:03] easier said than done with moira she's a
[11:06] very distractible dog
[11:08] let go easy sit stay
[11:13] she's looking
[11:17] look at me
[11:20] yes okay good girl very good in that
[11:23] example you could see how she held her
[11:25] stay while something she really wants
[11:27] was nearby but did you also notice how
[11:29] delicate
[11:29] i was i didn't make the distraction
[11:31] super crazy we want to work up to that
[11:33] so to this point we've seen moira
[11:35] display a number of different issues
[11:37] from
[11:37] anxiety in her crate to pulling and
[11:39] lunging on her leash
[11:41] to barking outbursts and more there's
[11:43] one
[11:44] absolutely critical component to dogs
[11:47] who behave
[11:47] like moira and without it you have
[11:49] almost no hope of having a well-behaved
[11:52] dog and that component
[11:53] is exercise well exercise that involves
[11:56] interacting with a person
[11:58] and moira loves to play so again
[12:00] channeling that desire to play
[12:02] into a polished game of fetch is a game
[12:05] changer for her
[12:06] so i'm going to run around a little bit
[12:07] here see if she comes towards me
[12:12] good and i'm gonna she backed away a
[12:14] little but i'm gonna hold the ball
[12:16] let go it was a really good let go yes
[12:19] since i said yes i'm gonna follow it up
[12:21] with a reward
[12:22] good girl yeah what and you can see
[12:26] my energy caused her to come bolt
[12:28] towards me yes
[12:31] this is also a very fun way to solidify
[12:34] come when called
[12:35] and obviously when a dog loves playing
[12:37] fetch this much i can't help but check
[12:38] in to see how they like frisbee the
[12:40] really cool thing about teaching dogs
[12:42] how to play like this besides getting
[12:43] their energy out on your terms and
[12:45] schedule
[12:46] is that you get your dog in an amazing
[12:47] mood so you can actually start to
[12:49] practice
[12:50] their everyday obedience training while
[12:51] they're in that optimistic
[12:53] fun frame of mind let me throw in a sit
[12:56] sit yes good so now she had fun
[13:00] because she took direction for me you
[13:02] can see how this can really spiral in a
[13:04] good way
[13:05] for your training yes i mean getting
[13:07] your dog to listen to you when they're
[13:09] in that excited mindset can be very
[13:11] powerful
[13:12] and of course for your dog to be really
[13:14] proficient at fetch they have to have a
[13:15] very good
[13:16] let go clearly that was something that
[13:18] moira and i needed to practice
[13:20] a little bit more yes good girl you can
[13:23] see she's really
[13:24] getting it here it was also becoming
[13:26] more evident that moira was more of a
[13:28] physical train in that she was just a
[13:31] rough and tumble dog you might notice
[13:33] with moira with her being so energetic
[13:35] and strong
[13:35] i'm a bit more physical with her than i
[13:37] have to be with other dogs
[13:38] i have to block her from jumping on me
[13:40] or getting at my face i'm really hoping
[13:42] to make it out of this series without
[13:43] a broken nose i hope i've been watching
[13:45] cobra kai
[13:47] i can like block a little while later we
[13:50] were outside and a dog appeared behind
[13:52] our yard and surprised
[13:54] all of us this was moira's most
[13:55] significant reaction to date
[13:57] and since the dog was moving by i did my
[13:59] best to just hold my ground and try not
[14:02] to drag moira away which i think could
[14:04] have frustrated her
[14:05] even more making this issue even worse
[14:07] it was clear we had some very
[14:09] significant issues here that we needed
[14:10] to work on with moira
[14:12] aside from some of these more extreme
[14:14] reactions to other dogs jumping on and
[14:16] scaring away potential adopters
[14:18] was another one of moira's significant
[14:21] issues so we got to work on that right
[14:22] away
[14:23] so generally when i'm teaching a dog how
[14:24] not to jump on someone i'll teach them
[14:26] how to
[14:27] not jump on me first and then later
[14:29] start working with them on not jumping
[14:31] on other people
[14:32] because they really are different issues
[14:33] aren't they okay
[14:36] girl see what i'm saying she just gets
[14:38] she's like give me that food
[14:39] yes the fact that she offered to sit
[14:41] right there
[14:42] means i'm gonna okay girl all right sit
[14:46] yes this is also a great time to use
[14:49] their meal
[14:50] uh-huh see there she made no contact you
[14:52] gotta watch them
[14:53] it's a great time to use their meal for
[14:56] training i want to intercept it before
[14:58] the jumping sit
[15:01] yes and the next day we officially
[15:03] started moira's
[15:04] lease training session albeit indoors
[15:06] and even there
[15:07] it was clear i'm gonna have a tough time
[15:09] here see
[15:12] look at that she's pulling towards the
[15:13] toy if that was a dog
[15:15] she would be like i'm not paying
[15:16] attention to you i'm paying attention to
[15:17] that i'm trying to guide her away from
[15:19] the distraction and
[15:20] man this is going to take longer than
[15:23] two weeks
[15:24] if she can't leave that toy burrito
[15:25] alone there's virtually no chance she's
[15:28] going to disregard a dog
[15:30] anywhere within 50 yards of her i've
[15:33] decided to upgrade my treat here
[15:35] to real chicken do you want this
[15:39] look at that it can be a little
[15:40] frustrating when you're trying to teach
[15:41] your dog how to leave a toy alone
[15:43] for a leash training session like this
[15:44] but i mean
[15:46] real chicken you want this instead put
[15:49] it right on her nose look at that
[15:50] she's saying i would rather play with
[15:52] this toy than eat that chicken the fact
[15:54] that moira turned down
[15:55] real chicken right at her nose in favor
[15:57] of that toy
[15:58] is a pretty big deal on one hand she
[16:00] gets so focused on something and it's
[16:02] hard to get her attention on me even
[16:03] when i have a good currency but it also
[16:05] tells me
[16:06] that okay hey i can probably use that
[16:08] toy to motivate her to do a variety of
[16:10] different things moving forward
[16:12] her true personality was really
[16:14] beginning to emerge we started to see
[16:16] more instances of demand barking
[16:18] as well as her starting to get very
[16:19] interested in my shoes
[16:21] my new classic reeboks why is this on
[16:23] the floor
[16:24] you can't have these that would be
[16:26] tragic fortunately
[16:28] my shoes made it out alive around this
[16:30] time she was also making a lot of
[16:31] progress when it came to settling down
[16:33] inside the house
[16:34] so that was a win now after several days
[16:36] of really focusing on these fundamental
[16:39] skills
[16:39] it was time to take our training out
[16:41] into the real world and start
[16:43] implementing some of these skills
[16:44] so the first place i took moira was to a
[16:46] very unpopulated public area but there
[16:49] wasn't much around and she nailed it she
[16:51] did pretty awesome
[16:52] she's very interested in people there's
[16:53] someone crossing the road over here
[16:55] and she's giving them a look which is
[16:57] fine but
[17:00] let me practice getting her attention
[17:01] while she's mildly distracted by someone
[17:03] in the distance
[17:04] moira here look at me
[17:08] yes good
[17:12] here yes good and
[17:16] okay good and now i'm going to let her
[17:19] satisfy her curiosity for a minute and
[17:20] because she was doing so well i was like
[17:22] all right let's move on to our second
[17:23] location which has a slightly higher
[17:25] concentration of dogs and people in the
[17:27] distance
[17:28] and as soon as we got there it was clear
[17:30] i was going to have to be very focused
[17:31] and very disciplined about training
[17:33] moira
[17:34] i mean that dog is very far away and
[17:35] moira is already over threshold
[17:38] before this gets any worse i'm going to
[17:39] help her out by moving her farther away
[17:41] from the dog
[17:42] and this is good she doesn't need much
[17:43] coaxing to come along with me when the
[17:45] dog
[17:46] is that far away that's definitely a
[17:48] plus since we have a lot to work on here
[17:50] and here's another dog already that has
[17:52] walked into moira's detection zone
[17:54] and it's more the same she's definitely
[17:56] not willing to voluntarily give me her
[17:58] attention if she can see
[18:00] a dog at all even when i call moya's
[18:03] name and i ask her to sit she's
[18:04] completely non-compliant
[18:06] i mean moira became very reactive to
[18:09] people and dogs and basically anything
[18:11] she could see
[18:12] anywhere so we were in over our head
[18:14] here and so then the next day i was like
[18:16] all right we've got to get really
[18:18] serious not only about her basic
[18:19] training here but we also need to focus
[18:21] on this reactivity every moment that we
[18:23] can while we're together but i don't
[18:24] have the luxury of only focusing on that
[18:26] so we decided to focus our training
[18:28] efforts on the field right behind my
[18:30] house where i can control the
[18:31] environment pretty well
[18:32] and i've got terrific visibility so i
[18:35] can see dogs and distractions coming and
[18:37] going
[18:37] nonetheless this training session and
[18:39] the next few would still be very rocky i
[18:42] would definitely encounter some
[18:43] significant
[18:44] outbursts from moira we have a couple of
[18:46] dogs coming here
[18:47] oh go get it maura can't focus on me
[18:50] toys treats or
[18:51] anything else if she detects a dog
[18:53] anywhere
[18:54] on planet earth the other dog is quite
[18:56] excited as well so i want to make sure i
[18:57] have a good grip on her
[18:59] want to keep full control when you're
[19:00] doing early leash training sessions with
[19:02] a dog like this the process can be
[19:04] very bumpy to say the least it's hard to
[19:06] keep your dog's sustained attention at
[19:08] times for sure
[19:09] you can see me trying here and failing
[19:11] miserably at times but i'm not gonna
[19:13] give up
[19:14] but let me be clear i am making a
[19:16] sincere effort to minimize
[19:18] these outbursts and i'm doing that by
[19:20] being very far away from potential
[19:22] triggers that moira can see i'm going to
[19:24] try and create some distance
[19:27] let's go come on girl
[19:30] i mean some dogs are more sensitive than
[19:32] others but moira
[19:33] is particularly sensitive whenever she
[19:36] sees a dog
[19:37] in between our outings to work on
[19:39] moira's reactivity we had a lot of other
[19:41] things to work on too i focused on
[19:42] getting her more comfortable with some
[19:44] basic grooming practices and there were
[19:46] some bumps in the road
[19:48] yes okay sit
[19:51] she did not like that at all but
[19:53] training is all about being flexible so
[19:55] we shifted our game plan and moira did
[19:57] incredible
[19:57] so here we're counter conditioning her
[19:59] like getting her to be more tolerant of
[20:01] something that she typically isn't
[20:03] and she's getting a good experience of
[20:04] eating that peanut butter at the same
[20:06] time and she's like hey i don't mind
[20:07] this so much so we'll cater our approach
[20:09] to her because her biting and jumping
[20:11] still needed some work i really wanted
[20:13] to diligently focus on resolving that
[20:15] too
[20:15] though this is going to be crazy you
[20:17] want to go say hi let's go say hi
[20:19] good okay so right there that's why we
[20:21] have them on leash say hi
[20:22] hey little good girl okay come see that
[20:25] so we're interrupting the behavior
[20:27] before
[20:27] it occurs the next day was just magical
[20:31] well mostly at this point i really felt
[20:34] like i mean me and moira were starting
[20:36] to connect and understand one another
[20:38] and had some really solid basic
[20:39] communication
[20:40] so as you'll remember one of her big
[20:42] issues was
[20:43] being tempted by birds so i figured we
[20:46] would do some training around birds
[20:48] lots and lots of birds i mean if i
[20:50] remember correctly she had a little bit
[20:52] of a tough time
[20:53] at first but for the most part she
[20:55] showed extreme focus
[20:57] in the presence of thousands like
[21:00] literally
[21:01] thousands of different birds let's see
[21:02] how all of her steps of fetch are
[21:04] looking
[21:05] interesting toy check that's good let go
[21:08] let go okay better than it was sit
[21:13] stay okay yes go
[21:16] good girl chasing it returning it in a
[21:19] straight line let's see
[21:22] come on yes good
[21:25] eagerly let's go and awaits the next
[21:27] throw let's find out let go
[21:31] stay eagerly awaits the next throw
[21:34] for sure okay so i'm really satisfied
[21:37] that my strategy here was working of
[21:39] teaching her to run
[21:40] and chase after something and bite it
[21:42] and bring it back to me aka fetch was
[21:44] really satisfying that desire
[21:46] to play and interact with her world i
[21:48] mean moira
[21:49] was just firing on all cylinders and it
[21:51] was at that moment where i was like
[21:53] we are turning this corner that is just
[21:55] incredible she is looking so good on
[21:57] heel i love the way a german shepherd
[21:59] looks when they heal but i would be
[22:01] reminded that progress when training a
[22:03] dog is very rarely
[22:04] linear after what had been an enormously
[22:07] successful day of training
[22:09] moira had her single worst outburst
[22:12] in my custody to date all right moira
[22:16] no ma'am come here
[22:20] come on back here let's go and of course
[22:23] i want to take responsibility it was my
[22:24] own fault for moving
[22:26] too quickly and putting her too close to
[22:28] other dogs it goes to show that just
[22:30] when you think you're having a major
[22:31] breakthrough
[22:32] dog training really does keep you humble
[22:35] and just like i talk about in my books
[22:37] link below and throughout my youtube
[22:39] videos you always have to be prepared
[22:41] to take a step back whenever the
[22:44] situation dictates
[22:45] so the next day it was off to try and
[22:47] solidify
[22:48] moira's obedience when she sees other
[22:50] dogs
[22:51] so you can see straight away we've got
[22:53] some dogs here
[22:57] so my overall strategy here was
[22:59] basically to manage her should she
[23:01] become overwhelmed when in the presence
[23:03] of another dog
[23:04] though ideally i'm trying to prevent
[23:06] that from happening at all from this
[23:08] point forward
[23:08] and i was definitely not perfect at that
[23:11] episode 9 though was
[23:12] really a breakthrough day it's like
[23:14] she's really seemed to start
[23:16] to understand what we're going for here
[23:18] she started paying attention to me
[23:20] a lot more reliably when she would see
[23:22] other dogs
[23:24] moira come yes much better very good
[23:27] on that day she made some incredible
[23:29] leaps forward on her obedience she did
[23:31] her
[23:31] longest ever stay which was impressive
[23:34] to watch
[23:35] okay come yeah i love that look at that
[23:39] sprint
[23:39] her heel was starting to come together
[23:42] something we had just basically started
[23:43] on
[23:44] moira also had her first bath with me
[23:46] which is always an
[23:47] interesting experience
[23:51] we had our ups and downs and bottom line
[23:53] she did get pretty clean
[23:54] and neither one of us were too
[23:56] traumatized in the process when you're
[23:58] working with a reactive dog like moira
[24:00] you're looking for
[24:01] sometimes tiny examples of success even
[24:04] those tiny successes are important to
[24:06] celebrate though but the success that
[24:08] moira had on this next day
[24:10] was just huge and it was so satisfying
[24:12] to see this
[24:13] we were just shooting some photos with
[24:15] moira and both of us noticed holy cow
[24:17] there's a dog
[24:18] coming and we know how delicate she can
[24:19] be with dogs so i quickly escorted her
[24:22] down
[24:22] here and a beautiful thing happened
[24:26] i was able to keep her attention almost
[24:28] exclusively on the ball playing fetch
[24:30] with that dog at
[24:31] by her standards extremely close range
[24:34] she still showed a lot of interest but i
[24:35] was able to get her back which was
[24:37] the really encouraging thing to me
[24:39] there's hope moira you can do this
[24:42] it's hard to resist a barking dog i
[24:43] understand
[24:45] she's running around from excitement let
[24:46] me see if i can get her back on the ball
[24:48] here we go i'm not insisting on
[24:50] perfection i'm just trying to get her
[24:52] attention loosely on me right now
[24:54] because we know she's really excited
[24:57] you hear the dog barking still there
[24:58] she's still excited about the dog but
[25:00] she's still picking that ball up so it's
[25:02] a really
[25:02] effective currency and even though she's
[25:04] in and out right now they're in and out
[25:05] before they're all in but that's fine
[25:07] for now that's where you start
[25:08] and that's the goal of this series to
[25:10] give you realistic places to start not
[25:12] to try and
[25:13] make me look good like i can train a dog
[25:16] like a wizard
[25:17] but to really just show you the actual
[25:18] steps i go through to try to get a dog
[25:20] compliant over a more extended period of
[25:22] time
[25:23] keep in mind my overall goal with this
[25:25] project is to make sure
[25:26] moira is as prepared as humanly possible
[25:30] for her new home so that also means just
[25:32] general good behavior in the house like
[25:34] not stealing things and how to just
[25:36] chill out and relax sometimes
[25:38] plus training sessions like this always
[25:40] help deepen your mutual communication
[25:42] with your dog as evidenced by how hard
[25:44] moira tried to convince me that she
[25:46] really didn't have to leave that chicken
[25:48] alone i think this is our first actual
[25:50] argument as a dog and trainer team and
[25:52] you can't have it really
[25:55] no i'm sorry here
[25:58] come on over here leave it come
[26:01] nope come good girl yes sit
[26:04] on my last day of training moira i could
[26:07] not have been more proud
[26:08] i mean she was listening to her basics
[26:10] like sit stay
[26:12] come and heal she showed incredible
[26:14] restraint with other dogs
[26:16] very close by look at this loose leash
[26:18] right now that's pretty good
[26:21] so this is really impressive here come
[26:23] on
[26:24] good girl and i was satisfied that there
[26:26] was a strong foundation in place for her
[26:28] new mom to take over
[26:30] i took moira on one last walk with just
[26:32] me and her
[26:33] and she did not have a single outburst
[26:35] on our entire walk
[26:37] moira you're going home with your new
[26:38] mom today
[26:41] i've really enjoyed working with you i'm
[26:43] going to miss you
[26:44] tremendously you're a very special dog
[26:50] do you think she can understand any of
[26:51] this she's wonderful
[26:53] very smart girl
[26:57] really curious about her world not one
[26:59] outburst on our final leg
[27:03] proud of her now i don't want to make
[27:05] this look like oh moira will never have
[27:07] another outburst again
[27:08] i think it's still probably going to
[27:10] take several more months of doing a lot
[27:12] of repetitive training
[27:13] as we've done over the last several
[27:15] episodes of this series
[27:16] and that's okay real behavior change
[27:19] takes time there's no way to skip over
[27:21] life experience for our dogs
[27:23] this series was really focused on those
[27:25] beginning steps that you need to take so
[27:27] that you
[27:28] and moira's new family could hopefully
[27:30] learn where you can
[27:31] start to get traction on a complex issue
[27:34] like this
[27:35] i'm so proud of moira and this is
[27:36] definitely going to be
[27:38] my favorite moment of the entire series
[27:41] you've been waiting for it i'd like to
[27:42] introduce you to moira's new mom
[27:45] arena hi i'm irina i'm going to be
[27:47] maura's new mom
[27:48] i met moira a few weeks ago and i wanted
[27:50] to be considered for adopting her
[27:51] and since this project began with zach
[27:53] i've been accepted i've been searching
[27:55] for a dog for a while
[27:56] and of course fall in love with every
[27:58] single dog but when i saw her
[27:59] i fell extra in love i'm not planning on
[28:01] getting any other pets for now as far as
[28:03] training it would be nice that she could
[28:04] understand basic skills things like sit
[28:06] and stay and how to come and not pull on
[28:08] her leash i understand she's reactive to
[28:09] other dogs so i'm hoping to work on that
[28:11] over time i know that moira has to get
[28:12] used to working with me
[28:14] and that none of these skills will stick
[28:15] unless i continue to work with her but
[28:17] i'm really excited that she's had this
[28:18] time with zach
[28:19] once arena and moira got united i went
[28:21] over the things that we taught moira
[28:24] of course moira was so excited to see
[28:26] arena but she could hardly contain
[28:28] herself there's always a learning curve
[28:30] when it comes to teaching a dog to
[28:31] interact with a specific individual but
[28:33] i think they're going to have plenty of
[28:35] time to get to know each other better
[28:36] sit good job stay
[28:40] stay and look at me now look at me okay
[28:43] come to me okay come
[28:44] on perfect good girl happy with that
[28:47] sit we're working on hand signal with
[28:50] down so no treat no lure
[28:51] uh-huh here look at me up stand stay
[28:56] good so sit down and stand are the three
[28:58] positions we've been working on with her
[29:00] it was really a lot of fun to help them
[29:02] work together for the first time
[29:04] arena found a really great dog and moira
[29:07] was so lucky to be able to find such a
[29:09] committed person
[29:11] i can tell these two are going to be an
[29:13] awesome team this was a fantastic
[29:15] experience and you guys really seem to
[29:17] love it and i can't wait to show you

[00:00] i'm zach george and this is george
[00:03] no relation george has spent the last
[00:05] four months living in an animal shelter
[00:07] with
[00:07] minimal contact with other dogs or
[00:09] people this is one of the strongest dogs
[00:11] i have ever worked with
[00:13] how would i ever get a frisbee away from
[00:16] a dog that's pulling like this
[00:18] holy cow in our part of the world dogs
[00:20] that look like george
[00:21] have the deck stacked against them from
[00:23] day one we took george out of the
[00:25] shelter having no
[00:26] idea where he would end up he is my
[00:28] responsibility
[00:29] at this point if he goes back to that
[00:31] shelter he has almost
[00:32] no hope of standing out he's a totally
[00:35] untrained dog
[00:36] his drive is really intense we have to
[00:38] get this pulling under control with him
[00:40] and it's my job to transform him from a
[00:42] wild and crazy dog
[00:44] to an incredible pet seems
[00:45] straightforward right
[00:52] he's caught off guard by a stranger in
[00:54] the area he has what seems to be a fear
[00:56] response hey
[00:58] all right buddy it's okay it's okay
[01:00] inertia was kind of telling them off a
[01:02] little bit
[01:02] oh she's like yo i don't play like that
[01:06] you need to back off
[01:08] he's getting a little impatient here
[01:10] he's refusing sit he's pulling
[01:12] he's just not listening at all right now
[01:14] i mean people
[01:15] interpret this behavior as being
[01:16] stubborn we're getting ready to go out
[01:18] tonight
[01:19] i'm a little worried about him oh gosh
[01:20] he's in the house unattended
[01:22] george no i never thought the thing that
[01:26] would take me down as a dog trainer
[01:28] would be this
[01:30] not getting that ball buddy i've never
[01:31] been in this much of a
[01:33] physical gridlock with any dog ever
[01:36] holy cow not getting that ball
[01:40] i have to tell you as this was happening
[01:41] the one thing i'm thinking is if someone
[01:43] whips out their phone and they record
[01:45] this like
[01:47] this could look really ridiculous and
[01:49] then i look up and i realize
[01:51] my wife is filming this i had an
[01:53] incredible outburst
[01:54] out of him george just lost it how am i
[01:57] ever going to teach him
[01:59] to let go of something when his grip and
[02:02] his strength is like this
[02:04] by far this is the toughest case of let
[02:06] go i have ever encountered in my entire
[02:09] life
[02:09] i don't even want to talk about let go
[02:11] you know george
[02:12] you know how many people are gonna troll
[02:13] me over this a lot of people
[02:16] they're gonna say zach george can't
[02:18] train the dog to let go of the ball
[02:20] you know in this case i guess they would
[02:21] be right
[02:24] george is a dog like i've never known
[02:26] before
[02:28] only a handful of dogs have ever been
[02:30] able to pull off the double disc catch
[02:32] i just keep hoping that it's gonna like
[02:34] click and he's gonna just catch one and
[02:36] then catch the other one
[02:37] oh come on
[02:42] i've seen zach see a lot of dogs and i
[02:45] rarely see him want to keep a dog in his
[02:47] life the way he
[02:49] has deeply thought about george i
[02:51] understand the
[02:52] greater calling is to be able to bring a
[02:55] dog
[02:56] into our life to train them and to find
[02:58] them a great home
[02:59] i don't know if i can let this dog go
[03:02] let go
[03:03] [Music]
[03:07] you can tell that he's really trying
[03:09] he's really understanding the concept
[03:11] i love that that's looking like a real
[03:14] [Music]
[03:16] heel
[03:22] wow whoa a plus
[03:25] you're smarter than me the fact that
[03:27] he's come this far
[03:28] this quick is shocking this might be the
[03:31] single greatest transformation i have
[03:33] ever seen
[03:34] in a dog that i've worked with the
[03:36] hardest thing about boston dog you
[03:38] fall in love with them
[03:38] [Music]
[03:43] look at this guys look at this leash
[03:45] whoa there we go

[00:07] i'm zach george and this is george no
[00:11] relations
[00:12] george has spent the last four months
[00:13] living in an animal shelter with minimal
[00:15] contact with other dogs or people
[00:18] and it's my job to transform him from a
[00:20] wild and crazy dog
[00:21] to an incredible pet seems
[00:23] straightforward right
[00:26] holy cow not getting that ball
[00:29] george is a dog like i've never known
[00:31] before i don't know if i can let this
[00:33] dog go
[00:34] let go this might be the single
[00:38] greatest transformation i have ever seen
[00:41] in a dog that i've worked with
[00:42] the hardest thing about foster dog you

[00:46] this is reality dog training
[00:51] subscribe and click the bell so you

[00:55] it's just incredible how much you can
[00:57] train a dog like george in just a few
[00:59] days i mean
[01:00] there's still a lot to work on but he's
[01:02] really starting to understand some
[01:03] amazing things quick
[01:04] let's see if there's anything in our pup
[01:06] box that george would like
[01:08] i think he's going to like everything
[01:10] hutbox is a training-centric monthly
[01:12] subscription box where they send you
[01:14] items and treats based on your dog's
[01:16] specific age but this is one of the
[01:17] things that
[01:18] really makes them very different here
[01:20] you get training advice that's specific
[01:22] to your puppy as they grow
[01:23] what else do we have in here we've got i
[01:25] think he's really gonna
[01:27] i need that to train you what are you
[01:29] doing george
[01:31] we got the snake toy this is a classic
[01:34] toy here
[01:34] i love using this in training he's never
[01:36] encountered a toy quite like this and
[01:38] that's the beauty of using brand new
[01:40] toys like this
[01:41] that can really be effective in holding
[01:42] your dog's attention they have
[01:44] nerf for dogs who knew this is exactly
[01:46] his kind of toy
[01:48] you've got a classic pig ear that's good
[01:50] for keeping your dog preoccupied
[01:52] and some high quality treats right here
[01:54] too i'm actually going to use these
[01:55] right now when we take our free walk so
[01:58] thank you pop box all of you can get 50
[02:00] off of your first pup box when you go to
[02:02] putbox.com
[02:03] zach can sign up for a 360 or 12 month
[02:05] subscription and use code zack i'll have
[02:08] the details in the description
[02:10] we're out here behind the house to do
[02:11] some more training outside today
[02:13] and i'd love to get some aerial shots
[02:15] with our drone today but i don't know
[02:16] how he's going to react to that so i'm
[02:17] going to quickly
[02:18] introduce him to the drone if it's too
[02:20] much for him we'll just not use it but
[02:22] if he seems to be okay with it then cool
[02:24] we'll have aerial shots that's always a
[02:26] plus
[02:26] good boy sir yes so he acknowledged it
[02:30] there but i just want to make it like no
[02:32] big deal that kind of thing happens
[02:33] sometimes so he looked at it and then i
[02:35] was like yes because he didn't
[02:36] immediately start lunging and barking at
[02:38] it as many dogs would
[02:39] so far his demeanor and body language is
[02:42] very
[02:42] calm look at me yes i'm gonna walk him
[02:45] over here a little bit
[02:47] a little bit closer to the drone by
[02:50] going here
[02:56] yes good job and so here i'm just
[02:59] conditioning him
[03:00] that that sound of the drone
[03:03] equals a really good treat right now
[03:06] here yes
[03:10] good work buddy and so i mean even
[03:12] something like this is an
[03:14] actual distraction here
[03:18] yes just rewarding the attention being
[03:20] very consistent about that
[03:22] i mean i'm real satisfied that he's
[03:24] doing great around the drone i feel like
[03:25] we can move on from this i don't think
[03:26] we need to spend a lot of time should
[03:28] something change i'll let you know
[03:29] but one of the things i really had hoped
[03:31] to accomplish today
[03:33] was getting out here and doing a proper
[03:34] free walk a free walk is just where you
[03:37] let your dog explore their environment
[03:39] you don't ask a lot of them it's not
[03:41] hardcore training
[03:42] there is some training planned for
[03:44] today's free walk but
[03:46] in general it's like hey go sniff go
[03:48] explore
[03:49] occasionally i'm going to ask you to do
[03:50] something i'll get more into that later
[03:52] but good job around the drone sir yes
[03:56] he loves these freeze-dried treats so
[03:58] we're just going to go ahead and get
[03:59] started he's doing well with the drone
[04:01] i'm going to try and give him a fair
[04:03] amount of distance here just to give him
[04:05] an outlet
[04:05] dogs are smart curious animals it's
[04:08] essential
[04:09] that we give them an outlet to freely
[04:11] check out the world to the best of our
[04:13] ability i mean i know there are
[04:14] limitations depending on where you can
[04:16] live i mean here i'm in public i can't
[04:18] take him off lesion or would i because
[04:19] he's not ready for that
[04:21] but i can put him on a long lead i can
[04:23] let him smell around and
[04:25] enjoy his environment here i'm gonna try
[04:27] to keep the walk
[04:28] generally moving i might stop here and
[04:30] there just to let him check something
[04:32] out but
[04:32] looks like he's ready to go on there's
[04:34] some leash pulling going on here
[04:36] i'm not too concerned with that right
[04:37] now because you have to kind of pick
[04:39] what you're really working on are you
[04:41] going to focus on leash pulling
[04:42] or you're going to focus on letting them
[04:44] check out the world to understand it
[04:45] better and to me
[04:46] that's a little more valuable for this
[04:48] particular training lesson
[04:49] we're going to move over to the side
[04:51] here and let this pedestrian pass
[04:53] hi how are you good boy
[05:00] all right come on buddy one of the
[05:01] things i really want to start to
[05:02] formalize a little bit more with him is
[05:05] come when called getting him to come to
[05:07] me any way that i can quite honestly
[05:09] because that's such an essential skill
[05:11] i want to wait till he's in a relatively
[05:13] like compliant frame of mind where he's
[05:15] like hey i'm acknowledging you
[05:17] i'm gonna see if that happens
[05:19] automatically here i'm just gonna hang
[05:21] out for a minute
[05:21] right here he's wanting to trek ahead
[05:24] i'm avoiding
[05:25] here george yes
[05:28] i'm gonna reward the attention here i'm
[05:30] gonna even take a few steps
[05:32] back on purpose here just to try and get
[05:34] a few extra steps of him coming to me
[05:37] happy to let him go back there see his
[05:40] ears
[05:41] listening behind him george
[05:45] come i'm gonna say come while he's in
[05:47] the process of coming to me good boy
[05:49] very good again letting him go back to
[05:51] doing what he's doing
[05:52] that's really important you don't want
[05:54] it to be too monotonous for your dog and
[05:56] you don't want to have to make them do
[05:57] three or four things when they come to
[05:59] you not in the beginning be content to
[06:00] have them come to you here and there
[06:02] then let them go back to doing their
[06:04] thing we want them to have a really good
[06:06] association with coming to us that's why
[06:08] we're so tolerant on
[06:09] other things when we're training that
[06:11] here he's a little distracted
[06:18] come good boy did you see how i resisted
[06:21] saying come until he was in the process
[06:23] of coming to me
[06:24] very good job buddy okay that's because
[06:26] he doesn't know what the word come
[06:28] means just yet it's really important for
[06:30] me to show him what that means in
[06:31] context
[06:32] i do have to be honest with you this
[06:33] dog's leash pulling is no
[06:35] joke this is one of the strongest dogs i
[06:37] have ever worked with when you can just
[06:39] hear him huffing and puffing he's
[06:40] pulling off to the side so i mean i am
[06:42] shortening the leash a little bit
[06:44] here just to kind of see what happens
[06:46] i'm still trying to gauge this leash
[06:48] pulling and
[06:48] how we're going to approach it but you
[06:50] can see he's just like straight ahead
[06:53] i'm gonna let george check out these
[06:54] waves from a distance of course
[06:56] although gosh why are you pulling me so
[07:00] much
[07:02] all right you can see he's really on a
[07:04] ground scent as
[07:06] you might expect yeah i see
[07:09] dead sea life of some kind i like that
[07:12] he didn't pick it up there that was good
[07:13] but i want to give him some exposure to
[07:15] the water here this is something that is
[07:17] unusual that he's probably not
[07:19] encountered too much of but he's
[07:20] behaving really well something's got his
[07:22] attention what is it
[07:25] i don't know he may have just shown some
[07:27] interest in the drone there but good
[07:28] reaction
[07:31] come
[07:34] so he's not quite as snappy as i'd like
[07:36] about coming to me
[07:38] when i call him but pretty good for
[07:39] being a relatively informal lesson here
[07:42] i'm going to let him smell this it's a
[07:43] little more damp over here so it's
[07:45] probably more fragrant again
[07:46] just in the interest of letting him
[07:48] experience brand new scents
[07:50] wherever possible i think he's trying to
[07:52] get up there come on stay over here
[07:53] buddy
[07:56] george come yes
[08:00] good boy i'm gonna give him a good treat
[08:02] for that one look at that tail
[08:04] yes good boy
[08:08] all right come on you can see we've
[08:09] gotten many instances of him coming to
[08:12] me when i call him
[08:13] right out here and we're not doing it
[08:15] over and over again we're allowing him
[08:17] time to
[08:17] mentally recharge and enjoy his life i'm
[08:20] really focused on a low stress
[08:22] experience for him right now
[08:25] yes the fact that he's just walking up
[08:28] to me
[08:29] through all of that terrain is amazing
[08:32] good boy
[08:33] and you might notice the environment
[08:34] we're working in today this is very much
[08:36] by design
[08:37] it's not an extremely distracting or
[08:40] enticing environment that would cause
[08:41] him to overreact to things
[08:44] oh okay hey he tried to pick this thing
[08:47] up that appeared to be a
[08:48] beer can or something at one time let's
[08:51] practice a real life leave it sit
[08:55] leave it here yes
[08:59] here you go yeah i'm gonna give him a
[09:00] treat for that try it again
[09:03] leave it look at me come on
[09:06] yes very good
[09:10] nice work buddy so i mean that's how you
[09:12] work on real-life leave-its in a variety
[09:14] of situations that was a very good
[09:16] example
[09:16] sometimes just taking an extra 30
[09:18] seconds to zoom in on a real life leave
[09:21] it where you pick up the
[09:22] item you remind them hey leave it
[09:23] applies to this too not just dog treats
[09:25] when we're doing a training exercise
[09:27] do you want to teach him a trick yeah oh
[09:30] i know i know i want to teach him
[09:32] sit pretty i usually call beg for a boy
[09:34] is that is that sexist
[09:37] i think george gets to pick what he
[09:38] wants to call it george do you identify
[09:40] as a sit prettier or a beggar
[09:42] i think we'll go with sip pretty why not
[09:44] let's break protocol so he knows the
[09:46] prerequisite sit
[09:49] good and i'll go ahead and get him
[09:51] warmed up give him a treat for sit even
[09:53] though he knows that just to get him in
[09:54] the right
[09:54] mindset i'm using some chicken here and
[09:57] sit pretty
[09:58] basically it's just where you teach your
[10:00] dog to sit up like this
[10:02] let's see like this
[10:05] oh that is pretty thank you that's it
[10:08] you remember last time we talked about
[10:09] lure training this is also lure training
[10:11] i'm gonna let him know i've got the
[10:12] treat look how i'm gripping it i've got
[10:14] kind of a chunk of chicken here
[10:16] and i'm gripping it like this so that i
[10:18] can slowly
[10:19] beat it out you'll leave it looks good
[10:21] sir
[10:23] is that adorable
[10:26] yes and so anytime he moves these feet
[10:30] i'm gonna go ahead and release a little
[10:32] bit of that chicken see
[10:34] yes just any effort although he's i can
[10:37] see he's never done this before because
[10:39] it's going to be clumsy yes
[10:42] spoke too soon okay good
[10:45] i don't want to reward him when his butt
[10:47] comes up off the ground the idea is that
[10:48] his butt stays on the ground
[10:50] yes good and right there i'm happy to
[10:54] let him
[10:54] grip my arm and you are heavy
[10:58] and balanced and i'm just gonna let him
[11:00] enjoy this chicken right here
[11:01] as he holds this position but you can
[11:03] see his hips right here
[11:05] are supposed to balance him
[11:08] yes good boy ow
[11:11] boy he takes treats rough if i give him
[11:14] the treat like this
[11:15] you can see how my whole finger goes
[11:17] inside his mouth
[11:18] see that you see how my and he's like a
[11:21] little
[11:21] clampy there but if i'm gripping it like
[11:24] that and just showing him a little bit
[11:25] look how much lickier he is see that
[11:29] but there's still some nibbles that
[11:31] happen in there he's not breaking skin
[11:33] or anything
[11:33] he's doing pretty well but it can still
[11:35] hurt a little bit i mean it is something
[11:36] you need to address but once they get it
[11:38] they tend to get it in my experience
[11:40] good boy you're doing yes and even
[11:43] though he didn't come up all the way
[11:44] that time i still want to go ahead
[11:46] and acknowledge that you're on the right
[11:47] track yes
[11:49] good yes
[11:54] came up all the way but he's trying so
[11:55] i'm gonna go i chose to reward that time
[11:58] i mean he just started really learning
[12:00] how to interact with people four days
[12:01] ago so
[12:02] sit see sometimes he he doesn't seem to
[12:06] i shouldn't have treated him there
[12:08] sometimes he doesn't really sit very
[12:10] readily when i'm on the ground i think
[12:12] if i
[12:12] stand up george yes
[12:16] sit see that he's more likely to listen
[12:18] to sit when i'm standing up like this
[12:21] yes so we the next step of this and this
[12:25] is premature
[12:26] is to get him less dependent on holding
[12:28] my arm
[12:30] sit good
[12:33] yes little reward on sit just so i keep
[12:36] that around for a minute
[12:38] here yes
[12:41] good i'm the moment he comes up i'm
[12:44] immediately pulling the treat away
[12:45] good so the positioning of the treat is
[12:49] so important here he hasn't bound his
[12:50] center of gravity
[12:52] yet i don't think i have either but you
[12:54] really want to keep it at just the right
[12:56] height here
[12:57] so that they don't stand up on their
[12:58] hind legs so
[13:00] i guess notice the hand movement here
[13:02] i'm using his nose
[13:04] and right there i'm really gripping it
[13:06] so he's having to work for every little
[13:08] millimeter
[13:09] of that chicken but he's gripping on
[13:13] here
[13:13] like that's here trying to get him on
[13:16] his
[13:17] yes yes good very good did you see he
[13:20] held it for just
[13:21] a little bit longer there without any
[13:23] help from me those are the moments i
[13:24] really want to communicate to him that i
[13:26] like
[13:28] yes not bad so
[13:31] i'm going to try to discourage him now
[13:33] from grabbing onto my arms and i'm going
[13:34] to get my arm out of the way and see if
[13:36] i can get him accidentally
[13:37] holding that position for a second yes
[13:40] good
[13:41] a little late on my mark that time but
[13:43] that's okay hey george
[13:48] yes he's trying i mean he is trying so
[13:51] hard you can see he's like all right is
[13:52] this right
[13:54] almost sit
[13:57] i know he's like what was wrong with
[14:00] that one
[14:01] i don't get it and so it's a fine line
[14:04] here you want to be very careful not to
[14:05] overwhelm your dog
[14:06] with requests here and get them
[14:08] frustrated i think i need to find a
[14:09] reason to keep the training session a
[14:10] little more upbeat for him got a jogger
[14:12] coming by this will be interesting
[14:13] going to hold a short leash just in case
[14:16] actually he's probably gonna be running
[14:17] off
[14:17] hey good that's okay oh you're fine i
[14:21] probably should have prepared george
[14:22] better for that he got a little startled
[14:24] by
[14:24] a jogger coming up over here let's see
[14:26] how well he recovers though sit
[14:29] pretty good pretty good he's
[14:30] demonstrated to me that he's recovered
[14:32] by holding that sit and that guy's not
[14:33] very far away either so that's pretty
[14:35] good
[14:35] good recovery buddy back to yes
[14:38] i'm not saying sit pretty sit pretty
[14:40] again because he doesn't know what that
[14:42] means
[14:42] yes very good i'm gonna see if i can
[14:45] keep this going
[14:46] yes yes
[14:51] what is happening
[14:59] yes yes you can see how he's about to
[15:02] topple over there that's what i'm
[15:04] talking about with the muscle memory
[15:06] it almost seemed to help for me to be
[15:07] like standing up but a little hunched
[15:09] over right here he seems to respond a
[15:10] little better at least for this
[15:12] particular skill notice his butt though
[15:13] right there i don't think he's really
[15:15] going to be able to balance there so i
[15:17] want to set him up for success here
[15:18] see that's much better look at that sit
[15:20] that's an easier butt to balance on
[15:22] right there
[15:23] that's a sentence i never thought i'd
[15:25] say
[15:28] here we go yes little late did you see
[15:32] i said yes but it was as he came up
[15:34] that's trainer error right there
[15:36] i really want to do my best to say yes
[15:38] when he's doing exactly the thing that i
[15:41] want that's our goal to try and mark
[15:42] precisely when our dog is performing the
[15:44] action we're teaching them and that
[15:45] takes practice and no one will
[15:47] ever be perfect with that but we can all
[15:49] try right i'll be honest with you i have
[15:50] no idea if we're going to finalize this
[15:52] trick in this series or not
[15:54] because it does usually take two or
[15:55] three weeks of a dog learning how to
[15:57] balance
[15:58] to really learn how to hold that
[15:59] position but who knows
[16:01] he's defied all odds in more ways than
[16:03] one so far
[16:04] it's such a delicate lure too you gotta
[16:07] feel that out with each individual dog
[16:08] sit
[16:10] good yes yes okay good
[16:14] work i think that was a great one to end
[16:16] on we got a micro second of sit pretty
[16:19] i'm feeling great about that i don't
[16:20] want to burn them out on it so i'm going
[16:21] to give them a break
[16:23] buddy you're doing so well can you
[16:25] believe this dog
[16:26] has been sitting in a shelter for four
[16:28] months amazing dogs like this are just
[16:30] a dime a dozen in shelters they are
[16:33] everywhere
[16:33] i hope we can get them into the right
[16:34] foster home or find him a new home or
[16:37] something because he cannot go back to
[16:39] the shelter he's way too bright
[16:41] and way too promising he's already
[16:43] walking a little bit better which i like
[16:44] that goes to show that a nice long walk
[16:47] paired with some training that
[16:48] stimulates his brain and body a little
[16:50] bit
[16:50] can be very satisfying to him hopefully
[16:52] he'll take his mid-afternoon nap
[16:55] all right just let the two dogs out to
[16:57] burn some energy off and play here
[17:02] the nurse is really trying to get george
[17:04] to play chase she clearly is the better
[17:07] at this game george has his talents
[17:12] [Music]
[17:16] though
[17:21] [Music]
[17:27] running circles around you george
[17:31] metaphorically speaking
[17:54] and our house looks like this
[18:01] that's how you know we're filming a dog
[18:03] training series again
[18:05] how does this happen it's like we have
[18:07] an infant or something
[18:08] it's a lot of work and you gotta get a
[18:10] dog listening to the basics in a short
[18:12] period of time good boy george
[18:15] we're gonna teach you how to clean up
[18:16] next i'm just a neutral observer guys
[18:20] i'm not training you
[18:24] hey sweet boy i don't think you're
[18:27] supposed to be doing that it's
[18:28] very cute though are you enjoying zach's
[18:31] bed
[18:33] oh man i make my bed guys just saying
[18:44] i appreciate your strength because i
[18:45] know how much you love that
[18:51] redirect now you're on the furniture
[18:55] see i made my bed he just unmakes it hmm
[18:58] i have evidence that it was not made
[19:02] oh my goodness okay oh geez are you a
[19:03] pillow bumper i think he might be
[19:06] i wouldn't sleep with that pillow
[19:07] anymore i agree with that
[19:10] i'm gonna put in this crazy little wound
[19:12] up i thought he was gonna take a break
[19:14] but i'm gonna encourage him to go in his
[19:16] crate voluntarily throw a chew in there
[19:18] very good about his crate trading so far
[19:20] i want to show him what i want him to do
[19:22] instead of saying
[19:23] don't do that but don't do that
[19:27] what do you think you ready to take a
[19:28] nap looks like you're tired to me
[19:32] look at those tired eyes you're looking
[19:34] smarter
[19:35] andy's just being good
[19:38] [Laughter]
[19:42] this is the greatest series i have ever
[19:44] made or we have ever made i should say
[19:47] what about george well we're only three
[19:50] days in but it
[19:59] and as predicted he is definitely
[20:02] taking a nap i still have a lot of
[20:04] training to do with him today though so
[20:05] he's not getting off that easy but i
[20:07] think we should let him recover
[20:08] a little bit in the meantime get 50 off

[01:32] off of a two week trial of nom nom by
[01:34] using my special link in the description
[01:37] trinom.com zack there's no way i could
[01:40] have a dog like george
[01:41] in my custody and not attempt to get him
[01:44] into playing some frisbee i like playing
[01:46] frisbee with almost any dog that is
[01:48] willing
[01:49] so it'll be curious to see how this
[01:51] pitbull type dog
[01:52] takes to frisbee i always cherish the
[01:54] first frisbee lesson with any dog that i
[01:56] do them with so
[01:57] i'm excited especially with a big tug
[01:59] dog so
[02:00] just quickly to review when you're
[02:02] teaching frisbee to your dog the first
[02:04] step is to generate
[02:05] interest i suspect that's going to be
[02:07] easy with him although what's this about
[02:09] hey i don't think he knows it's a toy so
[02:12] let me make it clear
[02:13] yeah good boy that it's a toy get it
[02:16] it's okay
[02:16] he doesn't know how to bite it by the
[02:18] rim yeah there he goes he figured it out
[02:20] there he goes and oh wow good boy i'm
[02:23] gonna let him know it's okay to tug this
[02:25] good look that's a bite you guys you
[02:28] look at it and you're like how would i
[02:29] ever
[02:30] get a frisbee away from a dog that's
[02:32] pulling like this holy cow
[02:34] let go
[02:40] leave it
[02:43] i feel like i know what i'm doing come
[02:44] on get it
[02:47] good good let go
[02:54] leave it alone stay okay
[02:58] we've generated interest in the frisbee
[03:00] he's letting go
[03:01] pretty well sit stay he picks up things
[03:04] so quick i'm going to roll it now
[03:06] right i want to see what happens when i
[03:07] roll it i don't want to just throw it
[03:09] because he's going to be like
[03:10] well he might actually figure it out but
[03:12] let's see
[03:13] ready okay yes
[03:18] good that was pretty good did he get it
[03:20] by the rim i mean
[03:22] good let go okay
[03:26] let go come on i was talking good about
[03:30] let go leave it stay
[03:34] okay go on good boy
[03:38] come on george i'm gonna get low
[03:42] yeah i'm gonna play tug when he gets to
[03:43] me
[03:45] let go
[03:48] uh come on let go
[03:53] yes okay
[03:56] well done so that one he cleanly picked
[03:58] it up by the rim
[04:00] and he's just like oh this new joy's so
[04:01] exciting i want to walk around with it
[04:03] for a second
[04:03] which is okay i mean i'm going to be
[04:05] tolerant there
[04:07] i love that he's into it good all right
[04:08] hey let go
[04:10] so as he gets more excited the let go
[04:12] gets a bit tougher so i'll concede that
[04:14] but we're definitely trending towards
[04:16] improvement
[04:17] to get a dog to catch a frisbee in the
[04:19] air takes several weeks of training
[04:21] typically so i don't expect that
[04:23] here or necessarily in this series at
[04:25] all but the next step would be to get
[04:28] your dog
[04:29] to catch it while we hover it right in
[04:31] front of them like that right
[04:33] hey let go yes get it
[04:36] that was amazing did you see him
[04:38] actually go for it
[04:40] get it good boy i mean he's very close
[04:44] stay yes oh there we go baby
[04:48] that's what i'm talking about first
[04:50] catch ever
[04:51] oh we did it that was so great to me
[04:54] that's the equivalent of a child taking
[04:55] their first steps it's just amazing
[04:58] yeah two in a row oh my gosh look at
[05:01] this
[05:01] good boy i'm gonna let him really
[05:03] celebrate he loves that tug
[05:05] of course with tug comes let go when
[05:08] your dog is learning to play frisbee let
[05:10] them know that you appreciate every time
[05:12] they go for it
[05:13] not just when they actually make a catch
[05:16] nice work buddy
[05:17] you can't have a better first frisbee
[05:19] training session than this
[05:20] he's got to learn the timing and how to
[05:22] catch up to him but i'm not worried
[05:24] about him not understanding the game i
[05:25] think he clearly understands what he's
[05:27] supposed to do he just has to practice
[05:29] now
[05:29] okay go and as i throw them i'm trying
[05:32] to give them plenty of hang time so we
[05:34] can figure it out
[05:36] yeah good boy even if he goes for it
[05:39] we've got to act like they caught it
[05:40] whether they did or not
[05:42] okay there you go
[05:45] i mean like a pro this is definitely a
[05:48] frisbee pitbull
[05:50] let go now
[05:53] hey stop
[05:57] all right i am going to crack down a
[05:58] little because he's starting to really
[05:59] chomp and chew on that frisbee and that
[06:01] can be a really bad habit frisbees are
[06:03] not chew toys and bad habits can develop
[06:05] like
[06:06] a good yes okay good buddy good good
[06:10] good
[06:10] i'm gonna throw some rollers in there
[06:12] i'm not gonna forget about those either
[06:13] so kind of a mixture of rolling it to
[06:16] really get them
[06:17] let go no not gonna play tug now i'll
[06:19] play tug intermittently but with him
[06:21] catching
[06:21] on so fast i wanted to get this let go
[06:23] down hey let go
[06:25] no you see me really close to his face
[06:27] that's because
[06:28] we've earned some trust together you
[06:29] would not want to do that with a dog
[06:31] that you are not very comfortable with
[06:32] even then you've got to always use
[06:34] caution
[06:38] good boy come on love how he just turns
[06:41] back to me
[06:42] come come on come on come on brings it
[06:45] right to me
[06:46] let go george's let go is looking pretty
[06:48] good for the moment but when you're
[06:50] teaching things like this you often take
[06:52] one step forward and then
[06:54] two steps back so i don't think george
[06:56] and i have fought
[06:57] our last let go battle yet yeah
[07:00] i should keep them low the wind caught
[07:02] that one but when you're first teaching
[07:03] a dog to catch a frisbee they're still
[07:05] learning how to use their body so you
[07:06] want to keep them low
[07:07] okay go there it is
[07:10] that's it come on bud
[07:14] george you got it you got it
[07:18] let go yes like a real frisbee dog here
[07:22] this is day three with a dog that's been
[07:24] living in the shelter for the last four
[07:26] months who has picked up
[07:27] off the streets in new orleans and is
[07:29] performing like this
[07:31] i don't think there's anything special
[07:32] about what i'm doing i think he's just a
[07:34] really bright dog
[07:35] oh we have a pedestrian here so that's
[07:38] okay
[07:38] that's all right all right buddy it's
[07:41] okay it's okay
[07:43] come on over here come on that's good so
[07:45] this has been an interesting thing i've
[07:46] noticed about jordan when he's caught
[07:48] off guard by a stranger in the area he
[07:50] has what seems to be a fear response to
[07:51] them and he starts barking
[07:53] just pretty unsure so fear responses can
[07:56] escalate
[07:56] if we don't manage our dogs properly so
[07:58] i want to avoid
[08:00] any escalation in a fear response from
[08:02] you i think that's an area we can
[08:03] improve on by giving him more exposure
[08:05] to the real world
[08:07] and get him doing things that he likes
[08:09] in
[08:10] real world environments much like we're
[08:11] doing here dude no come
[08:15] on good boy yes
[08:19] nice if your dog has prey drive like he
[08:21] was trying to go after those ducks if
[08:22] you can become successful
[08:24] in redirecting it to something harmless
[08:26] like a frisbee or a toy
[08:28] then that gives them the satisfaction
[08:30] and they learn to forget about that that
[08:31] was a good example you can see
[08:33] how george was like all right i'll play
[08:34] frisbee over those ducks i'd much rather
[08:36] play with you
[08:36] so i think that was a pretty good lesson
[08:38] for today i mean
[08:40] more than i was ever expecting i don't
[08:42] think i've ever had a first frisbee
[08:44] lesson go
[08:44] quite that well and i've trained border
[08:46] collies so that's pretty awesome
[08:50] george come here it looks like george is
[08:52] having a little bit of a barking
[08:54] outburst i want to nip this in the bud
[08:56] and really
[08:57] focus on getting him to pay attention to
[08:58] you when he feels we need to react to
[09:00] something he sees outside
[09:01] no we've got to be quiet we don't want
[09:06] them
[09:06] to stay
[09:10] [Music]
[09:12] george
[09:16] sure that worked up i was trying to hide
[09:18] the treats from him but i think he
[09:19] detected it
[09:21] okay sit good job
[09:24] i'll take it before we use treats
[09:28] catch it
[09:31] all right good job it's not always that
[09:33] easy to get your dog's attention when
[09:34] they're excited by something outside
[09:36] but i'm really focusing on any barking
[09:38] outburst at all because
[09:40] man unwanted barking can get out of
[09:42] control quickly
[09:43] and so far he's been reasonably good on
[09:46] it
[09:46] now at day three though he's starting to
[09:48] get a little more comfortable here and a
[09:50] little more boisterous at times
[09:52] i need to do some maintenance training
[09:54] basically
[09:56] working on some things that we went over
[09:58] you might remember yesterday
[10:00] with george he did really well but his
[10:03] let go
[10:04] was not as good as i would like so i'd
[10:05] like to polish that up it's kind of
[10:07] hit or miss sometimes he's good with it
[10:09] and then other times he's like i'm not
[10:11] letting go
[10:12] all right let go uh-uh
[10:17] yes i'm just going to get them warmed up
[10:19] with a few of these
[10:20] let go stay
[10:25] ah oh okay we need some improvement
[10:28] there
[10:29] let go sit
[10:33] stay look at me
[10:40] here george here look at me stay
[10:48] here yes okay good boy gotta start
[10:51] releasing from this stay he's breaking
[10:53] on yes i'd rather he
[10:55] break on okay but we can work on that
[10:57] good
[10:58] boy stay
[11:03] okay yes good boy
[11:06] good work let go
[11:10] yes let go
[11:13] yes here
[11:17] okay you want to play with that one that
[11:18] works
[11:20] good let go
[11:24] yes let go
[11:28] yes let me see if he'll do a basic
[11:31] obedience request here
[11:33] while in this excited state stay
[11:38] here look at me
[11:41] okay yes good boy very good
[11:45] good and two tug toys
[11:49] good fine all right and let go
[11:55] yes go get it all right buddy
[11:59] looking good sit yes
[12:03] he's not used to working for his food
[12:05] but meal time is a great opportunity to
[12:07] get some training in with your dog
[12:09] yesterday we introduced lie down for the
[12:11] first time to him i don't think he's
[12:12] quite generalized it i'm gonna warm him
[12:14] up by reminding him what we did we're
[12:16] gonna lure him
[12:17] it's okay he's like i want that food
[12:20] he's really fixated on the bowl because
[12:21] you can tell from the shelter he's
[12:23] really used to getting his bowl at one
[12:24] time so he's like what are we doing
[12:26] he's not following allure with this and
[12:27] with kibble it can be a little tough to
[12:28] lure them anyway i was hoping he would
[12:30] do that but let's see if we can work on
[12:32] some other stuff so how about
[12:34] leave it look at me
[12:37] yes so we gotta leave it and look at me
[12:40] yes here leave it
[12:45] here look at me good
[12:48] leave it here look at me good just gonna
[12:52] be really repetitive here
[12:54] leave it that one's real close yes
[12:58] keep going
[13:01] there we go that's working a little
[13:02] better so that that's interesting rather
[13:03] than using a single kibble
[13:05] i put three or four or five and he yes
[13:08] he went right into the down wasn't that
[13:10] cool all right down
[13:12] yes yes
[13:15] bow oh my gosh look at you all right
[13:18] which i wore
[13:20] how about duration on down yes yes
[13:25] yes
[13:29] yes yes
[13:33] yes yes
[13:36] yes look at me
[13:40] okay good so i got a nice long down stay
[13:44] there
[13:44] i was rapidly reinforcing him with his
[13:46] meal
[13:47] just to let him know look i like that
[13:49] you're still holding your down stay now
[13:51] he's going
[13:51] into the down yes for a single kibble
[13:54] which was different than just a moment
[13:56] ago that's pretty cool
[13:57] yes
[14:00] yes right here okay and
[14:03] okay still learning what okay means
[14:07] that the stay is over with lie down you
[14:10] know it's probably a good idea for it to
[14:12] mean stay into a down until i say
[14:14] break that position okay here stay
[14:18] yes encouraging him to come back up into
[14:20] that sit
[14:22] now stan still pretty new to him come on
[14:27] okay good yes
[14:30] yes so watch this
[14:35] yes yes
[14:39] yes okay yes
[14:42] good boy okay meaning you don't have to
[14:44] hold that stand so
[14:46] once i get him in the position i'm going
[14:47] to try just like i did with lie down
[14:49] to hold him there by rapidly giving him
[14:52] his meal
[14:53] sit yes
[14:56] stay yes yes
[15:01] oh oh stay
[15:04] being very generous by giving him
[15:06] rewards here after all it is his meal
[15:10] yes
[15:14] okay yeah okay good boy yeah good
[15:18] can you lie down
[15:22] what how did you do that yes
[15:25] that was exciting because i gave him a
[15:26] hand signal and he went right into the
[15:28] down without a lure
[15:29] sit lie down
[15:32] you notice i'm saying down and lie down
[15:34] that can be a little confusing to some
[15:36] dogs sometimes
[15:37] but i like the dogs i work with to have
[15:39] a pretty broad vocabulary and they
[15:40] really seem to get it overall it doesn't
[15:42] seem to cause a lot of confusion as long
[15:44] as you're
[15:44] consistent using hand signals that they
[15:46] seem to be understanding as we're seeing
[15:48] here with george
[15:48] so i try not to get too hung up on that
[15:50] sort of thing i want you to feel
[15:52] liberated to be able to talk to your dog
[15:53] in a way that feels natural to you
[15:55] can you down
[16:00] yes okay he didn't really understand
[16:02] what the point meant
[16:03] but then the second i kind of bashed my
[16:05] fingers in a lure away he's like oh wait
[16:07] i think i recognize what you're going
[16:08] for there
[16:09] lie down
[16:13] see you guys confused then i do this see
[16:16] that just that little difference
[16:18] that little gesture made a huge
[16:20] difference on lie down there
[16:22] come on good
[16:26] hold on
[16:34] oh my yes he could do bow
[16:38] yes maybe he could do crawl he's so
[16:40] responsive yes
[16:42] stay yes
[16:46] yes yes yes
[16:50] yes yes and okay good boy
[16:55] wow that was pretty impressive now i
[16:57] caught him bowing i like teaching dogs
[16:59] tricks i think it's good for their brain
[17:01] i think it's just good for overall
[17:03] communication building so the fact that
[17:05] he offered it right there
[17:06] was awesome sit
[17:09] lie down no treating my hand that time
[17:13] guys
[17:14] yes pretty good so we're trying to
[17:17] fade out the lore over time okay come on
[17:20] okay good notice all the ways i'm
[17:24] looking to say
[17:25] yes to him so that he really starts to
[17:28] understand
[17:29] how to communicate with a human being
[17:32] george
[17:33] [Applause]
[17:35] yes good big reward there for coming to
[17:38] me when i called him
[17:39] in fact i'll go ahead and give him the
[17:40] rest of his meal just for that come wind
[17:43] called is huge
[17:44] for the first many months of training if
[17:46] not first
[17:48] year or even two years of training you
[17:49] want to go out of your way to save your
[17:51] dog
[17:52] when you come to me i'm definitely going
[17:54] to make it worth your while
[17:55] because that's a life-saving skill so no
[17:57] point in being stingy on rewards when it
[17:59] comes
[18:00] to such an important skill good job
[18:02] buddy proud of you
[18:03] i'm so thrilled at george's progress
[18:05] well another day
[18:07] is done day three i think he's pretty
[18:09] content
[18:10] hey george what's up buddy i just have
[18:12] to say that today was
[18:14] pretty unexpected in a lot of ways like
[18:17] it's clear to me this is a very smart
[18:19] dog
[18:20] it's clear to me this is a very strong
[18:22] dog difficult to communicate with when
[18:24] you first start to train a dog like this
[18:25] if you're not experienced with dogs you
[18:28] kind of
[18:28] are tempted to label them as stubborn
[18:31] dogs
[18:31] because they won't let go of the toy or
[18:33] they jump too much
[18:34] it's hard to get through to them if you
[18:36] don't really kind of embrace that spirit
[18:38] that they have
[18:40] frisbee was just the highlight today
[18:42] when i said that
[18:44] i have never experienced a first frisbee
[18:46] training session like that with a dog i
[18:47] kid you not
[18:48] it really was special and he really
[18:51] caught on i mean he's a natural athlete
[18:54] i think tomorrow we'll probably go into
[18:56] public in a more significantly
[18:57] distracting
[18:58] environment outside he's been doing well
[19:00] behind the house
[19:01] george is just a reminder to us all how
[19:04] many great dogs
[19:05] are available in shelters and pounds and
[19:08] rescue groups
[19:09] there really are just a lot of great
[19:11] dogs out there george
[19:12] i love you buddy i probably fell in love
[19:15] with george yesterday
[19:17] but i really love him today i think
[19:20] that he is really sweet and he's so easy
[19:24] to love
[19:25] what do you think i'm sorry i just had
[19:27] to come in here and say
[19:28] how many months do you think it told you
[19:30] it took you
[19:32] to say that you loved me because i'm not
[19:34] sure
[19:35] it was like months and you've known
[19:38] george for
[19:38] three days yeah and i love him
[19:41] it's true let's get a thumbs up for bree
[19:44] she's like
[19:44] the main executive producer of this
[19:46] series and she's killing it i hope you
[19:48] guys like it
[19:49] we're trying yeah trying to make
[19:50] something really cool for you
[19:52] it's being it's feeling pretty fun so
[19:54] far because right now as you're watching
[19:56] this
[19:56] the moira series with the german
[19:58] shepherd is on like episode five
[20:00] tomorrow
[20:01] yeah or so we're producing that too you
[20:02] guys might not realize we have a real
[20:04] job
[20:05] it's not just training dogs how do you
[20:06] feel about george
[20:08] i think he's snoring in my ear right now
[20:10] and it's very cute
[20:11] so soothing i noticed you're on the
[20:12] floor and the dog's on the furniture yet
[20:14] again oh
[20:15] i didn't even realize that i'm just so
[20:17] happy with him he got up here on the air
[20:18] mattress and
[20:20] he's not jumping on the furniture though
[20:22] we do have him pretty controlled but
[20:23] he's not attempting to jump on the
[20:24] furniture and
[20:26] i'm not seeing much much harm in it real
[20:29] time
[20:30] he caught a frisbee today he caught an
[20:32] actual frisbee not only do we want to
[20:33] train but
[20:34] we need to start getting the word out
[20:35] that he's available for adoption
[20:37] oh yes i think we have like enough
[20:39] footage now where i can put like a
[20:40] little
[20:41] like mini promotional trailer together
[20:42] for him get it on social and
[20:45] see how he does it's been a little bit
[20:46] nerve-racking because we're like
[20:48] stressed about finding him a home
[20:50] because he's so amazing and he deserves
[20:51] a home
[20:52] and it's kind of on us now because we
[20:54] signed him out of the shelter so we
[20:56] really have to get this done or foster
[20:58] group
[20:58] um right as excited and anxious as we
[21:01] are to start trying to find a home for
[21:02] george we wanted to take a few days to
[21:04] really get to know him
[21:05] and see how he did you know with zach
[21:07] with people with training
[21:09] with other dogs he sounded incredible
[21:11] with our dogs which is
[21:12] really awesome if i didn't have a
[21:14] two-dog rule i'd be really
[21:16] considering this guy i know he would be
[21:18] george george
[21:19] just saying every dog i work with i can
[21:21] see myself i mean you sort of can't you
[21:23] always do
[21:24] say you love them but when george caught
[21:27] that frisbee today i saw a different
[21:29] look on your
[21:30] face than normal that is the way to
[21:32] zac's heart if you're a dog
[21:33] true yeah i like i like athletic dogs

[00:00] every day george is making huge strides
[00:03] but in every area where he shows
[00:04] progress there's another area that still
[00:07] needs a lot of work
[00:08] ah too much i'm zach george
[00:11] and this is george no relations
[00:14] george has spent the last four months
[00:16] living in an animal shelter with minimal
[00:18] contact with other dogs or people
[00:20] and it's my job to transform him from a
[00:22] wild and crazy dog
[00:24] to an incredible pet seems
[00:25] straightforward right
[00:28] holy cow not getting that ball
[00:32] george is a dog like i've never known
[00:34] before i don't know if i can let this
[00:36] dog go
[00:37] let go this might be the single
[00:41] greatest transformation i have ever seen
[00:44] in a dog that i've worked with
[00:45] the hardest thing about fostering a dog
[00:47] you fall in love with them
[00:48] this is reality dog training
[00:52] subscribe and click the bell so you
[00:54] never miss an episode
[00:55] at this point it should be obvious that
[00:58] george
[00:59] really likes great toys and great treats
[01:02] so the biggest question is is your dog a
[01:04] bark box dog
[01:05] or a super chewer dog whatever they are
[01:08] bark will send you a box each month that
[01:09] your dog is going to be obsessed with
[01:12] super chewer is for dogs that are really
[01:14] tough on toys
[01:15] like george for example this is a beef
[01:18] scented seagull
[01:19] i'm sure it makes sense to dogs if your
[01:21] dog does manage to get this covering off
[01:23] they actually have toys inside of them
[01:25] too look at that
[01:26] it's a sandcastle by the way this is a
[01:29] squeaker
[01:30] i can't even squeak it i have to step on
[01:32] it and squeak it
[01:33] this one's a little bit easier but still
[01:36] very tough then you have a forever ball
[01:38] let go perfect can you teach george how
[01:41] to do that
[01:41] and bark box is for dogs that take a
[01:43] little bit better care of their toys
[01:45] if i know barkbox these are going to
[01:46] come off
[01:49] told you what a great game because your
[01:51] dog can learn to pull them off the stick
[01:52] here
[01:53] even the plush toys have varying
[01:55] textures which really matter
[01:56] a little raccoon that they can pull out
[01:58] she's going to love that look at the
[01:59] tail
[02:00] and with both these boxes you get really
[02:02] high quality treats and shoes it's great
[02:04] to replenish your treat supply without
[02:05] you having to go
[02:06] anywhere and guess what you can get a
[02:08] free barkbox superchewer box or
[02:10] even both when you sign up for a
[02:12] multi-month plan at barkbox.com
[02:14] dog training and superchewer.com dog
[02:16] training those links will be below
[02:18] another morning george slept perfectly
[02:21] overnight for the first time without me
[02:22] being present so he did
[02:24] awesome our plans for today are
[02:26] basically
[02:28] uh to do some planning kind of figure
[02:29] out how we want to proceed forward
[02:31] with george in his training program i'm
[02:33] going to be working
[02:34] off camera though i'll probably show you
[02:36] most of that anyway because there really
[02:38] is no off camera
[02:39] but as you can see the dogs are having a
[02:41] great time this morning playing with
[02:42] each other
[02:42] they really enjoy waking up like this
[02:44] together and i'm hoping to let them get
[02:46] a lot of play time in today it's going
[02:47] to be a little warmer today so i'm
[02:48] hoping to get a lot of this play time
[02:50] earlier in the day
[02:51] when training your dog you really want
[02:52] to consider weather and trying to
[02:54] optimize your outdoor training for the
[02:56] weather
[02:56] you don't want to train in too much heat
[02:58] especially here in the south it can get
[02:59] quite warm
[03:01] oh ah too much when their play gets a
[03:04] little too rough there's no harm in
[03:06] intervening george is very responsive to
[03:08] that
[03:12] but he's toughening up inertia too
[03:21] don't nip we don't nip sit
[03:25] stay that's too much we don't do that
[03:29] dogs playing rough can be perfectly
[03:30] natural however to help them more
[03:32] quickly understand what's too rough and
[03:34] what isn't it can be helpful to
[03:35] intervene and give them a few seconds or
[03:37] a few minutes to calm down before
[03:39] resuming
[03:39] intervening like that doesn't just teach
[03:41] george what's appropriate and what isn't
[03:43] it has also helped inertia to see that
[03:45] she can look to
[03:46] me to step in if she ever feels like she
[03:47] needs help he's crazy
[03:49] huh he's crazy crazy man
[03:53] today's a little different because bree
[03:55] has to do some off-camera production
[03:57] work so we don't have our camera
[03:58] operator so i decided to set up a tripod
[04:01] so i could still show you what i'm
[04:02] working on with george
[04:04] yes and so there that's exactly what i'm
[04:07] after
[04:07] so here i'm working on rewarding george
[04:09] for being in the heel position
[04:11] right by my side for following that lure
[04:13] which really helps me show him the exact
[04:15] position i want
[04:16] and for moving with me a little bit
[04:18] forwards and even backwards let's try
[04:20] a cypriot sit yes
[04:25] the sit pretty starting to look good i
[04:27] told you the muscle memory on that one
[04:29] takes a minute
[04:30] yes yes yes yes
[04:33] good the longer he's holding that
[04:35] position the faster i'm giving him the
[04:37] treats just to let him know that's
[04:38] working
[04:38] great example of how you can use your
[04:40] dog's meal to really
[04:42] train them either new things or maintain
[04:44] things that you're trying to keep
[04:46] you've got to admit he is one of the
[04:48] most special dogs
[04:49] we have ever featured on this channel i
[04:51] want to test now and see if he prefers
[04:53] to do his training
[04:54] with a toy use what your dog likes he
[04:56] likes play he likes food we can use that
[04:58] to train them all kinds of things
[05:00] yes so he's making an effort there so
[05:02] i'm going to give him some tug
[05:03] come on here
[05:07] come on let's go this way here let's go
[05:10] yes that's it he's like wait a minute
[05:13] we're doing that thing again for this
[05:15] that's weird good
[05:18] here good boy here
[05:23] this way come on you're doing good easy
[05:26] good boy
[05:27] this way come on come on i'm going to
[05:29] get a little bit more and then i'm going
[05:30] to jackpot them with this thing
[05:32] come on let's go come on yes good there
[05:35] we go
[05:36] really give him a nice 15 20 second tug
[05:40] session for that one
[05:41] he's clearly enjoying working for toys
[05:43] so let's try his frisbee
[05:45] go nice
[05:49] good boy let go
[05:53] come around doing very well with let go
[05:55] with the frisbee
[05:56] good
[06:01] let go straight to my hand there love
[06:03] that go
[06:05] we have to use tug as a throttle
[06:07] sometimes to bring up our dogs drive
[06:10] or resist using tug to bring down their
[06:12] drive if they're like a little too crazy
[06:15] here i want him a little happier about
[06:17] charging after that frisbee
[06:19] good boy get it come on now get it all
[06:22] right
[06:22] let go easy nope
[06:26] okay fine come round ready go
[06:30] there you go you went a little faster
[06:31] that time maybe i'm hoping to work on
[06:34] george today with something
[06:35] we call multiples in the world of dog
[06:38] frisbee that's where they catch them in
[06:40] rapid succession basically the goal
[06:42] would be to get them to
[06:43] catch one there catch it catch it catch
[06:46] it like
[06:47] that quickly it's a fine line here
[06:48] because on one hand i want him extremely
[06:50] excited on the other hand he's gonna
[06:51] have to quickly abandon one frisbee to
[06:54] catch the next
[06:54] yes good let go
[06:58] yes good i mean that
[07:02] right there is his first flawless
[07:04] multiple segment
[07:06] for basically a first attempt that was
[07:08] pretty amazing
[07:09] let go here yes
[07:12] let go hey
[07:15] here yes let go yes
[07:19] oh yeah yeah yeah that's exciting you
[07:23] guys
[07:24] gonna give him a good tug there he
[07:25] earned it he loves that
[07:27] but fine line remember let go
[07:31] yes stay okay let go
[07:36] yes let go yes
[07:40] let go yes
[07:44] nice job all right good boy
[07:48] good nice tug there
[07:52] i need a break after that one that was
[07:54] good one of the very selfish reasons
[07:57] that i'm trying to teach him these
[07:58] multiples these rapid catch and let gos
[08:01] because i think he has a shot at being
[08:03] the first dog i've worked with
[08:04] in over 15 years i can catch a double
[08:06] disc throw
[08:07] i think he has what it takes but that
[08:10] stuff doesn't usually come quickly it's
[08:11] just he's really excelling at frisbee so
[08:14] i want to give him a chance at it
[08:15] because it's a money move i'm telling
[08:16] you it's a good one
[08:18] go
[08:22] wow that was much closer than i expected
[08:25] so rather than just throw that over and
[08:27] over let me do it like this
[08:28] yes good i'll take it i'm looking for
[08:31] his like eyes to commit to it and then
[08:34] that's what i'm throwing it just to get
[08:35] them used to that rhythm so that's what
[08:37] george and i did all day in our day off
[08:39] and now we have our camera operator back
[08:41] so i've got some big plans for george
[08:43] today
[08:44] the day before yesterday we took george
[08:45] into a pretty crowded place for the very
[08:48] first time
[08:48] he did okay but he still definitely
[08:50] needs some work
[08:51] george george yesterday however we took
[08:56] an off day from the production but i
[08:57] still continue to work with george and
[08:59] he was blowing my mind at every turn
[09:02] so i'm hoping to take some of the
[09:03] success that we had yesterday
[09:05] and i hope to replicate it here in this
[09:07] medium distraction environment but one
[09:09] thing i know is that there are
[09:10] definitely birds here
[09:12] so yeah and george has made it clear
[09:14] that he is
[09:15] interested in birds of all sizes george
[09:17] and i are going to work on his general
[09:19] training today but again the big
[09:20] variable change is a new environment
[09:22] that he's never been to before
[09:24] let's give him this quick test see how
[09:25] he does over here just on his basics
[09:28] very good knew to said he knew what i
[09:30] was going to go for
[09:31] i'm just using his breakfast right now
[09:34] stay
[09:36] yes okay look at me
[09:41] yes good boy lie down has been a little
[09:44] challenging
[09:45] on grass surfaces
[09:49] yes there we go not today
[09:53] yes not released him from this down yet
[09:57] yes okay good boy now he can get up from
[10:01] the down
[10:02] we had a little bit of a breakthrough on
[10:04] the hand signal
[10:05] not too long ago let's see how he's
[10:07] doing there
[10:08] thinking about it
[10:15] yes good boy and okay
[10:18] that was so interesting to watch do you
[10:20] see how patient we were with him just
[10:22] then i gave him the request and he would
[10:24] look to his left he would look to his
[10:26] right and he would keep looking back at
[10:27] my hand signal trying to recall
[10:29] exactly what it was that he was supposed
[10:31] to do there you could read him really
[10:33] easily in that moment
[10:34] sit down stay from a distance okay his
[10:37] release all of that looking
[10:39] very good have i mentioned this is only
[10:40] day six with him with a completely
[10:42] untrained dog
[10:43] right out of the shelter listen to that
[10:45] car horn going off in the background
[10:47] that must be very distracting here
[10:52] george here the other thing we haven't
[10:54] even talked about
[10:56] we're right next to cafe dumont here in
[10:58] new orleans so they're making beignets
[11:00] back there which smell amazing right now
[11:02] and he's able to tune that out and pay
[11:04] attention to me
[11:05] yesterday i started getting him to
[11:07] assume the heel position by spinning
[11:09] into it here
[11:10] still probably a little early for this
[11:11] but i want to see if he's had any
[11:13] progress here
[11:14] come here see this yes just
[11:17] rewarding him for turning around here
[11:21] good yes i'll take that see how he ended
[11:24] up kind of over here
[11:25] we'll just try to improve that over time
[11:26] but he's looking good
[11:29] yes very good now did you see that turn
[11:32] that's how i want it to look good boy
[11:34] he's really whipping them legs around
[11:35] that's nice
[11:36] and it's awkward for a dog to use yes
[11:39] their back legs but i'm seeing dramatic
[11:40] improvement in typical george fashion
[11:43] here
[11:43] here yes look at me
[11:47] yes
[11:52] i'm trying to keep george aligned to my
[11:54] side in general right now but in the
[11:55] beginning
[11:56] you have to make judgment calls about
[11:57] whether to focus on your dog's exact
[11:59] position
[11:59] or their overall focus during heal
[12:02] neither answer is wrong but
[12:03] it's a lot for your dog to learn at once
[12:05] so definitely remain patient
[12:07] i'm gonna try the turn started to get
[12:10] out of here
[12:10] good recovery here george is still
[12:12] putting together exactly what we want
[12:14] when we ask him to heal but he's already
[12:16] showing glimmers of the light bulb going
[12:18] off
[12:18] george yes all right asking a little
[12:21] much of him there
[12:22] it's a little difficult to get his
[12:24] attention right now just because there's
[12:26] stuff going on in the background
[12:29] george here
[12:36] yes
[12:39] good here yes
[12:43] yes
[12:51] come up come on let's go this way george
[12:55] come on you're doing good buddy keep
[12:57] going
[12:59] come on let's go yes
[13:02] good all right not bad i'm pretty happy
[13:04] with that for today
[13:05] now it's about time that we teach george
[13:08] a new trick
[13:09] too since he knows down we can start to
[13:12] build on that
[13:13] i think every dog should know how to do
[13:14] a rollover but the problem with him look
[13:16] at his hips see how he doesn't readily
[13:18] relax his hips
[13:20] if they flip one hip under them it makes
[13:21] it a little bit easier
[13:23] so here it might be a little tougher
[13:24] with them this is common with a lot of
[13:26] dogs that are built like this
[13:28] they really lie down in that sphinx
[13:29] position
[13:31] yes okay there we go
[13:34] that was nice the lure has been really
[13:37] delicate with him like i'm having to
[13:39] lure differently because i'm actually
[13:40] using kibble with him today but i'm
[13:41] having to lure kind of with a handful of
[13:43] kibble as opposed to
[13:44] between my thumb and index finger you
[13:46] know what i mean so that's been
[13:47] something that's been kind of different
[13:48] with them
[13:49] here we go there we go nice and see i've
[13:51] got an open hand lure there which is
[13:53] really interesting
[13:55] good boy yeah dog training is about the
[13:58] nuances so really catering to your
[14:00] individual dog is key you want to go
[14:02] back the other way or not
[14:06] yes good one thing you don't want to do
[14:09] when teaching play dead or roll over
[14:11] is force them onto their back that will
[14:13] definitely make it worse in most cases
[14:16] you really want them going voluntarily
[14:18] and you've seen when he plays with
[14:19] inertia he likes to get on his back
[14:21] sometimes so he's comfortable doing the
[14:22] motion
[14:23] i like the battle i'm going to reward
[14:25] for it even though we're teaching
[14:26] rollover
[14:27] yes bow
[14:31] okay good
[14:34] okay see it
[14:38] down come on
[14:42] yes
[14:46] and um let's see how i got the treat a
[14:48] little farther away that time
[14:50] so that's the very beginning of trying
[14:52] to phase out that dramatic lure so
[14:54] eventually you can be like hey roll over
[14:56] and just give them a hand signal or say
[14:59] roll over
[15:02] so i'm looking for opportunities when i
[15:03] can see he's committed
[15:05] to really pull my hand away so he can
[15:07] get used to doing the behavior or as
[15:09] much of that behavior as possible
[15:10] without the treat being
[15:12] right at his nose look at that
[15:15] how far away yes roll over
[15:19] not too concerned with saying roll over
[15:20] roll over he doesn't know what that
[15:21] means it's more important
[15:23] okay to get him to go through it good
[15:25] job buddy we've seen george shake off a
[15:27] couple of times like this
[15:28] he's still relatively new to wearing a
[15:30] harness and collar and in this case i'm
[15:32] guessing that the harness and or traffic
[15:34] handle attached to him moves around as
[15:36] he rolls over and that might be throwing
[15:37] him off a little
[15:38] that's a nice light rollover training
[15:40] session that plants the seed i can
[15:42] continue to work on that as well
[15:43] in fact you should work on many things
[15:45] in a single training session with a dog
[15:47] like this
[15:48] george as smart as he is will get bored
[15:50] if i just keep training to these basic
[15:52] things the way to really get him
[15:54] excited about training is to break out a
[15:56] toy so i'm gonna do that next
[15:57] i mean you can see it look at this the
[15:59] second bree handed me the frisbees you
[16:01] can see
[16:02] different george he's very lit up right
[16:04] now he's very interested in these
[16:07] before i get started with my frisbee
[16:08] session let's just see how different his
[16:10] heel looks when i use
[16:12] a frisbee as motivation instead of
[16:13] treats
[16:20] you can see how motivated he is to heal
[16:21] for a toy yes
[16:23] okay good boy he loves to chew these
[16:27] things like bubble gum
[16:28] we've really been working on his let go
[16:30] that's been our nemesis sometimes it's
[16:31] great sometimes it's not so great it
[16:33] depends on his mood
[16:34] and so i've decided that one of the best
[16:36] ways to teach him to let go
[16:37] is to get him hopefully excelling at
[16:39] doing multiples you remember we talked
[16:41] about multiples being where you deliver
[16:43] frisbees in rapid succession where your
[16:44] dog has to let go
[16:46] abandon it and then catch the next one
[16:48] like that doing training like this is
[16:49] really great because it gets your dog in
[16:51] the habit of thinking
[16:52] quick and quickly moving on to the next
[16:54] thing the goal here is to get them to
[16:55] catch this one
[16:56] let go and then catch the other one
[16:58] we're getting a lot of use out of these
[16:59] frisbees
[17:01] catch it let go
[17:04] hey yes see right there when he let go i
[17:07] didn't even say yes and he was looking
[17:09] for it
[17:09] let go yes
[17:13] a lot of it is just finding your rhythm
[17:15] here yes
[17:17] good come here george come on
[17:20] here yes good
[17:24] all right and again not concerned with
[17:26] whether or not he catches it here
[17:27] the fact that he's attempting to catch
[17:29] his everything
[17:30] so it looks like it started raining we
[17:32] got some shelter here so i'm going to
[17:33] keep up with our training
[17:35] i'm going to be pretty conservative
[17:36] given that we're not on grass though
[17:38] we're on a hard surface so i always want
[17:40] to be mindful of the surfaces i'm
[17:41] working on
[17:42] here good catch it good let go
[17:46] yes george little distracted up here not
[17:50] not laser focused come on okay yes
[17:53] there you go right now i can see that
[17:55] his attention is a little thrown off i
[17:57] mean it's understandable we're in a new
[17:58] place now it's raining we just relocated
[18:00] from down there to up here
[18:02] that's a completely different setting
[18:03] for him but you can kind of see how he's
[18:05] not quite as intense about the frisbee
[18:07] so i'm wondering if i should
[18:08] play some tug with him to get him a
[18:09] little amped up and a little more
[18:11] intense about the frisbee
[18:13] but then again that runs the risk of
[18:14] setting let go back as well
[18:16] george good get it
[18:20] good and there's a nice tug all right
[18:23] catch it let go catch it let go catch it
[18:27] let go yes okay there we go
[18:30] considering he's just now learning how
[18:32] to do multiples those are looking pretty
[18:34] good
[18:34] another thing that i'd like to touch on
[18:36] with george is teaching him to start
[18:38] understanding the concept of listening
[18:40] to me when i'm farther away sit
[18:42] yes if i go up to george like that and
[18:44] say sit he's perfect but if i were to do
[18:46] that from farther away
[18:49] george sit
[18:52] same signal holding up you know
[18:54] pretending like i'm holding up a treat
[18:56] sit
[18:58] no here sit yes
[19:01] see how just an inch or two can make a
[19:03] huge difference
[19:04] dogs are like wait that's not normally
[19:06] what i do when you're that far away
[19:08] okay good let's see if we can improve on
[19:10] that sit
[19:12] he's distracted over here by someone
[19:14] doing some park maintenance
[19:16] so i don't want to ask for too much but
[19:17] i think he's got it in him to at least
[19:18] sit
[19:20] yes when you're in public training like
[19:22] this and you see they're distracted it's
[19:24] a good idea
[19:24] a lot of times to just let them check it
[19:26] out i mean look at that you think he's
[19:27] ever seen a vehicle like that
[19:29] yes i'm gonna treat him for holding his
[19:31] sit stay
[19:34] but boy now he sees a stroller good one
[19:38] stick it's really a fine line i'd like
[19:41] him to pay attention to me no matter
[19:42] what's going on but at the end of the
[19:43] day i need to be realistic about the
[19:45] fact that i'm working with a dog who is
[19:47] brand new to training
[19:48] and does not have extensive
[19:49] socialization with the world to my
[19:51] knowledge
[19:51] so these are the things i have to feel
[19:53] out as i go i'm gonna hold off on
[19:55] asking for look at me here
[20:00] i'm gonna see if he does it naturally
[20:03] good boy
[20:10] yes just i was waiting for him the
[20:13] moment he was gonna give his attention
[20:15] to me i wanted to go ahead and let him
[20:16] know i love that
[20:17] good boy george nice job okay
[20:21] yes i like the stand came right up into
[20:23] a stand
[20:24] yes look at me stay
[20:29] here sit
[20:35] yes isn't that funny you see that the
[20:38] slightly different position
[20:39] totally throws dogs off all the time you
[20:42] have to build it like a centimeter at a
[20:43] time
[20:44] sit that's better yes
[20:47] yes okay stand good
[20:50] stay look at me
[21:00] sit
[21:10] nope sit
[21:14] yes very good i gave him a gentle no
[21:18] there to just let him know
[21:19] essentially that's not what i'm looking
[21:20] for and then he thought about it and he
[21:22] went into the sit i mean he's showing a
[21:24] lot of potential it may not look like
[21:25] much but being able to get
[21:26] another foot or two away from your dog
[21:28] and have them perform
[21:29] a behavior like that is pretty
[21:33] challenging with a lot of dogs stay
[21:36] look at me sit yes
[21:40] good okay good love it i'm not going to
[21:42] just keep drilling and drilling with him
[21:44] today it's important that we keep
[21:45] training really optimistic and that he
[21:47] has some time to
[21:48] just enjoy this place so i think we'll
[21:49] go on a free walk right now and let him
[21:51] enjoy the environment sniff around not
[21:53] ask him to do much of anything
[21:54] a free walk is just where you give your
[21:56] dog a very casual
[21:58] walk you're not asking them to do skills
[22:00] left and right you're just letting them
[22:01] have some nice
[22:02] meditative time to themselves
[22:06] come on here good boy
[22:10] so you know i gave him some gentle
[22:12] encouragement there
[22:13] good job sir so so far i'm seeing this
[22:16] pattern of pretty heavy pulling
[22:17] when he's on a free walk or a less
[22:20] disciplined
[22:21] walk here thank you whoa
[22:24] pulling dog has its advantages stay here
[22:26] do not jump into the water
[22:28] there are definitely alligators in there
[22:30] but going down the stairs
[22:32] different story goodness
[22:35] all right this is exactly what i had in
[22:37] mind for a free walk george
[22:39] right now since he's pulling so much and
[22:41] the goal is for him to simply experience
[22:43] this new place i'm gonna pull off to the
[22:45] side so i don't have to deal with
[22:46] pedestrians as much
[22:47] it's a good thing about working in parks
[22:49] like this you can get the best of both
[22:51] worlds
[22:51] if you need to go towards a busy part of
[22:53] the park you can train there if you want
[22:54] to get them
[22:55] in a more secluded part of the park you
[22:57] can do that and so this is good and i'm
[22:58] just going to kind of keep him moving
[23:00] just so i'm giving him the experience of
[23:02] a walk we have another dog right over
[23:03] here
[23:04] so far he's been pretty good with dogs
[23:05] he'll look at him he'll notice him
[23:07] occasionally he'll bark at them i'd like
[23:09] to keep that behavior of him being
[23:10] decent around dogs maintained for sure
[23:13] i'm a little surprised right now i'm
[23:15] pretty much unable to get him to
[23:16] voluntarily pay attention to me
[23:17] but let me practice come when called
[23:19] this is when it matters george
[23:21] come come on yes
[23:25] good boy he was distracted by the dog i
[23:27] was able to get his attention on me but
[23:29] took a few attempts there so i want to
[23:31] work on that too
[23:32] it's important to remember that our dogs
[23:33] are not machines no one no dog
[23:36] nothing and life is a hundred percent
[23:38] and so while i stress this
[23:40] is his time for him we still want to
[23:42] prove
[23:43] basic things like come and stay
[23:45] periodically in these walks
[23:47] when you're working with bright animals
[23:49] like dogs you have to always remember
[23:51] that they're
[23:51] very interested in a variety of things
[23:54] that's one of the qualities
[23:55] of being smart being curious about
[23:58] things just be understanding of that
[23:59] when working with them
[24:00] they don't always adhere to our schedule
[24:03] and our
[24:04] desired rate of success come on keep
[24:07] moving good boy
[24:08] that was good i didn't want him to stall
[24:10] out there
[24:12] he's really walking quite nicely so you
[24:14] can see he was really starting off
[24:16] pulling very bad when we got here
[24:18] and even when we started this particular
[24:20] free walk and now he's
[24:21] walking a lot better stopping to smell
[24:24] briefly moving on
[24:25] seems to be enjoying himself quite
[24:27] honestly that's the whole point
[24:29] of this walk that primes your dog for
[24:31] all kinds of success in the future too
[24:33] when they have regular experiences like
[24:34] this
[24:35] i'd like to give them some desensitizing
[24:37] around birds too
[24:38] looks like we've got a canada goose over
[24:40] there just chilling in the water we can
[24:42] let him
[24:42] explore a bird if he discovers it don't
[24:45] pull me towards the water's edge there
[24:47] are gators in there
[24:49] i have no doubt you could handle
[24:50] yourself with one though there we go
[24:52] he's looking at that flock of seagulls
[24:54] over there look at him on one foot ready
[24:56] to sprint after him if he could
[24:58] sir no come here come on
[25:02] zoom in on that and see if that goose is
[25:03] alive okay it's a real good smell
[25:05] that goose is alive and standing on
[25:07] water we are witnessing a miracle right
[25:10] now and you're just acting like it's
[25:11] normal
[25:11] it's like jesus goose leave it
[25:15] what's this someone had a crawfish boil
[25:18] here hey
[25:19] leave it good boy oh
[25:23] see this leave it alone only in new
[25:26] orleans guys
[25:27] you come across a crawfish leave it
[25:31] it's okay i'm vaccinated okay come on
[25:34] let's go
[25:35] yeah good job did you see that real life
[25:38] leave it there that was
[25:39] really impressive how quickly he's
[25:40] picking that up you want to play with
[25:41] your super chewer toy this is a good way
[25:43] to get some light heel training in with
[25:44] him as well
[25:46] for him this is not work he's like i
[25:49] don't consider this training this is fun
[25:51] that's always the best kind right there
[25:53] come on
[25:54] here yes good
[25:58] i'm trying to reward him before he jumps
[26:00] ideally
[26:01] easier said than done with george here
[26:04] good boy yes
[26:09] good let go yeah
[26:12] good a little awkward with the leash on
[26:17] here that's okay easy
[26:18] leave it alone here come on
[26:22] easy
[26:26] so he's really trying to keep pace with
[26:28] me that's really good
[26:30] he's staying when i stay that's the
[26:32] point of heel that they're really
[26:33] just in tune with you and staying with
[26:34] you
[26:37] okay easy come on here ah
[26:41] here come one nope
[26:45] yes good
[26:50] good so just getting to chase after that
[26:52] toy is exciting to him
[26:53] getting the chomp on it a little bit let
[26:56] go
[26:58] now let go let go
[27:06] no it's not your toy that's my toy it's
[27:09] looking better but he's one of the more
[27:10] challenging dogs i've ever had to teach
[27:12] let go to you're doing good look at that
[27:16] yes ah boy i pushed him right to the
[27:19] jump should have rewarded a millisecond
[27:21] earlier that's all right that's all
[27:23] right
[27:23] we never know what the next data point
[27:25] on the graph will be
[27:27] here here
[27:30] yes good boy
[27:35] let go good boy here let's try left heel
[27:40] now
[27:44] you're doing great you're doing
[27:46] fantastic here
[27:47] come on easy too far
[27:51] come on let's readjust here
[27:54] and here's a classic example of me just
[27:56] getting plain greedy
[27:57] since george has been doing so well but
[28:00] in hindsight i can tell you i'm
[28:01] definitely
[28:02] not rewarding george enough here so
[28:04] remember if your dog is not succeeding a
[28:06] couple of times in a row take a step
[28:07] back and make things easier for them
[28:09] so every day we're just seeing more and
[28:11] more progress out of him this might be
[28:13] the single
[28:14] greatest transformation i have ever seen
[28:17] in a dog that i've worked with
[28:18] and here we're getting some really good
[28:20] leash walking out of him
[28:21] just incorporating play into our
[28:23] training seems to really encourage him
[28:25] to feel more satisfied well done
[28:28] oh we have a hoverboard up here which
[28:31] he's been pretty good on stuff like that
[28:32] but i see him pulling a little bit
[28:38] i'll hold on to him just for good
[28:42] measure
[28:44] you doing good every day george is
[28:47] making
[28:47] huge strides but in every area where he
[28:50] shows progress there's
[28:51] another area that still needs a lot of
[28:53] work nice night
[28:55] out here doing a free walk with the guys
[28:57] just letting them
[28:58] check things out here beautiful night
[29:03] sun's going down
[29:06] i know george's little throwed off by
[29:09] the wind
[29:11] inner inertia come
[29:17] okay girl good boy what a good man
[29:21] all right let's keep moving come on good
[29:24] job guys
[29:29] i love just walking and smelling the
[29:32] ground
[29:33] checking things out so we're back from
[29:35] our walk now the dogs did
[29:37] reasonably well together i mean there
[29:39] was on the wall
[29:40] oh just a little bit yeah it was a
[29:42] little tough to do but
[29:43] it was okay i'm interested to find out
[29:45] how you manage that good for you
[29:48] thumbs up for zach for filming while
[29:49] holding two dogs
[29:51] i'm just great like that he had a long
[29:54] day today we did a lot today
[29:55] the frisbee has been interesting yeah
[29:57] his frisbee were a little plateaued i
[29:59] mean for
[30:00] george you know uh over the last 24
[30:03] hours we kind of haven't moved too much
[30:05] farther but
[30:05] his multiples are getting better which
[30:07] is exciting to me
[30:08] and i mean he's just having a blast a
[30:10] really good time
[30:11] we need to probably start getting
[30:13] serious about his adoption but we'll
[30:15] talk more about that
[30:16] tomorrow i guess so yeah i have a
[30:19] the more i get to know george first of
[30:22] all the more i love him and props to all
[30:23] you foster people
[30:25] who do this all the time because
[30:27] honestly i kind of want to keep george
[30:29] but we can't
[30:30] it's okay we're not hi andy i know andy
[30:33] would be okay not keeping george
[30:35] the more that i get to know george the
[30:38] more
[30:38] particular i kind of feel about
[30:42] the like perfect adopter that i have in
[30:45] mind for him and i know that's
[30:46] definitely not the right way to go so
[30:47] i'm getting a little worried because i
[30:49] really want him to go to a home that
[30:51] wants to like actively train him and
[30:53] interact with him every day because he's
[30:55] got so much cool potential i would love
[30:57] to see him realize
[30:58] um yeah he's the dog trainer stream yeah
[31:01] sure
[31:01] but i sure hope that i don't stand in my
[31:03] own way with this adoption process
[31:05] because
[31:06] honestly i have no idea what i'm doing
[31:08] but overall i feel really good about his
[31:09] progress
[31:10] i hope i can teach him more the thing
[31:12] with him is knowing where to stop so he
[31:14] recovers and so you don't burn him out
[31:16] yeah he's he's doing great so fingers
[31:18] crossed it all continues
[31:19] we definitely have some more challenging
[31:21] times ahead with george in the meantime
[31:23] get a free bark box
[31:24] super chewer box or both when you sign
[31:26] up for a multi-month plan at barkbox.com
[31:29] dog training and training if you're
[31:32] working on teaching your dog you'll
[31:33] definitely like both of my books too
[31:35] we'll see you in the next episode
[31:37] unless you follow us on instagram tick
[31:39] tock and facebook and we'll see you in
[31:40] the meantime over there

TRANSCRIPTION:

[00:00] we've been struggling it goes from just
[00:01] terrible to better
[00:03] to terrible to worse than ever to what
[00:08] good yeah that was so close i just keep
[00:11] hoping that it's gonna like click and
[00:13] he's gonna just
[00:13] catch one and then catch the other one
[00:16] now it's time to attempt to train george
[00:18] at the dog park i'm zach george
[00:21] and this is george no relations
[00:25] george has spent the last four months
[00:26] living in an animal shelter with minimal
[00:28] contact with other dogs or people
[00:31] and it's my job to transform him from a
[00:33] wild and crazy dog
[00:34] to an incredible pet seems
[00:36] straightforward right
[00:39] holy cow not getting that ball
[00:42] george is a dog like i've never known
[00:44] before i don't know if i can let this
[00:46] dog go
[00:47] let go this might be the single
[00:51] greatest transformation i have ever seen
[00:54] in a dog that i've worked with
[00:55] the hardest thing about boston dog you
[00:57] fall in love with them
[00:59] this is reality dog training
[01:02] subscribe and click the bell so you
[01:04] never miss an episode
[01:06] i've got some big plans for george today
[01:08] no matter
[01:09] what you're working on with your dog
[01:10] knowing what motivates them most
[01:12] is critical for success once you figure
[01:15] out what your dog
[01:16] really loves you can leverage that love
[01:18] by using it as a reward during your
[01:20] training sessions
[01:21] all kinds of things can be motivating to
[01:23] dogs but it's safe to say that for most
[01:24] dogs
[01:25] food and play are really high on the
[01:28] list
[01:28] for dogs who love food using their meal
[01:30] as a reward during a training session is
[01:32] a fantastic
[01:33] idea as long as the food you're giving
[01:35] them is super high quality
[01:37] and tasty of course george loves solid
[01:40] gold food and i'm not surprised
[01:41] solid gold has one of the best
[01:43] ingredient lists i've ever seen
[01:45] they've done so much research into
[01:46] what's both healthiest and tastiest for
[01:48] dogs
[01:49] if you're looking for a dry dog food
[01:50] that has everything your dog needs give
[01:52] solid gold a shot our viewers are going
[01:54] to get 30 off select solid gold products
[01:56] by going to my special link in the
[01:57] description
[01:58] solidgoldpet.com zack let's see how he's
[02:01] doing with frisbee
[02:03] yeah whoa there we go nice catch bud i'd
[02:08] say he's doing all right
[02:09] you know we've been working on the
[02:10] double i don't think i'm gonna get it
[02:12] with him but i'll show you where we are
[02:14] hey let go ready come around ready
[02:19] go good effort though you can see he's
[02:23] teetering on the edge of it but the
[02:26] light bulb hasn't gone off with him
[02:28] this is a great way to challenge him
[02:30] mentally and physically as well
[02:31] beyond just basic bench all right guys
[02:34] stick with me here
[02:35] i know you guys are probably like what
[02:36] is even this thing you're trying to do
[02:38] right now
[02:39] and the answer is it's a double frisbee
[02:41] catch which is a totally epic trick and
[02:43] none of you are going to convince me
[02:45] otherwise
[02:46] but there is a greater point to training
[02:48] your dog a more challenging or advanced
[02:50] thing like this if george and i can work
[02:52] through this confusion and get to a
[02:53] place where he
[02:54] actually understands the rather
[02:55] complicated thing i'm asking him to do
[02:57] and realizes he actually understands me
[03:01] that is how you develop really deep
[03:03] communication with a dog
[03:04] i mean sit stay lie down and come only
[03:06] build so much communication between you
[03:08] and your dog right
[03:09] so i'm sticking with it here and i'm
[03:10] giving him lots of chances to try to
[03:12] figure this out and catch both frisbees
[03:14] i've been doing my best to break this
[03:16] concept down for him in a variety of
[03:18] different ways over the past few days
[03:19] and today i feel like he's really
[03:21] starting to understand the end goal
[03:23] i mean look at that you can really see
[03:25] him giving that second frisbee some
[03:27] serious looks
[03:28] so now he just needs some time to figure
[03:29] out how to actually physically do what
[03:32] i'm asking it's important to pay close
[03:33] attention to your dog's mindset too
[03:35] if george seemed like he wasn't having
[03:37] fun i would definitely stop asking him
[03:39] to try this but i'd say it's pretty
[03:40] clear he's enjoying this practice
[03:42] i do have an ulterior motive for this
[03:45] exercise session
[03:46] too i wanted to get out as much of his
[03:47] energy as reasonably possible because
[03:50] now it's time to attempt to train george
[03:52] at the dog park we've just arrived here
[03:54] at our location and
[03:56] instantly he's discovered a ball this
[03:57] brings me right back to the baseball day
[03:59] and i want to make sure
[04:01] that i can get his attention off of that
[04:03] george here
[04:06] george yes good boy here
[04:11] good okay well not my fault you missed
[04:14] it but you got your reward
[04:15] good boy huge improvement i wasn't
[04:18] expecting that ball to be there
[04:20] i don't know if it's as tempting as a
[04:21] baseball is to him but i do know
[04:23] that my alarm bells went off because
[04:25] that was a bit traumatic when he
[04:27] encountered the baseball i'd never
[04:28] encountered quite anything like that
[04:29] before and so it's really nice
[04:31] to see a similar situation and him be a
[04:34] little bit more controllable but you can
[04:36] see here we've got dogs around the dog
[04:38] park
[04:38] now since this is a training lesson i
[04:41] have no intention of really going
[04:42] in the dog park my intention here is to
[04:45] do training
[04:46] around dogs to see how he reacts i want
[04:49] to prove him and make sure that i can
[04:51] reliably get his attention around me
[04:53] when he sees strange dogs that he's not
[04:54] familiar with i mean you might be
[04:56] wondering well zack he's been
[04:57] training and listening around inertia in
[04:59] india at your house that's only two dogs
[05:01] though and that's in a different
[05:02] environment so
[05:03] just because a dog listens well around
[05:05] one dog doesn't mean they'll listen well
[05:06] around new dogs
[05:08] i talk about this in both of my books i
[05:09] love training on the perimeter of dog
[05:11] parks because obviously you have control
[05:13] of the environment you can get farther
[05:15] away if you need to if your dog becomes
[05:17] over threshold that's one of the great
[05:18] benefits of training around a dog park
[05:20] your dog is the one who dictates how
[05:22] close you're going to be working to the
[05:24] other dogs if your dog is too
[05:25] overwhelmed to give you their attention
[05:27] when you're close to the dog park fence
[05:29] then move
[05:29] farther away until they are able to
[05:31] focus on you and practice there for a
[05:33] while before you start to work your way
[05:35] closer
[05:36] yes hey
[05:39] here what's this good giving him a
[05:43] reward there for
[05:44] behaving acceptably around the dogs
[05:46] probably let go
[05:48] that like that prompt let go right has
[05:50] more to do with his
[05:51] interest in these dogs though okay come
[05:55] george is definitely interested in other
[05:57] dogs but he isn't likely to get
[05:59] overwhelmed so in his case
[06:01] i feel comfortable getting really close
[06:03] to the other dogs but i'll be watching
[06:05] him closely and ready to move farther
[06:07] away if we need to
[06:09] what's this yes good
[06:13] pleco a little less interested in the
[06:17] ball right now i think it has to do with
[06:19] being in a new place this is a different
[06:20] park than before
[06:22] not all parks are the same they don't
[06:23] all smell the same look the same feel
[06:25] the same to a dog
[06:26] so i'm just gonna walk up and down here
[06:28] i love doing this when i'm training a
[06:30] new dog
[06:30] yes mix up my currencies here let's give
[06:35] them some
[06:36] treats it's good to mix up your
[06:38] currencies with some dogs because it
[06:39] keeps training lively and
[06:41] unpredictable you see a dog playing
[06:43] fetch up there
[06:44] so far so good let's go see if we can
[06:45] give him a more significant test we'll
[06:47] go around a busier part of the park here
[06:49] see how he does around those dogs my
[06:51] only goal here is to make sure that i
[06:53] can get some general compliance out of
[06:55] him
[06:55] when he sees dogs at relatively close
[06:58] range good boy
[06:59] yes good work you got it
[07:03] nice job keep moving sir okay so they're
[07:07] a little distracted by a sense
[07:08] you can see that george is really on the
[07:10] edge of being able to listen to me but
[07:12] with a little patience i'm able to get
[07:13] him to move along without having to pull
[07:15] him away
[07:16] at all now i don't want him grieving
[07:17] dogs through the fences or anything like
[07:19] that
[07:19] see those dogs here you can see that
[07:22] nose working overtime right now
[07:24] he's really trying to gather info about
[07:28] them
[07:33] stay fine to let him look but i still
[07:36] want to be able to get his attention on
[07:37] me
[07:38] yes the look towards me i want to
[07:40] reinforce that i really like that he's
[07:42] looking at me when there are dogs
[07:44] right there sit stay
[07:47] here yes
[07:51] stay yes
[07:56] so you can see this pattern of
[07:58] desensitizing conditioning him
[08:00] when he's doing well and really just
[08:02] getting them used to the world and some
[08:04] of the more
[08:04] tempting things in it we're doing a nice
[08:07] long stay here
[08:10] dogs just feet away letting them look at
[08:12] the dogs now want to get attention on me
[08:14] periodically
[08:17] look at me yes
[08:22] stay dog's getting really rough and
[08:26] playing over here
[08:28] notice how he's holding that sit and
[08:30] stay
[08:32] yes we're going to continue on our way
[08:36] down here i think
[08:39] remember that your dog is the one who
[08:40] gets to pick what motivates them most
[08:42] okay good boy
[08:51] good boy this white dog
[08:54] is checking about don't want to have any
[08:56] greeting through the fence here so i'm
[08:57] not going to allow that i know they
[08:59] probably want to do that here george
[09:00] is a little too borderline to pay
[09:02] attention to me so i do have to pull him
[09:04] back
[09:05] but with just a few more inches of
[09:07] distance i'm able to get his attention
[09:09] back on me again
[09:11] here yes stay let him look at the dog
[09:19] good boy very good
[09:23] here see that i'm able to get his
[09:25] attention off the dog and on to me
[09:27] no i didn't say okay all right guess i
[09:29] spoke too soon
[09:30] in case that's not obvious from your
[09:32] angle it seems pretty clear to me that
[09:33] george has picked up the scent trail of
[09:35] the white dog that just walked away
[09:37] scents can be the most tempting of
[09:39] distractions for
[09:40] many dogs not perfect but
[09:43] pretty close
[09:51] waiting for him to look at me
[09:52] automatically just to reinforce that i
[09:54] like when he looks at me
[09:57] also letting him satisfy his curiosity
[10:00] here at the same time by
[10:02] checking out these dogs he's behaving
[10:03] very acceptably
[10:08] yes good boy
[10:15] okay this just goes to show when you
[10:18] take the time
[10:19] to really communicate with dogs and
[10:21] really show them how to behave they
[10:23] are more than willing to listen as long
[10:25] as we're very clear with our instruction
[10:27] and we go out of our way to make it
[10:28] worth their while hey you want to go
[10:30] play now
[10:32] i think we should go play and see how
[10:33] you're doing yes
[10:36] he's offering a heel right now yes
[10:40] so i want to acknowledge that i
[10:42] appreciate the initiative
[10:44] george you're doing great leave it
[10:47] come ah okay
[10:52] didn't quite leave it but he gave it a
[10:53] sniff moved on i'll take it
[10:55] we got a gentleman playing golf over
[10:57] here too which i mean it's a ball
[10:59] this will be interesting sports balls
[11:01] have been challenging
[11:03] watching this guy hit golf balls good
[11:05] boy
[11:06] yes
[11:10] good here good
[11:13] he's very interested in this guy playing
[11:15] with the golf balls but he's staying
[11:16] under threshold he's being
[11:18] compliant but now he sees a plastic bag
[11:21] i gotta be able to call him off that
[11:22] piece of trash over there whatever that
[11:24] is
[11:26] george come
[11:30] no there's a consequence here
[11:33] i'm going to encourage him physically by
[11:34] reeling him in
[11:36] so i will do that from time to time
[11:39] because we have to be able to enforce
[11:41] come when called again that is a far cry
[11:43] from a harsh
[11:44] leash correction some people will say
[11:46] zack i thought you were
[11:47] purely positive now understand dog
[11:49] trainers that use positive reinforcement
[11:51] as a main training strategy
[11:53] never refer to themselves as purely
[11:55] positive that's a term that's used by
[11:57] others to try and marginalize using
[12:00] modern humane
[12:02] scientific based methods i think it's
[12:04] perfectly acceptable to encourage a dog
[12:06] to come to you physically
[12:07] in this case in the same way that i
[12:09] would go up to a three or four year old
[12:10] child
[12:11] get them by the hand and say come on
[12:13] let's go if they weren't listening to me
[12:14] when i called them back
[12:15] here he goes again let's see he's still
[12:17] distracted hopefully he'll come to me
[12:19] voluntarily
[12:20] come he i swear he understands what i'm
[12:22] saying good boy
[12:26] he likes that ball look at him he's so
[12:28] ready
[12:29] look how focused
[12:34] okay come yes good man
[12:37] boy you gotta love that i love a dog
[12:39] bolted at me like that i'm gonna try to
[12:41] keep the ball out of sight here
[12:43] sit stay because i want them coming to
[12:46] me not the ball
[12:47] but the ball really helps bridge that
[12:50] motivation
[12:52] okay come
[12:56] good job nice long stay really good
[12:59] recall
[13:01] i'm gonna leave the ball over there stay
[13:03] is he gonna go to the ball or is he
[13:04] going to go to me i'm really not sure
[13:06] honestly
[13:07] come he went to the ball big surprise
[13:11] but he needs to come to me so let's work
[13:13] on that for a bit
[13:14] so we're going to do a couple of reps
[13:15] with the ball here and you can
[13:17] really see george's wheels turning so
[13:19] i'm just gonna let you watch this play
[13:21] out for a second
[13:22] come no
[13:25] george come yes
[13:28] good sit
[13:32] stay
[13:42] stay
[13:46] look at me come
[13:50] yes no
[13:54] yes good boy yes good boy
[13:58] we had a couple of breakdowns there he
[13:59] was doing pretty well
[14:01] still a little confused still having a
[14:03] tough time resisting
[14:04] the ultimate reward there at least for
[14:06] today is ball
[14:07] but the last two times there i let him
[14:09] think about it he never reached the end
[14:11] of his leash and he did ultimately
[14:12] listen
[14:13] but i love that he's making the decision
[14:14] on his own to eventually come back
[14:16] so i'm going to continue to make him use
[14:18] this impulse control because it's
[14:20] extremely important for all dogs
[14:21] especially pitbull type dogs to be
[14:23] highly obedient
[14:30] look at me come he's starting to get it
[14:33] almost but he's wimping out on that last
[14:35] little bit come on you got to keep
[14:37] coming you got to come all the way come
[14:38] on
[14:39] come on i want to go come on george
[14:43] here come come on i want to get that
[14:46] collar
[14:46] grab it want him to be that close yes
[14:49] so i'm using a mixture of solid gold
[14:52] kibble and pieces of fresh cooked meat
[14:54] as i trained today
[14:55] give them some real chicken there stay
[14:58] ball's way down there he hasn't
[14:59] forgotten about it come
[15:03] on yes good boy
[15:08] good boy so there was a good example i
[15:10] mean there was
[15:12] several attempts in a row where he was
[15:14] like starting to come to me then he's
[15:15] like can i go after the ball but there i
[15:16] was able to get him to come in a more
[15:18] straight line getting down and being
[15:19] extra encouraging was extra helpful in
[15:21] that particular instance
[15:22] all right buddy i'd call that an
[15:24] extremely successful training session
[15:26] we headed home to relax but george had
[15:28] other plans
[15:35] look at me
[15:38] do you want to go play some more frisbee
[15:41] do you want to go play some more frisbee
[15:43] if you have a high energy dog who seems
[15:45] restless giving them
[15:46] a quick outlet for their excess energy
[15:49] can be a great way to
[15:51] satisfy them so in my continued efforts
[15:53] to
[15:54] train various frisbee skills to george
[15:57] i'm ready to train him
[15:58] yet another one and it's a pretty
[16:00] significant one let's do a little bit of
[16:01] reviewing so far we've worked with him
[16:03] on his multiples that's where he catches
[16:05] one frisbee after another we of course
[16:07] have
[16:08] taught him to do a basic frisbee catch
[16:09] where we just have him go out and catch
[16:11] one he knows a lot of elements of
[16:12] frisbee like come around
[16:15] and catch it right very good but now
[16:17] that he has a lot more obedience under
[16:19] his collar i'm hoping to teach him
[16:21] how to do a more sophisticated frisbee
[16:24] trick
[16:24] an over an over is where a dog jumps
[16:28] over your body to catch a frisbee of
[16:30] course there's a prerequisite that they
[16:32] know how to catch a frisbee
[16:33] okay sorry ready catch it good good man
[16:37] and so he's got that down let go his let
[16:39] go as we know needs work but
[16:41] it's getting better off and on it's
[16:44] important that your dog knows how to
[16:45] stay if you really want to teach this
[16:47] right
[16:48] so i don't care what his stay looks like
[16:49] whether it's a stand or a sit
[16:51] stay i'm gonna go slow because this is
[16:55] different for him i'm changing positions
[16:57] stay look how well that stay is
[16:59] okay get it then we're gonna do a take
[17:01] just like that
[17:02] let go good boy stay
[17:06] very good i like how he followed the
[17:07] frisbees back over too so once again
[17:09] it looks like this take it good come on
[17:13] good so i want to get him really
[17:14] comfortable with jumping over my legs
[17:16] and
[17:16] that he looks like he is comfortable
[17:18] with
[17:19] and then okay george stay
[17:22] sorry stay then this time i'm just gonna
[17:26] barely let go of the frisbee
[17:28] see that happened real quick i let go of
[17:31] it before he took it so we're trying to
[17:32] get a little bit of something that
[17:33] resembles the throw
[17:35] okay good very good so much better you
[17:38] can see he caught the frisbee there
[17:39] while jumping over my legs i love it so
[17:41] let's see if we can make this look a
[17:42] little bit more impressive hey george
[17:44] over here buddy
[17:46] sit stay a lot of people like to say
[17:49] that
[17:49] trick training or training like this
[17:51] isn't serious training but i've got to
[17:52] tell you
[17:53] when you look at the intensity in his
[17:55] eyes look how he's willing to hold that
[17:57] stay
[17:58] just in exchange to have the chance at
[18:01] catching a disc
[18:02] i mean in the face of something really
[18:05] exciting at least something he views as
[18:06] exciting
[18:07] that to me is one great way to build a
[18:10] serious rock solid stay out of a dog
[18:13] so trick training and sports training
[18:15] like this can be an incredible way
[18:17] to train obedience to a dog it's a huge
[18:19] myth that this doesn't strengthen
[18:21] obedience training
[18:22] but if you have the type of dog who's
[18:24] just so toy crazy
[18:25] this could be a really good activity for
[18:27] them because it gives them an outlet
[18:29] we even have a dog coming by getting
[18:31] your dog to play with you when things
[18:32] they find tempting or in the distance is
[18:34] an amazing way to help your dog learn to
[18:36] ignore
[18:37] distractions okay whoa i mean
[18:40] pretty solid hey george come on
[18:45] yeah buddy okay nice
[18:48] good job boy that was a good looking
[18:51] catch
[18:52] good boy good boy that was good good
[18:56] let go but do you see how we're starting
[18:58] to really combine a lot of the things
[19:00] that he's learning here
[19:01] that focus that stay that cumlin called
[19:04] even to come after the frisbee he'll let
[19:06] go
[19:07] sometimes no let's see i'm not gonna i'm
[19:09] not gonna throw it there he jumped the
[19:11] gun
[19:12] so we're gonna try and build on let's
[19:13] see he's just so excited
[19:16] stay
[19:20] wait okay
[19:23] nice good man we're gonna try this from
[19:26] a little farther away now because a
[19:27] really impressive over happens when they
[19:29] get a great running start
[19:31] good boy sit stay
[19:38] what george i was just sitting here
[19:40] telling everyone
[19:41] how frisbee can be a great way to
[19:43] encourage a dog to stay
[19:45] when you differ your position from a
[19:47] stage who i'm now sitting on the ground
[19:48] and expect you to stay
[19:50] that can be something that can throw
[19:51] some dogs off most dogs off in fact
[19:54] i'm a little scared bree says she's
[19:56] scared i don't blame her that's okay
[20:00] i can't guarantee your safety on this
[20:01] next one okay
[20:04] whoa there we go nice one i felt the
[20:07] whoosh oh my gosh
[20:08] yeah so his overs are looking really
[20:11] good i want to keep mixing this up and
[20:13] continue to teach him various elements
[20:14] of frisbee i do this just because i
[20:16] really enjoy it it's one of my favorite
[20:17] things
[20:18] to teach dogs it may not be for everyone
[20:20] it's certainly not for every dog
[20:22] for a dog like george and a person like
[20:23] me it is four
[20:25] and now if i could just get him to drop
[20:26] a frisbee to go after the next one and
[20:28] catch that double my life would be
[20:29] complete
[20:30] catch it let go good boy yes
[20:34] and really you've got to be willing to
[20:36] experiment when you're trying to
[20:38] communicate a pretty advanced concept
[20:39] like this
[20:40] good i love that holy cow what just
[20:43] happened
[20:44] that was pretty good hey let's go let go
[20:47] it's okay no
[20:49] okay let go good all right let's try the
[20:52] double
[20:52] see where we are here been working on
[20:54] this every day
[20:56] but we're definitely plateaued
[20:59] and i'm definitely rushing it i mean
[21:00] this is something that can take months
[21:02] to train but
[21:04] i'm just hoping to get lucky with him
[21:05] ready go
[21:07] let go oh come on
[21:12] come around go
[21:15] let go let go did you see that you
[21:19] he's going from looking at it to how do
[21:21] i catch that no you can't
[21:22] i know it's a lot to process in a short
[21:24] period of time ready come on go go go go
[21:29] ready go let go good
[21:32] boy that's my boy you're getting it
[21:34] catch it
[21:35] catch it let go catch it let go
[21:39] catch it let go catch it i'm reminding
[21:42] george how to catch multiple frisbees
[21:43] here to help him get the muscle memory
[21:45] for catching and letting go in rapid
[21:47] succession
[21:48] breaking things down into easier parts
[21:50] is a great way to help dogs understand
[21:52] more advanced concepts as quickly as
[21:54] possible
[21:56] let go yes
[21:59] good come around
[22:02] and go let go yeah
[22:06] good effort buddy go
[22:09] let go yes i want to see that i want to
[22:12] see that good boy
[22:14] good catch it stay catch it stay
[22:18] catch it stay good
[22:21] come around go good yeah that was so
[22:26] close okay maybe i'm a little too
[22:29] excited here but did you see that
[22:31] that was amazing he is so close to
[22:33] making this catch
[22:34] so gosh where do we even start with
[22:36] today
[22:37] george has had a very
[22:40] impressive day what a good man he is hey
[22:43] easy with those teeth i'm watching them
[22:45] george just continues to tease us
[22:48] with the double he's coming so close to
[22:51] making that double frisbee catch a
[22:52] couple of times i thought he actually
[22:54] did it but then i looked at the camera
[22:55] and i'm like not yet
[22:56] but progress for sure i just keep hoping
[22:59] that it's gonna like click and he's
[23:01] gonna just
[23:01] catch one and then catch the other one
[23:04] and he might and he might not i don't
[23:06] know
[23:06] i don't care i just want to make sure
[23:08] that he's having a good time
[23:10] whoa easy teeth no teeth too biting
[23:14] when we were practicing the double it's
[23:15] like somewhere in there he started to
[23:17] like
[23:18] let go at will of the frisbee in a way
[23:20] that he hasn't yet done
[23:22] before i mean we've been struggling with
[23:23] let go it goes from just terrible to
[23:26] better to terrible to worse than ever
[23:29] to what we've had people reach out about
[23:32] adopting them so we're trying to find
[23:33] out who might be
[23:35] the best home for him so far uh easy
[23:38] hey we're not playing we just played
[23:40] frisbee didn't get enough fighting in
[23:41] and we're continuing to share him on
[23:43] social media
[23:44] just in the hopes that we can really
[23:46] place him in the best home possible but
[23:48] i really hope to see him end up
[23:50] in a home that really values training
[23:52] that really values his intelligence
[23:55] his athleticism and just
[23:58] his overall greatness so we'll continue
[24:00] to see how things go

TRANSCRIPTION:

[00:00] despite being an overall prodigy i mean
[00:02] he's caught the double disc throw in
[00:04] just a couple of weeks for goodness sake
[00:06] there are two things that george finds
[00:08] thoroughly irresistible balls of all
[00:10] kinds
[00:11] and squirrels okay
[00:15] this is reality dog training
[00:18] subscribe and click the bell so you
[00:20] never miss an episode the journey with
[00:23] george continues and we still have a
[00:25] couple of pretty major hurdles to
[00:27] overcome i can honestly say though that
[00:29] this experience would have been a lot
[00:31] different if i didn't have super chewer
[00:33] and bark box along the way these boxes
[00:36] are some of my favorite sources for
[00:37] incredible toys and very high quality
[00:39] treats let me show you what a super
[00:41] chewer box looks like i love their fun
[00:43] themes doggone fishing this month bri
[00:46] you're not a fisher person you wouldn't
[00:47] get this
[00:48] yes
[00:50] is it a pokemon no that is a bobber
[00:54] a bobber so basically the bobber is up
[00:56] here it connects to the worm and the
[00:58] hook down here so that when a fish gets
[01:01] it it goes under make sense
[01:05] i can tell this is a squeaky toy look at
[01:07] the top but look i can't even squeak it
[01:10] and i'm very strong let me tell you you
[01:12] have to step on it
[01:13] yep there we go that is the toughest
[01:15] squeaky ball known to man right there
[01:17] each one of these is a completely
[01:19] different texture which i like but
[01:21] they're all appropriate for dogs that
[01:22] are extremely tough and hard on toys
[01:25] barkbox is the o.g monthly subscription
[01:28] box from bark it's probably the greatest
[01:31] thing ever for dogs who are obsessed
[01:33] with plush toys of all kinds of
[01:35] different textures and you get first
[01:37] class streets and a great shoe in every
[01:38] bark box too play dead
[01:42] okay she earned one right these are beef
[01:44] crunchies do you guys want a free bark
[01:46] box or super chewer box i thought you'd
[01:48] say yes which is why when you sign up
[01:50] for a multi-month plan at barkbox.com
[01:52] dog training and superchewer.com dog
[01:54] training you get a free extra month at
[01:56] this point you're probably painfully
[01:58] aware of my struggle to get george to
[02:00] have some self-control around balls i
[02:02] mean we've had some of the most extreme
[02:04] training breakdowns of my entire dog
[02:06] training career not getting that ball i
[02:09] would not trust him to leave a baseball
[02:11] alone when we're outside at this point
[02:13] but we've made some progress in my
[02:15] living room and this morning i made a
[02:17] rather interesting discovery the only
[02:19] other thing that george gets as excited
[02:21] about as a ball is his breakfast well
[02:24] and his dinner too i've already been
[02:25] rewarding him with his food for almost
[02:27] all of his training sessions and it's
[02:28] been working really well to motivate him
[02:30] in most situations even in public but
[02:33] when a ball is present he immediately
[02:35] loses all interest in everything else
[02:38] including his favorite food so i've
[02:39] tried to up the ante with chunks of
[02:42] fresh baked chicken but when balls are
[02:44] involved he's still not interested this
[02:46] morning it suddenly clicked that when
[02:48] george sees his kibble in his bowl
[02:50] he's orders of magnitude more amped up
[02:52] about it he has a super strong positive
[02:54] association with his food bowl
[02:57] leave it ah good
[03:00] you can see that obsession with the ball
[03:02] fighting to come out but i have finally
[03:03] found something that he actually loves
[03:06] more than all of these balls
[03:08] leave it
[03:11] good leave it
[03:13] yes
[03:18] leave it
[03:19] leave it
[03:28] sit
[03:29] let it
[03:31] stay okay
[03:33] sit
[03:36] good
[03:37] what what is even happening right now
[03:40] stay
[03:46] come
[03:47] yes
[03:53] stay
[04:00] look at me
[04:04] all right that was an amazing practice
[04:05] session but for george to actually
[04:07] function in the real world i have to
[04:09] teach him to resist baseballs even when
[04:12] we're outside and it's not dinner time
[04:14] but i'm pretty much out of time at this
[04:16] point and i think we might need a
[04:17] miracle so i'm continuing to work with
[04:20] george on paying attention to me in
[04:22] specific circumstances where it seems
[04:24] like he would rather not listen to me
[04:26] remember the ball is a metaphor for
[04:28] anything that your dog just absolutely
[04:29] cannot resist other dogs squirrels
[04:32] running into the street self-control
[04:34] exercises like we're about to do might
[04:36] be the most important thing you ever
[04:38] train your dog so our saga with leaving
[04:41] things like this alone continues now
[04:44] recently we had a huge breakthrough in
[04:47] the living room where we were working on
[04:48] this and i was able to actually have a
[04:50] lot of success with him but here we are
[04:52] we're in a outdoor environment you can
[04:53] see he's already fixated so i mean i'm
[04:56] hoping to get him paying attention
[04:57] around this baseball which he loves more
[04:59] than just about anything in the universe
[05:01] and then i've got some surprises planned
[05:03] for him if he does well with that leave
[05:04] it
[05:08] look at me
[05:10] yes good man ah
[05:13] nope you're not allowed to have this
[05:14] leave it
[05:16] look at me yes
[05:18] yes
[05:20] no
[05:22] stay look at me come
[05:27] george
[05:31] george come
[05:33] no
[05:34] time's like this where he seems to be
[05:36] struggling it's like what's going on we
[05:38] were doing so much better than this
[05:40] inside it's been up and down and up and
[05:42] down and now he seems to be back to
[05:44] square one all of a sudden but i'm just
[05:46] gonna take the time to really remind him
[05:48] here and try and work through this
[05:49] confusion think about it george did
[05:51] amazing in our living room and now he's
[05:52] basically forgotten everything what's
[05:55] different we're outside asking george to
[05:57] do as well out here as he did in my
[05:59] house is like asking a kid to be as
[06:01] focused on their homework at the
[06:02] playground as they are at your kitchen
[06:04] table but i know george has it in him to
[06:06] do this he has to do better than this as
[06:08] a pit bull type dog in today's society
[06:11] if he goes after the wrong ball and
[06:12] knocks a child over he may not get a
[06:15] second chance and this may look innocent
[06:17] enough but it's a very serious training
[06:19] issue for george we have to get this
[06:20] issue under control now here
[06:24] so it looks like he's starting to
[06:25] remember now let's go ahead and up the
[06:27] difficulty let's see if we can add some
[06:29] more distractions to the mix i happen to
[06:32] have bought an entire bucket of
[06:34] baseballs here look at me
[06:36] stay
[06:39] yes
[06:41] very good i really like to face training
[06:43] issues like this head-on with dogs and
[06:46] so this happens to be one of those
[06:47] situations where i can easily recreate
[06:50] the intense distraction for george
[06:53] that's not always easy to do but my
[06:55] logic here is if i can get him to stay
[06:57] around many distractions and many
[06:59] baseballs then i'm probably making some
[07:00] serious progress on this issue come sit
[07:04] stay
[07:05] able to calm away from the balls
[07:08] good
[07:09] look at me yes
[07:14] stay
[07:16] look at me yes you're getting it
[07:20] stay
[07:24] ah
[07:25] leave it come
[07:27] no george
[07:29] come up let go
[07:32] here i'm really trying to help george
[07:34] reason through this before resorting to
[07:36] physically preventing him from accessing
[07:38] these baseballs but ultimately this
[07:40] attempt is a fail so let's see if we can
[07:42] do better
[07:44] leave it
[07:45] come
[07:46] sit
[07:47] stay
[07:49] look at me
[07:50] stay
[07:52] look at me yes
[07:54] good man
[07:56] stay
[07:58] ah
[07:59] stay
[08:00] look at me
[08:02] yes
[08:05] wait
[08:06] hey
[08:07] george come
[08:09] leave it alone come good man stay
[08:15] look at me come
[08:16] sit yes
[08:19] look at me
[08:20] stay
[08:23] up
[08:24] here
[08:25] stay
[08:27] come
[08:28] sit
[08:30] stay yes
[08:33] hey
[08:34] leave it
[08:38] come
[08:39] sit
[08:41] stay
[08:42] leave it
[08:46] stay
[08:51] leave
[08:52] it
[08:54] ah
[08:56] come
[08:57] sit
[08:59] yes
[09:00] okay good man all right so it took him a
[09:03] second to get warmed up but we were able
[09:05] to break through there and get him to
[09:06] leave the baseballs alone but i'd really
[09:08] like him to be able to run past that
[09:10] field of baseballs and come to me when i
[09:12] ask him to without picking the balls up
[09:14] i don't want to just immediately set him
[09:16] up for failure by having him rush
[09:18] through there let me see if i can get
[09:19] him to come to me here come
[09:21] sit
[09:22] you can see he's looking at him but he's
[09:24] reaching very deep no
[09:27] george come
[09:29] leave it
[09:34] leave it
[09:35] come
[09:36] uh uh uh
[09:38] sit
[09:39] okay it definitely could have gone
[09:41] better come
[09:43] sit yes let me take a step back and call
[09:46] him from a shorter distance instead of
[09:49] expecting him to strut past all 30 of
[09:50] those baseballs at once on the first try
[09:53] look at me
[09:55] come
[09:56] yes
[09:57] good
[09:59] here
[10:01] yes
[10:03] come
[10:06] yes leave it let go no george has really
[10:10] broken through on leaving the baseballs
[10:11] alone while he's sitting still but when
[10:14] he's actually running through these
[10:16] balls it's a lot harder for him to focus
[10:18] while also retaining his self-control
[10:20] maybe it feels like trying to rub your
[10:21] stomach and pat your head at the same
[10:23] time
[10:24] yes there you go
[10:26] come
[10:27] leave it
[10:28] come yeah good man
[10:31] in general george tends to get really
[10:33] excited about new items so i'm extra
[10:36] impressed that he's leaving these
[10:37] baseballs alone and coming to me around
[10:38] them good man sit
[10:41] nope
[10:43] stay
[10:46] come
[10:50] yes
[10:52] good boy you can see he's thinking about
[10:54] it but he's reaching deep he's making
[10:56] those decisions on his own right there
[10:58] that's very good
[11:00] come i'm gonna have george come to me
[11:02] and throw the ball so that the ball is
[11:04] in motion while he is in motion i'm
[11:06] progressively making these exercises
[11:08] even more challenging for him
[11:10] leave it ah okay see
[11:13] so right there there was motion we still
[11:15] have work to do let go
[11:18] let go look great stay
[11:21] george is so close stay
[11:25] come leave it leave it come leave it
[11:29] he's doing it this is incredible
[11:31] progress when you compare george today
[11:34] to how he acted at the beginning of this
[11:36] series it's hard to believe that he's
[11:37] come this far in this period of time
[11:40] especially considering how overwhelming
[11:42] his outbursts were when we started okay
[11:45] one enemy conquered but we still have
[11:47] one more big test that george has to be
[11:50] able to pass let's go find some
[11:51] squirrels up to this point george has
[11:54] demonstrated that he can get totally
[11:56] overwhelmed with excitement almost every
[11:59] time he sees a squirrel seems like this
[12:01] might be a good idea to teach him some
[12:02] impulse control around squirrels
[12:04] nature's dog toy look at their tails i
[12:07] mean they are designed to entice dogs
[12:11] here sit good
[12:14] that i mean that was remarkably easy and
[12:16] that's really what i want to be able to
[12:17] do get his attention see there's a
[12:18] squirrel right there and he gave me his
[12:20] attention there that was great
[12:22] sit good man
[12:24] stay
[12:28] good man i have noticed when he sees
[12:30] like an excited happy dog he just wants
[12:32] to play so much with that dog stay
[12:36] good boy
[12:38] here look at me yes
[12:40] good boy
[12:41] we've got a squirrel right there
[12:44] see how he does
[12:45] george
[12:47] here
[12:50] come sit it's almost like he knows i'm
[12:53] gonna ask him to come to me when he sees
[12:56] the squirrel it's he's become
[12:57] conditioned oh yeah when i see a
[12:59] squirrel
[13:00] this guy usually asks me to come to him
[13:02] but really i mean you can see he's come
[13:04] a long way from just a few days ago when
[13:06] we were at the other park i mean he
[13:07] practically pulled me over trying to get
[13:09] to a squirrel so he's showing a lot of
[13:11] potential here he does find a certain
[13:14] contentment in walking with that ball he
[13:16] was a little tough to work with moments
[13:17] ago but just giving him a nice little
[13:20] walk and allowing him to adapt to the
[13:22] environment and get some of that energy
[13:23] out he becomes a new dog most dogs like
[13:26] him are this close to being super
[13:28] obedient if we just go out of our way to
[13:30] do those things i want to see something
[13:32] though let me call him george come
[13:35] good man yes now
[13:38] see how this works
[13:40] okay you here
[13:42] what are you going to do
[13:46] here go on there's some treats
[13:50] there we go
[13:52] leave oh boy
[13:56] that's it you can see he's fortunately
[13:58] he's not a resource guarder with uh toys
[14:01] but he's pretty intense about it so he
[14:03] let go
[14:04] here do you want these so i've regained
[14:06] possession i'm gonna make him earn this
[14:08] i'm not just gonna give him the toy for
[14:09] the heck of it right now let's see how
[14:11] well his heel is doing
[14:13] what i'm looking at my eyes that's why
[14:15] i've got the toy behind my back here
[14:17] good because of course i'll fixate on
[14:19] the toy but that's not a real heel
[14:21] though it's a great way to introduce a
[14:23] heel here yes that was a really good
[14:26] looking heel so i'll go ahead and give
[14:28] him the toy for that um and i'm gonna
[14:30] let him chomp on it for a little bit
[14:33] and we'll see if he becomes oh anytime
[14:35] he does let go of that toy though
[14:38] i am gonna try to take it back
[14:41] hey oh are you kidding me oh my god do
[14:44] you see what he has
[14:46] i thought it was a bee are you kidding
[14:48] me
[14:49] we did not plant this there
[14:51] uh-uh let go
[14:53] he let go i mean when you compare it to
[14:55] that day at the park when we encountered
[14:57] that baseball he found that out of
[14:59] nowhere this is why we film everything
[15:01] this is great look at me stay
[15:05] here look at me leave it
[15:08] yes
[15:10] stay
[15:13] leave it
[15:15] look at me yes
[15:17] good man stay
[15:19] leave it
[15:21] no
[15:22] come yes
[15:23] george is not used to going out to the
[15:25] park like this on a regular regular
[15:27] basis you know so the more normalized
[15:29] this becomes to him in other words the
[15:30] more that he gets out there and
[15:32] experiences places like that the more
[15:34] likely he is to behave more normally in
[15:36] those places so you have to give them
[15:38] lots of experience so they learn how to
[15:39] listen to you everywhere over time
[15:42] george has been doing really well
[15:43] overall when we have him tied out in the
[15:45] house sometimes we even take him off
[15:47] leash and he's been doing well when we
[15:49] supervise him and everything because
[15:50] we're trying to phase in more freedom
[15:52] but for the time being when we leave the
[15:54] house
[15:55] we're gonna have to leave him here in
[15:57] this crate but i have noticed that he
[15:59] tends to get a little bit anxious when i
[16:01] leave the room or i go upstairs so i'm
[16:03] hoping to make some improvement there
[16:05] this appears to be a minor case of
[16:07] separation anxiety and it would be great
[16:09] to see if we can reduce that
[16:11] dramatically because we have somewhere
[16:12] to go tonight so he's going to be all
[16:14] alone
[16:16] really great way
[16:18] to encourage your dog to go in their
[16:19] crate just toss some treats in there
[16:21] avoid
[16:22] pushing them in there forcing them in
[16:24] there
[16:24] good man
[16:25] so i want to see i just want to do a bit
[16:27] of a dry run here
[16:31] since george gets a little anxious when
[16:33] i leave sometimes i'm taking the time to
[16:35] pretend to leave when i'm actually able
[16:37] to focus on him and i'm coming back to
[16:39] give him great rewards before he has a
[16:41] chance to get anxious so i'm
[16:42] counter-conditioning him so instead of
[16:44] feeling nervous when i leave he'll start
[16:46] to think oh whenever zach leaves then he
[16:49] comes back and i get something great at
[16:50] least i hope that's what he thinks you
[16:52] like those barkbox treats huh
[16:55] good man we're just making it a game
[16:59] i'm essentially leaving him alone right
[17:00] i'm leaving the house as far as he's
[17:02] concerned but it's for seconds at a time
[17:04] i want to get him comfortable with being
[17:06] alone for seconds after i leave before i
[17:08] can have him behaving acceptably for
[17:11] minutes or hours after i leave
[17:13] so that's pretty good i've also noticed
[17:15] that sometimes when i go out this back
[17:17] door as well he gets a little anxious so
[17:20] hopefully we can continue the success
[17:21] we're having here
[17:23] so i'm not anticipating too much of a
[17:25] problem here but this will be the first
[17:27] time that he's been left alone in a
[17:29] crate for a significant period of time
[17:31] when we've left the house we're getting
[17:33] ready to go out tonight we've got george
[17:35] back here and we have our furbo set up
[17:38] so
[17:38] i'm gonna be checking in on him while
[17:40] we're gone but really big test today
[17:42] what do you think maybe he'll get
[17:44] nervous but i don't think that it'll
[17:46] last very long on a side note though
[17:48] look how beautiful my wife looks tonight
[17:51] it's just
[17:52] stunning you look great thank you i've
[17:55] given george a chew that he's been
[17:58] enjoying he's been making it last so
[18:01] that should preoccupy him we did do some
[18:03] training so hopefully that'll help out
[18:04] but i'm a little worried about him but i
[18:06] think it's gonna be okay and worst case
[18:08] we'll just have to come right back and
[18:10] call our evening short
[18:12] yeah so he's doing pretty well there
[18:15] see
[18:19] so george seems to be relaxing a lot
[18:21] right now by the way
[18:23] having a good time at a wedding
[18:25] i have no idea if this audio is usable
[18:28] but
[18:30] george is happy and that is the only
[18:31] thing that matters yes good job george
[18:36] look at him
[18:37] he's chilling
[18:39] going to sleep
[18:41] it's been kind of a long time yeah since
[18:43] we left probably like i don't know four
[18:45] or five hours since we left i'm really
[18:47] proud of him i am too he's well adjusted
[18:50] so zach yes sir
[18:52] i'll buy you a shot if you remember my
[18:54] doctor
[19:07] ready for me to let you out

[00:00] i'm almost out of time with george so
[00:01] what i'm hoping to do today is to check
[00:03] in on his training and see if there's
[00:05] any last-minute improvement we can make
[00:08] perhaps we can start with the barking
[00:10] this is reality dog training subscribe
[00:13] and click the bell so you never miss an
[00:15] episode
[00:17] so today is likely to be my last serious
[00:19] frisbee training session with george
[00:21] before we take him to his new home so
[00:24] i'm really looking forward to this
[00:25] you'll recall that let go has been one
[00:27] of the issues that we've been struggling
[00:29] with off and on sometimes it's good
[00:31] sometimes it's not today i'm hoping for
[00:34] more good than not frisbee is something
[00:36] that i've always enjoyed teaching dogs
[00:38] but it's definitely physically demanding
[00:40] for them and i have found that good food
[00:42] helps training and is a huge part of
[00:44] getting great results there's a lot of
[00:46] ways to feed your dog a quality diet nom
[00:48] nom is one of the freshest options
[00:50] available and it meets the delicate
[00:52] nutrition standards of dogs something
[00:54] that is shockingly hard to get right on
[00:56] your own honestly i will admit it i did
[00:58] try it myself and it tasted exactly like
[01:01] it looks nice and healthy if you guys
[01:03] want to try this you can get 50 off a
[01:06] two-week trial by going to trinom.com
[01:08] zach and entering discount code zach
[01:10] i'll have a link below let's make sure
[01:12] he still remembers how to play frisbee
[01:14] george go
[01:16] yep okay
[01:17] i'd say yes
[01:18] let go
[01:20] yes
[01:21] good good start on let go now let's see
[01:23] how those multiples are doing you'll
[01:24] remember multiples are where he catches
[01:26] those frisbees in rapid fire succession
[01:28] one after the other and he needs to be a
[01:30] master at let go to do that
[01:33] let go
[01:35] yeah good let go
[01:37] hey so when doing multiples like this
[01:39] this is a great way to teach george how
[01:42] to let go of a toy and how to further
[01:44] focus on me of course he's got his eye
[01:46] on his ducks over there
[01:48] george
[01:49] come
[01:50] yes
[01:53] okay
[01:54] not so much
[01:58] and a lot of these frisbee tricks are
[01:59] just wonderful for improving a dog's
[02:02] other skills in life well after about
[02:04] three weeks of training george still
[02:05] sometimes has outbursts at other dogs
[02:08] reactivity is not something that gets
[02:10] resolved overnight but i love how
[02:12] quickly he's able to recover this time
[02:14] george here sit
[02:16] no
[02:19] sit
[02:20] stay by the way able to get him under
[02:22] control without any force without any
[02:24] treats right now he's actually really
[02:26] generalizing his skills quite well so
[02:28] i'm out here doing some leash training
[02:30] with george today and when he's pretty
[02:32] revved up and excited he can definitely
[02:34] pull a little bit as we've seen but he's
[02:36] gotten a lot better for the time being
[02:37] though free walks are gonna be part of
[02:39] my prescription for him so that he can
[02:41] get some of that energy out as well as
[02:42] playing fetch just before his training
[02:44] lessons as we've done for these first
[02:46] few minutes walking with george here i'm
[02:48] just
[02:49] letting him check everything out you
[02:50] know i don't like to just throw rules on
[02:53] him straight away because
[02:55] well he doesn't know the rules
[02:56] completely right he's got to adapt and
[02:59] we haven't done much neighborhood leash
[03:01] walking we've been focused on so many
[03:03] other types of exercise from like
[03:04] frisbee and fetch and we've been doing
[03:06] our free walks and a lot of screen saver
[03:09] training in public environments but a
[03:10] neighborhood walk well that's something
[03:12] that's fairly novel to him and when you
[03:14] think about it when a dog is so new to
[03:16] training everything is new to them so
[03:18] finding things that can continually
[03:20] compete for their attention in these new
[03:22] scenarios can be challenging and there
[03:23] are times when your dog does need to
[03:25] just take in their environment for a
[03:27] while but mixing up treats and various
[03:29] currencies and toys during your dog's
[03:31] first year of training can really give
[03:33] you newfound momentum one of my favorite
[03:35] products to endorse is puffbox because
[03:38] it's a training centric monthly
[03:40] subscription box that grows along with
[03:42] your puppy so they give you very
[03:44] specific advice based on your dog's age
[03:46] and they send you the appropriate items
[03:48] that you need with every box they
[03:50] include a really detailed training card
[03:52] that'll tell you what to work on each
[03:53] month give pupbucks a try you can get 50
[03:55] off of your first pup box when you sign
[03:57] up for a multi-month subscription by
[03:59] going to pupbox.com
[04:01] zack use the discount code zack i'll
[04:03] have the info in the description so here
[04:04] comes some pulling here like he's really
[04:06] kind of intermittent on his pulling like
[04:08] now there's not pulling right and i'll
[04:11] just remind you this is after about 10
[04:13] minutes 15 minutes of fetch which is why
[04:15] he's
[04:16] panting right now because i
[04:17] really wanted him to get that excess
[04:19] energy out so he wasn't extra frustrated
[04:21] on his walk notice also throughout these
[04:23] first couple of minutes of this walk i
[04:25] haven't been giving him treats or
[04:26] anything the bigger goal is just to get
[04:28] him comfortable out here in this
[04:29] environment and he's being relatively
[04:30] good it really is this first few minutes
[04:32] that can be extra frustrating with him
[04:35] in particular i really like to keep the
[04:37] walk moving
[04:38] which can be discouraging to my camera
[04:41] operator but doing a lot of stopping
[04:43] with him tends to recharge him very very
[04:45] quickly hold on what do we got here
[04:47] all right so look at this hey yes
[04:50] george
[04:51] look at me yes good man i'll give him a
[04:54] treat for that
[04:55] here you go
[04:57] you want a treat or not
[04:59] really good around a barking dog i
[05:01] really appreciate that got another
[05:03] parking dog immediately here
[05:06] this one he's a little more interested
[05:07] in isn't that interesting so
[05:14] come on
[05:16] let's go come on
[05:19] so he's giving the dog a look little
[05:21] excitement but very manageable right now
[05:24] you can see how he's periodically
[05:25] checking things out he looks up at me
[05:27] sometimes he looks at his environment i
[05:29] mean after all the point of a walk isn't
[05:31] for our dog to pay constant attention to
[05:33] us the point of a walk is for a dog to
[05:36] enjoy themselves and hopefully us too
[05:41] are you stopping what's that about come
[05:43] here
[05:45] here we go
[05:47] yes
[05:48] good see what happens here look at me
[05:51] nope come
[05:53] good
[05:55] stay look at me
[05:58] here
[05:59] george here
[06:02] look at me
[06:04] you're doing great look at that getting
[06:06] that eye contact
[06:08] good man
[06:10] here
[06:12] and now we go from leash walking
[06:14] to a proper heel
[06:17] here
[06:23] somewhat of a proper eel we'll take it
[06:25] nice little casual heel george here
[06:28] okay
[06:29] and so now i'm gonna just kind of
[06:31] release him here to enjoy the walk
[06:35] notice i'm using the environment there
[06:37] i'm not using a treat letting the walk
[06:39] continue letting him explore the world
[06:42] that can be very reinforcing to dogs
[06:44] like george boy and so what are we like
[06:46] six minutes into our walk so sometimes
[06:48] it really feels
[06:49] like a long time with your dog
[06:52] pulling and being uncontrollable
[06:55] but quite an improvement here you just
[06:57] walked past the dead snake that was nice
[07:00] the point of this lesson is that we
[07:02] trend towards better and better walking
[07:05] like most things in dog training we
[07:08] don't just get the behaviors we want
[07:10] like that i think a lot of people think
[07:12] of dog training as you should be able to
[07:13] turn on that switch and get that dog to
[07:15] behave perfectly and there's so much
[07:17] pressure on a lot of dog trainers to do
[07:19] that believe me
[07:20] i feel it all the time
[07:22] and i think that's one of the reasons
[07:23] we've seen a rise of harsh tools being
[07:26] very popularized
[07:28] in dog training culture because they
[07:30] have the illusion of working quite
[07:31] instantly but in reality
[07:33] if we really just take the time to teach
[07:35] our dogs how to behave
[07:38] without demanding quick fix results i
[07:40] think we can get a lot quicker
[07:42] results long term with them like
[07:44] authentic results
[07:45] george
[07:46] look at me yes
[07:48] good boy
[07:50] oh we got a dog across the street here
[07:52] he's excited stay
[07:55] all right
[07:57] now that george has settled down a good
[07:59] bit i'm gonna work on some basic heel
[08:01] training with him i'll see if i can get
[08:03] him to pay attention to me as we walk in
[08:05] a straight line good okay let's go this
[08:07] way
[08:09] good
[08:10] man he's doing really well with that
[08:13] isn't he let's see how his left turns
[08:15] are doing can he walk in a left circle
[08:17] while staying next to me nice left
[08:19] circles there leave it
[08:21] yes let's go ahead and check out those
[08:23] right turns these are a bit tougher
[08:24] because he's got to walk slower
[08:27] look at me
[08:29] he's really trying but overall he's
[08:31] really catching on pretty quick i mean
[08:32] think about how he's got to really
[08:34] deliberately walk extra slow i mean he's
[08:37] obviously a very athletic dog whenever a
[08:39] dog like him really even after exercise
[08:42] goes through the effort to walk that
[08:43] slow you can tell that he's really
[08:45] trying he's really understanding the
[08:47] concept and you can easily see where
[08:49] this is headed if this training was kept
[08:51] up for several months and i keep
[08:53] thinking back to when i first met him
[08:54] knew nothing about him at all and
[08:57] learned that he'd been sitting in a
[08:58] shelter for just months and months and
[09:00] months and to see how far he's come and
[09:02] how much he's learned and how well he's
[09:05] doing
[09:06] has just been inspiring
[09:08] to see
[09:10] good job around that weed whacker huh
[09:12] but look you know i mean just in the
[09:14] interest of keeping it real here we are
[09:16] at the end of our training session and
[09:18] we still see some pulling here right i
[09:20] mean it's not like it's gone completely
[09:21] i don't want to lead you to think that
[09:24] oh just because we had a good heal
[09:26] session there and he was doing well on
[09:27] loose leech walking that it's all of a
[09:29] sudden fixed we still get a few seconds
[09:31] of pulling here and there you're just
[09:33] looking for the trend there don't be
[09:34] discouraged if you're not getting there
[09:36] all at once
[09:37] i'm almost out of time with george so
[09:39] what i'm hoping to do today is to check
[09:41] in on his training and see if there's
[09:42] any last-minute improvement we can make
[09:45] perhaps we could start with the barking
[09:47] i don't know dogs bark for a variety of
[09:50] reasons i think when you see it coupled
[09:52] with the playful body language there
[09:53] rolling over and being pretty goofy he's
[09:56] probably just in a playful mood
[09:59] hey george come
[10:01] i like that i like that he responded to
[10:03] come when called especially while in
[10:04] that excited state look at me
[10:07] yes the winds coming off the gulf of
[10:09] mexico from all the way across the world
[10:12] must have many sense to them but look at
[10:14] that focus
[10:16] good boy all right while he's so focused
[10:19] i want to work
[10:20] we test his stay remember stay is
[10:23] absolutely one of the most important
[10:24] skills a dog should know
[10:26] stay
[10:28] i'm using a 33 foot lead today
[10:32] look at me
[10:36] yes
[10:38] stay reiterating stay it's being very
[10:41] obvious with the hand signal just to be
[10:42] very clear look at his eyes
[10:47] yes
[10:49] you can't do this too much this really
[10:50] burns it into his brain that stay mean
[10:52] stay
[10:57] you make that look easy don't you sit
[10:59] stay okay good man
[11:02] so that was pretty awesome there that
[11:04] was my literally my first attempt of
[11:06] doing a circle around him which is way
[11:08] easier said than done i mean i started
[11:10] to get a little warmed up by doing a
[11:12] quarter circle but then i just saw it in
[11:14] his eyes i mean we put in so much work
[11:16] together that i really was convinced he
[11:18] was in a solid state so i kind of just
[11:20] went for it and i was able to get a
[11:22] complete circle in the reason this is
[11:24] harder than it seems is because for a
[11:26] brief moment you kind of have to go out
[11:27] of sight with your dog and that is weird
[11:29] to them
[11:33] yes
[11:34] and since i have a 33 foot lead today
[11:37] let's take advantage of that and make
[11:39] sure that we can really solidify a stay
[11:41] with a more significant distance the
[11:43] look in his eyes like wait a minute
[11:45] you've never gone that far away before
[11:47] i'm resisting the urge to call him at
[11:49] the end of the lead i think a lot of
[11:51] people do that and i do it sometimes it
[11:53] just depends but i want to first
[11:54] solidify this stay
[11:58] walking back and forth again just to
[11:59] bring some dimension to the training
[12:01] here so it's not the same every time
[12:04] this is a good example of proofing a
[12:06] stay so it doesn't always look the same
[12:08] in other words stay isn't just always
[12:10] about doing a linear
[12:12] walk back and stay you want them staying
[12:14] in a variety of different ways and
[12:15] circumstances this is just one way to
[12:17] add another dimension to stay
[12:21] see how he's doing on come now george
[12:24] come so stay is starting to look a
[12:26] little bit better and even come when
[12:28] called there at a significant distance
[12:30] in an outdoor environment first attempt
[12:32] very impressive as we have established
[12:35] when you're training a dog it's way
[12:37] easier to teach them how to listen to
[12:39] you and take direction from you when
[12:41] you're really close to them but it's
[12:43] when we're farther away that things can
[12:45] get a little more challenging so what
[12:47] i'm hoping to be able to do is to get
[12:48] him to sit one of the easiest things he
[12:51] knows how to do while i'm farther away
[12:54] sit
[12:58] sit yes did you see that just one step
[13:01] close
[13:02] yes
[13:03] okay good man that was a really good
[13:05] example of being one step too far away
[13:07] from him for him to really understand
[13:09] the concept of sit so i'm gonna play
[13:10] with this for a little bit and see how
[13:12] we do sit
[13:16] no
[13:17] sit yes good
[13:21] yes
[13:22] stay look at me
[13:24] sit
[13:25] yes
[13:26] one of his favorite tricks so far has
[13:28] been sit pretty maybe we can see if he
[13:29] can do that from a distance here see the
[13:32] difference here so pretty right into it
[13:36] yes okay
[13:38] three inches back
[13:39] what he says
[13:42] stay
[13:43] look at me
[13:44] so pretty
[13:46] yes okay that was awesome that was
[13:48] farther away that time you see that here
[13:52] stay
[13:54] yes okay good man very good
[13:58] and so it may not look like much there
[13:59] but being able to be just a foot farther
[14:01] away from him right there is huge
[14:03] progress and that's something that i
[14:05] think we can build on see how you're
[14:06] doing with shake
[14:08] yes
[14:10] the shake is more like a wave but i'll
[14:12] tell you he doesn't like it when you
[14:13] grab his paws much
[14:15] that's okay though here
[14:17] shake good look at me hey george
[14:21] i didn't ask for that what if i wanted
[14:22] you to lie down or something lie down
[14:25] yes
[14:26] so right there he was just anticipating
[14:28] so i kind of like to be a little bit
[14:30] ahead of the anticipation you know when
[14:32] dogs are like i think i know what you
[14:33] want so i actually wanted to throw them
[14:35] a different request out there lie down
[14:38] it's like wait a minute i know you mean
[14:40] shake
[14:41] no i really want lie down
[14:43] yes okay good man and now sit shake okay
[14:48] i'll take a shake now
[14:50] you're a good man yes you are oh my god
[14:52] i love you so much you were so good
[14:55] how's your bowel doing stay yes
[14:58] stay
[14:59] yes
[15:00] stay
[15:02] yes
[15:04] that was looking okay one of his most
[15:07] impressive tricks and i have been really
[15:09] impressed with it anyway is roll over
[15:12] yes
[15:14] good boy so rollover's looking great
[15:19] yes
[15:20] good so you know spin is doing well he's
[15:23] still working on getting his muscle
[15:24] memory which is why i'm doing the heavy
[15:25] lore there let's throw a surprise leave
[15:27] it look at me drill at him leave it look
[15:30] at me
[15:32] come i'll even take a come when called
[15:34] sit
[15:35] stay the point of this test is to see
[15:38] how well he's generalized leave it alone
[15:40] and look at me so that i can further
[15:42] direct you
[15:44] yes very good i'd say he passed that
[15:47] test wouldn't you
[15:48] this time i'll ask him to come to me
[15:50] come you can see the look on his face
[15:52] like hey what just happened that was
[15:53] different but he did it and that's great
[15:55] that's what we want we want our dogs
[15:56] listening to us when in that surprise
[15:58] state of mind i mean that really is what
[16:00] training is about in so many regards
[16:02] this is kind of how we phase in
[16:04] off-leash training you might be
[16:05] wondering about that i'm getting a
[16:07] little bit lacks here with the lead
[16:09] sometimes i'm holding it sometimes i'm
[16:10] dropping it
[16:12] you know i'm able to look around me and
[16:13] see there aren't heavy heavy
[16:14] distractions i don't want to throw him
[16:16] in the deep end okay come you're doing
[16:17] great bud i want to release him from
[16:19] that stay before he broke i feel if i
[16:21] took the lead off he would probably stay
[16:23] with me now would i do this in a big
[16:24] city no way but out here he's adapted
[16:27] and this is kind of how we really
[16:29] introduce off leash training it's phased
[16:31] in little by little we're not in a rush
[16:33] at all to get him off leash so we want
[16:35] to do extensive testing and proofing
[16:38] with a long lead like this before we
[16:40] would consider letting our dog off lead
[16:42] in a public environment when i look back
[16:45] on george when i first met him and i
[16:47] think about how he was totally untrained
[16:49] with the exception of sit i just can't
[16:51] believe how quickly he's learned to
[16:54] perform like this out here i mean it
[16:55] really goes to show you some of the best
[16:57] dogs ever are in pounds and shelters
[17:01] great dogs are absolutely everywhere and
[17:03] george has been a prime example of that
[17:06] it's time to play some fetch with george
[17:09] this is something he absolutely loves
[17:10] but so far we've been limiting fetch to
[17:13] fenced environments out here he's really
[17:15] focused today so i'm feeling pretty good
[17:17] about playing some fetch in an open
[17:19] unrestricted field as long as i have a
[17:21] lead on him and keep up with him fetch
[17:24] for a dog like george is so important
[17:26] because he has that energy and it can
[17:28] really satisfy him in a way that few
[17:31] things can alright we got bikes coming
[17:33] so i'm gonna pick up the lead and see
[17:34] how he does
[17:36] good man very good i think he passed
[17:39] that test
[17:41] good boy
[17:42] but one of the breakdowns we've had with
[17:44] fetch throughout our time together is
[17:46] let go let go has been awful at times
[17:49] it's been okay at times but it's never
[17:51] been perfect but today i really feel
[17:53] like the tide is turning on let go and
[17:55] he's really starting to get it one of
[17:57] the hacks that i've been trying to do to
[17:59] kind of patch this issue is using a
[18:02] second toy this isn't ideal because
[18:04] honestly i want a dog letting go when i
[18:06] ask them to let go but sometimes if i
[18:08] distract him with the second toy he'll
[18:10] let go of this one so i can pick it up
[18:12] and that might be just enough to give me
[18:15] traction i would not be content with
[18:17] doing that long term but i am content
[18:19] right now if it makes it a little bit
[18:20] easier for him all right
[18:23] good get it
[18:25] hey what's this good yes
[18:29] so that's been really helpful continuing
[18:31] to practice the recall during fetch as
[18:33] well this is a great way to burn income
[18:35] when called with a fetch dog we're
[18:37] essentially capturing the behavior
[18:39] that's already occurring putting a word
[18:40] to it while he's in the frame of mind of
[18:42] i'm having such a great time and as he
[18:45] burns more and more energy out here he's
[18:47] getting more and more fatigued which
[18:49] actually makes it easier to practice off
[18:51] leash training in other words the more
[18:53] fatigue this particular dog becomes the
[18:56] more reliable he's going to be off leash
[18:58] and the less likely he is to bolt after
[19:00] something because he has so much pent-up
[19:02] energy we're really giving him an outlet
[19:04] for all that prey drive as they say and
[19:06] that desire to chase run and bite things
[19:09] with energetic dogs you must give them a
[19:11] healthy outlet like this now if your dog
[19:14] is energetic and they haven't quite
[19:15] taken to fetch yet really long walks off
[19:18] leash hikes if they're reliable off
[19:20] leash can be a really great way to
[19:22] deplete some of that energy and i should
[19:24] also say you don't want to rely on
[19:25] sprinting activity like this as your
[19:27] dog's main form of exercise forever but
[19:30] fetch is a great way to get that energy
[19:32] out on your terms and schedule in order
[19:34] to make your dog a lot more manageable
[19:36] so prioritize fetch training if your dog
[19:38] is anything like this one
[19:40] let's check in and see how george's play
[19:42] skills are developing with inertia
[19:44] getting a dog like george to play well
[19:46] with both humans and other dogs is going
[19:48] to be a very important part of his life
[19:50] moving forward and he's doing great so
[19:52] far in general i tend to like dogs to
[19:55] play in small play groups of two or
[19:56] three dogs at a time so they don't
[19:58] become overwhelmed honestly i think
[20:00] inertia might be the biggest
[20:02] transformation here george happens to be
[20:04] the biggest strongest dog that inertia
[20:06] has really felt comfortable with some of
[20:08] you might recall that she's been a bit
[20:09] nervous about playing with bigger dogs
[20:11] in the past so this has been a fantastic
[20:13] victory for us i'm hoping george has
[20:15] helped set her up to play with even
[20:17] bigger dogs in the future but i guess
[20:19] we'll just have to wait and see how that
[20:21] goes one of the best signs that two dogs
[20:23] are really comfortable with each other
[20:24] is when you see reciprocal play like
[20:26] when inertia and george take turns
[20:28] flopping over on their backs like this
[20:33] that's the one it just cracks me up
[20:34] because he's like oh you pulled me over
[20:37] wow you're so strong you don't want to
[20:39] let any dog just play with any dog in
[20:41] the world he's really good at taking
[20:43] social cues and
[20:45] playing at the level that indoor show is
[20:46] comfortable with they had to work it out
[20:48] a little bit i mean it started off a
[20:50] little rocky but they worked it out and
[20:52] it was okay one even good girl i love it
[20:55] when she flips over too reciprocal play
[20:57] he flops over she flops over
[21:00] and for telling you reporter kali
[21:02] that's saying something
[21:05] they don't do that easily
[21:06] indy you want to get in on this
[21:09] maybe two dogs
[21:11] i'm just i know she's not gonna she's
[21:13] looking for treats please play like this
[21:15] is just so interesting to watch as a dog
[21:18] trainer it really is to watch how dogs
[21:21] communicate and interact with each other
[21:23] in the purest form
[21:26] you know we can learn a lot from that
[21:28] too as trainers i mean
[21:32] these two dogs like to play they're not
[21:34] picky in how the play happens most of
[21:35] the time they just want to play somehow
[21:37] someway
[21:38] okay i have too many shoes out for sure
[21:40] right now i have three pairs out right
[21:42] there and they're actually three of my
[21:45] favorite pairs i have the black
[21:47] air force ones with the gum bottoms
[21:50] there and then i got my
[21:51] adidas
[21:53] ultra boost super comfy shoes and then
[21:55] i've got my favorite like plaid nikes oh
[21:58] i love those plaid ones this is not
[22:00] supposed to be a shoe tour though i know
[22:02] sorry anyway
[22:03] the point is i'm putting a lot of trust
[22:05] in george right now and he's doing
[22:07] really well he actually has i noticed
[22:09] these shoes were out here yesterday and
[22:11] he did really well all day
[22:14] really good sign for i feel like his
[22:15] house training is just coming along in
[22:17] leaps and bounds
[22:19] yeah everybody he's been awesome you're
[22:21] doing amazing awesome i'm starting to
[22:25] get really sad i don't know about you so
[22:28] policy in
[22:30] the george household
[22:32] and probably should be in most of yours
[22:34] is that we don't leave
[22:36] chew toys or even play toys around we do
[22:39] leave shoes all around but we don't
[22:41] leave
[22:42] dog toys
[22:44] freely out
[22:46] because we don't want them to you know
[22:48] have an argument over them but
[22:51] there are some times when george goes
[22:53] into his crate he gets a bone he brings
[22:55] it out and we take it away from him and
[22:57] we have noticed
[22:59] he's not possessive of his bones at all
[23:01] with inertia which is fabulous
[23:04] but even so
[23:06] we just don't like to leave our stuff
[23:07] lying around huh inertia did you like
[23:09] playing fetch today
[23:11] you were amazing at fetch
[23:15] we were practically off leash and
[23:17] everything
[23:18] he was okay so i'm gonna give george a
[23:22] bath
[23:22] it's okay
[23:24] good man yes
[23:27] just gonna like touch him remember this
[23:28] is only the second bath i've given him
[23:30] so i'm gonna go nice and
[23:32] slow
[23:33] good
[23:36] look at that i love short hair dogs
[23:39] so much easier to clean good boy
[23:43] see rather than just jumping into it i
[23:45] think that's what
[23:46] a lot of people might do
[23:48] i certainly have before i knew better in
[23:50] the past
[23:52] but if you just go a little extra slow
[23:54] dogs take the baths really well stay
[23:58] you know he's pretty good on his head
[24:00] there oops i'm trying to kind of stay
[24:02] away from his space we can do that a
[24:04] little more by hand
[24:07] really good all right time to soak you
[24:09] up don't ask about the shampoo
[24:12] this is one of our past sponsors and
[24:14] they sent us so much shampoo i think we
[24:16] have a lifetime supply got one of these
[24:18] scrubber things i really like these
[24:20] gives them a nice massage
[24:23] let me go ahead and distribute all the
[24:25] soup
[24:26] get them all soapy all over
[24:30] you are doing so well i'm really gonna
[24:32] miss this boy he's so easy to bathe
[24:36] he really just turned out to be the
[24:38] greatest dog ever
[24:39] and i keep saying it over and over it
[24:41] really is a super amazing experience to
[24:44] be able to do this because
[24:46] anyone who's been to a sheltered nose it
[24:48] can really target your heartstrings you
[24:50] feel very bad
[24:53] for those dogs who have so much
[24:54] potential there's just not enough people
[24:57] who are willing
[24:59] to give them a chance
[25:01] the silver lining is that i'm fortunate
[25:03] to have a platform and an audience and
[25:05] i'm
[25:06] really excited to be able to show off
[25:07] this whole
[25:09] experience of taking homeless dog in
[25:11] fostering them finding them a new home
[25:13] getting them trained for that new home
[25:16] and sharing
[25:19] in detail the ups and downs of what
[25:21] that's like
[25:22] you were all ups though every bit of it
[25:25] was ups
[25:26] george
[25:28] look at me
[25:29] stay
[25:36] good man
[25:38] it's so therapeutic
[25:41] giving a dog a bath like this i'm like
[25:44] in my own beta state just kind of
[25:46] meditating here
[25:47] george
[25:48] is making it easy i think you know in
[25:51] part
[25:52] it's because we really set him up for
[25:53] success and the last staff that we gave
[25:55] him and he did give me a little bit of a
[25:57] hard time today he's not even trying at
[25:59] least not too hard to get out i know
[26:00] he's thinking about it i can see that
[26:02] but he hasn't tried at all to get out of
[26:04] the tub
[26:05] i'm gonna turn him around now just to
[26:08] make sure i thoroughly rinse him
[26:10] stay almost
[26:13] boy stay here see
[26:21] all right
[26:22] oh god well you might have guessed
[26:25] george is getting a bath before he goes
[26:27] on a very special journey with us it's
[26:29] finally time to reveal george's destiny

TRANSCRIPTION:

[00:00] this park is located in the more
[00:01] populated part of anchorage which is why
[00:04] i came out here i just wanted to get a
[00:05] good sample of how he behaves with all
[00:07] these different variables
[00:10] he cannot be doing that when he sees
[00:11] dogs he wants to go up to every dog he
[00:14] sees he seems like one of those leash
[00:16] pulling is the worst
[00:19] he is a wild animal this dog
[00:23] this is choc a wild alaskan street dog
[00:27] with minimal human contact his manners
[00:30] leave a lot to be desired we are in
[00:33] alaska to get this man ready for his new
[00:36] life
[00:38] if we can survive it
[00:42] this is reality dog training subscribe
[00:45] and click the bell so you never miss an
[00:47] episode
[00:52] in episode 1 you met chop the wild
[00:55] alaska dog for the first time and he's
[00:58] been with me just over 24 hours now i'm
[01:01] incredibly excited about today because
[01:03] it's my very first day of training with
[01:06] him there were some ups and downs
[01:07] yesterday and it is time to start
[01:09] teaching them so we may as well start
[01:11] with teaching him sit because he doesn't
[01:13] even know that if you can believe it
[01:15] constantly on my mind is that i have
[01:18] never worked with a dog with this
[01:19] particular background so i think this is
[01:21] going to be interesting for
[01:23] all of us
[01:25] nothing really special here in the way
[01:27] that i'm teaching him to sit i'm just
[01:28] going to lure him into position usually
[01:31] this method is pretty effective
[01:32] particularly with larger dogs but
[01:34] honestly i'm having kind of a tough time
[01:36] with chop here because he just wants to
[01:38] keep backing up instead of kind of
[01:40] plopping into a sit that's okay though
[01:42] we're gonna keep working on it and we'll
[01:43] adjust our approach for him so i'm just
[01:45] looking for his
[01:47] butt to go down
[01:49] yes just because
[01:51] his legs bent ever so slightly there is
[01:53] why i said yes the fact that he's just
[01:55] following his treat really well there is
[01:58] good
[01:59] yes
[02:00] did you see that did you see how his
[02:02] butt like went an inch or two i'm using
[02:04] his meal this morning instead of regular
[02:07] treats because i want to be able to
[02:08] reward him so much today because we have
[02:10] a lot to teach in a short period of time
[02:12] yes
[02:14] this is definitely a sign that he's had
[02:16] very limited interactions with humans
[02:18] yes i like how he's spinning there
[02:21] that's pretty cool that gives me an idea
[02:23] for later so over the course of these
[02:25] first few lessons i expect chop to start
[02:28] learning what the word yes means i'm
[02:30] going to be using the word yes to mark
[02:32] behaviors that i like that chop does and
[02:34] every time i say yes i'm gonna follow it
[02:37] up with something that he values in that
[02:39] particular moment see how he's tuning
[02:41] out that i'm gonna let him check out too
[02:42] and come back as he pleases
[02:44] good boy i'm gonna reward him for coming
[02:46] back
[02:47] to me there yes for a dog that's never
[02:49] sat for a human before it definitely
[02:51] looks like he's catching on quickly i'm
[02:53] encouraged by this i'm hoping this is
[02:54] going to be a good sign that he'll be
[02:56] controllable when we go out in public
[02:58] later today
[03:04] so i'm gonna try and shrink my training
[03:05] bubble and see if that helps
[03:08] yes
[03:10] let me see if we can get some momentum
[03:13] yes
[03:16] okay that's his first sit lesson he
[03:18] still doesn't completely understand the
[03:20] concept and i don't want to push him too
[03:22] much because like i said there's a lot i
[03:24] want to cover with him today it looks
[03:26] like this bark eats is very effective so
[03:28] far in terms of motivating him bark one
[03:31] of my favorite companies has just come
[03:33] out with a very new innovative dog food
[03:36] so they use a new technology to coat
[03:38] this food with live probiotics which
[03:41] have a number of health benefits for
[03:42] dogs so he's getting healthier as i
[03:44] train him they deliver pre-portioned
[03:46] packets to your door every month that's
[03:49] actually personalized and portioned for
[03:51] your dog by real veterinary
[03:53] nutritionists everything bark does is
[03:56] always super high quality and this food
[03:58] is no exception if you want to give it a
[04:00] try you'll get 60
[04:02] off your first order using my special
[04:04] link barkeats.com
[04:07] zac george i'll have details in the
[04:08] description so rather than trying to
[04:10] teach him one thing at a time and get
[04:13] everything perfect before moving on to
[04:14] the next i find it really practical to
[04:18] teach them a little bit of each thing as
[04:20] we move on to keep them super simple so
[04:23] the next thing i want to teach him is
[04:25] how to look at me how to leave something
[04:27] alone and how to understand his name and
[04:29] the thing that all of those have in
[04:31] common is that there are ways to get
[04:32] attention onto me particularly when he
[04:35] becomes distracted in public so i'm
[04:37] doing my best to try to lay the best
[04:39] foundation i can before having him
[04:41] organically encounter exciting things so
[04:44] that at least he has some history of
[04:47] communicating with me
[04:50] holding up a treat right up here yes
[04:52] when i have eye contact i'm going to say
[04:54] yes and give him a treat yes
[04:57] he followed my finger right up to my
[04:59] eyes look at that
[05:00] let's see
[05:03] yes now i'm actually not even using a
[05:05] treat he's following my hand so quickly
[05:07] because some of the prior lore training
[05:09] we did you see how one thing builds on
[05:11] another it's a dangerous risky attitude
[05:13] to be like well i just want to train my
[05:15] dog x y or z but don't really want to
[05:18] train them their general basics overall
[05:20] so look at me it's looking good i'm
[05:21] going to start saying here to mean look
[05:23] at me so in general i like to use the
[05:25] word here to just request his overall
[05:28] attention in a variety of contexts it's
[05:31] not exactly look at me in this case
[05:33] because i'm more after attention more so
[05:36] than proper eye contact so while i agree
[05:38] this is a bit of an abstract definition
[05:42] here can be a great way to encourage
[05:44] your dog to pay attention to you here
[05:47] yes
[05:48] keeping the treats nice and random some
[05:50] of it's his meal some of it is bark
[05:52] treats he's following that signal great
[05:54] and no treats here so in other words i
[05:56] want him here
[05:58] yes
[06:00] then i'm gonna get the treat see that so
[06:02] that really gets him paying attention to
[06:03] the signal or i might want him just to
[06:05] reply or understand the verbal so let's
[06:08] put my hands behind my back this time
[06:09] and i'll say
[06:10] here
[06:12] yes
[06:14] let's see i don't know if he really
[06:16] registered that but let's see waiting
[06:17] for him to look right into my eyes to
[06:19] come back to me and to look up at me and
[06:21] i'm going to say here without a hand
[06:22] signal this time
[06:26] here
[06:27] yes
[06:29] there we go so
[06:31] just being a little extra patient here
[06:33] yes
[06:34] i'm loving chop's overall body language
[06:37] right now you can see he's not even on
[06:39] leash or anything and i love how he's
[06:41] voluntarily staying near me and
[06:43] interacting with me so enthusiastically
[06:45] this is a great way to build trust he
[06:48] really seems to be enjoying this lesson
[06:50] which is going to be vital to my future
[06:52] training with him he's got to love
[06:54] working with me here
[06:57] yes
[06:58] all right good so i feel like he's
[07:00] starting to understand the concept of
[07:01] here this is going to become more
[07:03] evident when we're doing things like
[07:04] leash training and training in public
[07:06] where i go to get his attention but
[07:08] we'll see how that goes later on i feel
[07:09] confident he's starting to get the
[07:11] concept here but i also want him to know
[07:13] that his name means he's gonna get
[07:15] something great as well let's do a
[07:17] variation of the game we did yesterday
[07:19] right we threw the treat he's gonna go
[07:21] get it
[07:24] and he looks up at me
[07:28] chop
[07:29] come yes
[07:33] very good so chop and are kind of
[07:36] synonymous for our purposes at least
[07:38] right now you know there may be a time
[07:40] when i want chop to mean pay attention
[07:42] up here or whatever but right now i
[07:44] think as a default when he hears his
[07:46] name i want him approaching me chop
[07:49] good
[07:54] chop
[07:56] and so as he follows me chop
[08:00] chop yes
[08:02] good man you can see chop is just
[08:04] another word we can use to get his
[08:06] attention in different contexts so i'm
[08:09] gonna throw some treats out there let
[08:10] him chase it so essentially i mean he
[08:13] hears chop he thinks oh i get a treat
[08:15] and over time we're gonna phase that in
[08:16] to mean hey chop pay attention to me or
[08:18] chop come here or whatever
[08:22] chop
[08:24] yes
[08:25] okay now we need to give him his first
[08:28] impulse control training session which
[08:30] is everything in dog training if you
[08:32] ever want to teach your dog how to not
[08:35] do something that they want to do but
[08:37] you'd prefer they not do it then they
[08:39] have to know this next exercise this
[08:42] whole session you've been seeing when i
[08:43] put the piece of food in front of him he
[08:45] goes and he takes it right i mean every
[08:47] time he does it but i want to teach him
[08:49] how to
[08:51] only take that treat with permission
[08:53] watch how easy this is to train i'm just
[08:55] gonna close my hand when he gives up on
[08:56] it right
[08:58] what am i gonna say i'm gonna say the
[08:59] magic word
[09:01] yes
[09:03] yes and then i'm gonna reveal it because
[09:06] he was being less it's no that's my
[09:08] finger
[09:09] i want to verify that he has it within
[09:10] him to lay off the treat when he clearly
[09:14] wants to get it
[09:16] yes
[09:17] there we go
[09:20] yes so i'm looking for that micro second
[09:23] where he's actually not even going for
[09:25] it yes you see that
[09:28] now let's see if he
[09:29] with my hand closed still
[09:31] i do cover how to teach all of this in
[09:33] both of my books as well i'm going to
[09:34] have links below to those you can also
[09:36] get an audio form too
[09:39] yes see that this is so much more than
[09:42] just teaching him to leave a treat alone
[09:44] this is just one of the easiest versions
[09:46] that i can think of of him leaving alone
[09:49] something that he really wants so that's
[09:51] why i start here in the future this
[09:53] foundation of self-control will
[09:55] theoretically help us teach him to leave
[09:58] much more enticing things alone like
[10:00] other dogs on a walk but i have a
[10:02] feeling that we have a lot of work to do
[10:05] to get to that point though instead of
[10:07] keeping my hand closed now i'm going to
[10:10] present the tree to him directly and see
[10:12] if i can catch him succeeding for just a
[10:15] moment
[10:17] yes
[10:20] yes
[10:21] i put that treat right in front of him
[10:23] you could see in his eyes the restraint
[10:24] he was using yes
[10:27] looking for that restraint when he goes
[10:28] for it and pull when i pull away he's
[10:30] like whoa i didn't mean to do that i
[10:32] want to keep it near
[10:35] yes
[10:36] so i'm looking for that one second
[10:39] of restraint let's put him back here
[10:42] here we go and let's see here's another
[10:44] way to lure him i'm trying to get him in
[10:45] a nice position for the camera and
[10:47] that's coming in quite handy look at
[10:49] this right in front of him
[10:52] yes
[10:53] good now let's just introduce the word
[10:55] to him that now that he's starting to
[10:57] understand the concept
[10:59] leave it
[11:01] yes
[11:02] good i like how he glanced at me when a
[11:04] dog offers you their attention with a
[11:06] treat right in front of them like that
[11:07] as if to say hey am i doing the right
[11:09] thing that's a good sign that we are
[11:12] really starting to connect with each
[11:13] other it's amazing what a training
[11:15] exercise as simple as this can evolve
[11:18] into over the next several weeks this
[11:21] right here is a magical moment for chop
[11:24] i mean here we have a dog who's grown up
[11:26] on the streets basically in the
[11:28] wilderness and in this moment i really
[11:31] feel like i'm starting to see that shift
[11:33] in his expression that depth of his
[11:35] intelligence when i first met him we
[11:38] were completely detached and now i'm
[11:40] starting to see that glimmer of mutual
[11:42] communication starting to happen it's
[11:44] like he's wondering am i a dog or
[11:46] something why is this guy over here so
[11:48] interested in communicating with me i
[11:50] love sharing these very special hard to
[11:53] catch moments on camera with you guys
[11:55] because these are the moments that we
[11:57] look for to see our dog truly beginning
[11:59] to break through
[12:01] leave it
[12:02] yes
[12:04] good man all right so leave it's looking
[12:07] good now that he's leaving it alone
[12:09] while it's in my hand let's see what
[12:10] happens when i drop it leave it
[12:14] whenever we change a variable when
[12:16] teaching our dogs it's bound to confuse
[12:19] them the vast majority of the time so
[12:22] while i'm still teaching him leave it
[12:24] overall in the first instance my hand
[12:26] was closed then it was open with the
[12:28] treat exposed and now i'm dropping it
[12:30] that's three variable changes and all
[12:32] three of those versions required him to
[12:34] use his logic a little bit different
[12:37] each time and it doesn't just stop here
[12:39] this trend is going to continue
[12:40] throughout his training after all seeing
[12:42] a dog at the park might prove to be a
[12:44] lot more exciting than a piece of kibble
[12:46] in front of him in my living room just a
[12:49] hunch
[12:50] so let's make it a little bit easier by
[12:51] setting it down covering it up
[12:57] yes good man did you see how he's like
[12:59] what do i have to do
[13:05] chop
[13:09] here
[13:10] yes did you see how he instantly looked
[13:12] up i was able to get his attention off
[13:14] there i want to really reward that i
[13:16] want to keep that going i'm trying to
[13:18] really get into this groove where i can
[13:21] drop a treat in front of him and then
[13:23] get his attention on me
[13:24] yes
[13:27] here yes
[13:29] it's just a good way to play hot or cold
[13:32] with your dog
[13:33] so
[13:34] leave it
[13:36] here
[13:36] yes
[13:38] for added measure i'm going to see if i
[13:40] can guide him away from that kibble
[13:42] sitting on the floor with another kibble
[13:47] good yes
[13:49] that's come
[13:50] putting motion to it definitely makes it
[13:51] harder but i'm really trying to get him
[13:53] to think here
[13:57] yes okay pretty good lesson for now
[13:59] still long ways to go but i feel much
[14:01] better knowing that he's starting to
[14:03] learn this concept of leave something
[14:05] alone pay attention to me come when
[14:07] called sit i mean all of that pretty
[14:09] quickly here but
[14:11] not very polished at all but a good
[14:13] start i'm encouraged it's one thing to
[14:16] be in here but the second i step out
[14:19] there i'm stepping into a bear preserve
[14:22] there are bears in our driveway all of
[14:24] the time this is one of the most
[14:26] hazardous environments that i've ever
[14:28] trained a dog in why can't anything be
[14:30] normal in alaska the dogs are huge
[14:32] there's bears in my driveway what is
[14:34] happening i'm super anxious to get out
[14:37] into public with chop but before i go to
[14:40] a public park with him i want to make
[14:41] sure that i have some at least basic
[14:43] leash skills with him so we're out here
[14:45] in the driveway and i want to see how
[14:47] well he does because it's probably going
[14:49] to be easier for him to learn here in my
[14:52] driveway than it is in a public park so
[14:55] i want to know what i'm working with
[14:56] here
[14:59] interesting i see how i said here he
[15:01] didn't immediately pay attention to me
[15:02] like he was doing just a moment ago by
[15:05] now you'll probably understand that when
[15:07] you're outside things are way harder
[15:09] than when you're inside why don't we
[15:11] shape this more because right now i want
[15:13] him to check things out so i don't want
[15:15] to just be like pay attention to me pay
[15:17] attention to me he's really enjoying the
[15:19] various sites of the neighborhood here
[15:21] and looking at some things in the
[15:22] distance so what i'm hoping is going to
[15:24] happen is he's going to satisfy his
[15:26] curiosity and then he's going to glance
[15:28] up at me
[15:30] and then i'm going to say yes i'm going
[15:31] to give him
[15:32] a whole handful
[15:34] of kibble the advantage to just waiting
[15:37] for him to do it on his own is that it
[15:39] shows him that he really organically
[15:41] made that pleasant reward appear before
[15:44] his eyes
[15:45] yes
[15:47] good man there we go
[15:49] that was perfect
[15:51] yes
[15:53] so let's see if it happens a bit quicker
[15:55] this next time
[15:57] yes
[15:58] right there it's like
[16:02] let's just let this play out for a sec
[16:06] yes
[16:09] i know what you're thinking he's being
[16:11] too good right now zach come on couldn't
[16:13] you have got a challenging dog to work
[16:14] with admittedly this is a good start but
[16:17] remember we are only in my driveway and
[16:20] there are very minimal real-world
[16:22] distractions around my objective here is
[16:25] to really get him looking up to me and
[16:27] paying attention to me while we move
[16:30] around now outside in the driveway as
[16:32] opposed to inside like we talked about
[16:34] yes
[16:39] here yes
[16:41] in this environment he's really finding
[16:43] his food reinforcing but for him this
[16:45] environment isn't exactly challenging
[16:53] you can hear a neighbor's dog barking in
[16:55] the background
[16:58] yes
[17:00] good and
[17:02] i just want to make sure that i can
[17:03] easily get him away from a distraction
[17:05] he might encounter in the wild
[17:09] yes
[17:10] sit
[17:12] i've never been so happy to see a dog
[17:14] sit in my life
[17:16] here
[17:17] yes
[17:20] good and see there i was able to
[17:22] redirect that forward momentum i'm
[17:24] liking that
[17:26] yes oh wow
[17:29] i loved how he was rubbing against my
[17:31] leg on that one that was cool let me
[17:32] address this because i know it looks
[17:34] like i'm just constantly shoving treats
[17:36] down his throat here but keep in mind
[17:38] two things first this is his daily meal
[17:40] and perhaps more importantly the whole
[17:42] reason we rapid fire treats like this in
[17:44] the beginning of brand new behavior is
[17:46] so that we can communicate in no
[17:48] uncertain terms that what he's doing
[17:50] right there is definitely working for
[17:52] both of us don't worry this isn't
[17:54] something that happens forever rather
[17:56] quickly we would begin rewarding for
[17:58] three seconds of good behavior then 10
[18:00] seconds then eventually 10 minutes but
[18:03] let's not get ahead of ourselves just
[18:04] yet i find too like with people who are
[18:07] new to teaching dogs you're really
[18:09] tempted to default to no because you
[18:12] want to let your dog know what not to do
[18:15] but really if you can just kind of tip
[18:17] the scales 180 you know and look at it a
[18:19] little bit differently and try and say
[18:21] yes 80 of the time or even 90 of the
[18:24] time if you can so let your training
[18:27] live around the word yes i like that and
[18:30] don't miss too many opportunities to
[18:33] acknowledge when your dog is just doing
[18:35] great i mean there's no harm in letting
[18:36] them know when they're on the wrong
[18:38] track from time to time as we did with
[18:40] leave it just moments ago inside but
[18:42] find those opportunities to let them
[18:45] know when they have done the right thing
[18:47] just trying to see what happens if i
[18:50] pick up the pace does that get him a
[18:51] little more engaged i don't know
[18:59] yes
[19:02] good man okay all right good i feel good
[19:05] about that it's good to know that at
[19:07] least in this relatively
[19:09] free environment he's pretty receptive
[19:11] to learning but i'm really curious to
[19:13] get a baseline as to how chop behaves in
[19:17] an average park where there are a number
[19:19] of dogs people kids and other
[19:22] unanticipated stimuli and while he gets
[19:24] an a-plus for his performance so far
[19:26] today experience tells me that this next
[19:29] part could be potentially very rocky he
[19:33] cannot be doing that when he sees dogs
[19:35] training can go off the rails with so
[19:38] many different dogs when you take them
[19:40] to a place like this
[19:42] this is reality dog training check out

[00:00] i felt like in that moment every bit of
[00:02] training i had done with him was
[00:04] meaningless

[00:18] from everything i've seen inertia and
[00:19] chop are ready to meet each other again
[00:22] and hopefully this time they'll open up
[00:24] a little bit more than they did when
[00:25] they first met each other inertia is
[00:27] sensitive but she is brave enough and
[00:29] there comes a time to test and i think
[00:31] now is that time during times like this
[00:35] i like to eat some nom nom to think
[00:37] about things now i know what you're
[00:38] thinking there's no way they ship nom
[00:41] nom to
[00:42] alaska you're right about that sorry
[00:45] alaska the thing is nom nom is super
[00:47] fresh food so they have to get it where
[00:49] it's going fast and apparently dog
[00:52] sledding the product takes a little bit
[00:54] too long hopefully someday though but
[00:56] this stuff is so fresh and so good it's
[00:58] designed by a veterinary nutritionist
[01:00] they actually cater it to your specific
[01:03] dog and gently cook the food so it
[01:05] retains so many of its nutrients nom nom
[01:08] is the freshest food that i know of that
[01:10] you can have delivered straight to your
[01:12] door if you want to try nom nom you can
[01:13] get 50 off a two week trial by going to
[01:16] my special link trinom.com
[01:18] zack i'll have a link below i'm hoping
[01:20] that today inertia and chop might
[01:23] actually become friends this is one of
[01:25] the more significant moments in
[01:27] inertia's life at least as it relates to
[01:29] interacting with a young strong big
[01:32] other dog he had such an active day
[01:35] yesterday and he basically woke up after
[01:37] spending 10 plus hours asleep and he
[01:40] still looked pretty tired and pretty
[01:43] subdued so i'm looking at him and i'm
[01:44] like this is the mindset i want him in
[01:47] when he interacts with inertia not high
[01:49] strung like he was at the park yesterday
[01:51] and it's worth reminding you remember
[01:52] inertia has demonstrated fearful
[01:54] behavior in the past where she's felt
[01:56] the need to nip at other dogs and it's
[01:58] fortunately not accelerated but i want
[02:00] to keep it that way but inertia has also
[02:02] come a long way she's matured
[02:04] tremendously her training's been going
[02:06] very well and so i really think that
[02:09] these two have a very good shot at
[02:12] hitting it off well together of all the
[02:14] things that inertia and i have done
[02:15] together the trust we've built with one
[02:17] another has probably been one of the
[02:19] things that i'm at least most proud of i
[02:21] don't want to mess that up and i don't
[02:22] think i'm going to at the end of the day
[02:24] you never know how two dogs are going to
[02:26] interact with one another there's a lot
[02:28] of variables and we can't know exactly
[02:30] what's going on in their head all we can
[02:32] do is do our best to prepare them for
[02:34] these interactions i've brought my dog
[02:36] inertia outside and both dogs seem
[02:38] pretty calm and in a good mood i'm
[02:40] feeling pretty good about this but let's
[02:42] see if this goes as i expect it too
[02:45] i just like letting the dogs come out
[02:46] here when i'm doing this type of
[02:48] training and have their dog time
[02:50] together and
[02:52] let them get their fresh air
[02:55] wake up a little bit
[03:07] and there we have it i mean let's let
[03:09] this play out for a little bit and see
[03:11] where they go with this but so far so
[03:13] good
[03:28] there's their first game of chase
[03:41] you see a brief moment of cautiousness
[03:42] here from inertia and she appears to be
[03:45] communicating to chop settle down for a
[03:48] second and chop takes that cue from her
[03:50] extremely well and he backs off for a
[03:53] few seconds he's pretty good at chase
[03:55] i'd say so and inertia is going to be
[03:58] super happy now that's her favorite dog
[04:00] game right there
[04:02] some dogs like to wrestle but inertia
[04:05] loves to play chase that's her favorite
[04:07] game to play with other dogs
[04:09] chop is behaving extremely well he's
[04:11] even ignoring inertia sometimes which
[04:13] will communicate to her that she doesn't
[04:15] have to worry about him constantly being
[04:17] all over her plus it gives her time to
[04:19] watch him and decide that he's okay on
[04:22] her terms
[04:23] for a nurse to be doing so well with
[04:25] such a big dog just
[04:27] makes me as her dad super happy
[04:34] and ursula looks like she's really ready
[04:36] to play rough here she's like let's go
[04:38] for it and chop says okay i'll
[04:40] reciprocate i'll get a little rough too
[04:42] and he does
[04:45] but then inertia says oh okay that's a
[04:47] little too rough
[04:49] this is brilliant communication between
[04:51] these two very smart dogs
[04:58] this so far is best case scenario number
[05:01] one reciprocal play they're both doing
[05:03] play bows and neither one is being very
[05:06] overbearing so far they really appear to
[05:07] be playing politely they're testing the
[05:09] waters with one another and there are
[05:11] moments here where both dogs completely
[05:14] stop playing they sniff around and chill
[05:16] out for a minute in a way that isn't
[05:18] hyperactive at all so this is a really
[05:20] good precedent
[05:23] sometimes introducing two dogs can be a
[05:25] delicate process i do talk about this
[05:27] and many other dog training tips in my
[05:29] books i'll have links below
[05:32] all right looks like his stamina is uh
[05:34] limited you like playing chase in very
[05:36] short bits i can see
[05:39] all right there they go
[05:43] easy
[05:45] so i'm watching him to make sure he
[05:47] doesn't get too rough
[05:49] because inertia's pretty good at evading
[05:51] however
[05:52] if he catches up to her
[05:55] he might put pause on her and she
[05:57] doesn't like that
[05:59] but so far he seems quite polite they're
[06:01] doing so well right now i'd like to see
[06:03] if we can get them coexisting inside the
[06:06] house too
[06:11] while inside here periodically i'm going
[06:13] to get chops attention on me maybe by
[06:15] snapping my fingers in order to
[06:16] interrupt him from being too
[06:18] rambunctious especially when he attempts
[06:20] to put his paws on her i'm going to
[06:22] discourage that because inertia needs to
[06:24] have the freedom to create distance from
[06:26] him if she wants to and if he restrains
[06:28] her that could make her more fearful and
[06:30] possibly escalate matters so i really
[06:32] need to be on top of things here
[06:36] she's so bad
[06:46] inside things might get a little bumpy
[06:47] if they continue to play rambunctiously
[06:49] like this and i'd prefer that indoor
[06:51] play be a little bit more subdued than
[06:54] outdoor play with these two because well
[06:56] you can only imagine okay
[06:58] so now we'll let them resume
[07:01] if they want you or like not that's fine
[07:03] too
[07:04] yeah and it seems like if we just
[07:05] interrupt them over and over when they
[07:07] do things we prefer they don't do
[07:10] they learn not to do them
[07:12] high inertia
[07:14] you having fun
[07:16] you like your new friend i'm constantly
[07:18] watching these two and i'm not just
[07:20] going to make the assumption that oh
[07:21] they're best friends and i'll let them
[07:23] do whatever they want now they still
[07:24] have a lot to learn about interacting
[07:25] with one another just because two dogs
[07:27] start off this way and play well
[07:29] together doesn't mean that they're just
[07:30] bound to be best friends forever though
[07:32] remember rambunctious play can escalate
[07:34] at times so it's very important that i
[07:36] continue to intervene if things start to
[07:40] get a little too hyperactive that way my
[07:42] hope is that both dogs continue to learn
[07:44] what's appropriate behavior over time
[07:46] and even though today went well we're
[07:48] not out of the woods here chop is still
[07:50] coming out of his shell so we still have
[07:52] a lot to learn about one another over
[07:54] the coming weeks
[07:59] you can pick them like flowers these
[08:01] clumps of hair
[08:03] look at that sorry bree yeah
[08:05] i have got to brush this dog and give
[08:09] him a bath today i think it's a
[08:12] reasonable guess to say that he has
[08:14] probably never had a bath at least a
[08:16] formal bath in the way we're going to
[08:18] give him today because he's been
[08:19] homeless his entire life he's lived
[08:21] outside i mean he is a very significant
[08:24] shedder as we have established i mean
[08:26] usually when i brush a dog i really try
[08:28] to ease them into it make sure they're
[08:29] not scared of the brush maybe they've
[08:31] had a past affiliation with a brush that
[08:33] scares them up
[08:34] clearly chop does not appear yes to be
[08:38] scared so i'm just right now i'm letting
[08:40] him smell it reacting confidently around
[08:42] the brush of course i don't want him
[08:43] biting it but i'd rather him be more
[08:45] playful than nervous of course i'm gonna
[08:48] come over here right at the side of his
[08:50] face or under his neck and touch him
[08:51] with it
[08:52] just because that's where dogs like to
[08:54] be touched by humans initially when we
[08:57] pet them is under their chin which can
[08:59] be a little counter-intuitive sometimes
[09:00] we want to go above their head or behind
[09:02] them but that can throw off a lot of
[09:04] dogs
[09:05] so i'm just kind of tapping him here
[09:08] going to tap his shoulder yes
[09:11] and i'm giving him a treat so just
[09:13] really easing him into it yes
[09:16] if you just go in and start brushing
[09:17] them
[09:18] yes
[09:20] vigorously then that can really startle
[09:23] a lot of dogs
[09:25] see that he got a little nervous that
[09:27] time yes
[09:28] it's okay
[09:30] gonna go
[09:31] a little easier yes
[09:35] so far i have like done one stroke there
[09:38] you go a very light one
[09:40] yes
[09:43] i'm just giving him his breakfast right
[09:44] now
[09:46] never seen anything like this look at
[09:49] that
[09:53] sorry it's just it's hilarious because
[09:54] i'm gonna have to like take the hair out
[09:57] every three seconds it's gonna take
[09:59] forever to brush and going it this way
[10:00] let me see if i can get a few strokes in
[10:02] now
[10:04] yes i got three that time he was a
[10:06] little thrown off but i think he'll be
[10:07] okay let's see
[10:09] good man you're doing great yes
[10:12] two that time for those of you with new
[10:15] dogs in particular you should probably
[10:17] consider getting a monthly pup box they
[10:20] send you training supplies every month
[10:21] along with a wealth of information on
[10:24] this extremely detailed training card
[10:26] that's front and back and extra durable
[10:28] so it's somewhat resistant to untrained
[10:31] dogs and this is all based on your dog's
[10:33] age so this for example would be the six
[10:35] month box i still think it'll be helpful
[10:37] here but they also have adult boxes i
[10:39] love this box though because they send
[10:40] me my favorite shampoo right here i'm
[10:43] gonna use this in a sec one of the tips
[10:44] i got from the training card inside the
[10:46] pup box was you could use a washcloth
[10:48] too to really ease them into it if
[10:50] they're very sensitive so that would get
[10:52] them used to being touched before they
[10:53] actually have to feel the bristles i'm
[10:55] going to go ahead and let them eat out
[10:56] of my hand
[10:57] while i do
[10:58] this this is great
[11:01] this is also a great warm-up for his
[11:03] bath because i might try to do something
[11:05] similar when giving him a bath though a
[11:07] lot of dogs lose interest in eating when
[11:09] you give them a bath because
[11:11] they're a little bit stressed about
[11:12] what's going on
[11:15] yeah he certainly did yes
[11:18] why did i say yes there he had walked
[11:20] away
[11:21] i prefer he not do that
[11:23] i'm really careful to allow chop to opt
[11:26] out here whenever he wants i want to
[11:28] keep him as comfortable as possible by
[11:30] being patient here and going slowly
[11:31] we're dramatically increasing the odds
[11:33] that he will hopefully continue to feel
[11:36] good about this experience moving
[11:37] forward as you can see he comes right
[11:39] back too came back automatically and i
[11:41] said chop come as he was coming so i
[11:44] could really capture that and put it in
[11:46] context so he understands really
[11:49] what that term means because he's in the
[11:50] middle of performing that action and so
[11:52] i'm still trying to be mindful to give
[11:56] him treats here
[11:59] every several strokes just to keep it a
[12:01] fun experience
[12:03] it's like you were made to live in the
[12:05] arctic or something
[12:08] and this is after brushing him for 20
[12:10] minutes straight
[12:11] [Laughter]
[12:15] oh gosh come here
[12:18] oh how's you with his tail good man some
[12:20] dogs have sensitive tails
[12:22] chop
[12:27] yes
[12:27] that was quite nice
[12:32] here sit
[12:34] yes
[12:37] good man
[12:39] look at me
[12:42] you ready to take a bath
[12:44] okay come on let's go just seeing what
[12:46] happened outside
[12:48] i'm wondering what is the bath gonna be
[12:51] like this dog just lost a whole dog's
[12:53] worth of fur i mean he basically just
[12:56] exploded before my eyes but he is still
[12:59] here and he still needs a bath if you
[13:02] approach it right giving a dog a bath
[13:03] can be a fantastic way to build trust
[13:06] with them i guess it's a great way to
[13:08] demonstrate that you are willing to go
[13:10] slowly with them through new and
[13:13] potentially stressful experiences the
[13:15] idea especially in the beginning is to
[13:17] guide them through this experience nice
[13:19] and easy so that they'll learn even if
[13:21] they're a little stressed that you've
[13:23] got their back and once you start
[13:25] building trust like that it can start to
[13:26] translate in other areas of your
[13:28] relationship with a dog at least that's
[13:30] what i found
[13:34] thanks
[13:36] he's a heavy man
[13:38] yes good man i think it's really
[13:40] important to go slowly when we're
[13:42] introducing a dog to the bath process
[13:46] yes
[13:48] doing really well here and so you can
[13:50] see how the water is making contact with
[13:53] his feet right now he's aware of it but
[13:55] he's doing really well so now we're
[13:57] going to go to this
[13:59] i'm pointing it away from him notice yes
[14:01] let me turn it off that would probably
[14:02] be better we'll turn it off like this
[14:05] hey what's this
[14:06] you can see there's a little bit still
[14:07] coming out there but
[14:09] he's doing really well see if this is
[14:11] indeed his first bath i want to go out
[14:13] of my way to make this as good of an
[14:15] experience as i possibly can while still
[14:17] making sure that he gets clean and
[14:20] naturally a lot of dogs can be sensitive
[14:22] to getting a bath it's kind of like
[14:23] going to the dentist for dogs
[14:25] we'll go to one of the softer
[14:28] sprays here
[14:30] that's a nice temperature oh you're
[14:32] gonna like this it's okay
[14:35] yes
[14:37] see that just a quick little sprinkle
[14:39] here yes
[14:42] i think i've forgotten to take his
[14:44] collar off good man look at him yes he's
[14:47] a little like weirded out by the water
[14:51] so you're gonna do short bursts build
[14:52] some trust with him here
[14:54] yes
[14:55] good boy
[15:01] i wouldn't be surprised if this was his
[15:04] first bath ever in life
[15:07] look at this he's great oh my gosh
[15:13] that's quite convenient look at that
[15:15] gosh he's a big dog look at this
[15:19] he's making it easy for me here get
[15:21] under him
[15:25] i mean he's as tall as me look at this
[15:30] good boy hey yes
[15:33] you want some treats
[15:35] he's still taking treats too so
[15:38] you know that's a sign that he's not too
[15:39] stressed all right i'm going to go ahead
[15:41] and soak him up now
[15:46] he's being so brave right now
[15:49] oh you already smell so much better
[15:52] let's take a measure of the stress level
[15:54] okay still taking treats
[15:56] again we correlate that with not too
[15:58] stressed dogs that are really nervous
[16:00] won't take treats pup box sent us this
[16:02] awesome toy right here and you could put
[16:04] peanut butter on the inside of something
[16:06] like this to keep their attention we're
[16:08] gonna let him dry out when we're done on
[16:10] the deck
[16:12] he's gonna love that with the dry air
[16:13] out here in alaska he'll be dry in no
[16:16] time i think look at how good he is with
[16:17] his feet look at the size of these feet
[16:24] it's like washing an suv
[16:27] one of the best first baths ever
[16:30] honestly baths can be such a stressful
[16:33] time for a dog and just by going slowly
[16:36] like we did in this lesson you're much
[16:38] more likely to have a smoother
[16:40] experience
[16:42] you did a good job in that bath to try
[16:44] and dry him off a little bit before he
[16:46] shakes off all over the place because
[16:49] we don't have flood insurance on this
[16:51] house
[16:53] okay
[16:55] i'm gonna shake off
[16:58] shake off all right i think he's good to
[16:59] go on the
[17:02] deck comfy buddy seems pretty happy out
[17:06] there
[17:07] he's been doing so well out there
[17:10] well contrary to the bright sun it is
[17:14] 9 15 at night right now i think it's
[17:16] time to go to bed i've got lots of
[17:18] things planned for tomorrow so it should
[17:20] be pretty fun what do you think chop are
[17:22] you ready to go to bed if he gets
[17:23] through the night without waking up i'm
[17:25] going to be very pleased but if he
[17:27] decides he needs a potty break in the
[17:29] middle of the night then that's okay too
[17:31] i want to get some one-on-one time with
[17:32] inertia plus i also want to give chop
[17:35] some experience of seeing me work with
[17:37] another dog while he's in that calmer
[17:39] state of mind his social skills around
[17:41] other dogs still need some work and we
[17:43] found this great hack where chop can
[17:45] chill out outside and get some fresh air
[17:48] while i play with inertia so far he
[17:49] hasn't made any efforts to explore or
[17:51] jump up on the railing and he seems
[17:53] really content out here like he could
[17:55] just take a nap out here for hours but
[17:57] i'm still gonna stay right here in this
[17:59] room and keep an eye on him at all times
[18:01] controlling the environment like this is
[18:02] one of the most important things you can
[18:05] do just make sure there are no flaws in
[18:07] your controlling the environment plans

[00:00] the single worst thing that has ever
[00:02] happened in my dog training career
[00:05] just happened
[00:07] this is reality dog training subscribe
[00:10] and click the bell so you never miss an
[00:12] episode
[00:14] we're still inside that three-day window
[00:16] where
[00:17] it really takes a minute for them to
[00:19] open up i think we saw some of that
[00:21] yesterday when we were at the park with
[00:22] him and he was pretty tough to manage at
[00:25] times but still a smart guy he's just a
[00:27] curious guy that's all chuck has no
[00:30] leash skills and we have a long way to
[00:31] go but eventually i'm hopeful that he'll
[00:35] heal when i ask him to
[00:38] i'm on record now is saying that that
[00:40] means we have to teach it doesn't it
[00:41] yeah yep let me show you what i'm hoping
[00:43] to accomplish with my own dog inertia so
[00:46] a heel looks like this inertia heal
[00:49] good girl heels where your dog stays on
[00:51] one side of you they'll move with you
[00:53] when you move they'll turn with you when
[00:55] you turn and ideally they'll stop when
[00:57] you stop in other words you want them as
[01:00] glued to your side as reasonably
[01:01] possible we do heal in short-term
[01:03] situations like on a busy city street or
[01:06] for a good training exercise it's not
[01:08] necessarily reasonable to have your dog
[01:10] heal at all times whenever on leash as
[01:12] it requires a lot of focus and it's
[01:13] important for dogs to have experiences
[01:15] inertia is happy to do anything in
[01:17] exchange for this toilet paper toy and
[01:19] like you'll see with chop with inertia
[01:21] having a really powerful currency to get
[01:23] them to look at you at first can really
[01:25] work well look at this
[01:27] good yes for those of you that saw my
[01:29] series with inertia you'll know that i
[01:32] love bark toys and they were so powerful
[01:34] and teaching her so many things barkbox
[01:36] and super chew are monthly subscription
[01:38] boxes you get the most original toys
[01:40] imaginable and really high quality
[01:42] treats and shoes for your dog every
[01:44] month barkbox is for dogs who like
[01:46] plushier toys like this and super
[01:48] chewers for dogs who need tougher toys
[01:51] like this eyeball
[01:52] somersault stay
[01:55] okay good yes barkbox's theme is
[01:58] centered around halloween pranks here we
[02:00] have a bag on fire clearly they're
[02:02] indicating like there's some poop in
[02:03] here that's on fire so when you open the
[02:05] door you stomp on it
[02:07] that's clear to you
[02:09] there's something in there
[02:11] ah
[02:14] what
[02:16] are you kidding me seriously i cannot
[02:18] recommend these enough guys go to
[02:19] barkbox.com dog training or
[02:21] superchewer.com dog training get a free
[02:24] extra box when you sign up for a
[02:25] multi-month subscription
[02:27] so we saw recently how poor chops
[02:29] manners were in public so it's very
[02:32] clear i have to teach him good leash
[02:34] skills so we're gonna start really basic
[02:37] here in my neighborhood
[02:39] the thing is there are definitely
[02:42] black bears and brown bears in great
[02:44] abundance in these woods
[02:47] right here we've seen them we got on
[02:49] camera at our house so we don't usually
[02:50] go this unprotected out here but i need
[02:53] to train a dog how to pay attention in
[02:54] public we do have bear spray so i mean
[02:57] we are prepared i am not because the
[03:00] most recent bear video
[03:03] of many
[03:04] that was shared with me by our neighbor
[03:06] right there
[03:07] of the street that we're about to train
[03:09] on yep was a mom bear with two cubs and
[03:12] no thank you that is not the kind of
[03:15] bear that i just i do not want to
[03:16] encounter a mom bear that's the scariest
[03:18] kind of bear in case you don't know what
[03:20] bear spray is it's concentrated pepper
[03:22] spray just like human pepper spray it's
[03:24] a non-deadly way to get rid of bears i
[03:26] have a new hypothesis about chop and i
[03:28] think he might be an anatolian shepherd
[03:31] mix and if he is then he will maybe
[03:33] genetically be predisposed to help me
[03:36] not get eaten by a bear today and that
[03:37] would be great so i really hope that's
[03:39] true we would probably get a lot of
[03:40] subscribers
[03:42] my general goal here is to work in a
[03:44] small area and see if i can gain
[03:46] traction by getting him familiar with a
[03:49] small area see one of the problems with
[03:50] trying to train your dog when you're on
[03:52] a normal walk especially with a dog who
[03:54] can pull like he does is that you're
[03:56] trying to get somewhere it's just not
[03:57] realistic to teach them to slow down in
[03:59] that particular context because when
[04:01] you're constantly encountering new
[04:03] ground and new smells that can be
[04:05] overwhelming to a lot of dogs so if my
[04:07] hypothesis is correct as we walk down
[04:10] this patch here he's going to be pulling
[04:12] and very distracted by all the plant
[04:14] life and everything else around here and
[04:16] then by the end of this training lesson
[04:18] i'm hoping that i can
[04:20] have him walking nicely and if things
[04:22] are going really well i hope that i can
[04:24] do some heel training out here in this
[04:27] environment uh but i don't know if we're
[04:29] gonna get there let's see how bad it is
[04:31] all right so i'm just gonna walk
[04:33] so you can see how he's
[04:36] pulling
[04:38] here
[04:40] i said here getting no response from him
[04:42] see
[04:44] here is something that means give me
[04:45] your attention i'm also looking out for
[04:46] bears all right
[04:48] good man let's go
[04:49] so we're gonna walk back here
[04:51] now this is interesting do you see how
[04:54] immediately on the walk back
[04:57] he's slowing down he's like we've
[04:58] already been here it's not perfect but
[05:00] you saw an immediate difference here
[05:02] let's try
[05:04] so he's like all right i guess we're
[05:06] going back now
[05:07] oh yeah i remember that smell that's
[05:09] interesting
[05:10] there's a lot of toxic plant life to
[05:13] dogs here so i want to
[05:15] be very careful about that
[05:21] not doing any treats yet because i'm
[05:23] really more focused on just letting him
[05:25] walk here and explore i don't really
[05:26] want to distract him with treats i want
[05:28] him to have a genuine experience with
[05:30] his environment too
[05:31] so
[05:34] i'm not asking him to do anything as
[05:36] much as i am just seeing what he does on
[05:37] his own good man
[05:40] i'll say good to let him know you know i
[05:42] like that whereas i'll say yes to mark a
[05:45] behavior and follow that up with a
[05:47] reward so they're similar but a little
[05:48] bit different
[05:50] and i mean already better
[05:53] than he was just a moment ago you see
[05:55] what i mean this really underscores
[05:57] how dogs
[05:59] once they satisfy their curiosities
[06:02] they tend to be relatively good
[06:04] it's a spectrum of course not every dog
[06:06] is this compliant i love how he's
[06:09] looking up at me i haven't marked those
[06:10] yet because i'm still really just trying
[06:12] to prime him for this lesson rather than
[06:14] to train him but in a moment i'm gonna
[06:16] start marking these behaviors once i
[06:17] feel he's really adapting i think maybe
[06:19] one more lap now of course in the long
[06:21] run you'll want to be able to walk
[06:23] virtually anywhere with your dog but
[06:24] while they're learning we need to break
[06:26] things down into smaller steps
[06:29] if he looks up at me this time i'll mark
[06:31] it
[06:33] in fact that's what i'm going to do i'm
[06:34] going to wait for him to naturally look
[06:36] up at me and then i'll mark come on
[06:38] let's go
[06:40] yes there we go that was the glance i
[06:42] was waiting for
[06:44] good boy
[06:46] his loose leash walking is looking
[06:48] really good right now that was my
[06:50] expectation so we're on schedule but
[06:53] he's not completely focused on me he's
[06:55] not staying by my side i would like him
[06:57] to at least know what a heel is even
[07:00] though we don't expect him to heal 100
[07:01] percent of the time when on leash but
[07:04] heal is a great communication building
[07:06] exercise hey you ready to heal come here
[07:09] first thing i want to do is make sure
[07:10] that i can get him right in front of me
[07:12] and i can get his attention
[07:14] unlike that come here
[07:17] sit
[07:21] the way he's shaking his head a little
[07:22] here could be a sign of a bit of stress
[07:24] so i want to take note of things like
[07:26] that and do my best to not frustrate him
[07:28] too much here i really really want to
[07:30] keep him optimistic about training in
[07:32] our living room he would do great with
[07:33] this i'm going to take a step back i'm
[07:35] going to show him a treat we're going to
[07:37] lure sit
[07:38] good man yes just to give him a reminder
[07:41] trying to get him to follow my hand as a
[07:42] visual signal yes
[07:45] good
[07:46] here
[07:50] yes so now i have him looking up at me
[07:53] in the heel position here i'm having him
[07:55] heal on the right today i find a right
[07:57] heel is often more practical and natural
[07:59] for me but keep in mind you can teach
[08:01] your dog how to heal on either side of
[08:03] you like i've done with my own dog
[08:04] inertia here
[08:06] yes
[08:07] did that one intentionally
[08:10] with the car coming i wanted to see if i
[08:13] had his attention here
[08:15] chop
[08:16] yes
[08:18] i'm periodically rewarding for his
[08:20] general attention when i ask for it and
[08:22] i'm also rewarding him as he stays near
[08:24] me while we're moving
[08:27] yes
[08:29] i love how he's stopping when i'm
[08:30] stopping we're really tuned into each
[08:32] other right now
[08:34] here yes
[08:35] putting my hands behind my back so now
[08:37] i'm not saying here right i can go here
[08:41] yes
[08:44] i want to be able to have my hands on my
[08:46] hips and say here yes
[08:50] or even
[08:51] here
[08:52] yes that's how i'm verifying that he's
[08:54] really paying attention to my head we
[08:56] communicate with each other really well
[08:58] people and dogs through our eyes
[09:01] yes
[09:03] so i use his name i'll use here
[09:08] he needs to know both of them yes
[09:10] rewarding the automatic look for sure
[09:13] because that's what you want them doing
[09:14] really also on a reward back here can
[09:16] you see that like over here before he
[09:18] gets ahead in other words i don't want
[09:19] him to say yeah good boy and reward over
[09:21] there let him know that's where the
[09:22] rewards come from with heel training i'm
[09:25] gonna try and get in more steps now
[09:29] yes
[09:34] here
[09:38] i cover teaching lessons like this and
[09:40] everything else you can think of in both
[09:42] of my books i'll have links to them
[09:43] below yes
[09:45] i'm gonna wait so i have a reliable look
[09:47] at me
[09:49] let's here
[09:51] so i'm getting a successful response
[09:53] from him sometimes but sometimes i'm not
[09:56] i'm gonna stop because he didn't respond
[09:58] does he
[09:59] correct himself and look up
[10:01] as if to say what i do chop is really in
[10:04] and out here he's not exactly inspired
[10:07] to pay attention to me when there's so
[10:09] much to look around at so i'm gonna see
[10:11] if i can brainstorm some different ways
[10:13] to get him really into this training
[10:14] session because i've noticed that
[10:16] sometimes when a dog isn't that
[10:17] interested in me there's probably
[10:19] something that i can do better maybe if
[10:22] i pick up the pace that might get him a
[10:23] little bit more excited about me let's
[10:25] see
[10:28] chop here
[10:30] oh
[10:31] here
[10:36] yes
[10:40] much more confident trot there like
[10:44] that chop
[10:47] here
[10:48] so is he always looking good but this
[10:49] other dog thing is a bit of a problem
[10:52] yeah dog just quickly ran by here with
[10:55] his person and you can see chop
[10:57] immediately became less responsive so
[10:59] that's still another thing we have to
[11:00] work on i have to get him in the
[11:02] presence of dogs in a distance moving
[11:04] forward
[11:06] oh boy
[11:07] okay he definitely still appears to be
[11:10] excited at the sight or detection of
[11:13] other dogs he's next to impossible to
[11:16] communicate with when he sees a dog most
[11:18] of the time and in this early stage that
[11:21] has been one of our greatest challenges
[11:23] so far now that the dog has cleared out
[11:25] i want chop to still get some exposure
[11:27] but at a great distance here so this is
[11:29] a way to kind of let him satisfy that
[11:31] curiosity you can see him sniffing where
[11:34] the dog walked i mean he gathers a lot
[11:35] of information this way we've got a lot
[11:37] of work to do on teaching him how to be
[11:40] more civilized when he sees dogs in
[11:41] public i still think that there's got to
[11:44] be a better way to get chop even more
[11:47] interested in this training session at
[11:48] any given time dogs find different
[11:50] things reinforcing and those things can
[11:53] change based on circumstance and context
[11:56] let me try and switch up his currency
[12:02] look at that yes
[12:04] good man and so
[12:06] instead of the food this time i'm using
[12:08] a toss of the ball as a reward it can be
[12:11] a little clunky but it can be well worth
[12:13] it this is interesting
[12:15] here
[12:16] yes
[12:18] so i'm get the focus here is getting his
[12:20] eyes on me let me see if i can get his
[12:22] attention for just a second at a time
[12:24] and reward him with the ball then i'll
[12:26] try to get a few steps of a proper heel
[12:29] in exchange for a toss of the ball
[12:33] come on
[12:34] yes
[12:35] so i got like three or four steps right
[12:37] there that was awesome we're gonna bring
[12:39] him back here
[12:40] look at how i'm able to steer him so
[12:43] well often when we think of luring a dog
[12:45] we think of luring with a treat but you
[12:47] can also use all kinds of things that
[12:49] your dog loves in order to lure them for
[12:51] his heel training in general my goal is
[12:53] going to have him to look up towards my
[12:55] face while we're walking luring with the
[12:57] ball can help me get him into position
[13:00] and just like with treats i can focus on
[13:01] shifting his attention from the ball
[13:03] onto my actual eyes over time oh now he
[13:07] remembers it yes
[13:09] so you can see an immediate difference
[13:10] in his energy
[13:12] yes
[13:15] good
[13:16] come on let's go i'm gonna let him chomp
[13:18] on that ball for a second since he's
[13:20] doing so well so you might notice
[13:21] sometimes when i say here i'll say yes
[13:23] afterwards and sometimes i won't that's
[13:25] how i would phase out treats later on as
[13:27] i continued his training chop
[13:30] yes so i'm gonna cheat a little bit here
[13:32] get his attention on the ball and then
[13:34] see if his glance holds once i have eye
[13:37] contact and get that ball out of sight
[13:40] easy i'm also starting to introduce the
[13:42] word easy in context in other words as
[13:45] he's walking slow he'll learn that easy
[13:47] means pay attention to me and slow down
[13:50] if he slows down yes
[13:51] not a perfect heel but
[13:53] pretty good focus and if we can just
[13:55] refine his position a little bit look
[13:57] how wild he is
[14:01] here
[14:04] good let's try and turn
[14:06] oh see how he got thrown off when i went
[14:08] to turn
[14:09] here
[14:12] yes
[14:13] you see that did you see how he took one
[14:14] step that way i'm gonna steer him with
[14:16] the ball since he's a little confused on
[14:18] that turn
[14:19] so come on
[14:21] got to be careful of those teeth though
[14:24] he can accidentally get you good man i'm
[14:27] gonna hold the ball up to my eyes again
[14:29] just to make it real easy look at that
[14:31] here come on
[14:34] good
[14:35] what
[14:36] here
[14:39] yes
[14:40] good man all right good catch it's a
[14:44] pretty nice day so bree's gonna take the
[14:46] car with the equipment home and chop and
[14:48] i are gonna take a walk or hopefully
[14:50] something that resembles one
[14:53] and talk about a completely different
[14:56] story the moment we left that small
[14:58] patch that we were practicing on chop
[15:00] was off to pulling like crazy he
[15:03] immediately became super stimulated in
[15:06] the new setting albeit just 30 meters
[15:08] away from where we just were this is
[15:10] clearly evidence that the progress he
[15:13] demonstrated earlier with his lease
[15:14] training has not been generalized to all
[15:18] or even most contexts sometimes when
[15:21] people see me a professional dog trainer
[15:23] with a dog pulling like this they think
[15:25] i should use a special training collar
[15:27] and deliver corrections in these moments
[15:29] it's worth briefly explaining why i
[15:31] don't use that strategy though i want to
[15:33] avoid creating a negative emotional
[15:35] response when he encounters other dogs
[15:36] like this when we're out and about later
[15:38] so instead my strategy is going to be to
[15:40] look for opportunities when he's
[15:41] succeeding and try to set him up to
[15:43] succeed and build momentum during those
[15:46] moments and the science seems to
[15:48] indicate that this is
[15:50] at least as fast if not faster so in the
[15:53] meantime when i do encounter dogs in the
[15:56] wild and he becomes overwhelmed and
[15:58] reacts to them i'm really gonna have to
[16:00] make sure that i manage him for now and
[16:02] if you're ever going to take your dog
[16:04] out into the real world you are
[16:05] guaranteed to encounter things that you
[16:08] can't control and speaking of which
[16:10] here's an example there are a couple of
[16:12] dogs that we encounter at pretty close
[16:14] range this can be a stressful
[16:16] challenging situation for you and your
[16:18] dogs
[16:20] actually doing really well
[16:22] i know these dogs and i know they're
[16:24] really friendly and they won't run into
[16:26] the street so my focus is completely on
[16:28] chop right now so my game plan is to
[16:30] manage him and quickly move him past the
[16:32] dogs while keeping him very secure my
[16:36] goal isn't to actually teach him how to
[16:38] behave in moments like this instead my
[16:41] goal is to reduce the odds of an
[16:42] exuberant outburst because chop is not
[16:45] yet prepared to act calmly in the
[16:47] presence of other dogs like this at
[16:49] least at this point in his training yeah
[16:51] we were just walking
[16:53] past
[16:54] our neighbor's house the dogs got
[16:56] excited and wanted to say hi and he was
[16:59] polling but he actually did pretty well
[17:01] considering how excited he typically
[17:03] gets by dogs but yeah he did not walk
[17:05] well on the way home to be expected i
[17:07] mean you got to do these lessons like we
[17:09] just did you have to do those a whole
[17:11] bunch now that chap has had all of that
[17:12] physical and mental stimulation i'm
[17:14] going to let him get some rest and we'll
[17:16] see how he does when we actually leave
[17:18] him alone for the first time gonna leave
[17:20] him with some water and see how he does
[17:23] i think he's gonna do pretty well for
[17:24] good measure i've closed these blinds
[17:27] over here uh and i have inertia in the
[17:30] bedroom over here so i'm trying to
[17:32] minimize distractions while we're gone
[17:35] so i just kind of wanted to be a boring
[17:36] quiet environment for him as we leave
[17:40] we're not gonna make a big deal out of
[17:41] anything we're just gonna walk out we're
[17:43] not trying to alert him or anything to
[17:44] the fact that we're leaving we're just
[17:45] gonna go so we stopped to grab some
[17:48] dinner real quick and
[17:51] i want to check on chop and see how he's
[17:53] doing
[17:54] thank you very much
[17:57] wow
[17:58] what a man look at him i can't i got it
[18:02] i know i know but
[18:05] i just have to give him a treat there
[18:07] guys
[18:10] hey that's how he likes to be woken up
[18:12] me too yeah exactly
[18:16] how good is he being good boy
[18:18] let's keep in
[18:22] free do not
[18:24] we were talking about
[18:26] how much we already love him
[18:28] so it's like here we go again he was
[18:30] doing so well when i was working with
[18:32] him on heel and he's starting to pick up
[18:34] sit all of a sudden as of this point of
[18:37] the filming of this we have not
[18:38] announced that indy has left us she went
[18:42] unexpectedly she had organ failure that
[18:45] came on very suddenly we actually
[18:47] monitored her blood um like every three
[18:50] months because i'm a very paranoid pet
[18:52] parent and so it was truly a sudden
[18:54] event but i'm happy for that uh in a way
[18:57] because i didn't want her to suffer
[18:59] either and she didn't but she's been
[19:01] really hard it's really hard to not have
[19:03] her here it's really hard to film this
[19:05] series without her
[19:07] it's really hard to not want to keep
[19:08] every dog i see too yeah i know
[19:11] it's been a tough time i say this
[19:13] because we have the benefit of inertia
[19:16] being able to have a friend to play with
[19:19] i mean i'm sure inertia misses indy
[19:22] so he is filling a certain void of
[19:24] course nothing compares to
[19:26] well i can tell inertia's been sad and i
[19:29] think she also can tell like i've been
[19:31] really really sad and i think she
[19:33] obviously knows that i'm just really sad
[19:36] i really miss indie you know losing a
[19:38] dog that you love is really hard
[19:41] it's tough man
[19:42] dogs are amazing
[19:44] so it's nice for her to have chop around
[19:46] and you guys know about the two dog rule
[19:48] and so zach's struggling a little bit
[19:50] now it really appears that he's just had
[19:52] no exposure to like
[19:54] a traditional pet life up until now and
[19:56] so there's all these things like today
[19:58] it really felt like chop started to
[20:00] understand that humans do a lot more
[20:03] than just bring him food and give him
[20:04] love like we can actually try to
[20:06] communicate with him and we can
[20:08] show him what we'd like him to do and
[20:09] then reward him when he does it and i
[20:12] feel like it was
[20:13] a cool light bulb moment for chop it was
[20:15] fun to watch it's not exactly exactly it
[20:18] i want to go see him we've been gone oh
[20:19] look i wanted to show you look at him
[20:21] still sleeping or is he just chilling
[20:23] he's chilling
[20:26] and now we've just gotten home he's
[20:28] being good i'm going to actually ignore
[20:30] them one of the ways that i like to
[20:31] prevent hyperactivity when you come home
[20:33] it's just by ignoring the dog for the
[20:35] first 5 10 15 minutes whatever no need
[20:38] to get them excited they're probably
[20:39] already a little extra excited
[20:41] so we'll just ignore them for a minute
[20:43] it's very hard though oh yeah then we go
[20:45] love them extra later absolutely
[20:47] chop's house training still needs work
[20:50] he will still lift his big old leg up
[20:53] and try and pee on some furniture when
[20:55] you're not looking i mean fact is he's
[20:57] been an outdoor dog until just the last
[21:00] three days of his life so i should be
[21:02] understanding of this so i've really got
[21:04] to do a better job of supervising him
[21:07] being one step ahead of him because
[21:09] potty accidents with him are like much
[21:12] more
[21:13] impactful so i have to really do a
[21:16] better job of letting him out for potty
[21:17] breaks often or let him hang out in a
[21:20] place where if he does have an accident
[21:22] it's very tolerable because you can just
[21:23] clean it up i mean our deck meets that
[21:25] criteria perfectly i mean my own dog
[21:27] inertia she spends hours out of time out
[21:29] there she loves the sunlight and just
[21:31] chilling and from what i've seen so far
[21:32] it seems like chop does too so now that
[21:34] he's had a potty break i'm gonna let him
[21:36] spend some time out on the deck while we
[21:37] keep an eye on him from the living room
[21:41] the single worst thing that has ever
[21:44] happened in my dog training career
[21:47] just happened
[21:48] as you guys know we've been using this
[21:50] back area to contain chop as an
[21:53] alternative to just having him in his
[21:54] crate or just having him walk around in
[21:56] here you know it's nice out there the
[21:58] weather's beautiful this time of year
[22:00] he's getting fresh air and for the first
[22:02] several days he's been doing really well
[22:04] out there so he's out there by himself
[22:06] but we have all these windows and one of
[22:09] us is always in theory keeping an eye on
[22:11] him i was sitting right here and then i
[22:13] looked back
[22:14] and i saw him jump up on the railing
[22:17] balancing there precariously and i tried
[22:20] to explain to him to stop but he wasn't
[22:22] able to regain his balance and he just
[22:25] plummeted
[22:26] it's one of the scariest sights i have
[22:29] ever seen in my life he appeared to be
[22:31] completely unscathed
[22:33] i mean he didn't so much as show a limp
[22:36] he immediately trotted over to the fence
[22:38] and peed fortunately the ground was very
[22:41] soft where he landed we're installing a
[22:43] lawn right now so we have like fresh
[22:45] topsoil i actually did extra topsoil
[22:47] because it was going to be softer for
[22:49] dogs when i eventually train out there
[22:51] for like when i'm doing fetch training i
[22:52] want a nice soft lawn for them so lucky
[22:56] we got so lucky we ran down there we got
[22:58] him i mean he was totally fine i'm not
[23:00] proud of the fact that this happened at
[23:02] all uh this was
[23:04] my fault it should have never happened
[23:07] we really wanted to share this with you
[23:08] because we wanted all of you to learn
[23:10] with us with this mistake here never
[23:13] underestimate how smart and determined
[23:16] dogs can be to push the limits they are
[23:18] an incredibly smart species and this is
[23:21] just a fresh reminder of that for us i'm
[23:24] glad he's okay it could have ended up a
[23:25] lot worse i just played with him and
[23:27] fortunately he's a pretty athletic guy
[23:29] but i will not let that happen again
[23:31] this is all the more reason that i have
[23:34] got to prioritize my training with him
[23:36] all of his basics say he had gotten out
[23:38] and he hadn't landed in the fence and he
[23:40] had landed on the other side of the
[23:41] fence and started running off i'm not
[23:43] certain that he would have come to me
[23:44] when i called him in fact i think he
[23:46] probably would not have he still could
[23:48] be like loose in the bear wilderness now
[23:50] there's like wolves out there coyotes
[23:53] bears wolverines porcupines definitely
[23:56] no people that will catch him i mean it
[23:58] was a nightmare no matter what the
[24:00] outcome it was a total nightmare he's a
[24:02] true escape artist though i mean we know
[24:04] that at his foster home before he came
[24:06] here he was staying in like this outdoor
[24:08] kennel area and he had dug underneath
[24:10] trying to potentially get out which
[24:12] makes sense for a dog who's born here he
[24:15] tries to dig at the fence out front but
[24:16] i'm always supervising him so i'm able
[24:18] to intervene to keep him from doing that
[24:21] just another reason to make sure that i
[24:23] can instill a strong recall and get all
[24:26] of his basics very tight and build that
[24:28] communication with him so that whoever
[24:30] ends up with him is going to end up with
[24:32] a dog

TRANSCRIPTION:

[00:00] we need to talk about our experience at
[00:03] the dog park today why do i keep finding
[00:05] myself
[00:06] saying that line in these series without
[00:09] intervention this could get out of
[00:10] control very easily
[00:13] [Music]
[00:14] this is chop he is a homeless wild
[00:17] alaskan dog and it's my job to train him
[00:19] and our job to find him home but it
[00:22] won't be without plenty of challenges
[00:27] this is reality dog training subscribe
[00:29] and click the bell so you never miss an
[00:32] episode
[00:33] good morning as you might imagine i'm
[00:35] about to let him out it is bright and
[00:37] early here in anchorage alaska his
[00:40] overnight
[00:41] manners or
[00:42] demeanor is so so good and i think that
[00:45] is in part because he's a great dog
[00:47] secondly we've been extremely consistent
[00:50] about giving him structure overnight
[00:52] controlling his environment but i still
[00:54] hope to make some progress on getting
[00:56] him to be a bit more adjusted inside the
[00:59] house he recently just had his first
[01:01] potty accident in the house for a
[01:03] grown-up dog we need to get that in
[01:05] check for sure one thing i can do though
[01:09] is to take him directly from that crate
[01:11] to outside and that is something we
[01:12] should do and we're potty training our
[01:13] dogs right the thing about house
[01:15] training a dog like chop is that you
[01:17] always have to be one step ahead of him
[01:19] and while this might seem obvious
[01:21] feeding chop on a regular schedule or
[01:23] any dog is going to definitely help with
[01:25] house training but i also know with some
[01:27] dogs if you give them their meal not all
[01:28] dogs will eat it instantly one hack that
[01:31] i've found to make sure that dogs gobble
[01:33] up their meal right away is to feed them
[01:35] extra delicious really good quality food
[01:38] there's just nothing quite like nom nom
[01:40] this food is actually made from
[01:42] restaurant quality ingredients and
[01:44] customized by a real veterinary
[01:46] nutritionist so that you're getting the
[01:48] best possible formula for your
[01:51] individual dog they even portion the
[01:53] food out perfectly for your dog too in
[01:55] individual packets it's literally
[01:57] portioned out to the individual calorie
[02:00] sometimes i can't resist taking a few of
[02:02] those calories for myself though if you
[02:04] want to try this food or even let your
[02:06] dog try it all of you can get 50 off of
[02:09] a two-week trial by going to my special
[02:11] link trinom.com
[02:13] zac i'll have a link below of course our
[02:15] dog inertia and chop are still working
[02:18] out their relationship so i do want to
[02:19] give them a chance to have a little bit
[02:21] of social time first thing in the
[02:22] morning and see how they do and by
[02:24] getting chopped to play and have some
[02:26] fun first thing in the morning i really
[02:28] think this will prime him for his
[02:29] overall training throughout the day easy
[02:31] buddy don't be too rough she's small
[02:34] hey
[02:35] too biggie
[02:38] easy
[02:40] she's
[02:41] and she's taking it though
[02:45] i mean my my
[02:46] concern with chop is he's bigger than he
[02:48] realizes
[02:49] as we've been bringing in foster dogs
[02:51] throughout inertia's life it's been
[02:53] giving her so many great experiences
[02:54] with different types of dogs inertia is
[02:56] becoming a different dog because of
[02:58] george and because of chop and all of
[03:00] these dogs that she's having great
[03:02] experiences with and it's so rewarding
[03:04] to see her gain this much confidence
[03:07] anybody who adopts chop is definitely
[03:10] absolutely a hundred percent going to
[03:12] have to vacuum all of the time
[03:14] as you might know dogs get thrown off
[03:17] and scared a whole bunch
[03:19] by the household vacuum cleaner and it's
[03:21] something that i like to be very
[03:23] purposeful with new dogs especially a
[03:25] dog like him who has such little
[03:26] experience being inside of a house like
[03:29] this he almost certainly has never seen
[03:31] a vacuum cleaner like this and has no
[03:33] idea what it is so i want to be very
[03:35] methodical in other words i don't want
[03:36] to wait for him to freak out over a
[03:38] vacuum cleaner and start barking and
[03:40] scratching at it to then try to fix that
[03:44] i want to be preemptive knowing that
[03:46] this could very well
[03:48] cause him a good amount of stress
[03:50] if he doesn't understand what it is so
[03:53] the first thing i want to do is just let
[03:55] him investigate the vacuum if he wants
[03:57] to i'm going to give him a treat really
[03:59] near it just to make sure he's
[04:00] comfortable let him smell it yes
[04:02] love how he's reacting you see how i
[04:04] haven't even turned it on yet i love
[04:06] doing this kind of training with dogs
[04:08] because it's a really good example of
[04:11] how you can take a bunch of small steps
[04:13] to make pretty dramatic progress in a
[04:16] short period of time i'm gonna let him
[04:17] know that it moves like this it goes
[04:20] back and forth in other words i want to
[04:22] be really sensitive to all of the things
[04:24] that might cause him to be nervous by it
[04:27] and now for the moment of truth let's
[04:29] see what happens
[04:32] good man i meant to just start it one
[04:33] time but i accidentally started it twice
[04:36] see how i didn't just turn it on and
[04:37] wait for him to start reacting i wanted
[04:39] to catch him succeeding i've had it on a
[04:42] total of two seconds and it's already
[04:44] like filled up with hair but you can see
[04:46] how he's intrigued by it
[04:49] look at that moving it a little bit
[04:52] good man so so far
[04:54] really great reaction and by the way if
[04:56] your dog was already super scared of the
[04:58] vacuum these are the steps you would do
[05:00] you would do the same thing but you
[05:02] might have to do it with your dog
[05:03] farther away or even behind a closed
[05:05] door at first and maybe you have someone
[05:07] help you along with it by treating them
[05:09] on the other side of the door
[05:12] good man
[05:16] yes
[05:17] let me see if i can treat him while the
[05:19] vacuum is on
[05:21] here
[05:23] yes
[05:24] he's a little like flinchy let's go
[05:26] ahead and turn that off i like to go at
[05:28] a dog's pace when i'm doing things like
[05:29] this you can see here that chop is free
[05:31] to walk away at any time and if he did
[05:33] that or anything else to indicate that
[05:35] he was feeling a little bit more anxious
[05:36] i want to notice things like that right
[05:38] away so that i can slow things down and
[05:40] keep them feeling comfortable this is
[05:41] really embarrassing breathe
[05:44] look how much hair
[05:47] is just on this rug so far
[05:52] and notice i'm not like going right at
[05:54] him at all i'll let him check it out yes
[06:01] here
[06:03] good
[06:04] so i'm also showing him how to behave in
[06:07] the presence of the vacuum
[06:10] in other words when he starts to
[06:11] approach it i'm trying to get him over
[06:13] here instead by the way this is the
[06:15] hoover high performance swivel xl
[06:17] pet
[06:18] edition
[06:19] talk about high performance that is so
[06:21] much hair yeah you did that
[06:25] are you proud of yourself thank goodness
[06:27] we live in an age though where you can
[06:29] have a hairy dog like this and fix the
[06:32] problem so that's cool
[06:34] at least it's easy to empty though i'm
[06:37] gonna have more information about this
[06:38] hoover in the description of this video
[06:40] and where you can get one
[06:45] my objective today is to teach chop how
[06:47] to stay for a period of time and with
[06:50] some distance and i'm going to introduce
[06:52] those separately we're kind of late in
[06:54] the game to be working on a basic stay i
[06:56] did work with him on stay at doorways he
[06:59] did really well with that but he has not
[07:02] generalized what stay means in a variety
[07:05] of contexts and settings i don't know
[07:08] about you guys but i get really weak
[07:11] need in places like this this is so high
[07:13] up and it's pretty much a straight cliff
[07:15] down there so
[07:17] i really will need to be careful
[07:19] about not letting chop go over the cliff
[07:21] the other benefit to training out here
[07:23] is that it's pretty secluded and there
[07:25] aren't very many distractions for some
[07:28] dogs simply being outside would be a
[07:30] huge distraction to them for him not so
[07:32] much he doesn't find this type of
[07:34] environment to be overwhelming remember
[07:35] he's spent his entire life outside so
[07:38] outside isn't that distracting to him
[07:40] it's only reasonable to allow chop and
[07:43] myself and maybe even you guys a second
[07:45] here to take in these surroundings
[07:47] because wow just look at this place oh
[07:50] you want to play with the ball don't you
[07:52] i suspect he wants the ball
[07:54] but i feel like he's pretty adjusted
[07:55] here i mean he's still a little
[07:56] distracted let's see how it goes i'm
[07:58] going to start with a stand stay right
[07:59] now because he's really comfortable in a
[08:01] stand let's start off uh with some
[08:03] warm-up exercises
[08:04] chop here yes
[08:08] he'll get better with those catches over
[08:09] time here right now i'm just simply
[08:12] making sure that i get his attention on
[08:14] me
[08:14] and so now i just want to go for a one
[08:17] second stay here
[08:22] yes i don't really mind the backing up
[08:24] so much the fact is he's focused on me
[08:26] he's not running off we can fine-tune
[08:28] the stay later let's teach him what the
[08:30] word stay means stay
[08:34] yes
[08:37] good boy one of the reasons this is a
[08:39] great place to train is that it's pretty
[08:41] secluded and there actually aren't many
[08:43] distractions like cars or pedestrians or
[08:46] other dogs even the local wildlife
[08:48] mostly stays down the mountain a bit so
[08:51] finding low traffic areas like this is
[08:53] going to be a key part of me training
[08:56] chop before we test him in more tempting
[08:59] locations now let's teach him what the
[09:01] hand signal means
[09:03] yes
[09:04] i mean right there i just caught him
[09:06] staying i don't know that he was
[09:07] intentionally doing anything so while
[09:09] i'm training chop to stay really is
[09:12] about catching him succeeding even if he
[09:14] can only stay for a micro second at
[09:16] first that's okay with me because that's
[09:18] a success my attitude is if i have to
[09:21] work up to four microseconds over the
[09:23] next four months so be it don't worry
[09:25] though it won't take that long here
[09:28] stay
[09:31] yes that was a really long one really
[09:34] good eye contact there so i'm thrilled
[09:37] with that let's move on to teaching him
[09:39] how to stay while i walk away this is
[09:40] going to be harder stay
[09:43] ah
[09:44] see how he wants to close the distance
[09:46] between us it's understandable for dogs
[09:48] to be confused by this concept at first
[09:50] most dogs really love to follow us
[09:53] everywhere so it makes sense
[09:57] yes
[09:58] he started to walk forward he corrected
[09:59] himself a bit there so i'll take that
[10:01] he's trying look at me
[10:04] yes
[10:06] that time i wanted to make it easier i
[10:07] just took a step a foot back let go
[10:11] here
[10:12] [Music]
[10:13] yes
[10:14] good
[10:15] so notice the distance at first it's
[10:17] pretty insignificant i'm just moving
[10:19] inches away from him that's how we can
[10:21] focus on setting our dogs up for success
[10:23] and then if we slowly build on that
[10:25] before you know it you're at 6 10 20 or
[10:27] more feet here stay
[10:31] yes
[10:32] good really good example right there
[10:34] okay hand signal now
[10:39] yes
[10:40] okay
[10:43] way to not flinch bree thumbs up for
[10:44] brie that was pretty slick from my
[10:47] perspective back up good
[10:49] stay
[10:53] yes
[10:54] okay he's really good on that okay isn't
[10:57] he
[10:57] he seems to really understand that so
[11:00] we've done stay for a period of time
[11:02] we've done stay with a little bit of
[11:03] distance i feel like he's understanding
[11:05] the concept of stay somewhat i need to
[11:07] practice this a lot but if you take
[11:09] nothing else from this keep it easy for
[11:11] your dog and they'll learn fast chop and
[11:14] inertia are really getting to know each
[11:16] other very well here and they're getting
[11:18] much more confident about playing
[11:20] together everywhere including my living
[11:22] room but just because dogs play well a
[11:24] handful of times doesn't mean that
[11:26] you're completely out of the woods and
[11:28] they're gonna get along forever and
[11:29] everything is perfect so i'm gonna
[11:31] continue to supervise them thoroughly
[11:33] and make sure that i step in before play
[11:35] accelerates to a point where it could
[11:37] potentially cause a conflict between the
[11:39] two dogs or at least i'll do my best
[11:43] and this is a great example of what i'm
[11:45] talking about here inertia is just a
[11:47] little startled by falling here and i
[11:49] think she probably needs a break right
[11:51] here to recover emotionally from being
[11:52] frightened so i'm going to step in and
[11:54] make sure that chop gives inertia the
[11:57] space she requires this is the kind of
[11:59] incident that can escalate with some
[12:01] dogs if you're not paying attention and
[12:03] you're not right there to intervene and
[12:05] so by giving these dogs lots of
[12:06] opportunities to interact with each
[12:08] other in short periods of time allowing
[12:10] them to take a break and then resume
[12:12] playing i'm hopeful this will be
[12:14] successful a little while later brie was
[12:16] out with the dogs and she caught
[12:17] something on camera
[12:19] that she thought i needed to see it
[12:21] looked to me like he got protective of a
[12:23] toy
[12:26] okay
[12:28] so i showed it to zach what did you
[12:30] think well uh yeah i agree with you he
[12:32] was protected but it seems like
[12:35] playful
[12:37] selfishness at first i was really
[12:39] nervous because he's so big and you know
[12:41] i just don't want to take any chances
[12:43] but every time he does it he like
[12:44] pounces on the toy and then inertia goes
[12:47] to another and then he'll pounce on that
[12:48] one
[12:49] seems more bratty right yes
[12:54] that scene is more brandy hey brat
[12:57] i'm not too concerned about it because i
[12:59] mean i've seen a lot of this stuff
[13:00] before it's really how dogs communicate
[13:02] with each other and if you can get in
[13:04] there and build some communication with
[13:06] them so you can be like you can do this
[13:08] but you can't do that then i think we'll
[13:10] be okay but you never know i mean
[13:11] sometimes those are signs that there are
[13:14] other issues that could escalate and
[13:16] that's the last thing we want so
[13:19] i'm hoping it's going to be a textbook
[13:21] case of resolving resource guarding it's
[13:23] not a funny topic but i was smiling
[13:25] while you were saying that because i was
[13:26] thinking about how
[13:28] chop now that i've gotten to know him
[13:31] intimidates me so much less than
[13:35] pancake whoa dude chill or tiberius you
[13:38] can't do that what are you doing and
[13:40] they are two of the cutest dogs on this
[13:43] earth and yet i was way more scared of
[13:45] them than i am of this guy but you're
[13:46] right i still want to be careful
[13:49] how did you get that our garbage goes
[13:52] under the counter and i guess it wasn't
[13:54] closed all the way he's a smart guy i
[13:56] watched him try to open it yesterday and
[13:58] he wasn't just like randomly digging at
[14:00] the cabinet like he went for the handle
[14:02] where we grab it and like gently tried
[14:04] to figure out leverage just you stinker
[14:07] i'm gonna have to develop a strategy as
[14:09] to how to handle that my plan for the
[14:11] immediate future is to just do a good
[14:13] job of managing resources like toys or
[14:16] bones things like that when he and
[14:18] inertia are together i'm going to be
[14:20] very vigilant in my supervision and
[14:22] otherwise yes
[14:24] i think it's time that we go
[14:27] practice around other dogs to see if we
[14:29] can make progress on his conduct you
[14:32] might remember not too long ago when i
[14:33] took chop out in public we definitely
[14:36] had some issues he was crazy every time
[14:39] he saw a dog i'm hoping to get some
[14:41] energy out of him because i still want
[14:43] to go practice in a more distracting
[14:45] environment than this but i want to set
[14:47] them up for success so trying to give
[14:49] them some good exercise before that just
[14:51] thinking about how important just having
[14:53] your dog's attention is and how that's
[14:55] probably 90 plus percent of dog training
[14:58] and when you teach them
[15:01] obedience or tricks or just how to
[15:03] generally listen to you it's kind of a
[15:04] measure of how well you're able to hold
[15:07] their attention chop come on let's go
[15:10] come on there we go good
[15:13] nice and timely there thank you for
[15:15] almost listening
[15:17] come on let's go buddy
[15:19] something i like to do is get into a big
[15:20] field like this throw the lead on them
[15:22] just kind of walk aimlessly
[15:24] let them smell wander a little bit get
[15:27] that fixation out desensitize them to
[15:29] the world be fair to him let him explore
[15:32] on his terms a little bit
[15:33] you have to meet them halfway and let
[15:35] them do what they love doing too it's
[15:37] such a wet day look at that
[15:39] and when you're training a dog you have
[15:41] to get out in conditions like this just
[15:42] because it's a little wet outside
[15:44] doesn't mean you don't train so having
[15:46] the right gear is important these shoes
[15:48] have been incredible they're completely
[15:50] waterproof which is insane that foot is
[15:53] completely dry
[15:54] there you go see that there's hair on
[15:57] them and they're a little dirty
[15:59] but
[16:01] they're not wet and look at this
[16:04] slip right back on it's the best vessies
[16:06] seem to have invented magic shoes there
[16:08] are now two mysteries i have on earth
[16:10] number one how do eels procreate
[16:13] secondly how do vesis keep your feet dry
[16:17] i'll have a link and discount code in
[16:19] the description where you can go and get
[16:21] your pair of bessies
[16:23] we need to talk about
[16:26] our experience at the dog park today why
[16:28] do i keep finding myself
[16:30] saying that line in these series i
[16:32] really thought i had built enough
[16:35] communication with him going into that
[16:37] training lesson i thought i would have
[16:39] better results than i did the thing is
[16:41] sometimes my job is just downright hard
[16:43] it really is sometimes it's hard to get
[16:46] a dog not to bark at lunch at a dog when
[16:48] they're excited by a dog today we're
[16:50] gonna go train around lots of different
[16:53] dogs the catch is chop won't be engaging
[16:56] or playing with any of them we're going
[16:58] out to a dog park but we're gonna stay
[17:00] outside of the dog park my goal will be
[17:03] to see if i can somehow get his
[17:05] attention on me when there are dogs
[17:07] close by
[17:08] i mean when he sees dogs he is like i've
[17:11] got to get to them geez and right away
[17:14] we have an adorable dog coming up to
[17:16] check us out here
[17:19] yeah very distracted as you can see
[17:23] that's okay i'm just gonna let him
[17:24] observe these dogs for a little while
[17:26] before i try to train him and like with
[17:29] many dogs chop is so stimulated in this
[17:32] new place that he's not interested in
[17:34] treats and he's not interested in toys
[17:37] the plan is for this to change as we
[17:39] give him more experiences in places like
[17:42] this
[17:43] over
[17:44] time so okay he was doing all right at
[17:48] this distance for a little bit but now
[17:50] he's had enough of just looking at these
[17:52] dogs and it seems like he really just
[17:54] wants to play with them so right now
[17:56] he's just frustrated here and he just
[17:58] wants to play that's exactly the issue
[18:01] if he's out taking a walk with somebody
[18:03] and they encounter a dog we can't have
[18:05] him think oh
[18:06] when i see dogs i get to run up to them
[18:08] and play with them i'm going to increase
[18:10] our distance from these dogs the thing
[18:12] that he's finding very enticing and
[18:14] exciting since chop seems to be a little
[18:17] over threshold here remember that's
[18:18] where he's too excited to pay attention
[18:20] to me because he's so interested in his
[18:23] surroundings chop
[18:25] there are so many people watching this
[18:27] right now can you just please pay
[18:29] attention to me there can be a certain
[18:31] level of anxiety when your dog is
[18:34] causing a scene in public people that
[18:36] have reactive dogs i mean i feel like
[18:39] they have to know what you're talking
[18:40] about yes i have i know what you're
[18:42] talking about i have a reactive dog i
[18:43] mean you know i've had to work through
[18:45] that for me when indy was younger she
[18:48] was very reactive to other dogs out in
[18:50] public and i always felt so alone
[18:53] but i think it's just because you spend
[18:55] all your time running away from everyone
[18:57] else that you see so like even if there
[18:59] is someone who understands your plight
[19:01] you're busy trying to get two blocks
[19:03] away from them because your dog's gonna
[19:05] bark at them so it's a it's a lonely
[19:07] endeavor sometimes to train a reactive
[19:09] dog i feel like especially in the
[19:10] beginning part of it yeah but not for
[19:12] you because you have a lot of friends
[19:14] watching you so that's nice yeah that's
[19:16] delightful so now we're backed up all
[19:17] the way to the woods here we can't get
[19:19] much farther away than this and chop is
[19:22] still reacting in my experience creating
[19:25] distance from these other dogs plus
[19:28] giving chop time to observe them should
[19:31] equal chop being able to summon a little
[19:33] bit more self-control clearly we have a
[19:36] little ways to go though this is a
[19:38] really important point here i don't need
[19:40] to scold chalk for this behavior and
[19:42] that's for a number of different reasons
[19:44] for one thing he's not open-minded to
[19:46] learning complex skills like ignoring
[19:49] other dogs when he's overwhelmed like
[19:50] this also even though i'm not scolding
[19:53] him there is still a consequence in his
[19:56] mind or hopefully for this outburst he
[19:58] is being taken farther away from the
[20:00] thing that he's interested in right now
[20:02] ideally i'm trying to compensate for the
[20:04] error that i made here by trying to find
[20:06] the ideal distance where chop is able to
[20:09] pay attention to me so we've moved over
[20:11] here we're very far away this has
[20:13] quickly evolved into a screensaver
[20:17] training session here
[20:18] my hope was that i i would be able to be
[20:20] you know 10 or 20 yards away from the
[20:23] dogs and i'd be able to focus on getting
[20:24] his attention on me and doing some leash
[20:26] training but he was way over threshold
[20:29] pretty instantaneously when i was giving
[20:31] him that initial exposure to those dogs
[20:33] behind the fence but let's keep things
[20:35] in context this is literally his second
[20:37] time in a park-like setting where there
[20:39] are dogs you remember last time we made
[20:41] a lot of progress we sat there for a
[20:43] good while close to three hours if i'm
[20:45] not mistaken to let him like take it in
[20:48] and then intermittently he would be
[20:49] responsive right now i can live with
[20:52] this behavior because you see how he's
[20:54] not just fixating on the dogs he's
[20:55] looking at the traffic over here sitting
[20:58] down
[20:59] leaning on me more suggesting that he's
[21:01] semi-relaxed getting him calmed down
[21:06] is going to hopefully
[21:07] set us up here but this is a sign that
[21:09] he's adapting and he's not
[21:11] too over threshold right now but if you
[21:13] think back to a few minutes ago when he
[21:15] was inconsolable impossible to
[21:17] communicate with i can understand why so
[21:20] many people would be discouraged and say
[21:22] their dog is stubborn or my dog will not
[21:24] pay attention to me around other dogs
[21:28] i think what a lot of people don't
[21:29] realize is that the cure is a little bit
[21:31] of patience
[21:33] and being flexible on your game plan now
[21:35] the catch is you have to do this over a
[21:37] prolonged period of time with most dogs
[21:40] the steps aren't particularly
[21:41] complicated it's just letting your dog
[21:43] observe things and let those things
[21:45] become normal to them i mean if you
[21:48] spend enough time around something it
[21:49] all becomes normal that's probably the
[21:51] missing ingredient i think that most
[21:53] people are lacking when it comes to
[21:55] resolving issues like this i talk about
[21:57] that in both of my books by the way
[22:00] links below
[22:01] ah look at this there we go a nice
[22:03] natural settle do you see that
[22:06] so he finally you know a sign that he's
[22:08] calming down which is
[22:10] good there we go that's it first ball
[22:14] grab of the training session so that's a
[22:16] sign that things are getting a little
[22:18] more normalized you might wonder whether
[22:20] trying to get chopped to play with this
[22:22] ball is counterproductive since we're
[22:24] also trying to get him to stay calm
[22:25] around exciting things but if he's
[22:27] definitely going to be excited i'd much
[22:30] rather channel that excitement into
[22:32] something more productive like paying
[22:34] attention to me and this ball when he
[22:36] starts to show interest in a toy that i
[22:38] know he loves at home i think that's
[22:40] probably an indicator that he's starting
[22:42] to adjust to the excitement around him
[22:44] in my mind i was like man what are we
[22:46] gonna do i don't think he's going to pay
[22:48] attention at all because i couldn't get
[22:50] his attention on me i couldn't get him
[22:51] interested in his favorite toy he wasn't
[22:53] taking treats all he wanted to do is
[22:55] focus on those dogs we come over here we
[22:57] chill out for a little bit i don't know
[22:59] 15 minutes or so and he's kind of
[23:02] relaxed a little enough to get back into
[23:04] kind of our normal way of training now
[23:06] the chop is doing a little bit better i
[23:08] want to test again and see if we can get
[23:10] a little bit closer to those dogs chop
[23:12] over here
[23:14] let's go back see that little
[23:16] vocalization tells me all right i need
[23:18] to get back here because
[23:20] that's likely to just continue to get
[23:21] worse and worse and then i've taken a
[23:23] step back so maybe i'll hang out right
[23:25] here we're still quite far away from the
[23:27] other dogs and i think that we're right
[23:29] on the cusp right on that borderline so
[23:32] i'm hopeful that he'll calm down and
[23:34] observe them
[23:35] leash not lunging towards them that's
[23:36] what i'm choosing
[23:39] was choosing to call a success but i
[23:42] guess you could make a case that i
[23:43] probably need to go farther back but my
[23:45] gut's telling me will probably be okay
[23:48] here if we just give it a few things
[23:50] like that automatic sit lying down
[23:53] patiently and politely observing
[23:57] it's exactly the kind of body language
[23:59] that i'm looking for out of it this is
[24:01] the formula no shortcuts folks i'm going
[24:03] to walk around a little bit just in this
[24:05] area seeing how compliant he is now my
[24:07] hypothesis is supported here that we're
[24:09] right at the line because when we walk
[24:11] towards the dogs look how uninterested
[24:13] he is
[24:14] come here yeah good man
[24:16] that's it so i'm loving that i can get
[24:19] him to go away from the direction of the
[24:21] other dogs
[24:23] good man do you want this yes
[24:25] ah
[24:26] how about that
[24:28] may not look like much but we were
[24:30] walking towards the dogs and he was
[24:32] receptive to taking the reward if he's
[24:34] receptive to taking the reward then the
[24:36] idea is that i can motivate him to
[24:39] behave a certain way if he's willing to
[24:41] find enjoyment in that reward alright
[24:43] chop is now starting to like the ball
[24:45] again it's normal for dogs moods and
[24:47] desires to shift throughout a training
[24:49] session so really aiming to be in sync
[24:51] with them is a goal of hours when we're
[24:54] training a dog and look how much closer
[24:56] to the other dogs we are now i'm telling
[24:59] you time a little bit of patience can be
[25:02] a dog trainer's best friend sit
[25:05] yes
[25:06] i'm trying to heavily reinforce that sit
[25:08] because he's really struggled with it
[25:10] today we're getting good sits getting
[25:12] chopped to pay attention to me and look
[25:14] up to me for direction is something that
[25:15] i want him doing regularly and often in
[25:19] all environments so this might be a good
[25:21] opportunity to practice around these
[25:23] guys this is a major level up in
[25:25] difficulty for chop see if we can get
[25:28] back to normal training where he's
[25:29] focused on my eyes instead of the ball
[25:31] remember at home
[25:33] yes
[25:34] he does that really well and right now
[25:36] he's doing it really well
[25:38] so we're seeing quite a turnaround at
[25:40] the moment
[25:41] here
[25:43] good yes
[25:45] rewarding intermittently trying to get
[25:46] several steps in
[25:48] and then seal in that good behavior by
[25:50] giving him a reward
[25:53] something he values
[25:55] yes
[25:57] choosing to reward that sit 95 plus
[26:00] percent of the time right now
[26:03] yeah buddy good job
[26:06] good job and so really the reward here
[26:10] is continued access to observing the
[26:13] dogs here he's behaving politely
[26:15] he can look at the dogs when he when
[26:17] he's not we're going to continue to get
[26:19] him farther away good man here
[26:23] good recovery chop sit
[26:26] good man
[26:29] as a reminder you'll notice i'm saying
[26:31] good to let him know he's on the right
[26:32] track and i'm saying yes to let him know
[26:34] when he's earned a reward i would love
[26:36] to be able to get his eyes on me and
[26:38] walk away come on
[26:42] doesn't take much to make me happy
[26:43] that's what i've been working for this
[26:45] entire afternoon look at me with dogs
[26:47] nearby and let's walk away without me
[26:49] having to escort him away you know
[26:51] sometimes you have days where your dog
[26:53] just is learning so fast and making so
[26:56] much progress and you have other days
[26:58] that don't go so well you have days like
[27:00] this where you get some success but you
[27:02] really have to earn it but he's still
[27:04] pulling on the leash i'm not gonna hold
[27:06] him to the bar of perfection right now
[27:08] there's so much give and take choose to
[27:10] be happy with small bits of success
[27:13] especially in the beginning you guys
[27:15] know that saying it gets worse before it
[27:17] gets better well i'm not saying that
[27:19] that's accurate to this series but i'm
[27:21] not saying it's not accurate either

TRANSCRIPTION:

[00:01] live i'm genuinely
[00:03] nervous about being live i hope my audio
[00:05] is okay hopefully someone will let me
[00:06] know if you can hear me i'm wearing a
[00:08] mic so i'm solo today
[00:10] um wow it's been so long since i've done
[00:13] a live here we actually have three
[00:16] videos coming out in the next seven days
[00:18] we just posted one today so actually
[00:20] it's a total of four videos
[00:22] in a like i guess eight day time frame
[00:24] that's nuts hi guys how are you
[00:27] it's really good to see you here awesome
[00:32] okay i'm going on lte it looks like
[00:34] because i lost my connection maybe i'm
[00:36] too far away from the house
[00:37] so
[00:40] it's great
[00:41] to be back here in new orleans you can
[00:43] see we're not in alaska right now we
[00:45] just got back
[00:47] to new orleans and we're here and i'm
[00:50] wearing shorts look at that more than
[00:52] you probably wanted to see but i haven't
[00:54] worn shorts in months
[00:56] so it's so cool
[00:59] hi anchorage alaska puppy power party
[01:01] yeah i mean so for those of you not
[01:03] following anchorage is where we spend
[01:05] our time
[01:07] in the summer though we stayed a little
[01:08] bit
[01:09] longer this year than normal just
[01:11] because we were having a good time until
[01:13] there was like three feet of snow on the
[01:14] ground which is gorgeous it's really
[01:16] pretty i'm just
[01:17] not tough enough alaskans are the
[01:19] toughest people in the world they're so
[01:21] resilient they have
[01:23] great character and i strive to be
[01:26] half as
[01:28] good
[01:30] so
[01:30] you guys can hear me right presumably
[01:33] see i'm wearing a microphone
[01:35] i'll wait for confirmation oops
[01:40] i love the questions about chop i'm
[01:41] gonna get to chop in a second because i
[01:43] do want to talk about chop and i want to
[01:46] talk about this series
[01:47] great okay glad you guys can hear me
[01:50] i've gotten confirmation
[01:54] so yeah i mean okay
[01:57] we just put out a video today with chop
[01:59] as you can see where we're working on
[02:01] leash walking i think it's probably
[02:04] the most realistic leash training
[02:06] session
[02:08] i've done in a long time so i think it's
[02:09] a really good one if your dog pulls i
[02:11] want to make sure that you guys
[02:12] definitely see that
[02:15] from god i'm sorry i'm getting
[02:17] distracted by the comments and i am
[02:18] going to look at those but yeah chop is
[02:20] just doing incredible in the series
[02:23] right now i see you guys asking where he
[02:25] is i'm not giving any spoilers to the
[02:26] series because there are so many twists
[02:28] and turns in this one
[02:30] it's amazing like
[02:33] when you start a series like this you
[02:34] think okay we're gonna run through some
[02:36] training get him ready for his new home
[02:38] and you can just never anticipate all of
[02:41] the other things that go on around that
[02:44] and to me that is by far the most
[02:46] interesting part of doing a series like
[02:48] this because
[02:50] adjusting to the dog and really
[02:55] really
[02:56] learning about how each dog learns and
[02:59] understands you
[03:01] like today's video for example we were
[03:03] going over lie down and you could see
[03:05] luring him into a lie down it just
[03:06] wasn't working at all
[03:09] um
[03:10] and so you can see how we brainstormed
[03:12] in that but that was
[03:13] i think the most interesting how to
[03:15] train a dog to lie down training session
[03:17] i've ever had in a video
[03:24] i'm so touched by how many people are
[03:26] here this is great i'm really glad that
[03:28] you guys are here i don't usually go
[03:30] live on youtube uh usually i go live on
[03:32] instagram and i'm gonna probably start
[03:34] going live on tik tok more
[03:36] because tick tock's pretty cool
[03:39] we've been putting out a lot of content
[03:41] on tick tock lately so go check us out
[03:43] over there i think i'm vezak george i'm
[03:45] sure you can find me pretty easily
[03:47] over there
[03:49] i'm seeing this question from colby
[03:50] brown what do i think of vislez
[03:53] diesels are awesome man
[03:55] i mean all dogs are awesome but yeah i
[03:57] have
[03:58] vessels my kind of dog because they're
[04:00] stereotypically pretty athletic uh
[04:02] intelligent
[04:03] things like that i i like them
[04:06] if i were stereotyping but
[04:10] so anyway
[04:12] yeah so we have three videos coming out
[04:14] between now and next sunday four if you
[04:17] count today
[04:19] so we have a lot of busy st i mean our
[04:21] channel is going to be pretty busy over
[04:22] the coming weeks
[04:26] okay yeah those are my main notes that i
[04:27] want to get across uh for here so i just
[04:30] really felt the need to connect with you
[04:31] as a creator who's been doing this
[04:35] nothing matters more to brie and i
[04:38] than than our audience you guys are our
[04:40] family and we always want to make sure
[04:42] we're accessible and
[04:43] we
[04:44] make ourselves available to you although
[04:46] bree is doing like i said we had so many
[04:48] videos coming out so she's inside doing
[04:50] producer stuff getting those videos
[04:52] ready with our editor tristan who's been
[04:53] amazing
[04:55] do i have any live dog training classes
[04:58] that i endorse in new orleans
[05:00] oh gosh actually yes our plus dog
[05:03] yes i usually don't know a lot of
[05:05] individual trainers
[05:07] in the many cities but since i live in
[05:09] new orleans i think she's great you
[05:11] actually saw some of her class in the
[05:13] inertia series because i took inertia
[05:15] through puppy socialization and beginner
[05:17] class for the experience and you know to
[05:19] get
[05:20] experience from other dog trainers i
[05:21] mean that never gets old when you're a
[05:23] trainer you love to hear how different
[05:25] people go about things and i was very
[05:26] impressed by art bless so
[05:29] our plus dog
[05:31] jeanette
[05:36] oh man so many questions how am i going
[05:38] to keep up i can't read this fast am i
[05:40] fully moving to alaska i'm glad you
[05:42] asked that question i've noticed that a
[05:43] lot i thought i made it clear but
[05:45] obviously i haven't
[05:46] so yeah we split our time brie and i
[05:48] between three different cities i'm
[05:50] currently in new orleans that's one my
[05:51] hometown is atlanta that's two
[05:54] and brie's hometown is anchorage alaska
[05:56] pretty cool awesome place right
[05:58] so that's three so we just kind of
[06:00] rotate
[06:01] between those places that's the current
[06:03] experiment we're trying it seeing how we
[06:04] like it
[06:05] excuse me
[06:08] i think i have allergies in new orleans
[06:09] but i think they're under control i took
[06:12] allergy medication a moment ago
[06:14] um
[06:16] oh goodness goodness you guys are
[06:19] awesome um
[06:21] and no need for the super chats or
[06:23] whatever don't give me money today i
[06:25] appreciate that though it's very nice
[06:27] for those of you that have but
[06:29] i'm requesting that you not do that i'm
[06:31] just here to talk to you guys uh have i
[06:34] thought about making a series with a
[06:35] rescue greyhound yes we have that's
[06:37] actually on our probably top five
[06:40] ideas for series moving forward because
[06:42] we're trying to give these series a
[06:44] different feel each one we don't just
[06:45] want to do the same thing over and over
[06:47] um
[06:49] let me get back to them from there
[06:51] so
[06:52] yeah we are considering that um
[06:56] i like the idea greyhounds are a really
[06:58] neat
[06:59] neat
[07:01] dog very dynamic very unique relative to
[07:04] other dog breeds
[07:07] in many ways in other ways not so much i
[07:08] mean you know so just depends
[07:14] i see okay oh man
[07:18] give me a second to read these
[07:20] that's why normally i have bri here
[07:21] because she's like a speed reader she
[07:22] can just like read so quick
[07:26] oh can i explain how 30 day perfect pup
[07:28] works with um pupford absolutely
[07:31] i can
[07:33] so 30 day perfect pup is basically uh
[07:36] some videos that we put together with
[07:38] with puppet and they have distilled them
[07:41] into
[07:42] a daily training regimen that you can
[07:43] follow along with study guides and
[07:45] everything like that and it's completely
[07:47] free
[07:48] puppet is a sponsor of of our channel
[07:50] and so that's you know one of the things
[07:52] we agreed to do and
[07:56] i
[07:57] have been so satisfied with your
[07:59] satisfaction of 30-day perfect pup
[08:02] because you never know how it's going to
[08:03] go because you're used to doing things
[08:04] on youtube and
[08:06] if you're me
[08:08] and so when you do a training program on
[08:10] a
[08:11] a way like that who you did not need to
[08:13] give me fifty dollars i said don't give
[08:15] me money thank you very much
[08:17] i appreciate that mo ow
[08:22] keep chop please he said
[08:25] you will find out chop's future
[08:28] in this series
[08:30] oh gosh i don't even know where i was
[08:32] now i got so distracted
[08:34] but that was very nice
[08:38] thank you james i appreciate the super
[08:41] chat it's very nice
[08:46] uh i completely forgot where i was oh
[08:48] yeah puffer thanks okay that's why you
[08:50] guys are great so anyway it's been a
[08:52] huge success because i would say like at
[08:54] least 50 percent of the time when i do
[08:56] get recognized in public which you know
[08:58] happens here and there
[09:00] it's because of puppet it really is
[09:02] people love that they'll be like i'm
[09:04] taking your 30 day perfect pup so i
[09:05] think that's really neat
[09:12] what kind of leash would i suggest
[09:14] that's really personal preference i mean
[09:16] a good one one that you can grip easily
[09:18] one that
[09:19] attaches very securely
[09:23] sometimes i mean okay so my
[09:26] what i think is very important about
[09:27] leashes there are many things that are
[09:29] important about leashes but one thing
[09:30] that i like to consider is the length
[09:33] so i like if you're in a position to buy
[09:36] several leashes if it's within your
[09:38] budget um having like a six foot leash a
[09:41] four foot leash uh maybe it's a ten foot
[09:43] leash can be real i love ten foot's
[09:45] probably my favorite training leash six
[09:48] foot's probably my favorite walking
[09:49] leash
[09:52] excuse me a 20 or 30 foot is my favorite
[09:54] long lead for playing fetch and doing
[09:56] more distance training
[09:58] um i've been impressed with the biothane
[10:00] this like plasticky material of the long
[10:03] leads because that's the problem with
[10:05] long leads they get really grungy and
[10:06] gross quick
[10:07] so
[10:08] you can probably you can find those
[10:10] products on amazon or wherever you get
[10:12] dog supplies
[10:14] but i think having a variety of lengths
[10:16] for specific training plans is a good
[10:19] idea
[10:23] um have i tried google
[10:27] any suggestions on border collie rabbit
[10:29] chasing
[10:31] i mean you know teaching your dog
[10:33] redirecting their attention to you being
[10:35] really consistent about that going out
[10:36] of your way to reinforce them when they
[10:38] do pay attention
[10:40] having the proper mindset and
[10:41] understanding that it can take a while
[10:43] making sure that you're controlling your
[10:44] dog's environment all those things are
[10:46] critical i talk a lot about i know
[10:48] that's a lot to digest in a lie but
[10:50] i would check out my second book if i
[10:52] were you or youtube videos where i
[10:53] demonstrate it for free
[10:56] to really get the breakdown of how to
[10:58] deal with reactive behavior or your dog
[11:00] running away or not listening at all and
[11:02] things like that
[11:09] wow
[11:13] can we have a george update he's the
[11:15] love of my life oh my gosh george the
[11:17] pit bull
[11:18] he yeah i mean i gotta tell you and chop
[11:21] two i mean these dogs
[11:24] steal your heart so quickly
[11:26] something about big strong
[11:28] smart dogs that just warm your heart
[11:31] actually all dogs warm your heart
[11:35] do i fly my dogs to alaska well we drove
[11:37] up and we flew back
[11:39] so yeah i traveled
[11:41] both
[11:42] ways with them which was interesting
[11:44] because i don't typically fly
[11:46] or in the past i've been a little
[11:47] uncomfortable with flying uh dogs not so
[11:49] much anymore though i'm pretty confident
[11:51] at least with my dog inertia she's very
[11:53] tolerant in those environments she zones
[11:56] out and when i was thinking about it it
[11:58] was like i could drive to when we drove
[12:00] to alaska it took about eight days of
[12:01] driving and she was in the crate eight
[12:03] hours a day
[12:04] as we drove and
[12:06] you know she was fine
[12:09] she seemed to be fine on the airplane
[12:11] didn't seem to stress too much she was a
[12:13] little anxious when
[12:14] um we dropped her off but she seemed to
[12:16] recover quite well from what i could see
[12:18] so yeah
[12:20] she was in a pressurized climate
[12:22] controlled environment we flew her under
[12:24] the plane but we made sure that she was
[12:26] in the proper environment um so it's the
[12:29] same conditions as the cabin and i think
[12:31] she she's the kind of dog that would
[12:32] almost prefer that because she's in her
[12:34] crate she's got her space
[12:36] she likes to sleep when there's that
[12:38] slow steady
[12:40] rumble of the plane so
[12:42] yeah
[12:47] uh let's see here what do we got here
[12:50] opinion on prong collars i mean i don't
[12:52] use prong collars um
[12:54] i don't think
[12:57] it doesn't matter what i think the
[12:58] science seems to indicate they're
[13:00] unnecessary for training if you look at
[13:02] the
[13:03] current advisement from absab and other
[13:05] similar organizations around the world
[13:08] they
[13:09] prong collars appear to be unnecessary
[13:10] so if they're unnecessary according
[13:14] to people who study this topic even a
[13:17] lot more than i do then i have to
[13:19] consider that because it's also been my
[13:21] experience that i haven't found an
[13:22] occasion where i've deemed them
[13:24] necessary other people have and i mean
[13:27] that's the big debate in dog training
[13:30] there are politics in dog training it
[13:32] seems that there shouldn't be i try to
[13:33] stay clear of that i just try to look at
[13:35] the science and
[13:36] um
[13:37] of course i have to balance that with my
[13:39] experience as well
[13:41] and try to do as well as i guess that's
[13:42] all any of us can do isn't it and
[13:47] i train bird dogs they are necessary so
[13:49] yeah you see i mean a lot of people a
[13:50] lot of people do find them very
[13:52] necessary
[13:54] and i haven't worked with hunting dogs
[13:56] in that capacity before i'm mainly
[13:58] focused on teaching people how to train
[14:00] their pets to be obedient and be good
[14:02] dogs and do tricks and pay attention and
[14:05] work on reactivity those kind of common
[14:07] issues i see this question a few times
[14:10] can a hot a husky live in a hot climate
[14:13] i mean
[14:14] i i suppose they could provided you have
[14:16] air conditioning and you're not keeping
[14:17] them outside for a long period of time
[14:19] maybe consult with a vet
[14:20] um
[14:22] to to make sure but i think as long i
[14:24] don't know that it would be a good idea
[14:25] for a husky to live outdoors in a hot
[14:27] climate
[14:28] in fact i think that's probably not a
[14:30] good idea
[14:33] what what i have heard but
[14:36] good question
[14:38] have i ever considered a small dog
[14:40] series sure have
[14:42] stay tuned
[14:46] yep i'm glad yeah small dog has been a
[14:48] huge request
[14:50] so
[14:51] you know i listen to you guys the big
[14:53] question for me is what's after the
[14:55] small dog series like what is the next
[14:57] theme earlier someone mentioned the
[14:59] rescue greyhound
[15:01] uh series which i kind of like the idea
[15:04] um i also like the idea of bree
[15:06] potentially
[15:08] taking the reins and training a dog like
[15:10] like seriously giving herself a few
[15:13] weeks of serious focus of training a dog
[15:14] because she's not really she's more of a
[15:16] casual trainer than she is like okay
[15:19] we're gonna stay on schedule focus on
[15:21] this stuff for a few weeks and
[15:23] see where we are at the end of it
[15:25] so i think those might be
[15:28] some of my ideas but yeah i would love
[15:30] to you guys guide us as much as we guide
[15:33] us
[15:34] uh hi maya check why my puppy
[15:36] lies down on his pee tray in the cage
[15:39] instead of
[15:41] on the bed i provide okay from singapore
[15:45] uh i don't know i i suppose i mean
[15:47] sometimes i wonder why my dog will sleep
[15:50] on the floor versus the bed even when it
[15:53] seems like it's really chilly it's extra
[15:55] cold
[15:56] and i think it's just probably the
[15:58] preference of the dog it's probably got
[16:00] more to do with texture than anything
[16:02] like dogs in the mood for that type of
[16:03] texture under them rather than maybe a
[16:05] bed where they might feel more warm i'm
[16:07] just guessing
[16:11] but maybe
[16:14] how long did it take me to train my
[16:16] border collie
[16:18] well i mean dogs are always in training
[16:20] so i'm never done i'm working on new
[16:22] tricks with her all the time um
[16:24] and playing frisbee and stuff and just
[16:26] trying to give her a happy life but
[16:28] on the inertia playlist we currently
[16:30] ended it with that very question i'm
[16:32] gonna probably add to it over time i
[16:33] would think but we're kind of in a
[16:35] holding pattern as we focus on these
[16:37] other series right now to make sure
[16:38] we're giving you guys enough variety
[16:40] uh and relatable material so
[16:44] but you know uh one to two years is what
[16:45] i say when it comes to training a dog
[16:48] not because
[16:49] it takes one to two years for dogs to
[16:51] understand basic concepts but it does
[16:52] take one to two years for them how to
[16:54] understand
[16:56] how to behave in a variety of contexts
[16:58] and settings and
[17:01] i mean life experience there's just no
[17:02] way around that for any mammal they all
[17:05] need that life experience
[17:06] so tolerance and patience and it's well
[17:10] worth
[17:11] focusing on making that first two years
[17:12] have a heavy emphasis on training and
[17:14] taking your dog in a variety of places
[17:17] and and things like that to give or or
[17:19] give them a variety of experiences is
[17:22] how i
[17:23] guess i mean to say that
[17:32] just trying to pick a question i'm
[17:33] reading inertia is doing well we were
[17:34] just playing brisbane i guess she's
[17:36] sleeping right now
[17:38] um anyway she's somewhere back there
[17:40] probably in the house
[17:42] but she's doing really well i mean she's
[17:44] doing great
[17:45] she's the perfect dog what can i say uh
[17:47] i mean she's a perfect dog for me she's
[17:49] wonderful she's
[17:51] level two dog on her energy level most
[17:53] of the time
[17:55] meaning middle of the road
[17:57] plays frisbee
[17:59] which i like
[18:00] um
[18:01] good fetch dog really bright
[18:04] she's just great
[18:06] loves other dogs
[18:08] nice bonus
[18:10] it's yeah
[18:16] is it possible to train two dogs at the
[18:18] same time yeah that's another thing
[18:19] actually we were thinking about
[18:20] featuring in a series uh no not really
[18:23] probably it's not ideal because ideally
[18:25] you get
[18:26] it's just like three times the work do
[18:28] you know what i mean yeah you can do it
[18:30] but
[18:31] the way that i would go about it would
[18:32] be training each dog individually while
[18:35] one is up getting them used to being
[18:36] apart so they're not always together but
[18:38] still giving them plenty of time
[18:40] together
[18:41] to play when it's appropriate but
[18:44] mainly because it's exhausting for the
[18:45] human probably
[18:49] it's not as practical to be teaching
[18:51] them new concepts simultaneously because
[18:53] it's easy for them to get distracted by
[18:55] each other and
[18:57] that kind of complicates training
[18:59] could it be done sure but it does become
[19:01] complicated
[19:02] so you're just adding more work to the
[19:04] pile but you know
[19:06] a lot of people have great success with
[19:08] it
[19:09] uh do i recommend it not necessarily but
[19:10] we're thinking about doing a series like
[19:12] that anyway like okay so you have gotten
[19:14] two because people will see a litter
[19:16] they'll be like man i just can't choose
[19:17] i'm getting them both
[19:19] and
[19:21] uh people do find themselves in that
[19:23] situation so that's why i was
[19:24] considering doing a series where we do
[19:26] train two dogs at once
[19:30] so we'll see
[19:31] what's my opinion on beagles
[19:33] i love beagles
[19:35] i mean when people ask me what i think
[19:36] about specific dogs what comes to mind
[19:38] with beagles is they're good all around
[19:40] dogs um
[19:42] but i just really don't like
[19:44] stereotyping
[19:46] because you get so many different
[19:48] personality types within the same breed
[19:51] so you'll get couch potato beagles
[19:54] you'll get high energy beagles you'll
[19:55] get ones that will stay by your side
[19:58] really naturally you'll get others that
[20:00] want to run off i mean
[20:04] like
[20:05] my general it feels feels this is not
[20:07] scientific but it feels to me like only
[20:09] 60 of dogs within a specific breed
[20:13] mostly adhere to their stereotype it's
[20:16] kind of that i don't know what do other
[20:18] dog trainers watching this have an
[20:19] opinion on that um
[20:21] i mean sure many of them will adhere to
[20:23] their stereotype but so many of them
[20:25] don't and so that's why it's kind of not
[20:29] helpful to say well i like beagles
[20:31] because
[20:32] this this and this and you know
[20:35] bear in mind this is coming from someone
[20:37] who's had four border collies so i do
[20:38] need to call out my hypocrisy a little
[20:40] bit i have a love of the breed in
[20:42] general um
[20:43] i do like their stereotypical sharpness
[20:46] and focus though as you've seen with the
[20:48] nurses she does not adhere to
[20:50] a totally uh
[20:52] traditional border collie and that's
[20:54] good to me that's what i was seeking i
[20:56] was looking for more of a dog that would
[20:58] make a great pet than a real high-energy
[21:00] dog who has the genes to herd cattle
[21:03] endlessly do you know what i mean
[21:04] so
[21:10] you look a bit tired can i ask if you
[21:12] take care of yourself i try to take care
[21:15] of myself i'm drinking hot water right
[21:17] now
[21:17] i try to drink a lot of water uh try to
[21:19] stay active um
[21:22] i am getting tired
[21:24] a little bit sometimes whoops there we
[21:26] go
[21:30] appreciate the honesty though
[21:33] views on golden retrievers i love i love
[21:35] it guys
[21:38] goldens are great
[21:39] i mean they are i mean you know
[21:41] all-around dog if you're going by what
[21:43] they're supposed to be
[21:45] also i've heard they're
[21:46] one of the top bite dogs who
[21:49] bite people
[21:50] could have to do with their large
[21:52] numbers i'm not sure and i don't even
[21:53] know if that's status quo anymore or if
[21:55] it ever was it's just something you hear
[21:57] from time to time as a trainer
[22:02] glad you guys are enjoying it oh my gosh
[22:04] 700 people are in here holy cow i was
[22:06] thinking we had like 45 people
[22:08] because you know lives
[22:09] well that changes everything i feel like
[22:11] i need to sit up straighter or something
[22:18] you guys are asking me what i think
[22:19] finnish lap hounds is that what i don't
[22:22] know that breed i actually don't know
[22:23] that breed there's so many breeds out
[22:25] there
[22:26] honestly i'm not an expert on breeds by
[22:28] any means
[22:29] for many of the reasons that i gave you
[22:31] but i've also found in my travels
[22:33] internationally and even around the
[22:35] united states it's really interesting
[22:37] that you see
[22:39] breeds that are more regional that you
[22:41] don't really encounter like in alaska a
[22:43] lot of village dogs for example which is
[22:45] a breed we have recently learned
[22:47] 75 percent of dogs in the world are
[22:50] village dogs allegedly we heard that
[22:52] from bark
[22:54] and that that's a fascinating stat
[22:57] um
[22:59] and
[23:00] you know in the uk of course you had a
[23:01] lot of lurchers and border collies and
[23:04] um
[23:05] you know
[23:06] in higher numbers so it's it's kind of
[23:08] cool you realize how many breeds you're
[23:10] unaware of when you travel more
[23:14] like here we get a ton of pit bulls
[23:16] obviously in the south
[23:18] very common and the village dog is the
[23:19] counterpart probably in the north uh at
[23:22] least in alaska where we are
[23:24] atlanta's just got a bit of everything
[23:26] those are the three cities we spend our
[23:28] time in so
[23:33] mm-hmm
[23:34] um can i make a routine video
[23:39] a morning routine yeah
[23:41] well you know guys i gotta tell you uh
[23:44] those of you who are asking can i make a
[23:45] routine video i may not title the videos
[23:47] that way but that's exactly what reality
[23:49] dog training is all about it is our
[23:51] routine throughout the training process
[23:53] how i start the day how we end the day
[23:55] so we do try to give you
[23:57] um
[23:58] exactly that because you're right
[24:00] routine is everything you have to
[24:01] understand you have
[24:02] to routine is valuable i shouldn't say
[24:05] it's everything but it's very valuable
[24:07] to have
[24:08] regina and that that's what the series
[24:10] is dedicated so rather than tell you
[24:11] about it i would
[24:12] encourage you to watch our reality dog
[24:14] training series or new puppy survival
[24:15] guide or
[24:18] the dog training experience with inertia
[24:21] this is the series we currently have on
[24:23] our youtube channel
[24:26] my dog is inside because we played
[24:28] frisbee
[24:30] i don't know if she's i don't know if
[24:32] she looks i think she's sleeping
[24:36] thank you so much for the five dollar
[24:38] tip that's very nice of you do not give
[24:39] me any money but thank you for giving
[24:41] that but i'm not i'm not asking for any
[24:44] tips today and just wanted to connect
[24:45] with you guys because we haven't talked
[24:47] in a while so
[24:49] um
[24:51] but yeah this is this is great i g
[24:54] animation series
[24:56] i don't know guys
[24:57] maybe a dalmatian that would be pretty
[24:59] cool
[25:02] i'm still i'm loving your ideas here for
[25:04] uh
[25:04] for
[25:05] new series ideas
[25:07] any plans to compete and just be with
[25:09] inertia probably not
[25:11] here's why
[25:13] i used to do three competitions in fact
[25:15] i won five championships in dog frisbee
[25:17] competitions that's how i came and came
[25:20] to be a dog trainer originally
[25:22] and
[25:23] i love it
[25:25] but what you
[25:26] in order to compete at the highest
[25:28] levels of dog frisbee you really need to
[25:30] focus on that craft like every single
[25:34] day more or less and your focus is
[25:36] getting a routine together that you do
[25:38] over and over very like much like a
[25:39] figure skating routine i would imagine i
[25:42] maybe they change them
[25:43] but you get that routine down and you
[25:45] enter it in a variety of competitions
[25:47] and you know you tweak it based on the
[25:48] rules of that competition but your core
[25:50] routine
[25:51] at least the way that i competed would
[25:53] remain the same so you're doing the same
[25:54] thing over and over and trying to
[25:56] asymptotically improve it and make it
[25:58] better and better
[26:00] but
[26:00] that doesn't work for my current career
[26:02] you guys would not want to see me do
[26:05] the same routine over and over again
[26:07] with a frisbee dog and that really is
[26:09] where my focus is and this requires many
[26:11] hours of work i know you
[26:14] it is true that i am a dog trainer but
[26:16] it's also true that i'm a full-time
[26:18] content creator as well with the staff
[26:20] to manage and a business to manage so
[26:22] it's less practical to compete in
[26:24] frisbee dog competitions for that reason
[26:33] let me see did i what
[26:38] oh
[26:39] that's such a compliment lexi lexie
[26:41] asked if i studied science
[26:43] in college because you think that i did
[26:47] uh i i mean i've always been predisposed
[26:50] to scientific thinking facts reality
[26:53] empirical evidence things like that brie
[26:56] my wife has a science degree i do not um
[27:00] and
[27:02] she shares i remember because i was with
[27:04] her she was going through college
[27:06] and she would share
[27:08] fun stuff without
[27:10] you know
[27:11] the interesting facts over the years and
[27:13] it really has
[27:14] helped me just double down on scientific
[27:17] thinking and really appreciate it what i
[27:20] love what i love about science i say
[27:21] this all the time but
[27:24] it
[27:25] is almost exclusively
[27:29] more interesting than anything you could
[27:31] ever imagine up if you're trying to come
[27:33] to a conclusion do you know what i mean
[27:36] so
[27:38] it
[27:39] that's that's what continues to blow me
[27:41] away about it like when you actually do
[27:42] decide to do the experiment and get into
[27:44] it
[27:46] so it's inspiring to me and
[27:50] yeah so that's what i have to say about
[27:51] science
[27:53] good nights
[27:58] you guys are these these are great
[28:00] questions you're doing really well chop
[28:02] the chop series has continued to just
[28:05] exceed expectations
[28:07] i feel like
[28:08] we're challenging ourselves in these
[28:09] series trying to make them better and
[28:11] better
[28:12] and focus on different things with each
[28:14] dog and i hope that comes off to you
[28:16] guys and i really appreciate the
[28:17] constructive criticism that you guys
[28:19] leave all the time we listen to that
[28:22] i love criticism so bring it on really
[28:25] seriously it only helps us do better
[28:29] i train a wolf i don't know that i could
[28:32] train a wolf
[28:33] wolves are not dogs do you know what i
[28:34] mean what i
[28:36] and this is actually an important
[28:37] distinction really because they get
[28:39] lumped together by pop culture and dog
[28:41] training a lot like be the pack leader
[28:43] and really like
[28:45] uh focus on being the alpha wolf and
[28:48] it's it's kind of misleading number one
[28:51] there's it's messy here because there's
[28:52] two
[28:53] big things we have to understand number
[28:55] one dogs
[28:57] have been specifically bred by humans
[29:00] to cooperate with humans over thousands
[29:03] of years so that's like the single
[29:05] common thing we selected for when making
[29:07] dogs over thousands of years
[29:10] we made copies of the ones that were
[29:12] good at listening to us second secondly
[29:15] you have the fact that there's no such
[29:17] thing as an alpha wolf
[29:20] just like in human families
[29:22] this is what this is what the science
[29:24] says so take it or leave it but this is
[29:26] what current science seems to bring wolf
[29:28] behavior as
[29:30] is that um
[29:32] oh gosh
[29:33] authority for lack of a better term
[29:35] tends to shift between certain members
[29:38] of the wolf pack
[29:40] and if i'm interpreting here
[29:42] uh
[29:43] as a layman
[29:45] think about how
[29:47] with your mom
[29:48] you may not
[29:50] ask her
[29:51] to go get ice cream but with your dad
[29:53] you might because you know that
[29:55] he'll do it and she won't you know and
[29:58] so
[29:59] it's kind of like
[30:01] you know different different parental
[30:03] figures assert themselves differently
[30:06] contextually so it's much more nuanced
[30:08] than be the pack leader and be a leader
[30:11] and
[30:11] focus on disciplining your dog also it
[30:14] is a myth too this is another big
[30:16] overstated thing people a lot of people
[30:18] believe
[30:19] that wolves are very forceful with each
[30:21] other when interacting with each other
[30:22] to to
[30:24] change behavior and
[30:27] um
[30:27] that's not naturally how they
[30:29] communicate nor is it natural for dogs
[30:31] even though dogs may you know certainly
[30:34] give up
[30:34] you know they're not killing each other
[30:36] they're not attacking each other they're
[30:37] not grabbing each other by by the neck
[30:39] harshly
[30:40] or or anything like that you know
[30:42] they're they have ways of communicating
[30:43] that might look harsh but in reality
[30:45] aren't really that harsh
[30:47] um
[30:48] so
[30:49] it's my understanding also that breeders
[30:51] will
[30:52] you know certainly
[30:54] a good breeder will not
[30:56] stand for a dog who's too rough with
[30:58] their puppies or or things like that so
[31:01] um
[31:02] another pretty popular myth in dog
[31:05] training it's tough to over
[31:08] come a lot of these
[31:11] i want to say outdated beliefs but i
[31:13] know that can be
[31:16] divisive sounding i'm not even trying to
[31:17] sound like that i'm just going again
[31:19] where the evidence leads and it's normal
[31:22] i mean i can't count how many times in
[31:23] my life i thought something was true and
[31:24] then i found out oh yeah actually that's
[31:26] not true
[31:27] and to me it's like why should that be
[31:29] any different in dog behavior
[31:31] so
[31:36] how many of you guys by the way have
[31:37] seen today's episode uh let me see let
[31:40] me see how it's doing really i gotta
[31:41] check on it i'm sorry i know it's live
[31:42] just hang out for a second i just want
[31:44] to see i like to see the real-time views
[31:46] over the first few hours of a video
[31:48] to kind of see where it stands youtube
[31:51] gives you really good analytics this
[31:53] one's doing quite well
[31:56] doing very good it could do better but
[31:58] it could do worse it's one of those
[32:01] so
[32:02] let's see
[32:05] yeah we could probably tweak the
[32:06] thumbnail or title we'll see
[32:10] anyway i think it'll do well over the
[32:12] long time over the long term too
[32:14] that's also true on youtube we really
[32:16] try to focus on evergreen content that
[32:18] tends to get used over a long period of
[32:20] time
[32:21] if you're an inspiring content creator
[32:24] go for it
[32:25] that i mean that's maybe something you'd
[32:27] want to consider
[32:30] chop's dna reveal that's a good question
[32:32] i was wondering the same thing
[32:34] brie is on top of that she's curating
[32:37] the storyline of the series more than i
[32:40] am she's in charge of this series and
[32:42] doing a spectacular job i might add i
[32:44] think
[32:45] you guys would agree with that it's not
[32:47] easy doing something like this
[32:49] usually it's a team of many more people
[32:51] doing stuff like this so
[32:55] but she has a vision and she is
[32:56] executing upon it
[33:00] that's admirable
[33:03] gotta snap the ball
[33:06] i won't do many more sports metaphors
[33:09] thank you yeah he's an amazing producer
[33:18] yeah i mean you know it's she get you
[33:22] you have to like she's been doing this
[33:24] long enough that she
[33:26] has a better vantage point and many
[33:28] things better than i do so i think
[33:30] it's been real valuable plus i want her
[33:32] to
[33:33] i just i want really know how to
[33:36] do everything and she does
[33:38] so
[33:44] have i thought about getting a new dog
[33:45] yeah we think about it we think about it
[33:47] we do travel a lot so it's something we
[33:48] kind of need to weigh and consider but
[33:57] how long did it i'm i'm
[33:59] i'll be honest with you guys i'm the
[34:01] questions i'm responding to i'm gonna
[34:03] respond to the shorter ones because
[34:04] they're going by so quick oh what are my
[34:06] hobbies outside of dog training oh i'm
[34:08] glad you asked well recently i have
[34:10] discovered tell me if you guys are into
[34:11] this have you guys discovered the oculus
[34:14] quest not a sponsor
[34:16] it's virtual reality headset
[34:19] so i've been i've that's a recent
[34:20] discovery
[34:22] of mine and
[34:25] it's
[34:26] blown my mind uh resident evil 4
[34:28] specifically is the greatest game i've
[34:31] ever played on the oculus version
[34:33] specifically
[34:34] um
[34:35] yeah i'm interested in investing outside
[34:38] of dog training
[34:39] so
[34:41] i consider myself an investor um
[34:44] and yeah those are my two big things at
[34:46] the moment investing in virtual reality
[34:49] and youtube youtube tik tok and
[34:51] instagram
[34:54] how long have i been training someone
[34:56] asked um
[34:58] i've been training i think this is my
[34:59] 18th year
[35:03] it's either 17 18 or 19 years some one
[35:06] of those three but i think 18 pretty
[35:07] sure about that or close to if not
[35:12] i know that's crazy to say
[35:14] uh let's see how do i manage my time
[35:17] with dog training and hobbies i mean
[35:22] that's a great question that is
[35:24] um
[35:27] it's a it's a struggle but you know
[35:28] something you you try to work on
[35:31] i mean
[35:34] we're just we're just really
[35:36] focused on trying to build the best
[35:40] thing we can brie and i for youtube i
[35:42] mean our heart is in it i hope that
[35:43] comes off i'm not even trying to
[35:46] i guess i'm saying this because i want
[35:47] you guys to know
[35:51] that we listen to you we value
[35:53] what you
[35:55] ask for what you say what you criticize
[35:58] all of that so
[36:01] thank you i guess what i'm saying is
[36:03] thank you for helping us be better
[36:09] city based dog training yeah we are
[36:11] considering doing a city-based dog
[36:13] training series in atlanta because our
[36:15] house in atlanta is right smack in the
[36:17] middle of the city um
[36:20] so
[36:21] exactly we're thinking about that and we
[36:24] have do a degree with inertia honestly
[36:26] so we definitely
[36:28] we definitely touched on city training
[36:29] quite a bit in the inertia series even
[36:32] the kona series was pretty good new
[36:34] puppy survival guide
[36:38] uh those are the ones i would look to
[36:39] for now if you're looking for that but
[36:41] yes
[36:45] let's see
[36:46] george is doing fantastic last i heard
[36:48] i'm thrilled with
[36:50] alex and george and oh man he's so lucky
[36:53] to have such a loving
[36:55] person in his life
[36:57] do i think shock collars are inhumane i
[36:59] mean i stay away from language like that
[37:02] um i don't use them
[37:05] but the science seems to indicate that
[37:07] they are unnecessary to use that's
[37:09] that's all i need to say about it
[37:10] because that
[37:12] if science shows shows me they're
[37:14] necessary
[37:15] then i'll i'll can i'll reconsider my
[37:17] opinion but um
[37:22] i mean there are the thing is i
[37:23] understand the points about like for the
[37:25] safety of the dog and um because that
[37:27] makes a lot of sense
[37:28] if in one capacity of thinking
[37:31] or way to ban it to keep them
[37:34] like using
[37:35] or training in a more contained
[37:37] environment things like that uh where
[37:39] you can work up through off leash
[37:41] training and things like that where
[37:44] it may be less necessary or necessary
[37:49] we're doing meet up probably but again
[37:51] for the look i'm not judging people who
[37:53] use things i get
[37:55] a dog training culture right now
[37:59] but i'm not like the kind of trainers
[38:01] like oh you're a terrible person if
[38:02] you're using an e-collar
[38:06] it's my
[38:07] put forward what i know how to do it's
[38:09] your job it's the public to determine
[38:11] what you're going to do
[38:12] i have no authority over you i cannot
[38:14] tell you what to do and what not to do
[38:16] that is for you to decide
[38:18] and there are many varieties and many
[38:20] different trainers out there that you
[38:22] can look at and
[38:24] make your own determinant
[38:26] i
[38:27] know what i mean
[38:30] a saint bernard series you're
[38:31] recommending that would be
[38:35] tips for extreme anxiety that
[38:40] well
[38:41] in general approach to that is
[38:44] taking a position of
[38:46] count conditioning your dog trying to
[38:48] counteract
[38:51] triggers light triggers ideally at first
[38:55] uh very far away from the thing if
[38:57] possible that causes them
[38:59] to
[39:00] react
[39:01] in an anxious way
[39:03] providing a positive outcome you know
[39:05] bottom line so counter conditioning
[39:06] desensitizing your dog to whatever
[39:09] causes them
[39:11] to behave anxiously
[39:12] meaning give them low level exposure to
[39:15] that thing whatever that is we're
[39:16] talking about that currently in the chop
[39:18] series as a matter of fact in our very
[39:19] next episode coming out wednesday i
[39:22] believe you're going to see a good
[39:23] example of all of this so i highly
[39:26] recommend we got
[39:27] three videos coming out in the next
[39:28] seven days four if you count today's
[39:30] video so it's going to be a busy week
[39:32] and i hope all of you watch all of the
[39:33] videos
[39:34] um
[39:35] because
[39:36] they're good i think they're good i'll
[39:38] let you determine that but
[39:42] and of course exercise as well uh
[39:44] exercise can be depending on the type of
[39:47] anxiety we're talking about but
[39:49] it seems that exercise can alleviate a
[39:52] lot of anxiety with dogs structured
[39:54] exercise specifically in form of fetch
[39:56] or or anything that involves your dog
[39:58] using their mind engaging with a human
[40:00] and moving
[40:02] vigorously over the course of an hour
[40:04] with breaks as needed within that hour
[40:09] the reason i think it's good to involve
[40:12] a human with that is because remember
[40:14] like we were discussing earlier
[40:16] dogs are predisposed to take direction
[40:19] from people that it seems to be where
[40:21] they feel most complete when they're
[40:22] engaging with a person in a vigorous
[40:24] manner at least the high energy dogs
[40:27] anyway
[40:28] the ones who have that kind of energy
[40:29] not all dogs are like that
[40:32] and so that seems to fulfill them in a
[40:33] unique way that say playing with other
[40:35] dogs or taking a walk around the block
[40:37] does not that's the hypothesis
[40:46] oh boy
[40:49] puppy steve's steels and thieves all day
[40:52] into everything
[40:53] yeah what should you do control your
[40:55] dog's environment put them on a leash
[40:56] put up those puppy gates block off areas
[40:59] that your dog can get to we talk about
[41:01] this extensively go ahead and check out
[41:03] new puppy survival guide or dog training
[41:05] experience with inertia from the
[41:06] beginning i'll talk about that quite
[41:08] early in both of those series because
[41:09] it's an important one
[41:17] oh boy i'm trying to field these
[41:19] questions as i can a nurse is doing
[41:22] great
[41:22] what's the easiest breed to train
[41:24] depends on the dog
[41:27] not
[41:28] not the breed
[41:35] would i ever come to colorado i hope so
[41:38] i've been to colorado a few times
[41:41] that was our we considered colorado over
[41:43] our anchorage house for a little bit um
[41:45] it has many advantages but in the end we
[41:48] love anchorage
[41:52] but i that doesn't mean i won't come to
[41:53] colorado though i could still do that so
[41:57] what did i do before dog training
[41:59] uh
[42:01] okay so i grew up in an entrepreneurial
[42:03] family um
[42:06] my mother is a real estate investor
[42:08] my dad owns a jewelry store
[42:11] and he's a
[42:12] been a jeweler for decades
[42:17] so yeah i i i didn't like grow up in an
[42:19] animal household so to speak
[42:21] so what to answer a question i was i was
[42:24] in real estate um i sold real estate
[42:26] before i was a dog trainer in my early
[42:28] 20s
[42:29] i got my license in real estate when i
[42:31] was 18 and
[42:32] did that for like six or seven years it
[42:35] overlapped with my dog training career
[42:36] for a little bit but then i was just
[42:38] like
[42:39] when you find your passion sorry when
[42:41] you find your passion when you find that
[42:42] thing that
[42:44] you hadn't necessarily been exposed to
[42:46] but you know it when you see it that's
[42:47] how dog training was
[42:49] for me it was like
[42:50] this is what i want to do you know i i
[42:53] hope
[42:54] all of you have had that pleasure at
[42:55] some point and if you haven't i hope you
[42:57] do at some point to find
[42:59] whatever that thing is that
[43:02] opens your heart and makes you excited
[43:04] from the moment you open your eyes in
[43:06] the morning
[43:07] um
[43:08] because that's the thing you need to
[43:09] listen to in my opinion
[43:12] whatever that is you know
[43:15] because if you're that excited about
[43:17] something you
[43:19] can endure
[43:21] all of the growing pains to get to where
[43:24] you want to be i guess
[43:25] not that i'm by any means where i want
[43:27] to be but i'm very content and happy
[43:29] with
[43:32] our situation
[43:36] vermont i've driven through vermont
[43:38] in like 30 seconds what i remember about
[43:40] vermont i think i was going to new york
[43:42] is vermont even south of new york i feel
[43:45] like it is right if you're going up the
[43:47] east coast
[43:48] or is it not anyway for whatever reason
[43:50] i was driving through
[43:52] vermont it was like welcome to vermont
[43:54] and like
[43:55] it felt like 30 seconds later it was
[43:56] like thank you for visiting vermont
[43:59] it was lovely what i saw of it i've
[44:00] heard it's beautiful though
[44:10] um
[44:11] what was let me see i saw a question
[44:13] about indy over here
[44:16] what was indy like indiana our dog who
[44:18] recently passed away
[44:21] she was
[44:23] legendary
[44:26] very um if you've seen game of thrones
[44:28] she was the dragon
[44:30] drogon
[44:33] that was her personality
[44:35] in her head you know
[44:38] too late to become a dog trainer at 45 i
[44:41] wouldn't think so i wouldn't think so i
[44:43] mean
[44:46] i'm 42 so we're pretty close of age um
[44:49] no i mean i don't think any age
[44:51] if i found something i loved more than
[44:52] dog training i would do that too you
[44:54] know so
[44:58] oh
[44:59] glad you guys like the series finale of
[45:01] george
[45:09] did indy ever get aggressive with other
[45:11] dogs
[45:13] no not as a general rule she would have
[45:15] i mean she definitely had spats like we
[45:17] would have spouts when we had four dogs
[45:19] under a house there would be occasional
[45:21] well yeah there would be occasional
[45:22] confrontation so i i mean she's gotten
[45:24] into fights before it's happened but
[45:26] i mean
[45:27] less than i can probably list on one
[45:29] hand
[45:30] but it does happen sometimes
[45:40] any good books
[45:42] i like dog training revolution
[45:44] zach george's guide to a well-behaved
[45:46] dog
[45:48] there's a lot of good dog training books
[45:49] out there i mean i would check out karen
[45:50] pryor patricia mcconnell um there are a
[45:53] couple of ones that come to mind
[45:55] i mean my friend chris parondy has an
[45:57] excellent trick book out there uh like
[46:00] what is it 101 dog tricks or uh it's
[46:03] easy to find just search for purandi and
[46:06] trick dog book i mean it's a really well
[46:08] done book
[46:09] um
[46:11] oh gosh i can't anyway
[46:14] i'm drawing a blank at the moment but
[46:15] those
[46:18] help at the moment ian dunbar of course
[46:20] i like ian dunbar a lot
[46:22] uh even dogs decoded is a pretty good
[46:24] book um
[46:28] is college necessary to become a dog
[46:30] trainer no
[46:31] no but a good understanding of modern
[46:33] behavior methods and uh
[46:36] is
[46:38] required i'd say
[46:39] that's the thing like dog training some
[46:41] we were talking about science earlier in
[46:44] this live cast and
[46:48] dog training is a scientific profession
[46:53] and so
[46:54] i do find it to be a bit of a red flag
[46:57] when i hear
[46:58] fellow professionals and i'm just peer
[46:59] reviewing again i'm nobody okay but when
[47:02] i do hear
[47:04] fellow professionals dismiss science a
[47:07] little too easily which is different
[47:09] than being skeptical of scientific
[47:10] findings i mean they're different you
[47:12] know but
[47:14] the skepticism also meets because i
[47:17] think what people who aren't formally
[47:19] trained in science
[47:20] they may not fully appreciate
[47:23] how
[47:24] the craft of science goes out of its way
[47:27] to correct for those things do you know
[47:29] what i mean to correct for the
[47:31] miscalculations and correct for the
[47:33] things they missed and repeat the
[47:34] experiment and make them better make
[47:35] sure it's peer reviewed uh the only i
[47:38] mean the best way to get famous in
[47:40] science is to go out and disprove a
[47:42] widely accepted thing and then
[47:45] show your evidence and see it can be
[47:47] repeated and so forth so anyway the
[47:49] point is i'm talking about this why
[47:52] that's why i think it's important to be
[47:53] very scientific minded if you are going
[47:55] to become a dog trainer um make sure you
[47:57] understand the scientific method
[48:00] if you it's been a while since high
[48:01] school for many of you perhaps but you
[48:03] know i mean commit it to memory because
[48:05] if you run everything
[48:07] through the filter of the scientific
[48:09] method you're probably going to be
[48:11] better off at least that's what i think
[48:13] i don't know
[48:16] so
[48:18] point being
[48:20] focus on science if you're gonna be a
[48:22] dog trainer or accept at least that you
[48:24] are in the scientific profession animal
[48:25] behavior
[48:38] see
[48:39] dog training revolution is a great book
[48:41] seriously oh thank you appreciate that
[48:44] it's on amazon
[48:50] uh my dog is dreaming right now while
[48:53] i'm watching this dog's dreaming is so
[48:55] wonderful
[48:58] always trying to interpret what they're
[48:59] thinking but we can never know that's
[49:02] also so important if you're a dog
[49:03] trainer it's one of the first lessons
[49:05] you need to understand you can never
[49:07] presume to know what a dog is thinking
[49:10] i mean you can
[49:11] guess but be very honest with yourself
[49:13] that it is a guess
[49:17] how do i deal with defensive guarding
[49:20] behavior resource guarding i guess
[49:21] you're talking about uh we've dealt with
[49:23] that
[49:24] in pretty much every series we've done
[49:26] so i would look at those but in general
[49:28] counter conditioning your dog
[49:30] giving them positive experiences and
[49:32] giving them good things so in the case
[49:34] of resource guarding if your dog snaps
[49:36] at you with a bone giving them something
[49:37] they want more sometimes it's a toy that
[49:39] you can throw off
[49:40] into the other direction while you take
[49:42] the bone away and then reward them with
[49:43] a toy or reward them with a piece of
[49:45] real turkey or chicken or something like
[49:47] that something that's
[49:48] likely to get their attention off of the
[49:50] bone and hand it back to them don't
[49:52] withhold it forever to validate their
[49:54] concerns
[49:57] it's much better if you watch my videos
[49:58] pancake is a decent one pancake the
[50:00] corgi
[50:01] um but i would look more at my more
[50:03] recent series i'd probably do a better
[50:04] job
[50:06] today than i did then
[50:13] uh did our home survive the hurricane
[50:15] well we've only been back here for a
[50:16] minute um and i yeah it did have some
[50:19] damage like the gutters got knocked down
[50:20] but apparently uh i had our favorite
[50:23] contractor come out and he took care of
[50:25] all that so i didn't see any of the
[50:26] damage but it got fixed by the time i
[50:28] was back so that was fun
[50:32] how do you choose a dog
[50:35] man that's such a personal thing i mean
[50:42] um
[50:43] i i mean i talk about it in my book but
[50:44] there's so many ways to go about it
[50:46] because i've been in your shoes very
[50:47] recently and i'm always in your shoes
[50:49] moving forward because i consider
[50:51] these foster dogs sometimes um
[50:57] well i mean the obvious things are your
[50:58] lifestyle how much time do you have for
[51:00] a dog things like that do you want a
[51:02] high energy dog you want a low energy
[51:04] dog you want a dog in between and do you
[51:06] understand what comes with all of those
[51:07] if you get a low energy dog you're
[51:09] likely not going to have a frisbee or
[51:10] agility dog champion if you get a high
[51:13] energy dog
[51:14] you're likely going to have to spend a
[51:15] lot of time each morning working with
[51:17] them and getting their energy out if you
[51:19] want ideal behavior out of them so and
[51:21] again i go into detail on that i think
[51:23] in book number one dog training
[51:24] revolution or i have a video on it as
[51:26] well and that's free and you can watch
[51:28] it now too so don't feel like you have
[51:30] to
[51:31] spend money
[51:32] i cannot even see now let me see what's
[51:34] going on here the sun's so bright
[51:39] trying
[51:41] all right well oh i'm up all the way
[51:42] here i guess i'm going to wrap this up
[51:44] you guys
[51:45] it was a great live
[51:48] thank you if you want to see more of
[51:50] these lives
[51:51] i may may i'm not promising anything but
[51:53] i may do more on instagram and tick tock
[51:55] so follow me on both of those you can
[51:56] find me very easily over there and yeah
[52:00] we'll see you later if i can ever figure
[52:02] out the screen
[52:03] stuck here

TRANSCRIPTION:

[00:00] previously on reality dog training i'm
[00:03] getting real significant pulling right
[00:05] here he definitely feels like he's
[00:07] genetically predisposed to drag me
[00:09] across alaska but my goal with him in
[00:12] this training session was by the end of
[00:14] it to be at 50 50 and i'd say we at
[00:16] least accomplish that his most
[00:18] significant issue that can be hard to
[00:19] deal with is his conduct when around
[00:22] dogs he needs a lot more desensitizing
[00:24] so we're off to do that now
[00:27] the stronger my communication is with
[00:29] chop the more likely it is i'll be able
[00:31] to teach him to behave
[00:33] that's what i'm going for big picture
[00:35] the things i want to focus on today are
[00:37] improving the bond between chop and me
[00:39] getting them to come to me more reliably
[00:41] and improving our communication together
[00:44] so that it's more fluid and more natural
[00:46] and i think that fetch can do all of
[00:48] those things at one time if i can just
[00:51] teach him to do it right this is my dog
[00:54] inertia i want to show you what a proper
[00:56] fetch should look like come around
[00:58] of course the come around is optional
[01:00] let me demonstrate with her what chop
[01:02] definitely doesn't know yet this is what
[01:04] a complete game of fetch looks like that
[01:07] is you want to be able to throw a toy
[01:08] have your dog chase it in a straight
[01:10] line return it in a straight line let go
[01:13] and eagerly await the next throw
[01:15] nonetheless there are definitely areas
[01:17] where some people struggle with with
[01:18] their dogs some people when they have a
[01:20] breakdown in getting their dog to bring
[01:22] a toy back they find it useful to use
[01:24] another toy that's one way to motivate
[01:26] your dog to come back to you she's never
[01:28] seen a toy like this it's like a frisbee
[01:30] but it's like a plush toy what is that
[01:32] isn't that crazy sometimes people
[01:34] struggle with teaching their dog to let
[01:36] go of things and there's lots of ways to
[01:37] teach your dog to let go but if you're
[01:39] having a really tough time you might
[01:41] want to consider using really good
[01:44] treats
[01:45] i told you it works quite well
[01:47] because most dogs will be like okay i'll
[01:49] let go in order to have a great quality
[01:51] treat anytime barkbox and super chewer
[01:53] box are incredible monthly subscription
[01:56] boxes they send you some of the best
[01:58] toys and treats for your dog every
[02:00] single month so you don't even have to
[02:02] think and they're just so creative this
[02:04] spider-man toy she goes crazy over the
[02:07] difference between these two boxes is
[02:09] that super chewer has really tough toys
[02:11] for those dogs who are hard on toys and
[02:13] barkbox has plushier toys like spiderman
[02:16] here for example chop toy inertia toy
[02:20] you guys can get a free bark box super
[02:22] chewer box or both when you sign up for
[02:24] a multi-month plan at barkbox.com dog
[02:26] training and superchewer.com dog
[02:28] training
[02:29] chops fetch game has been on fire lately
[02:32] i want to start using his love of fetch
[02:34] to help him practice better behavior
[02:37] when he sees things that excite him you
[02:39] know like when he sees other dogs
[02:42] exactly
[02:43] better than that
[02:45] the dog park was a little too much for
[02:47] chop so we're gonna head to a field
[02:49] nearby and there there's only likely to
[02:51] be a couple of occasionally passing dogs
[02:54] and should go without noting we've got
[02:55] them on a lead here but you see the
[02:57] clever
[02:58] set we've come up with here
[03:01] i say we but it was actually brie she
[03:03] knew this place because she grew up here
[03:04] but there's a nice steady stream of
[03:06] pedestrian and presumably occasional dog
[03:10] traffic and i can also play fetch right
[03:12] here so if i can get him playing fetch
[03:14] in the presence of dogs or at least
[03:16] depleting his energies even if he does
[03:18] react to the dogs it should be less
[03:20] significant thereby allowing him to
[03:23] experience being around other dogs in a
[03:26] less heightened state of alertness
[03:28] secondarily traffic has been something
[03:30] that's been catching his attention you
[03:32] might hear it in the background that's
[03:33] going to work to our advantage we're
[03:34] going to make sure that he's completely
[03:36] safe at all times since we're in public
[03:39] so that's why i've got him on the lead
[03:41] good man plus the lead is good when
[03:43] you're teaching fetch because if they
[03:45] start to veer off
[03:46] you can give them a gentle encouragement
[03:48] like that i'm continuing to teach him
[03:50] come when call during fetch like this
[03:53] chop
[03:55] come
[03:56] it's a really great time to capture that
[03:58] behavior i'm gonna give him a break
[04:00] right now i'll give him a water break
[04:01] but good first round so far we're
[04:03] getting pretty lucky we got in a whole
[04:05] first round of fetch i don't know six or
[04:08] seven throws and we didn't encounter a
[04:10] dog the more fetch i play i think the
[04:13] less reactive he's going to be when he
[04:16] sees dogs so you can see he's interested
[04:18] in a person over here
[04:20] chop come
[04:21] he's not very reliable right now
[04:23] but he's also not lunging at the people
[04:25] do you see what i mean i'm trying to
[04:27] really keep an open mind
[04:29] like before he's just really thinking it
[04:31] out so that extra bit of patience
[04:33] allowing your dog to process things is
[04:36] really necessary
[04:38] here good man
[04:40] yes
[04:41] come on
[04:46] since he's so dialed in right now i
[04:48] still like to throw in 10 seconds of
[04:50] heel training it's just a way to get him
[04:51] paying attention to you while he's
[04:52] having a good time
[04:54] this turn here if he's confused come on
[04:57] okay come
[04:59] yes
[05:00] good
[05:01] and then i'll do another four throws
[05:02] with them you know you'll get a lot
[05:03] longer training sessions too and your
[05:05] dog's enjoying it all right let's go
[05:07] take a break i'm really hoping that
[05:09] during one of these breaks upcoming he's
[05:10] going to hit a natural settle and lie
[05:12] down maybe we'll have a dog walk by and
[05:15] he's a perfect angel
[05:17] that'd be the best that's what i'm
[05:18] shooting for here textbook screensaver
[05:20] dog training there's a dog right here
[05:22] he's noticing
[05:25] chop come
[05:27] chop here
[05:29] what's this
[05:30] okay
[05:32] ah
[05:33] losing interest in the ball
[05:35] definitely pulling towards the dog
[05:38] now i frequently tell you all that
[05:41] exercise will probably solve 90 plus of
[05:44] unwanted behaviors at least with many
[05:46] high-energy dogs but look every dog is
[05:49] different so it's gonna take a little
[05:50] bit more than playing fetch with chop to
[05:52] get him to behave more politely now if
[05:55] you're struggling with things like this
[05:56] you should check out both of my books as
[05:58] well if your dog is like chop my second
[06:00] book might be a little bit more helpful
[06:02] for you i'm gonna have a link below the
[06:03] whole idea is to give him experience
[06:06] seeing dogs while experiencing genuine
[06:08] inner calm
[06:11] settle i like it i mean that looks like
[06:13] a happy dog to me oh there's dogs coming
[06:18] okay so he's not calm but
[06:22] stay here buddy i don't mind him looking
[06:31] good man
[06:33] since those dogs are moving farther away
[06:35] fairly quickly i'm going to stay put
[06:37] here and let them go rather than trying
[06:39] to pull chop even farther away from
[06:46] them here it's okay buddy at least so
[06:49] far in this training session he doesn't
[06:51] seem like he's at the point where he'll
[06:52] play in the presence of dogs and that
[06:54] may take a long time beyond the time i
[06:56] have with him i just want to give him
[06:58] the best head start that i can here
[07:00] leaning behavior
[07:02] good man
[07:05] a little over excited good recovery here
[07:07] i like the lean
[07:09] trying to encourage calmness
[07:12] it's a dog letting him look at the dogs
[07:14] as long as he wants right now
[07:16] especially as they get farther away
[07:19] let them see that dogs walk past us and
[07:21] they go and that's a normal part of life
[07:24] good man he's having trouble making
[07:26] sense of that this lower level of dogs
[07:29] passing by is obviously a lot more
[07:31] manageable for chop now of course it's
[07:33] ideal for him to have no outbursts at
[07:36] all but look at him settling down just
[07:38] moments after those dogs excited him
[07:40] exposure at a distance with some nice
[07:43] recovery time is hopefully going to be
[07:46] our recipe for success so even though
[07:49] we only encountered really a couple of
[07:51] dogs today turned out to be kind of
[07:53] ideal because he's still reacting pretty
[07:55] heavily to dogs when they're at close
[07:57] range to him so that way i was able to
[07:59] like have him experience listening to me
[08:01] playing fetch doing some of his
[08:02] obedience without being totally
[08:04] overwhelmed so low level exposure
[08:07] proved to be
[08:09] pretty good today i mean it's something
[08:11] just as we're getting ready to wrap up
[08:12] our lesson brie tells me that the dogs
[08:14] that chop had an outburst over a little
[08:17] while ago are on their way back we have
[08:19] a second chance with the same dogs now
[08:21] i'm hoping that since chop already saw
[08:23] these dogs maybe they're a little bit
[08:25] more familiar to him and maybe he'll be
[08:27] able to control himself a little bit
[08:29] better here i'm just going to try and
[08:30] keep him calm come on buddy relax
[08:35] off
[08:36] stay
[08:38] good man good boy
[08:41] very good
[08:43] he's leaning
[08:45] good boy this is definitely longer than
[08:48] he was able to stay calm in the past
[08:53] we were so close i thought that we had
[08:56] it
[08:59] but wait look at this
[09:01] okay come
[09:04] chop here
[09:06] come on let's go good man did you see
[09:10] how chop just followed me there we got
[09:12] to see that again and look i didn't have
[09:14] to drag him away or raise my voice i
[09:16] just called him one time then when his
[09:18] attention was on me i used a little body
[09:21] language to help encourage him and boom
[09:24] train dog okay just kidding we still
[09:27] have a ton of work to do but following
[09:29] me like a pro immediately after an
[09:31] outburst like that
[09:33] major step in the right direction now
[09:36] we're getting somewhere
[09:41] i think today was a huge day for chop i
[09:44] mean i was able to get him paying
[09:46] attention to me in a suburban mainstream
[09:50] neighborhood with all sorts of things
[09:52] going on around him he's chewing my
[09:54] furniture no sir
[09:56] i thought chop was getting trained there
[09:58] i guess it was nice while it lasted i'd
[10:00] never have had a couch destroyed by a
[10:04] dog so i hope this isn't the first time
[10:07] is it destroyed no but he's kind of a
[10:09] one bite and destroyed kind of guy
[10:12] that's the thing he's got a powerful
[10:13] bite hey buddy you may not chew on our
[10:15] couch okay as i was working with him
[10:18] i could really see it in his eyes that
[10:21] he was thinking and learning and just
[10:23] watching this wonderful majestic being
[10:26] take all of that in and process it it's
[10:29] like i can see his brain registering
[10:32] that we
[10:34] want to communicate with him
[10:36] right now he's trying to communicate
[10:38] with us but exactly he's like let me try
[10:40] it the other way okay go i mean
[10:42] ultimately he's going to end up living
[10:44] inside a house and he needs to really
[10:47] understand how to do something basic
[10:49] like take a walk in a civilized manner
[10:51] you know that's a huge transformation
[10:52] for a dog who grew up just like freely
[10:55] wandering the streets with no rules to
[10:59] come and live in a living room for us to
[11:01] expect him to behave is pretty crazy i
[11:03] mean sometimes when you first start
[11:05] training a dog it feels like progress
[11:07] isn't even starting it's like at a
[11:09] complete standstill or maybe it's just
[11:11] moving really slowly but what i've
[11:13] always done is i just stick with it
[11:15] continue to be patient and try to
[11:17] understand the dog as best i can don't
[11:18] be in a rush and eventually you get
[11:21] pretty cool results it's like i turn my
[11:23] back and these dogs are suddenly doing
[11:25] things they weren't doing the day before
[11:26] the other day i let chop out of his
[11:28] crate and he waited to get out and i was
[11:31] like when did you even learn that he did
[11:34] really well today in public i was really
[11:36] proud of him for that with one
[11:39] big exception
[11:41] anytime there was a dog around he saw
[11:43] just a couple of dogs and
[11:45] lost it every time just was inconsolable
[11:48] so i think what we've got to do is
[11:50] really desensitize him to a lot of dogs
[11:53] in public
[11:54] sounds easy yeah it's not gonna be that
[11:57] easy i know
[11:59] chop and inertia's play continues to
[12:01] evolve and i continue to be thrilled
[12:03] with how well chop is helping inertia
[12:06] achieve confidence look at this majestic
[12:09] dog contort himself in the strangest of
[12:12] ways i hope he doesn't get stuck like
[12:15] this oh different place
[12:19] i got his tummy i got his tummy
[12:23] oh my gosh really i'm accidentally
[12:26] airplaying what i'm currently recording
[12:31] job that's you right now
[12:33] as if i couldn't blow your mind enough
[12:35] already
[12:36] inception a little bit of a delay there
[12:39] yeah
[12:40] in other very significant news for chop
[12:42] i think that he is ready to graduate to
[12:45] getting more freedom within the house
[12:48] but he's still basically a wild animal
[12:50] at heart and he's got a lot of human
[12:52] rules to learn yet we're giving chop as
[12:54] much time as possible hanging out in our
[12:56] house with us today to see if we can
[12:58] make some improvements on his house
[13:00] matters very specifically i want to
[13:02] teach him how to settle down and be calm
[13:06] in the house
[13:07] it's pretty much a core required
[13:09] behavior if we're to find him a new home
[13:11] chop is contained in the living room
[13:13] here by doors and gates so that'll
[13:15] prevent him from leaving the living room
[13:16] area so he's always in sight and you can
[13:19] see why that's probably a good idea ah
[13:21] no
[13:22] no
[13:27] yeah well that is his second indoor
[13:30] potty accident probably not the best way
[13:32] to start this house training lesson but
[13:34] that's okay i will stay focused and look
[13:37] prevention is the key to successful and
[13:39] fast house training
[13:41] looks like i need to tell myself that
[13:43] inevitably there comes a time with any
[13:45] totally untrained dog where you feel
[13:47] that they have graduated to where they
[13:49] are ready for more freedom and so you
[13:51] give it to them but that means you
[13:53] really need to go through a period of
[13:54] time where you're really extra
[13:57] supervising your dog to make sure you're
[13:58] in a position to prevent or discourage
[14:00] or give them something else to do so
[14:02] that they learn how you want them to
[14:04] behave in the house chop no
[14:07] that's mine
[14:10] silly boy
[14:12] how does that look like food or a toy so
[14:14] a little while later we're watching tv
[14:16] and you can see chop is back on leash i
[14:19] like to use leashes in a very strategic
[14:21] way when i'm house training a dog
[14:23] especially when my attention has any
[14:25] chance of being divided
[14:27] and it often does chop is definitely one
[14:29] of the more settle resistant dogs that
[14:32] i've worked with he's just so up and
[14:34] curious about everything since he's had
[14:36] an outlet for his energy already i know
[14:39] that there's a dog in there that wants
[14:41] to chill out somewhere so we put on a
[14:43] show and we're just going to sit here
[14:45] and wait with him and see if he'll ever
[14:46] just lie down and relax being able to
[14:49] summon an actual state of mind is a
[14:51] pretty advanced concept for dogs but
[14:53] this is how i do it
[14:55] and there we have it finally a real
[14:58] settle wow he almost looks like an
[15:00] actual house pet nah never mind he's
[15:02] still the size of a direwolf
[15:04] no inertia no sound
[15:07] i'm going to discourage inertia from
[15:08] playing with chop right now since we're
[15:10] specifically working with shop to
[15:12] achieve a calmer state of mind and
[15:14] nurses doing really well on her settle
[15:16] training if only chop could learn from
[15:18] her by example
[15:29] good man
[15:30] relax
[15:31] i didn't expect that to actually work
[15:33] and he's back up again chop is just so
[15:37] excited about life it seems really
[15:39] unnatural for him to just chill out in
[15:41] here without constantly exploring and
[15:43] snooping around but i'm just going to
[15:45] keep waiting him out because i know that
[15:47] he's had exercise i know he's had a
[15:49] potty break recently and i know he's a
[15:52] physiological being that requires rest
[15:55] and recovery at least i think so
[16:00] i think that's the one i feel like i can
[16:04] literally feel his genuine truly chilled
[16:07] out energy right now so i'm gonna go
[16:09] with my gut here and see if i can give
[16:11] him a few minutes of successful
[16:13] well-behaved off-leash time in the house
[16:16] okay he definitely seems to notice me
[16:18] taking the leash off red alert off-leash
[16:20] dog in this house
[16:26] that's interesting
[16:29] his little bark actually triggered
[16:31] inertia bark a couple of times too but
[16:33] chop stayed in his settle so that's a
[16:35] major step in the right direction bree's
[16:36] going to put inertia in the bedroom
[16:38] right now so that chop isn't easily
[16:40] distracted by inertia during this very
[16:42] important breakthrough
[16:52] since inertia riled up chop a bit i'm
[16:54] going to put his leash back on for just
[16:55] a few minutes to help him get back into
[16:57] that stationary calm state of mind and
[17:00] after a couple of minutes chop seems to
[17:02] be back in a more settled mindset so off
[17:05] comes the leash again i mean there's no
[17:07] shortcut around this when you're really
[17:09] trying to teach a dog to relax you have
[17:11] to wait for them to genuinely relax and
[17:14] be there to reinforce it and i
[17:16] understand that usually when you want
[17:17] your dog to be calm it's because they're
[17:20] not being calm so it's not realistic at
[17:22] first to get them to just shift from
[17:24] that excited mindset to a relaxed
[17:27] mindset on cue chop is clearly up and
[17:30] down today but now that he's had a
[17:32] couple of preliminary successes when he
[17:34] does relax again i'm going to start
[17:35] trying to teach him what the term relax
[17:38] means
[17:39] relax
[17:42] just like that he doesn't know what
[17:44] relax means right now but i'm going to
[17:46] teach him by telling him what he's doing
[17:48] as he's doing it
[17:50] so pretty fulfilling day for chop
[17:53] a lot of good training in today a lot of
[17:55] good playing in today
[17:58] good balance
[18:05] oh look at that he's getting on his back
[18:07] too that's something new every day they
[18:09] play together it's like a new
[18:11] little nuanced game they have with each
[18:13] other so it's kind of fun to see that
[18:15] today it really looks like chop is
[18:17] trying to get inertia to chase him he's
[18:18] feeling really boisterous and inertia is
[18:21] not 100 sure about all that she's
[18:23] usually more comfortable being chased
[18:25] and usually with slightly less
[18:28] rambunctious dogs but that won't stop
[18:30] chop from trying to get her going she's
[18:32] letting him know that he's toeing the
[18:33] line of what she's comfortable with
[18:35] though and chop continues to take her
[18:38] signals really well look at that it
[18:41] seems like he's saying see i'm still
[18:42] nice i love watching him flop on the
[18:45] ground like this too another pretty big
[18:47] day for chop in a nurse's relationship
[18:50] and this is lovely to watch
[18:52] you are such a good dog whoever gets you
[18:54] is going to be so lucky
[18:57] these big teeth look how big they are

[00:00] think about this wouldn't it be great if
[00:02] you could have me zach george the
[00:04] youtube dog trainer to watch your dog
[00:06] whenever you're not home that's right i
[00:09] have figured out a way to clone myself
[00:11] and put me
[00:13] inside of a device i mean don't get me
[00:15] wrong there's still some stuff to work
[00:17] out with the megabytes or something
[00:20] hang on furbo just emailed me they're
[00:22] definitely going to be into this idea
[00:26] oh
[00:27] they're they're not interested in my
[00:28] clones apparently furbo already enhances
[00:33] your supervision powers so that you can
[00:35] take even better care of your dog and
[00:37] you can stay connected with them even
[00:39] when you're not at home what am i gonna
[00:41] do with all of these clones now i'll
[00:44] deal with them later the metaverse isn't
[00:47] such a bad place to be stuck in is it
[00:49] this is how it works you just launch the
[00:50] furbo app on your phone you just tap
[00:53] this right here and it'll launch streets
[00:55] especially when i'm traveling or i'm
[00:57] away from home i always want to know if
[00:59] my dog or any dog that i'm working with
[01:02] is barking because barking could be a
[01:03] sign of boredom it could be a sign of
[01:05] anxiety or a sign that you're about to
[01:07] get kicked out of your hotel verbose
[01:09] bark alerts don't just let you know when
[01:11] your dog is barking they'll also tell
[01:13] you how long your dog's been barking for
[01:15] and they'll even differentiate between
[01:17] barking and crying and howling special
[01:20] dog trainer tip all of those
[01:22] vocalizations can mean very different
[01:24] things you can see you can select all
[01:25] the parking shots the continuous parking
[01:28] shots the check this out though look the
[01:30] howling shot
[01:32] hear that
[01:34] this has got to be the most incredible
[01:36] gift idea for anyone with a dog with
[01:38] furbo's dog nanny service verbo will
[01:40] record video of any moments that trigger
[01:43] it and automatically create a 60-second
[01:46] highlight video at the end of every day
[01:48] so you get to see the most important
[01:50] events of your dog's day even if you're
[01:52] too busy to check notifications being
[01:54] able to identify how your dog behaves
[01:57] when you're not there can be huge even
[02:00] though there's general approaches to a
[02:01] lot of dog training problems every
[02:04] single dog is different you get this
[02:06] data and that's going to help you make a
[02:08] better plan moving forward there's no
[02:09] way my clones could ever do that
[02:13] verbose features are specifically
[02:15] designed to keep dogs safe when they're
[02:17] at home alone if furbo hears a smoke
[02:19] alarm or a carbon monoxide alarm going
[02:22] off it will notify you even if glass
[02:24] breaks furbo can hear that how do they
[02:26] do this and it doesn't just detect dogs
[02:28] it can detect people as well so if
[02:31] you're not expecting someone that's
[02:33] pretty handy or if you want to know when
[02:35] your dog sitter or relative has arrived
[02:37] that's helpful too if your house is
[02:38] burning down you'll know it if someone's
[02:40] trying to break in your house you're
[02:42] going to get an alert on your phone
[02:43] they're also working on dog emergency
[02:45] alerts which will notify you of
[02:46] potential medical emergencies with your
[02:48] dog this is a crazy stat but so far
[02:51] furbo has saved over 2 800 dogs lives
[02:55] and that's just as of right now it's
[02:58] just supposed to help me train my dog in
[03:00] it
[03:01] wow the craziest thing is that they're
[03:04] always updating the furbo which is how
[03:06] it continues to get so brilliant so
[03:09] literally the day you buy it is the
[03:11] least capable it will ever be because it

[00:00] it's hard to believe that my time with
[00:02] chop is so close to ending of course we
[00:04] still haven't found him a home but that
[00:06] should be no problem since his house
[00:08] manners are perfect
[00:10] [Music]
[00:13] knowing that chop is leaving soon it's
[00:15] hard for me to resist taking just a few
[00:16] more opportunities to squeeze in a
[00:18] training session with inertia here and
[00:20] there too especially when it comes to
[00:22] listening to me around other dogs so
[00:24] while this might look like a training
[00:26] session for chop at first glance i'm
[00:28] also still staying focused on inertia
[00:30] too to help her understand that she
[00:32] needs to be calm and patient while i
[00:34] work with other dogs
[00:39] they're both doing pretty well so far if
[00:41] you've ever tried this yourself though
[00:43] you'll probably agree that inertia is
[00:45] making it look pretty easy it can take a
[00:47] lot of practice to teach dogs how to
[00:49] patiently wait their turn while other
[00:51] dogs are present i don't even know where
[00:54] i would be with chop without bark and
[00:56] super chewer boxes i get one of each of
[00:58] these boxes shipped to me every single
[01:00] month so i always have a fresh set of
[01:02] premium toys and really good quality
[01:04] treats any time i need them if your dog
[01:06] is anything like inertia they're
[01:08] instantly interested in whatever it is
[01:11] that's in that box these are the treats
[01:13] i'm using they seem to be doing the
[01:14] trick i predict this will be a nurse's
[01:17] favorite toy i wouldn't have even known
[01:19] that inertia loved dangly toys unless
[01:21] they had sent this to me so i love that
[01:23] it allows me to discover new things that
[01:25] i would never think of barkbox makes
[01:27] these really original plush toys but
[01:29] chop on the other hand is definitely
[01:31] more of a super chewer box dog super
[01:33] chewers for dogs who need tougher toys
[01:36] it's a day spa theme look at this so
[01:38] this gives them kind of the feel of a
[01:40] plush toy but it's extra tough
[01:41] underneath and even if the cloth goes
[01:44] away
[01:45] you still have a pretty cool toy you get
[01:47] treats in both boxes and then you also
[01:49] get really good chews for your dog as
[01:51] well all of you can get a free bark box
[01:53] or a free super tour box or even both
[01:55] when you sign up for a multi-month plan
[01:57] but you'll have to use my special links
[01:59] and i'm gonna have those in the
[02:01] description below and i'm happy to
[02:02] report that chop and inertia seem to be
[02:04] doing extremely well when it comes to
[02:06] sharing their toys these days too every
[02:09] time i think that chop and inertia's
[02:10] relationship is as good as it can get
[02:13] they just get even cuter and more
[02:16] comfortable with one another as
[02:18] inertia's dad seeing them interact like
[02:20] this means so much to me i may have
[02:23] helped chop with a lot of things but i
[02:25] will owe him forever for helping me show
[02:28] inertia how to be more confident around
[02:30] bigger dogs this is a really interesting
[02:33] example inertia gets a little annoyed
[02:35] with chop but watch how he responds well
[02:38] easy that might be enough
[02:40] yeah she's a little annoyed yeah but
[02:42] then
[02:44] so he de-escalates
[02:46] and that's exactly what i want to see
[02:48] especially from chop chop is a pretty
[02:50] big dog who has
[02:52] kind of a high probability of
[02:54] accidentally irritating other dogs in
[02:56] the future i mean just due to his size
[02:59] and just his overall energy if nothing
[03:01] else so to me i think it's going to be
[03:03] very important that chop know how to
[03:06] take a measured correction like that
[03:08] from other dogs and that he take it the
[03:10] right way without escalating things and
[03:13] not only did he not escalate things he
[03:15] actually backed off he laid on his back
[03:17] as if to say sorry i didn't mean to not
[03:20] all dogs will respond exactly like chop
[03:22] did and that's okay so i'm really hoping
[03:25] that we can find him a home with another
[03:27] playful friendly dog like inertia that
[03:29] he can interact with all of the time a
[03:31] little while ago we put together a video
[03:34] we posted it on social to really try to
[03:36] cast a decent sized net in order to find
[03:39] chop a fantastic home we're looking for
[03:42] a really specific type of home for chop
[03:45] i mean he is such an incredible dog but
[03:47] for him to really thrive he's going to
[03:50] need someone super committed and
[03:52] passionate who can keep up with him and
[03:54] give him the active life that he
[03:56] deserves and ideally a dog friend who
[03:58] matches his playstyle too
[04:04] i'm a little discouraged because we have
[04:06] been struggling to find
[04:08] the ideal home for chop because we
[04:10] really want him to go to the best place
[04:12] possible but yeah it's surprising
[04:14] because when george's series went up i
[04:16] mean there were so many people who
[04:17] wanted george do you know what i mean
[04:19] once the youtube series premiered and i
[04:21] know that's going to be the case with
[04:22] chop there's going to be so many people
[04:23] who'd be like i'd take that dog in a
[04:24] second all the more reason to follow us
[04:27] on instagram that is the only place i
[04:28] talk about that's where we announce
[04:30] these dogs months ahead of time before
[04:32] they ever make it to youtube so just fyi
[04:35] if you think
[04:36] you might uh want one of our future dogs
[04:39] follow us there we'll make it happen
[04:40] he's amazing look at him
[04:42] it's been raining pretty heavy all day
[04:45] so he hasn't had a ton of exercise today
[04:48] but
[04:49] it's good to know he can chill out
[04:51] on days like this i mean street dog to
[04:54] house dog legitimately look at him yeah
[04:57] he has so much love and i mean he's just
[04:59] such a big heart man it's amazing
[05:01] we got an email from some potential
[05:03] adopters that finally sounded like they
[05:05] could be exactly the family that we're
[05:07] looking for they check all the right
[05:09] boxes i mean they have a fenced yard
[05:11] great references they also do a lot of
[05:13] traveling and adventuring which
[05:16] would be incredible i would love to see
[05:19] chop out there in the snow maybe
[05:21] skijoring and steven is he does like
[05:24] biking in all seasons of force biking i
[05:27] don't even know what to call it but yeah
[05:28] it's like adventure biking and i think
[05:29] chop would love that he's like a hex
[05:31] athlete or like i don't know he just i
[05:34] mean this guy does everything i want
[05:37] this to work out i think that they're
[05:38] great i really want it to work they also
[05:40] want a playmate for their other dog
[05:42] shuggie yeah who loves other dogs and i
[05:44] would love to see chop end up in a home
[05:47] with another dog that likes to play like
[05:49] he does but first i want steven and
[05:51] sarah to meet chop and see how they like
[05:54] them we invited them over so that we
[05:55] could spend some time together and get
[05:58] to know one another i wanted to make
[05:59] sure that sarah and steven had as much
[06:01] time as they wanted with chop i mean
[06:03] this really is a huge decision for
[06:06] everyone involved and so far i'd say
[06:09] that chop really seems to like them
[06:11] everything is going well so far so i
[06:14] think we should take things outside i've
[06:15] got to say the more time that we spend
[06:17] together the better i'm feeling about
[06:19] these guys
[06:20] i'm really seeing the potential for chop
[06:22] to have an unbelievable life with sarah
[06:25] and stephen and then it was time for
[06:28] shuggie their dog to meet chop and i'm
[06:30] thinking this is gonna go pretty
[06:31] smoothly chop loves dogs he's been
[06:34] hitting it off great with inertia i mean
[06:35] his biggest problem is that he loves
[06:37] dogs so much so they got their dog
[06:39] shuggie out of the car and we let the
[06:41] dogs investigate one another through our
[06:43] fence first they seem pretty interested
[06:45] in one another and look at those play
[06:47] bowels after a couple of minutes of this
[06:49] we decided to let shuggy through the
[06:51] fence shuggie ran in and was really
[06:53] excited to meet everyone but chop really
[06:56] wanted to interact with shuggy to say
[06:57] the least then it felt like to me a
[07:00] nightmare scenario unfolded
[07:09] here we are in the final stages of this
[07:11] series and i felt like in that moment
[07:14] every bit of training i had done with
[07:15] him was meaningless
[07:17] and even though he didn't bite shuggie
[07:19] and no harm was done obviously there are
[07:21] things that could have been done better
[07:24] here and i think we all need to learn
[07:25] from this and look i want to be the
[07:27] first one to take responsibility here
[07:29] anytime something like this happens it
[07:31] is on me i'm the one in charge and the
[07:33] one who should be teaching chop not to
[07:35] interact with another dog like that
[07:37] first and foremost i shouldn't have had
[07:39] shuggy in a position to not see chop
[07:42] approaching her i really think that chop
[07:44] just got way too over excited ran right
[07:47] over shuggie thinking that he could play
[07:50] however he wanted i think that he just
[07:52] was unsure i don't think he was like
[07:54] feeling vicious or anything you know
[07:56] from what i know of him i don't i agree
[07:57] with you now i know some of you might be
[07:59] quick to say that the reason we saw chop
[08:01] behave like this is because we haven't
[08:03] been allowing him to interact in public
[08:05] very much with other dogs but remember
[08:07] that is by design because there's a time
[08:09] and there's a place to interact with
[08:11] dogs and in public while on leash is not
[08:13] the ideal place to do that so i was kind
[08:16] of shaken up by this because i really
[08:19] really wanted to work with these people
[08:21] if they want him if they determine this
[08:23] is the right dog for them because you
[08:24] can tell they are two people who are
[08:26] going to give their life to this dog and
[08:29] commit to training him and just loving
[08:31] him and everything you want for in a
[08:34] family at this point i'm basically
[08:36] expecting them just to be like bye i'm
[08:38] gone yeah thanks right thanks probably
[08:42] not gonna work out whatever your scary
[08:43] dog but i'm gonna move on but sarah and
[08:46] steven stayed to talk with us about what
[08:49] had happened and they agreed with our
[08:50] analysis that shuggy was definitely
[08:53] startled by chop's less than polite
[08:55] greeting and that it may have just been
[08:57] a poor first impression and at this
[08:59] point we really took some time to
[09:00] reevaluate and determine whether it was
[09:03] appropriate or even fair to the dogs to
[09:05] try again and we decided to go about it
[09:07] differently and give the dogs another
[09:09] shot once they had a chance to calm down
[09:11] this time we moved much slower and gave
[09:14] them even more time to get to know each
[09:16] other through the fence first and this
[09:18] is much more of what i was expecting
[09:20] that's a look i've seen chop give
[09:21] inertia a thousand times when he really
[09:24] wants to play with her this time we put
[09:26] a muzzle on chop to be extra safe and we
[09:28] brought chuggy into the yard again but
[09:30] we made sure to give her a minute to get
[09:31] her bearings this time because they were
[09:33] both looking happy and ready to play we
[09:36] let them give it a go and this is the
[09:38] chop i expected to see they did well for
[09:40] several minutes even though chop was a
[09:42] little distracted by his muzzle since he
[09:45] and chuggy seemed so much more relaxed
[09:47] and both of them seemed really
[09:48] comfortable i decided to take off chop's
[09:50] muzzle and just like that they were like
[09:53] a match made in heaven so while things
[09:54] could have gone smoother this was
[09:56] definitely a good recovery and look it
[09:59] doesn't necessarily go this smoothly
[10:01] every time in many cases i wouldn't even
[10:03] attempt another interaction after an
[10:05] introduction like this at least not on
[10:07] the same day but every case is different
[10:10] and in this particular instance for the
[10:12] reasons i mentioned earlier i thought it
[10:14] was okay to try again in the end they
[10:16] got along so well but i know from
[10:18] experience having had a dog who's been
[10:20] in altercations before that is the one
[10:23] thing you remember about that day and i
[10:26] am just really afraid that we may have
[10:28] messed this up for chop i really want
[10:30] this to work i would sincerely
[10:32] feel quite guilty if he misses out on a
[10:35] home like this
[10:36] because i didn't prepare him to behave
[10:39] correctly
[10:40] so we did hear from sarah and stephen
[10:43] and after thinking it over they really
[10:45] want to adopt chop if it's best for chop
[10:48] and shaggy as much as we think they're
[10:51] great and as much as we love the fact
[10:53] that they love chop what matters most is
[10:55] whether those two dogs are going to get
[10:57] along so we thought it would be a good
[10:58] idea to get some more data and see how
[11:02] chop and chuggy would do together we
[11:04] still have to do a home check anyway to
[11:06] make sure that they have a great place
[11:07] for chop to live we are on our way right
[11:10] now to go do a home check for chop to
[11:12] see if this place has everything we're
[11:15] looking for for his new home so
[11:19] yeah i know it's getting real very
[11:21] quickly here
[11:22] i just really want to do the right thing
[11:24] for this dog they live near this awesome
[11:27] park
[11:29] yeah this is one of the reasons that i
[11:31] also was excited about these people
[11:34] i mean not that you have to live near a
[11:36] park to get a dog-like chop but it's
[11:38] certainly a plus so i think it's
[11:41] really cool here i think he's gonna do
[11:42] great here you can see how he can really
[11:45] run they'll have to do some on lead
[11:46] training for a while as he gets
[11:47] acclimated everything looked fantastic
[11:50] at sarah in steven's house this is
[11:52] definitely a new interesting place for
[11:54] chop and he's immediately interested in
[11:56] lots of different things that are at
[11:57] head level for him i think he's going to
[11:59] need a reminder on how to leave things
[12:01] alone
[12:03] leave it alone
[12:05] they obviously have an awesome yard for
[12:07] chop to play in but my biggest concern
[12:09] is what shuggie will think about him at
[12:12] their residence we reintroduced them and
[12:15] all i've got to say is that chop and
[12:17] shuggie got along even better than i
[12:19] hoped they would it seemed like they
[12:20] instantly remembered one another and
[12:22] that they were ready to pick right back
[12:24] up where they left off
[12:25] it's my favorite thing in the world
[12:28] to watch dogs play
[12:29] after that home check i feel like
[12:32] we've just won the lottery in terms of
[12:35] chops future i think it went super well
[12:38] i love how well he got along with
[12:39] shuggie it seemed like chop loved the
[12:41] house it seemed like sarah and steven
[12:43] loved chop they seem awesome
[12:46] really committed the fence is a little
[12:48] low out there but they're instructed and
[12:50] they seem very committed to supervising
[12:52] him or even having him on lead if
[12:53] necessary since he was very stable
[12:55] playing with shuggy their other dog i
[12:57] would get them in the habit of doing
[12:58] that early in the day and then
[13:01] let them focus on training one-on-one
[13:03] with chop like in the backyard on a long
[13:05] lead if necessary with fetch and
[13:07] obedience and things like that i think
[13:10] it's gonna work out pretty good yes i
[13:12] think so too oh i feel so relieved i'm
[13:14] so excited it's our last night with chop
[13:17] this will be one of their last play
[13:20] sessions together
[13:22] today
[13:24] i think he's come a long way in the last
[13:26] few weeks
[13:27] i'm happy for him to get as dirty as
[13:29] tired as he wants
[13:31] both of them for that matter
[13:35] oh god it's so muddy out here i probably
[13:38] spoke too soon
[13:39] i mean
[13:41] i was i was going to give him a bath
[13:44] i mean i am going to give him a pound
[13:46] and now i'm gonna have to give it nurse
[13:47] come on guys here let's go over here
[13:52] oh
[13:56] yeah the yard has gotten totaled we've
[13:58] gotten some rain
[14:03] look at that see she yelps but she's
[14:05] right back in it she doesn't shut down
[14:06] and go
[14:07] try to hide or anything her confidence
[14:09] level
[14:11] top-notch these days
[14:16] apparently so
[14:21] let me see if i can break them up
[14:24] hey inertia take a break chop come he's
[14:26] been getting better about that too been
[14:28] able to call him off play and chill him
[14:30] out when he gets too rambunctious it's
[14:32] so hard to say
[14:34] goodbye to chop i'm gonna miss him
[14:36] dearly i always ask myself when i spend
[14:39] significant time with a dog like this
[14:41] what did i learn from the experience i
[14:42] feel like chop has taught me how to be
[14:44] more patient he's reinforced the idea of
[14:46] how loving and genuine dogs are and how
[14:50] hard they're willing to try if you just
[14:52] take the time to show them and be
[14:54] patient with them he taught me that i
[14:55] really like a dog with a floppy ear
[14:58] i do appreciate that what do you guys
[15:00] feel like you've learned
[15:02] from the chop series i mean every dog is
[15:04] unique in their own way and they just
[15:07] teach you so much
[15:08] i really want to enjoy every single
[15:11] minute i can with him we wanted to give
[15:12] him some fresh air at the park
[15:15] whoa
[15:19] please don't poop on me
[15:21] i gave him a bath you're gonna have a
[15:23] good life
[15:24] sir you're going to a great place you
[15:28] know that
[15:29] and now the time has come we're in the
[15:32] final moments of our time with
[15:34] chop right now he's in the back what are
[15:36] you thinking i feel so emotional i am
[15:40] thinking about how he's just starting
[15:42] this like whole lifetime of experiences
[15:45] with this new family and like how they
[15:47] say your life flashes before your eyes
[15:49] i'm trying to future do that with chop
[15:51] and i feel like it's gonna be great i
[15:53] feel so good i'm going to miss them how
[15:55] about you i just really want to go in
[15:57] there i want to focus on them and chop i
[16:00] really just want to make sure they feel
[16:02] comfortable and
[16:03] i want to do everything i can
[16:05] to make the transition as smooth as
[16:08] possible for
[16:09] chop ready to do this i guess pulling up
[16:12] to their house every time we see sarah
[16:14] and steven we feel even better about
[16:16] them than before they were so excited to
[16:19] welcome chop into their family and i
[16:21] have to say it's been a little while now

[00:00] [Music]
[00:01] right now george is currently getting
[00:02] posted we're filming chop and we're
[00:05] casting for the next series which i
[00:08] think is going to be a puppy we're going
[00:09] to a place where i heard there are 20
[00:12] rescue homeless puppies needing homes if
[00:15] we're going to a place with 20 puppies i
[00:16] have to show you what if we did a series
[00:18] where we cast all of them please
[00:22] really come on not oh my god okay i
[00:24] can't move no no maybe not
[00:27] these puppies are from multiple litters
[00:29] and they get flown into this rescue from
[00:31] remote isolated villages throughout
[00:33] alaska i want to get to know as many of
[00:35] these puppies as i can i mean each and
[00:37] every one of them are incredible but
[00:39] we're looking for a certain something to
[00:41] stick out to us for the star of this
[00:43] series
[00:44] oh my gosh look at your eyes you look
[00:46] ridiculous one of the things that i look
[00:48] for when i'm looking at puppies i mean i
[00:50] personally love a dog that likes to play
[00:52] and interact with me
[00:54] so far she's ticking that box but so
[00:58] little look at this dog often for a lot
[01:01] of people a lower energy puppy is
[01:03] probably more ideal than a higher energy
[01:05] one the advantage with lower energy dogs
[01:08] is they're more likely to just chill and
[01:10] give you your space and not require
[01:12] maybe as much attention as a higher
[01:14] energy dog i just can't stop thinking
[01:16] about how brave that tiniest puppy was i
[01:19] mean i'm watching her she's basically
[01:20] getting trampled by all of these bigger
[01:22] dogs and she seems really resilient i
[01:25] mean who doesn't love
[01:27] an underdog she's literally under a lot
[01:29] of dogs right now so i wanted to have
[01:32] one more look at her oh my gosh hello
[01:35] hi
[01:36] oh she's adorable i like her energy so
[01:39] much
[01:40] i think this would be my choice i'm zach
[01:43] george this is my wife bri and our dog
[01:45] inertia and this is biscuits the rescue
[01:48] dog she's only 13 weeks old and
[01:50] completely untrained
[01:52] i teach dogs and i teach people how to
[01:55] teach their dogs using the most modern
[01:57] dog behavior science which shows us that
[01:59] using frequent corrections when training
[02:01] our dogs only holds us back so i'll have
[02:04] to keep biscuits loving training for
[02:06] maximum results in the weeks ahead but
[02:08] look just because it's more effective
[02:10] doesn't mean it's magic and my plans
[02:12] don't always go as intended not only
[02:14] does biscuits have to learn all of her
[02:16] basics but she has to get properly
[02:18] socialized in order to be prepared for
[02:20] her new life ahead in this magical place
[02:23] known as alaska you're not going to want
[02:25] to miss a single episode subscribe and
[02:28] click the bell this is reality dog
[02:30] training biscuits edition
[02:34] we are picking up biscuits and i already
[02:37] know that going into this one of my very
[02:39] very top priorities is going to be
[02:41] getting potty training and house
[02:43] training under control as soon as
[02:46] possible how long do you think it'll be
[02:48] until there's a potty accident really
[02:50] because she's not potty trained at all
[02:52] nope it's not a matter of if it's a
[02:54] matter when and how much
[02:57] okay so i have video evidence no
[03:01] that the best intentions alone are you
[03:03] serious are not enough to potty train a
[03:06] puppy god but i'm getting ahead of
[03:08] myself the first thing i do with any new
[03:11] puppy is show them where to go so we got
[03:13] a potty area out here for her
[03:16] gonna let her smell by the way you hear
[03:18] that wind
[03:19] here in the alaskan chugach mountains
[03:21] the winds can be insane good girl oh
[03:25] that's a pee
[03:27] good girl okay
[03:29] our neighbors stopped by we got a big
[03:30] windstorm coming tonight it might be a
[03:32] big one yeah oh yeah and he dropped off
[03:34] some moose bones too our hunting group
[03:36] got two moose well thank you that's
[03:38] great alaska is truly a different world
[03:42] i have a feeling this is going to be a
[03:44] very eventful first 24 hours biscuits
[03:48] appears to be a little extra reserved or
[03:51] even nervous upon first coming into our
[03:53] house i know inertia just adores puppies
[03:56] i think it's time to give them a quick
[03:58] introduction to help biscuits feel a
[04:00] little more at home but i'm going to
[04:02] start small i want to keep this first
[04:03] introduction nice and brief and as
[04:05] expected inertia is very excited to meet
[04:08] biscuits but i'm still going to remind
[04:09] her to be gentle and not overly playful
[04:12] after all she's had some much rougher
[04:14] playmates very recently with our other
[04:16] foster dogs being sweet who's a sweet
[04:18] girl but nurse is doing wonderful look
[04:20] at her she's being very polite she's
[04:22] sniffing and then backing off and she
[04:25] appears to intentionally not be
[04:27] overwhelming biscuits
[04:29] and biscuits is looking a little bit
[04:31] more curious and i know she's in good
[04:33] hands with inertia so i'll put her down
[04:35] to see how she feels biscuits is a
[04:37] little hesitant but i think they'll open
[04:39] up this is just a lot for biscuits to
[04:40] take
[04:41] you can see how she's up here and that's
[04:43] fine for now
[04:47] she's curious but she's like i don't
[04:49] know this dog that's pretty good you
[04:51] know it's clear to me that inertia is
[04:53] eager to engage in play but biscuits
[04:55] isn't quite feeling it yet and that's
[04:58] natural it is a lot to take in from
[05:00] biscuit's perspective so i'm going to
[05:02] put inertia up and give biscuits some
[05:04] space to let her absorb all of what's
[05:06] going on here i think we're just going
[05:07] to give her a little bit of time to
[05:08] unwind out here the thing is
[05:11] normally you say we should attach her
[05:12] with a leash but she's never worn one
[05:14] she's never worn a harness or leash to
[05:16] my knowledge at all obviously
[05:17] introducing a leash and a harness and a
[05:19] collar are high on my priority list but
[05:22] there's a different trick in my toolbox
[05:23] that might actually help me get some
[05:25] sleep tonight too before we go any
[05:27] further i want to teach biscuits her
[05:29] very first word let me teach her the
[05:32] word yes before i introduce her to her
[05:35] new crate yes is such a great word to
[05:38] train a dog since we know positive
[05:40] reinforcement can be so effective we
[05:42] want to find ways to say yes and follow
[05:44] it up with something our dog likes as
[05:46] often as we can to teach her yes all i'm
[05:48] doing is saying yes when she looks at me
[05:51] or pays attention to me in any way the
[05:53] key is i'm trying to mark the exact
[05:55] moment she does something i like by
[05:57] saying the word yes and literally every
[06:00] single time i say yes i'm going to
[06:02] attempt to follow it up with something
[06:04] that biscuits really likes and she
[06:07] appears to like food so i'll be using
[06:09] her meals to train her quite a bit yes
[06:12] just because she turned in my direction
[06:14] is why i said yes i gave her the treat
[06:16] so you can see how this might be really
[06:18] powerful if you can let your dog know
[06:20] what you like in really strong terms yes
[06:24] you discover that they are looking for
[06:27] ways to make you say yes so they can get
[06:29] whatever it is they're interested in
[06:32] yes oh i love that she responded to that
[06:34] noise i made i definitely want to mark
[06:36] that and reward that and so as long as
[06:38] i'm consistent it really is a good way
[06:40] to start building communication i really
[06:42] want to minimize or even do my best to
[06:45] eliminate correcting where possible i'm
[06:47] getting a good feeling about this girl
[06:50] i think she's really getting the point
[06:52] with yes i think she's gonna start to
[06:54] understand what that means in context
[06:56] and i think we can start right now with
[06:58] this transformer crate i mean honestly
[07:00] this is the most unusual innovative
[07:03] crate i have ever seen in my life i'm
[07:04] going slow because she's never seen this
[07:06] so i want to make sure that she doesn't
[07:08] get nervous
[07:09] of a moving part but look at this crates
[07:12] can be an amazing way to manage your
[07:14] dog's environment which is a key part of
[07:17] raising a dog on one very important
[07:20] condition and that is that they really
[07:23] enjoy the crate that they like being in
[07:25] there look at this
[07:28] snaps up like that yes
[07:31] why am i saying yes she was so brave
[07:33] around the door going up for the first
[07:35] time this is a very straightforward
[07:37] exercise to get started i'm just going
[07:39] to toss some treats into her crate and
[07:41] encourage her to go in there there's
[07:42] another door here
[07:44] see how she comes right back out let's
[07:46] see if we can get her voluntarily
[07:48] staying in there for a little bit longer
[07:51] this is fun so you can see here look at
[07:53] her overall body language she seems
[07:55] interested she's alert her tail is up
[07:58] her eyes are bright now i want to see if
[08:00] she'll go in all on her own when she
[08:02] does then i'll toss in the treat
[08:06] yes
[08:07] see the hesitancy before she came out
[08:09] there
[08:10] yes
[08:11] i want to catch her succeeding that's
[08:13] what we mean by positive reinforcement
[08:14] rather than saying no yes
[08:16] when she comes out
[08:18] we catch her doing the right thing and
[08:20] say yes
[08:22] right there and really try and burn it
[08:23] in her brain with her lunch let's see
[08:25] what happens if we go ahead and close
[08:27] one door good yes
[08:30] so i wanted her to get experiencing the
[08:32] door closed
[08:34] seeing it open
[08:36] all right so she's doing
[08:38] a little hey what's this
[08:40] she got a little hesitant there when i
[08:41] close the door whenever you notice your
[08:43] puppy looking a little hesitant or
[08:45] unsure it's really best to take the time
[08:47] to give them a more positive association
[08:50] right away you can do that by going at
[08:52] your puppy's pace and not rushing them
[08:54] and pairing every potentially scary
[08:56] experience with lots of great treats all
[08:59] right so far so good yes
[09:03] see i'm trying to override that instinct
[09:05] to come out because her desire is to
[09:06] come back to me and look for more food
[09:08] you notice how the metal on this is
[09:10] diagonal this diamond shaped pattern
[09:12] isn't just for looks though i do like
[09:14] the looks of it it actually helps
[09:16] prevent injury to a dog's jaws or their
[09:18] paws it's very clear that safety was of
[09:21] the utmost importance when they were
[09:23] designing this crate it's not often you
[09:25] see a major change in the design of
[09:27] crates but i think diggs really nailed
[09:29] this one if you guys want to try the
[09:30] crate i'm going to have a link below
[09:32] okay we're getting somewhere with
[09:33] biscuits crate training but it's
[09:35] definitely too premature to declare
[09:37] victory just yet puppies need a lot of
[09:39] rest throughout the day and biscuits has
[09:41] had a pretty long day so far so i'm
[09:43] gonna try to shift my strategy and use
[09:46] this nap to my advantage
[09:48] what if we made it more inviting by
[09:50] putting a bed in it what do you think we
[09:52] have an extra bed lying around here but
[09:54] it's one fluffy bed i like that i have
[09:57] the option to be able to put my hand in
[09:59] here to encourage her to come in like
[10:01] that i'm gonna go ahead and throw some
[10:02] beef jerky in there as well this is dog
[10:05] beef jerky let me just let her think
[10:06] about it and see if she goes in there
[10:07] ideally it would be good if she went in
[10:09] there started chewing on it while i left
[10:11] the door open
[10:13] okay i see
[10:14] it's like that huh
[10:18] oh easy there
[10:20] did you hear that growling right there
[10:22] we definitely need to address that this
[10:24] is a high value thing to her we'll have
[10:26] a lesson around that at some other point
[10:28] here good go get it
[10:30] now there she goes see that i'm gonna
[10:33] let her come right back out so there is
[10:34] a chew in there she knows it's there my
[10:36] guess is she'll go back and investigate
[10:39] i've got both doors open good girl i'm
[10:42] kind of freaking out a little bit bree
[10:43] about the crate training because i have
[10:45] to sleep tonight do you see how she's
[10:47] falling asleep naturally
[10:48] i was thinking maybe we could once she
[10:50] falls asleep gently place her in there
[10:52] this is a dog training hack that we
[10:54] learned with our puppy inertia if you
[10:56] can catch your puppy taking a good nap
[10:58] and then gently move them into their
[11:00] crate while they're sleeping and
[11:01] unconscious you can set them up to wake
[11:04] up feeling comfy and relaxed inside
[11:07] their crate the more literal minutes
[11:09] that i can have her spend in that crate
[11:11] while she's not feeling stressed out the
[11:13] more likely it is she'll come to accept
[11:15] being in her crate i don't know how to
[11:17] get out of here
[11:19] i don't know either
[11:20] hypothesis supported so far she's in the
[11:23] crate she's sleeping i think we go ahead
[11:25] and
[11:26] leave the door open since she's asleep
[11:28] anyway so if she does wake up she can
[11:30] come out but i really just want to
[11:32] slowly get her comfortable spending time
[11:34] in there because we saw a little while
[11:36] until bed
[11:37] and so this is a really great way to
[11:39] gently introduce
[11:41] the crate to her
[11:43] imagine she'll wake up shortly i
[11:44] probably don't want her sleeping too
[11:46] much because i want to sleep tonight i'm
[11:49] going to sleep in the bedroom i hope
[11:50] hopefully she'll just be like this and
[11:52] sleep through the night if i can steal
[11:53] eight hours overnight with her being
[11:55] comfortable and stress-free while she
[11:57] sleeps in her crate that's eight more
[11:59] hours in her cumulative bank of
[12:01] experience of relaxed positive great
[12:04] time but there's one kind of major
[12:06] complication with my plans to have
[12:08] biscuits sleep through the night that
[12:10] major windstorm is still headed our way
[12:13] and alaska does not do weather in
[12:15] moderation at all even biscuits notices
[12:19] that there's something very off and
[12:21] different about the weather when we were
[12:22] here over the winter we had a wind storm
[12:24] i wasn't positive i was gonna survive
[12:30] oh my gosh the glass vibrates you can
[12:33] see it flexing i might be going in that
[12:35] crate with her to seek refuge so the
[12:38] winds are picking up out here letting
[12:39] the dogs out watch this classic puppy
[12:42] fake out here biscuits think she's done
[12:45] with her potty break but i'm telling you
[12:47] that dog is lying to me well done come
[12:49] on let's go potty
[12:53] never trust a puppy true words
[12:56] you're such a little dog good girl
[13:00] see that pee could have been in my
[13:02] living room nice
[13:04] i'm feeling pretty good about this potty
[13:07] training i think it's gonna go smoothly
[13:08] perfectly we may never have a potty
[13:10] accident in the house at all biscuits
[13:12] doesn't have any experience with a
[13:14] collar or harness yet if i approach this
[13:17] too aggressively i run the serious risk
[13:19] of causing her to be less trusting of me
[13:21] since i only have a few weeks with her i
[13:24] must avoid as many setbacks as i
[13:27] possibly can but i have to get this
[13:28] collar on her i have to get this lesion
[13:30] harness on her and i have to do it in a
[13:33] way that gets her to trust me my goal
[13:35] here is to introduce her to this collar
[13:39] and then her harness in a way that
[13:41] doesn't freak her out hopefully all i'm
[13:42] doing is i'm trying to just break this
[13:44] down into a few steps
[13:46] yes good
[13:47] i think she might think it's a toy
[13:49] immediately but don't want her biting it
[13:51] yes
[13:53] okay all right why why can nothing go
[13:56] smoothly with you it must be a foreign
[13:58] concept to a dog when you try to put
[14:00] something around their neck like this
[14:01] see how she backed away there that's not
[14:03] ideal i need to probably go a little bit
[14:04] slower you can see how this might be
[14:06] daunting good
[14:08] being able to touch her with it see just
[14:09] getting her comfortable with it yes
[14:13] she's free to opt out anytime and so far
[14:17] she's not opting out which is good
[14:19] there's a little bit of an opt-out when
[14:21] a dog opts out that's usually a sign
[14:23] that we're moving too quickly so it's
[14:24] important to pay attention to that kind
[14:26] of feedback i think really she's backing
[14:28] up mainly because she's like hey let me
[14:30] grab that toy more than out of fear let
[14:32] me see what happens if i go ahead and
[14:34] put her whole food bowl there maybe
[14:35] that'll distract her oh look at this hey
[14:39] we did it yes
[14:41] good let's see how she reacts i
[14:42] definitely want to follow it up with
[14:43] some extra rewards so far so good gosh
[14:46] she looks so good with that but the
[14:48] collar is really just a thing to hold
[14:51] her tag on so that she can be identified
[14:53] if need be so it's time for the harness
[14:55] i'm just going to let her investigate it
[14:56] yes but i don't want her thinking it's a
[14:59] toy so hopefully i can get her focused
[15:01] on that food before she starts picking
[15:03] it up it's much safer to use a harness
[15:06] with a dog especially that still pulls
[15:07] on the leash or if they're young so
[15:09] you're not having that extra tension
[15:10] around their neck we try to avoid that
[15:12] let her see it let her smell it
[15:15] touch under her chin there not over her
[15:18] head dogs tend to get a little bit more
[15:20] nervous when you come in over their head
[15:21] so staying beneath their eye line
[15:24] good yes i'm just gonna go ahead and
[15:27] give her treats for every
[15:30] non-nervous interaction she's scratching
[15:32] because there's something new and
[15:34] foreign on her neck that's pretty normal
[15:36] some people might be like come on just
[15:37] put it on already but really the main
[15:39] reason i'm running through these steps
[15:41] is i think it's a great illustration of
[15:42] how going seemingly slow and putting a
[15:44] bunch of little tiny steps in there can
[15:47] get you to where you want to be faster
[15:49] even though it seems like man that would
[15:51] take much longer it actually doesn't it
[15:53] actually is quicker to take your time
[15:55] and i'm not going to say that oh she's
[15:56] just going to love wearing her harness
[15:58] instantly but we need to make a good
[15:59] faith effort to make sure she does look
[16:01] at that i haven't really started former
[16:03] lore training with her at all but she's
[16:06] yes she's doing quite well there we go
[16:09] look at this
[16:11] good i can go up and down i'm going to
[16:13] steal it while i'm here because she's
[16:14] doing so well good girl and i'm going to
[16:16] continue to follow up with treats i did
[16:19] go much quicker that time didn't i but
[16:20] she's i mean i'm just looking at her
[16:22] overall body language her tails nice and
[16:24] up she's taking treats pretty easily
[16:26] right now a nervous dog doesn't always
[16:28] take treats here so there you can see
[16:31] she's getting a little weirded out by it
[16:32] good job so i will take it off just
[16:34] because she did start to get a little
[16:35] nervous there biting at the harness
[16:38] leash or collar like this is really
[16:40] common with new dogs puppies are curious
[16:42] they're going to explore things wait
[16:44] wait what are you doing hey let me see
[16:46] if i can divert her attention onto some
[16:48] new exciting toys in the aim of showing
[16:50] her how to properly behave here hey
[16:52] what's this her natural fetch
[16:56] is looking great
[16:59] yeah good good i want to keep it that
[17:01] way so i'm going to play a little tug
[17:03] with her when she brings it to me let
[17:04] her win a little bit this is the
[17:06] two-month pup box and they know exactly
[17:08] what we need this nylo bone came in our
[17:10] pup box as well there's still one more
[17:12] thing that we have to introduce to make
[17:14] sure we can manage her and that is her
[17:16] leash probably the most important
[17:18] management tool of all same thing with
[17:20] the leash here just let her know it's
[17:22] here rather than surprise her with it
[17:25] let her feel the buckle
[17:27] so she knows what that's like she's so
[17:28] excited by the bone and this is good
[17:30] this is exactly where i want her when
[17:32] i'm training her i want her in this like
[17:34] curious happy state of mind
[17:37] see let her see it tap her with it you
[17:39] can see she's reacting normal there very
[17:41] interested in the stuff around her we do
[17:44] this because some dogs will immediately
[17:46] freak out the second they feel tension
[17:47] that they realize they're restrained
[17:49] and if we can avoid that that's only
[17:51] going to work to our advantage i've
[17:53] attached it to her harness here and i'm
[17:55] sure we're going to see some leash
[17:56] biting but this is good so i'm going to
[17:58] let her run around with the leash
[18:00] attached to her rather than guiding her
[18:01] immediately getting her comfortable with
[18:03] it i'm doing that to avoid tension for
[18:05] just a second and then i'm going to
[18:07] introduce tension on the leash very
[18:09] delicately a little tension there and
[18:11] then i dropped it she did well if a dog
[18:13] was like whoa what was that then that
[18:15] would tell me okay slow down zach so
[18:17] what happens here because there okay
[18:18] there we go that's her first time like
[18:20] running and feeling the tension
[18:22] of the leash right there and she doesn't
[18:24] appear to be perceiving it as something
[18:26] that is aversive i want her focused on
[18:29] me up here this is actually technically
[18:31] her first leash walking lesson and if
[18:33] you've got a puppy remember pup box is
[18:34] going to send you items based on your
[18:36] dog's specific age which will help keep
[18:38] your training on track what really
[18:40] differentiates pupbox is that they send
[18:42] you this really detailed training card
[18:44] with a ton of advice centered around
[18:46] your puppy every single month and you
[18:48] can get fifty percent off your first pop
[18:50] box i'll have a link and discount code
[18:52] below okay so now i have possession of
[18:54] her i can attach her to my belt loop or
[18:56] my belt if i need to while i'm around
[18:58] the house or to let her drag with it so
[19:00] if she does start to get away from me
[19:01] she's a lot easier to get to or if she
[19:04] runs under the couch she's still a lot
[19:06] easier to get to of course that is
[19:08] something i need to be aware of leash
[19:10] biting is an inevitable part of
[19:12] puppyhood for a lot of puppies so
[19:16] i'm just going to focus on giving her
[19:18] the appropriate thing to bite on thank
[19:20] you pop box and i need to do that
[19:22] consistently it's not like you just do
[19:24] that four times and then your dog
[19:26] understands you kind of have to do it
[19:27] 400 times but go get it eventually
[19:30] biscuits is well rested and she's had
[19:32] some time to adapt let's give biscuits
[19:34] and inertia another chance at playing
[19:36] together oh this might be their first
[19:39] time playing
[19:40] puppy is now adapted here for a good bit
[19:43] and i'm letting inertia
[19:45] and biscuits have a little bit more time
[19:49] this gets us getting a bit more brave
[19:53] good girl
[19:54] looks like she's playing with a gerbil
[19:56] good girl i want to make sure that
[19:57] inertia stays pretty low-key and mellow
[20:00] enough anyway and look biscuits looks
[20:02] like she's opening up a little bit more
[20:03] and i want to point out she's free to
[20:05] retreat under that furniture anytime she
[20:07] wants to it seems like biscuits is
[20:09] feeling braver and inertia is trying to
[20:11] initiate play
[20:12] but it seems as though biscuits may have
[20:15] found some kind of loophole
[20:17] she's racing between all of our living
[20:19] room furniture
[20:20] it's so fun to see the games that dogs
[20:22] come up with to play with one another
[20:24] this relationship definitely looks like
[20:26] it's trending towards being amazing
[20:31] he's sweet
[20:33] did you hear that yeah
[20:35] it's a little growling there did you
[20:37] hear that growl it was potentially
[20:39] resource guarding resource guarding is
[20:40] where a dog protects something that they
[20:43] value it could be food it could be a
[20:45] bone it could be a stick a toy you name
[20:47] it anything a dog values at all it's
[20:49] extremely natural particularly for
[20:51] puppies i mean look at the competitive
[20:53] environment that puppies come up in and
[20:55] particularly biscuits being the smallest
[20:58] dog in that group had to really assert
[21:00] herself but there's a way to show dogs
[21:02] that they really don't need to feel so
[21:04] defensive and so i'll be focused on
[21:06] resolving this resource guarding as we
[21:08] move on i'm gonna put this up for now
[21:09] good job inertia you handled that very
[21:11] well so how are you feeling so far with
[21:13] this experience we're pretty early in it
[21:15] we've already had a little bit of
[21:16] resource guarding she's a little
[21:18] hesitant of the crate but i think she's
[21:19] going to be okay we'll see i just want
[21:22] to talk about that potty accident i mean
[21:24] i was hoping not to have it on literally
[21:26] the first day i understand the
[21:29] the rep has reviewed the footage from
[21:31] the security camera yeah here's the
[21:33] thing i just feel like the inner puppy
[21:36] parent inside of me
[21:38] just gave me the biggest face palm
[21:40] because she woke up from a nap
[21:42] why do you take a puppy out because they
[21:44] just woke up from a nap it's in my book
[21:46] and everything i know then she walked
[21:48] over and drank a bunch of water yep why
[21:50] do you take a puppy out because they
[21:52] drank a bunch of water yeah exactly
[21:54] and then she came to you okay and then
[21:57] me or me then you maybe right and then
[22:00] she peed right after that
[22:03] and look i'm not saying that she like
[22:05] tried really hard to let us know but i
[22:08] think there were some signs that we
[22:10] could have picked up on that we missed
[22:11] and i just feel like
[22:14] i also am very apprehensive about
[22:15] tonight this windstorm the crate thing
[22:19] i feel like you're not gonna get much
[22:20] sleep and i'm excited that i get to
[22:22] ignore that i think we should have you
[22:23] stay up with the dog one of these
[22:26] episodes hey zach yeah there's some
[22:28] destruction going on over here what on
[22:30] the carpet yeah
[22:33] good and i mean that's another form of
[22:35] management obviously supervision
[22:37] hey
[22:38] good oh goodness goodness hello okay go
[22:42] play so it still remains a mystery
[22:46] as to if i'm gonna be able to get any
[22:48] sleep or how tonight she doesn't look
[22:51] very tired yet one of the things that
[22:54] can be problematic when you bring a dog
[22:56] home the first night you haven't trained
[22:58] them they don't know anything yet i kind
[23:00] of break it down into two categories
[23:02] there's management and then there's like
[23:04] hands-on training if you're teaching a
[23:05] dog to sit or come but we have to manage
[23:07] them when we can't tend to them because
[23:09] nobody can send to their dog 24 hours a
[23:11] day management is just as important
[23:14] in many ways
[23:16] as
[23:17] training itself
[23:19] oh my goodness all right i can't focus
[23:21] she's biting on me let me see those
[23:22] teeth look at those teeth those puppy
[23:25] teeth of course one way we can get
[23:27] immediate traction on the biting because
[23:29] she doesn't understand the concept of
[23:30] being redirected she doesn't understand
[23:32] look at me she doesn't know how to sit
[23:34] those are all things that i would
[23:35] typically try to get her to do another
[23:37] thing that i could do is actually
[23:38] satisfy her desire to bite as long as
[23:41] it's on something acceptable what do we
[23:43] got here
[23:45] i just gave her a chew here
[23:48] i'm hanging out with her seeing if she
[23:49] gets comfortable chewing it so she's
[23:52] doing a lot better in there my hope is
[23:53] that this will condition her to like
[23:57] being in here i'm gonna be sleeping
[24:01] right there you're gonna sleep
[24:02] downstairs again so you can get a good
[24:04] night's sleep okay this is by far the
[24:07] most stressful part for me because the
[24:09] last thing that i want or that biscuits
[24:11] wants is to be crying and stressed out
[24:14] all night long but what i don't know yet
[24:16] is how long this is gonna last or how
[24:18] significant this anxiety really is so
[24:21] she's a little anxious i have a timer
[24:23] set right now i'm gonna see if she if
[24:25] the anxiety subsides
[24:27] the first night it's to be expected but
[24:30] we've just let her out she's had
[24:32] exercise
[24:33] so i'm gonna try for a few minutes at a
[24:35] time if she doesn't settle down
[24:37] then what
[24:40] okay all right all right all right she's
[24:43] feeling anxious here but that's
[24:45] understandable all right we're gonna
[24:48] chill for a second i'm gonna try and
[24:50] put her at ease i mean i'm trying to see
[24:52] things from her perspective right
[24:55] as best as you can hey sweet girl hello
[25:00] are you
[25:02] she's had a lot changed in the last
[25:04] several hours she was just around dogs
[25:06] and all she's
[25:08] really ever known here she is with these
[25:10] people she doesn't know you're not gonna
[25:12] have free reign all over the bed not
[25:14] happening i think i'm gonna try to get
[25:16] her quiet get her sleeping here and then
[25:18] maybe place her in the crate
[25:20] later on when she falls asleep and
[25:22] relaxes so i don't know what the rules
[25:24] are gonna be at her new place
[25:27] wherever she ends up so i want to make
[25:28] sure she's comfortable but
[25:31] at the same time i might be asking her
[25:34] to do too much right now i think we
[25:36] might have to adopt
[25:37] a different strategy i mean really what
[25:39] is the harm can she can just sleep here
[25:43] okay
[25:45] problem fixed
[25:50] see
[25:50] you hear that
[25:52] these village dogs are amazing because
[25:55] they come from a part of alaska that is
[25:58] so remote that you can't even get there
[26:01] with a car so you actually have to fly
[26:03] in and they end up down here in
[26:05] anchorage for adoption and that's what
[26:08] she is she's from a remote alaskan
[26:10] village it's going to be interesting to
[26:12] find out what she's made of what do you
[26:14] guys think
[26:16] i'm guessing maybe a little chihuahua
[26:18] for sure not for sure it's very much a
[26:20] faux pas
[26:21] to
[26:22] try to guess what a dog is by looking at
[26:25] them
[26:26] as we saw with chop what was that he
[26:29] turned out to be a lab mix
[26:32] could not believe that i'll bet you
[26:34] there's definitely going to be a
[26:35] surprise in her dna there always is with
[26:38] these guys
[26:39] i mean i'm tempted to just pass out
[26:41] right here
[26:43] i'm just gonna i have to try as a dog
[26:45] trainer okay i've got to give it a test
[26:46] i can't just
[26:48] assume that this is where she should be
[26:51] so here we go
[26:52] and sit up zach
[27:02] okay
[27:04] that is how
[27:06] we address her underlying emotional
[27:09] issue we didn't have to scold her we
[27:11] didn't have to yell at her which is
[27:12] really good no discipline necessary
[27:15] we just needed to
[27:17] address her emotional state
[27:19] got her a little calm and for now
[27:21] she's relaxed what do you think pretty
[27:24] good night one i mean it's tough on
[27:26] night one that's pretty good
[27:32] she woke up she's chewing on her chew
[27:35] so i have some of her chews in there
[27:38] because
[27:39] she doesn't seem too bothered by me
[27:41] talking right now which is good but this
[27:43] is why i have like two or three
[27:45] different safe shoes
[27:47] inside her crate so she has options if
[27:48] she does wake up and doesn't immediately
[27:50] walk for something and that's also
[27:52] something she enjoys doing so we're
[27:54] hopefully getting a positive correlation
[27:56] with being in the crate by doing that
[27:58] it's really kind of magical to watch
[28:01] when it works
[28:02] i suppose the challenge sometimes is we
[28:04] don't know necessarily what to do to
[28:07] address the underlying issue i mean you
[28:10] know sometimes it's as easy as the dog
[28:12] is hungry or they have to go outside
[28:14] other times there's something that's
[28:15] making them more anxious in this case
[28:18] she's in a brand new place i think it's
[28:19] probably the simplest explanation
[28:21] there's been a lot of variables so we
[28:23] can just sum that up by saying change of
[28:26] environment so we'll see if she starts
[28:28] to whine or if she settles back down
[28:32] she just settled down
[28:38] okay
[28:41] i was unconscious six sections ago
[28:45] boy i was out okay what's happening
[28:51] would make a great soldier
[28:55] biscuits is awake again and this time it
[28:57] seems like she actually needs something
[29:03] all right let's go see if she wants to
[29:05] go inside
[29:09] so
[29:10] this is biscuits and me in the middle of
[29:12] the night in pitch dark alaska in a
[29:15] freezing cold windstorm trying to set a
[29:17] new world record for the fastest potty
[29:20] break
[29:22] mission accomplished
[29:24] i didn't want to put her just straight
[29:26] back in the crate and have her cry you
[29:27] can't sleep up here girl
[29:33] she made it like five hours four hours
[29:35] in the crate okay
[29:37] but then
[29:39] we were too
[29:40] tired
[29:42] i don't blame you
[29:43] the learning curve when raising every
[29:45] individual puppy is different and it's
[29:48] significant even for me to my knowledge
[29:50] biscuits has never been in a proper city
[29:54] and fortunately alaska does have one of
[29:56] those i mean just one but that's all we
[29:59] need she's going to see a city for the
[30:02] first time and it's going to become very
[30:04] apparent how much she has to learn over
[30:07] the next several weeks
[30:08] i mean we haven't even begun to get
[30:09] traction on potty training we've got to
[30:11] deal with things like puppy biting leash
[30:14] walking sit down stay come
[30:16] leave it
[30:17] look at me and all in the real world i

TRANSCRIPTION:

[00:00] there's been an interesting development
[00:01] between inertia and biscuits so that's
[00:04] something we've got to deal with right
[00:05] now plus biscuits needs to start
[00:07] learning how to pay attention to me when
[00:08] we walk and when we start putting all of
[00:10] this together in the actual real world
[00:13] and not just our living room subscribe
[00:16] and click the bell when biscuits first
[00:18] came to our house she was a little bit
[00:19] more hesitant than not about interacting
[00:21] with inertia and inertia has gone out of
[00:23] her way to make biscuits more
[00:25] comfortable with playing but perhaps
[00:27] inertia's strategy has backfired because
[00:29] now biscuits is getting maybe a little
[00:31] too confident around inertia
[00:35] one way that i like to temper this
[00:37] behavior rather than relying on inertia
[00:39] to take care of everything is to make
[00:40] sure that i'm doing my part to give
[00:42] biscuits the outlet she needs to run and
[00:44] bite and play
[00:48] [Music]
[00:52] look at the different textures here
[00:53] crinkle squeak i mean this is the dog
[00:56] toy perfected barkbox and super chewer
[00:59] box are incredible monthly subscription
[01:01] boxes they're magic mushrooms they are
[01:04] oh so you can pull them apart they
[01:06] really are magic mushrooms all right so
[01:09] she clearly likes the bark box what
[01:12] about super chewer super chewers for
[01:13] those dogs who are real hard on toys
[01:16] this comes off and there's a whole new
[01:17] toy before
[01:19] after super chewers for any size dog and
[01:22] i know in biscuits case she's definitely
[01:24] interested in different textures so this
[01:26] is a harder one she might be a super
[01:28] chewer dog after all with both boxes you
[01:31] get two bags of awesome treats bark has
[01:33] an insane deal right now they're going
[01:35] to give you a free memory foam dog bed
[01:37] when you sign up for a multi-month
[01:38] subscription of bark box or super chewer
[01:40] box or both these beds are really high
[01:42] quality they get great reviews and i
[01:44] honestly can't believe they're giving
[01:46] this away for free i'm gonna have a
[01:47] special link in the description this is
[01:50] first class
[01:52] right here this is good good play
[01:54] behavior love how a nurse is playing
[01:57] i love how she's kind of putting
[01:58] biscuits in her place a little bit
[02:00] sometimes biscuits is a little too
[02:02] confident good for an older dog like
[02:04] inertia to say hey
[02:06] chill a little bit
[02:08] very measured though
[02:10] this is all in good fun but there are
[02:12] times when biscuits energy is a little
[02:14] too much even for inertia and you can
[02:16] see that inertia's communication becomes
[02:18] a little bit more serious but she is
[02:20] still being extremely gentle here
[02:23] an appropriate correction from an adult
[02:25] dog is brief pointed and with no attempt
[02:27] to harm it's just about intervening and
[02:30] communicating there should be no obvious
[02:32] intent to escalate the altercation as
[02:34] far as the adult dog is concerned in
[02:36] other words this isn't exactly fight or
[02:38] flight since it doesn't seem to come
[02:39] from a place of fear or anger this falls
[02:41] more under dog to dog communication than
[02:43] it does a disproportionate fear response
[02:45] and not all dogs do this well a lot of
[02:47] this has to do with their personality
[02:49] their genetics and their socialization
[02:51] early in life inertia has been on both
[02:53] sides of this equation when she was a
[02:54] puppy our senior dog indiana was very
[02:57] good about showing inertia the limits of
[02:59] what was acceptable and what wasn't and
[03:01] now inertia is passing that knowledge
[03:03] onto biscuits we always make sure that
[03:05] both inertia and biscuits have a place
[03:07] that they can go if they need to take a
[03:08] break and hersha knows she can jump onto
[03:10] the couch to seek refuge unless biscuits
[03:13] manages to hang onto her neck and get
[03:15] dragged up there with her oh my god
[03:18] how'd that happen this gets used to her
[03:21] did she just drag did she get pulled up
[03:23] yes oh no no way biscuits that's where
[03:28] she goes to take a break biscuits
[03:30] i'm sorry but i have to remove you from
[03:32] inertia's take a break spot
[03:34] okay
[03:35] oh my gosh really
[03:39] yeah you tell her
[03:41] and what we just saw was a great
[03:44] measured correction by inertia that's
[03:46] exactly what i like to see in an older
[03:48] dog who's interacting with a puppy in
[03:50] terms of inertia kind of giving biscuits
[03:53] that correction saying hey little too
[03:55] rough don't bite my tail but not
[03:57] overreacting because biscuits was
[03:58] clearly
[03:59] going a bit far there
[04:01] hey girl but it's wonderful to see
[04:03] inertia feel comfortable enough to
[04:05] interact with her that way to provide
[04:07] the appropriate level of correction i
[04:09] mean there's kind of this thought out
[04:10] there that most dogs are quite forceful
[04:13] when they're trying to correct a puppy
[04:14] and while you saw inertia be a little
[04:16] physical she wasn't over the top she was
[04:19] very measured i know a lot of people are
[04:21] under the impression that oh dogs use
[04:24] force to communicate with each other
[04:25] therefore we should do it on them as
[04:27] well because that's what they understand
[04:29] intuitively that doesn't appear to
[04:31] really be true i mean if you ask any
[04:32] good breeder out there of dogs they're
[04:34] not going to continue to breed a dog who
[04:36] is overly aggressive to puppies or other
[04:39] dogs dogs are domestic animals before
[04:41] anything else they are selectively bred
[04:44] to listen to and take direction from
[04:46] people so if you're new to teaching your
[04:48] dog and you've heard this idea that dogs
[04:51] correct each other with their teeth and
[04:52] their physical and that's the language
[04:54] they understand keep in mind that's a
[04:56] dramatic oversimplification
[04:58] it looks like inertia has this perfectly
[05:00] under control now let's see if we can
[05:02] get biscuits to act less like a little
[05:04] terror and more like a model canine
[05:06] citizen i'm going to try something a
[05:08] little ambitious today i would love to
[05:11] start teaching her the concept of heel
[05:14] staying by my side when we walk and i
[05:17] thought it might be a good idea to
[05:18] introduce it inside here where it's
[05:21] still a pretty easy environment for
[05:22] let's see if i can get her to engage
[05:25] okay in a training session here
[05:28] here
[05:29] yes
[05:31] she gave me a glance sit
[05:33] all right looks like she's in the mood
[05:34] to do some training with me that's a
[05:35] good sign since i'm using her meal today
[05:38] that gives me permission to be extra
[05:39] liberal with her food rewards let's work
[05:42] on spin trust me this is relevant to
[05:44] teaching her how to heal or how to stay
[05:46] by my side when we both move yes good
[05:49] she's following that lure really well
[05:52] see that no treat in my hand good yes
[05:55] she is so good at that spin that i think
[05:57] she's ready to learn how to spin into
[06:00] that heel position yes she's a natural
[06:03] at that look at that by teaching
[06:05] biscuits how to spin and use all four of
[06:07] her legs to position herself like this
[06:09] that should set us up for rapid progress
[06:11] when we work on heel let me give you an
[06:12] idea of what we're working towards here
[06:14] these are some examples of inertia using
[06:16] a modified version of spin to achieve
[06:19] her heel position once i have her
[06:21] established in front of me like this i
[06:23] want to be able to get her over here by
[06:26] spinning into position so i've got her
[06:28] in front of me i'm going to get her into
[06:29] a stand
[06:30] trying to lure her
[06:33] right there yes
[06:35] i'm kind of cheating here because i'm
[06:36] trying to get her to back up that's okay
[06:38] yes and you can see how clunky and messy
[06:40] these things
[06:42] look to begin with i'm just trying to
[06:43] get her comfortable with this
[06:45] movement because
[06:47] it's a nice way to get your dog to
[06:48] understand how to use their body better
[06:50] which is good for future training if
[06:52] they're really good at walking backwards
[06:54] and spinning they're going to be more
[06:55] agile maybe less prone to injury if they
[06:57] know how to move their body very
[06:59] purposefully see how she's starting to
[07:00] back up there that's pretty cool and i'm
[07:02] constantly watching her for signs of
[07:04] frustration that she's becoming
[07:06] uninterested but so far i'm not seeing
[07:08] many signs it seems like she's willingly
[07:10] participating and enjoying the training
[07:12] session good
[07:14] yes here and ideally i'd like her to
[07:17] hold that stand yes
[07:19] when she does it it's right there
[07:22] here
[07:24] yes
[07:26] yes oh
[07:28] and okay good girl very good so she did
[07:31] great while we were on the ground
[07:32] together but i want to evolve this into
[07:34] something that looks more like an actual
[07:36] heel
[07:38] yes
[07:39] here
[07:40] good
[07:41] yes oh about that
[07:44] how about that yes
[07:47] yes
[07:48] okay i'm also trying to be clear about
[07:49] letting her know when the exercise is
[07:51] over by releasing her with the okay here
[07:53] once they start getting the motion of
[07:55] spinning around if you call them to you
[07:57] and then ask them to spin looks like at
[07:59] least in her case that might be a better
[08:02] way to get to heal a bit faster it looks
[08:04] like she's in the habit of sitting for a
[08:06] treat which for this training session is
[08:07] something that i'd like to discourage
[08:09] while i have her attention i'll treat
[08:11] her every second or so that she holds
[08:13] that heel position since that sit is now
[08:16] so predictable i can prevent it by
[08:18] encouraging an incompatible behavior
[08:20] that is keeping the heal session moving
[08:23] on so now i'm going to increase the
[08:25] criteria basically i'm only going to
[08:27] give her a treat while she's standing so
[08:29] when she sits she'll not get a treat
[08:32] yes
[08:35] yes see that very purposeful walk as she
[08:37] gets the hang of this the idea is to get
[08:40] her attention off of the treat here at
[08:42] some point yes she gave me a very subtle
[08:44] glance up to my eyes there here
[08:49] yes
[08:50] what was significant about that i don't
[08:51] know if you caught that there was no
[08:53] treat in my hand so now we've got our
[08:55] yes
[08:57] responding
[08:58] to a hand signal yes which we can over
[09:01] time evolve into something that's a
[09:03] little more practical having them being
[09:05] able to respond to your finger or signal
[09:08] is very useful in many other aspects of
[09:11] dog training outside of tricks until
[09:13] just a few moments ago biscuits would
[09:14] sit when she heard the word yes and knew
[09:16] a treat was coming but it looks like
[09:18] she's starting to understand that i'd
[09:19] prefer to have her standing for this
[09:21] exercise here
[09:24] come on
[09:25] she's brainstorming
[09:28] see how she's biting herself she could
[09:30] just have an itch or she could be
[09:31] getting a little frustrated that might
[09:32] be my cue to give her a break or do
[09:34] something easier but that was an
[09:36] incredible first session so that is the
[09:38] state of
[09:40] biscuits puppy heel right now biscuits
[09:43] has been learning how to be brave in
[09:44] some pretty intense places for a little
[09:46] puppy but today we're going to show her
[09:48] some things that would give any puppy
[09:50] pause i think she's ready though time to
[09:53] find out we brought biscuits out to this
[09:56] park that i really like but i'm kind of
[09:59] having second thoughts right now because
[10:01] i forget how loud the jets are that come
[10:03] over here but now that we're here i'm
[10:04] like i don't know and bri you know
[10:07] because sounds are so important for
[10:09] puppies to get used to we should like
[10:11] deliberately introduce a lot of sounds i
[10:13] know it might seem trivial but dogs
[10:15] often develop disproportionate responses
[10:17] to natural and artificial sounds like
[10:20] electronic motors or vacuums or anything
[10:22] else training yourself to deliberately
[10:25] introduce things like sounds that you do
[10:27] have control over is likely to set your
[10:29] dog up for success try the sunroof
[10:35] good girl
[10:36] nice job nice calm reaction love it this
[10:39] place is famous for very loud jets
[10:41] flying directly above so i'll want to do
[10:43] my best to give her an introduction to
[10:45] this type of sound plus have a way to
[10:47] reduce the volume of the jet should she
[10:49] get nervous this is going to take some
[10:51] ingenuity on our part but it's better to
[10:54] do gradual introductions to things where
[10:57] possible that's why we're sitting here
[10:59] waiting for a plane to fly over so she
[11:00] can hear it in this more controlled
[11:03] setting you know i just roll down the
[11:04] window there i can modify the volume of
[11:07] the jet flying above by
[11:10] changing the window see that isn't that
[11:12] neat yes so that's something and that in
[11:14] and of itself makes a sound and she's
[11:16] reacting really well you can see that
[11:17] she's noticing it it looks like our
[11:19] first jet is going to fly over right now
[11:30] have you noticed that like when you're
[11:31] holding her and something does surprise
[11:33] her you'll feel her heart rate really
[11:35] accelerated it's a really good indicator
[11:37] as to her state of mind but here when
[11:40] she's sitting on me and still feel her
[11:42] muscles loose whereas if she woke up and
[11:44] was like oh no she would kind of tense
[11:46] up looks good she reacted well and i
[11:47] think we're good to move forward i still
[11:49] want to verify though that she isn't
[11:51] startled of that jet when she's outside
[11:54] of the car
[11:58] little increase it caught our attention
[12:00] more than it did in there but still an
[12:02] acceptable reaction it looks like
[12:04] different perspective seeing people walk
[12:07] seeing dogs from above i'm still
[12:09] noticing that initial shaking which
[12:11] might indicate excitement it might
[12:13] indicate a little nervousness but it has
[12:15] been subsiding every time that we've
[12:18] gotten one of these
[12:20] training sessions underway or in this
[12:21] case it's going to be a free walk you
[12:23] think about that see the water
[12:26] there's dogs down there you can see
[12:28] there's quite a bit of people here she's
[12:30] so uncertain about all this she's
[12:32] probably never seen a ground quite like
[12:34] this either let's see what she makes of
[12:35] the water over here what do you think
[12:37] now these waves certainly while small to
[12:40] us must look much bigger and she's just
[12:42] bolting towards the water right now most
[12:44] likely the first time she's ever seen
[12:46] waves this is a weird planet huh
[12:49] interesting see that good girl that's
[12:52] neat huh you can see this is probably
[12:54] the most anxiety she's had so let's try
[12:56] and keep her under threshold here we're
[12:58] gonna counter condition her since she's
[13:00] having somewhat of a fearful reaction
[13:02] letting her back away at will
[13:05] she's not like shut down fearful i think
[13:07] she's just more apprehensive and that
[13:09] would make a lot of sense not so into a
[13:11] toy right now or are you let's see how
[13:13] about this i wonder if i can get her
[13:15] playing around the water here that's a
[13:18] good way to measure confidence see how
[13:19] she's playing right here she gets a
[13:20] little apprehensive when she sees one of
[13:22] those waves come up here
[13:26] yes
[13:29] so
[13:30] i've been able to put my hand out here
[13:32] look at how brave she's getting for this
[13:34] food and i'm not making her do it i'm
[13:36] just seeing if she'll go for it and if
[13:38] she doesn't feel like it that's okay too
[13:39] there's no reason for her to get into
[13:41] the water i just want her being more
[13:42] comfortable with something and show her
[13:44] how to overcome something that she's a
[13:45] little apprehensive of confidence
[13:47] building but you can see she's getting
[13:49] more and more comfortable with it this
[13:51] isn't like a sandy beach this is very
[13:53] rocky so i want to get her used to
[13:55] different surfaces too one of the things
[13:57] i just love about small dogs like this
[13:59] it's a lot easier to ease them into the
[14:01] environment because most of them are
[14:02] going to feel more secure when you hold
[14:04] them but then you know once you feel
[14:05] they've adapted you can put them down
[14:07] and we'll see if that does anything for
[14:09] us today you look at her
[14:11] she's like what is this place
[14:14] completely new type of ground for her to
[14:16] walk on some of these rocks are bigger
[14:18] than she is so think about how a terrain
[14:21] like this might look from her
[14:23] perspective they look like smaller rocks
[14:25] to us but her she's practically rock
[14:28] climbing see how she's having to learn a
[14:30] new way to walk there and one of the
[14:32] reasons we selected this place was
[14:34] because of the different texture of the
[14:35] ground and i'm hoping she might gain
[14:37] some confidence when dealing with
[14:39] different terrain encountering new
[14:41] things new smells new materials all of
[14:43] that letting your puppy naturally
[14:45] explore like this new places on their
[14:47] own terms can be really great i mean
[14:49] look at that look how brave she is to
[14:51] just jump up on that rock and look at
[14:53] her going down there and it's important
[14:55] to keep your eye out be aware of your
[14:57] surroundings make sure there aren't any
[14:59] other dogs that might run up to her i
[15:01] just want her to kind of explore right
[15:03] now hence why she's on such a long lead
[15:06] here
[15:07] yes
[15:08] that was awesome okay
[15:13] really key when teaching a recall is to
[15:15] also give them the freedom to resume
[15:17] doing what it is they want to do within
[15:19] reason of course yes
[15:22] she looked back at me just gonna give
[15:24] her a treat if she's responsive to it
[15:26] i'll do it but i'm not going to insist
[15:28] on training this is first and foremost a
[15:30] socialization outing what do you think
[15:33] biscuits look at that boat that crazy
[15:35] look at that big boat now i know that at
[15:38] any moment we are due for a giant jet to
[15:41] fly over and i'm curious to see if she
[15:43] continues to act well when the loud
[15:46] sound of the jets pass over when she is
[15:49] in explorer
[15:53] [Music]
[16:00] here
[16:01] yes
[16:03] good girl
[16:04] very good and so i've called her a total
[16:07] of what three times out here while we've
[16:09] just been hanging out that time i was
[16:11] able to call her in the presence of a
[16:13] significant distraction a giant airplane
[16:15] flying through the sky here
[16:18] yes
[16:20] good girl
[16:21] well done boy her recall is almost 100
[16:25] right now come and stay are two things
[16:28] that i really like to teach dogs when
[16:30] i'm first working with them because it's
[16:32] really important that they understand
[16:33] how to come to you and how to stay
[16:35] biscuits here
[16:38] she was doing perfect on coming back to
[16:40] me when i was asking for her attention a
[16:42] moment ago but you could see her clearly
[16:44] just look at these waves as they came in
[16:46] and she was like wait a minute i can't
[16:47] focus on you when that's happening yes
[16:50] good girl i said yes because she was
[16:52] walking towards me i would love to
[16:54] continue to support this wonderful
[16:55] confidence she's exhibiting this rock is
[16:58] probably millions of years old and it's
[17:00] been waiting for this opportunity to
[17:02] help me teach biscuits some general body
[17:05] awareness seriously this is actually
[17:07] pretty important and i wonder if we can
[17:10] get her comfortable staying on this rock
[17:12] with all four of her paws on it for
[17:14] example
[17:15] here
[17:16] yes i'm only going to reward her from
[17:19] this point forward when all four paws
[17:21] are up here
[17:23] whoa see it's top four to stay up there
[17:25] look at that there we go you guessed it
[17:27] rapid small treats is what i'm giving
[17:29] her to convey that i want her to stay up
[17:31] here for a longer amount of time seems
[17:33] to be working pretty well here okay
[17:36] so i haven't really focused on formally
[17:38] teaching her stay i have been teaching
[17:40] her to hold her position when i put her
[17:42] into a sit and to hold her position when
[17:44] i put her into a down and then release
[17:46] her but i also want her to understand
[17:48] the concept of stay in other
[17:50] circumstances as well training dogs is
[17:52] about showing them many different
[17:54] contexts in which you would like them to
[17:56] listen furthermore i'm seeing such a
[17:57] strong attention span from her in this
[17:59] new environment which is very
[18:01] encouraging yes and as long as she holds
[18:03] her four paws on there
[18:05] yes i'm gonna continue to give her some
[18:07] of her breakfast so i'm just using her
[18:09] puppy food right here yes
[18:12] kind of an unconventional way of
[18:14] teaching stay
[18:16] in this case stay means stay on this
[18:18] little platform sit
[18:21] okay
[18:22] and then of course
[18:23] i'll let her know when the stay is over
[18:25] there by releasing her got a distraction
[18:28] how responsive will she be in the
[18:30] presence of dogs okay i'm gonna release
[18:33] her from the stay since there's a dog
[18:34] close by i'm gonna let her now observe
[18:37] to be fair to her
[18:39] here yes
[18:41] so after letting her observe for a few
[18:43] seconds i'm going to try to resume over
[18:44] here here sit
[18:48] here
[18:52] yes
[18:54] i'll admit this strategy here is a
[18:56] little borderline i mean i do want her
[18:58] to see and observe lots of things
[18:59] without asking too much of her however
[19:01] she's so on right now so it seems like a
[19:04] good opportunity to reinforce her
[19:06] focused attention on me while pretty
[19:08] near another dog that's something that's
[19:10] really hard for lots of dogs on this
[19:12] planet got an airplane here yes
[19:16] yes
[19:19] here look at me
[19:20] yes
[19:22] okay
[19:27] you may start to see why gentle singular
[19:30] introductions have value i mean we've
[19:32] been letting her see dogs and nature in
[19:34] other lessons and now we have a massive
[19:37] jet just a few feet above us with dogs
[19:39] and all while being in a brand new place
[19:41] you can see how we're starting to stack
[19:43] all of these variables on top of each
[19:45] other and biscuits is passing the test
[19:47] at every turn i mean you've got to be
[19:49] impressed by that focus it was hard for
[19:52] me not to look up at that plane passing
[19:54] so closely and i even got her attention
[19:56] right as the plane was going by in the
[19:58] middle of a training session where i'm
[19:59] asking for a lot of focus i think we
[20:01] pointed out the myriad of distractions
[20:05] around us and remember socialization
[20:07] probably above all is about getting your
[20:09] dog to behave in an acceptable manner
[20:11] ideally calmly and focused in new
[20:13] environments not all dogs are like that
[20:15] as you've seen from other videos we've
[20:16] made now if she was overwhelmed i would
[20:18] just try to make the environment less
[20:20] stimulating and work up to being in an
[20:22] environment like this in other words i
[20:24] would probably go to less crowded or
[20:25] noisy places like a more remote park for
[20:28] example and try to be very purposeful
[20:30] about teaching or you know like 20
[20:32] minutes to an hour a day a few days a
[20:33] week you don't need to turn your life
[20:35] upside down to do this type of training
[20:36] i think that's the biggest misconception
[20:38] i mean dogs can only retain so much in a
[20:40] day anyway people think that i'm
[20:41] training these dogs all day long but
[20:43] really i just get a two or three of
[20:44] these training sessions in tops okay i'm
[20:47] beginning to think that biscuits was a
[20:48] gymnast in a former life this is more
[20:50] than just a cute trick i'm really
[20:52] impressed by this because she's having
[20:54] to really finally control her body
[20:56] rather than just flopping around like
[20:58] puppies often do i'm gonna go with maybe
[21:00] a half spin good motor control like that
[21:03] when they use their feet really finely
[21:05] and delicately can give you a lot of
[21:06] options it also teaches them how to stay
[21:09] safer over time okay
[21:11] serious real world tests coming up here
[21:13] will she pursue the other dog or will
[21:16] she choose to listen to me let's watch
[21:18] for tension on that leash and see how
[21:20] she does
[21:21] here yes
[21:24] very good
[21:26] good moment right there real good moment
[21:29] being able to call your dog away from
[21:30] another dog is a big deal she's learning
[21:33] how to use that body
[21:36] yes
[21:37] good girl there we go how about that
[21:40] she's loving exploring the world she's
[21:42] listening so well get a free memory foam
[21:45] bed and awesome toys and treats every
[21:47] month when you sign up for a bark box or
[21:48] a super chewer box or even both using my

TRANSCRIPTION:

[00:00] we all want our puppies to be trained
[00:02] but if they won't stay when we ask them
[00:04] to in an uncontrolled environment well
[00:06] what good is our training and so my job
[00:08] as a trainer is to get this mammal who's
[00:10] been on this planet for just a few weeks
[00:13] to listen to me while outside I mean
[00:15] after all that is why you guys are
[00:17] subscribed to my channel okay so you
[00:18] guys know when I'm working with a dog I
[00:20] like them to be in a good mood because
[00:21] I'm certainly not going to rely on
[00:23] physically correcting them over and over
[00:25] to teach them so a dog has to want to do
[00:27] something but that's not just about con
[00:30] L giving them treats either I mean after
[00:31] all I'm not just a treat dispenser I
[00:34] actually need biscuits to like me and
[00:37] that's saying something but if I can get
[00:39] her having a good time with me I know
[00:40] I'm off to a good start this really is
[00:42] my secret when I train dogs when I use
[00:44] toys they must be very sophisticated and
[00:47] the Ingenuity of these dog toys never
[00:49] ceases to impress me but there's more to
[00:51] these toys than you think at first like
[00:53] for example that is designed for a good
[00:55] tug-of war with a dog some dogs really
[00:57] prefer plushy toys like this this is you
[01:00] get in your Bark Box every month but
[01:01] other dogs prefer a more durable dog toy
[01:04] Super chewers for those dogs who are
[01:06] real hard on Toys For example on this
[01:08] toy look at all the layers and the
[01:10] thickness of that that has to be
[01:11] ballistic nylon so lots of dogs prefer
[01:14] these harder more firm toys I can't
[01:16] destroy these and you're going to get
[01:18] treats and shoes in every box too
[01:20] they're giving this away when you sign
[01:22] up for a bark box subscription or super
[01:24] chewer box right now my dog looks
[01:25] forward to these boxes every month and
[01:28] Ura really prefers this type of of
[01:30] memory foam bed I'll have a link in the
[01:32] description below where you can sign up
[01:33] for a box and get your free bed today is
[01:36] the day biscuits is going to learn how
[01:38] to stay in public even when she's
[01:40] distracted although if I'm being honest
[01:43] as we're walking to our training spot
[01:45] I'm reminded that her leash skills are
[01:47] not doing the best right now keep moving
[01:50] let's go this leash walking is a
[01:52] disaster right now oh looks like I've
[01:55] lost her here all right so it's clear
[01:57] that biscuits has some leash walking
[01:58] boot camp in her future I wonder who's
[02:00] going to take that job on now you might
[02:02] remember a couple of videos ago we were
[02:04] working with biscuits on going into a
[02:06] crate automatically and staying there
[02:08] and that's great at home she did well
[02:10] but I'm hoping to get her to do
[02:11] something similar albeit not in a crate
[02:14] but stay in a position out here at a
[02:16] park and that is significantly more
[02:19] difficult because I don't have total
[02:20] control of the environment out here so
[02:22] today I'm hoping to build on that
[02:24] success while also teaching her a
[02:26] seemingly unrelated skill to that
[02:28] interesting how one thing Builds on
[02:30] another when you're training a dog the
[02:31] challenge here is teaching her to keep
[02:33] that little puppy body still even when
[02:35] she sees things that interest her
[02:37] outside this is a training spot we've
[02:39] used several times at this point and we
[02:41] love it because we have a pedestrian
[02:43] Trail right here and then we have a
[02:45] field in the middle so there's a lot of
[02:47] opportunities to teach your dog to
[02:50] listen to you when a fairly distracting
[02:51] setting biscuits
[02:54] cup yes it looks like our strategy of
[02:57] calling her off of minor distractions at
[03:00] least is working well last time we had
[03:02] some pretty serious real life leave it
[03:04] issues I'm glad to see that training is
[03:08] sticking stick I'm hoping to teach her
[03:11] to stay in a unique and different way
[03:13] today my wife has brought this cutting
[03:15] board out for us out of our actual
[03:17] kitchen the idea here is we want to
[03:19] teach her to want to be in that spot and
[03:22] not to move yes is it just me or is
[03:25] biscuits becoming telepathic so the idea
[03:27] for this lesson is to get her to volunt
[03:30] stay in one specific spot regardless of
[03:33] where I am and in the beginning since
[03:35] she's like getting right into this I
[03:37] might even make it
[03:41] easier I putting some treats on there
[03:44] yes now I hear you how does teaching her
[03:46] how to stay on this piece of plastic
[03:48] have any benefits two things first it
[03:51] shows me that her General training is
[03:53] improving and she's starting to see the
[03:55] value of listening to me in public and
[03:57] it also gives me the chance to teach her
[04:00] how to stay still while in one spot even
[04:02] in public and I'm telling you this is
[04:04] such a vital skill that all dogs need to
[04:07] know for reasons that should be pretty
[04:09] obvious and getting her to think
[04:11] throughout this exercise is a wonderful
[04:13] way to kind of see how her overall
[04:14] reasoning ability is doing too remember
[04:17] making a dog do something that's one
[04:19] thing but making a dog want to do
[04:21] something that is quite another thing
[04:23] and I think the ladder is much more
[04:24] powerful all of the reinforcement right
[04:26] now in theory is going to come only in
[04:29] that area area and when she's on the
[04:31] right track yes I want to make sure to
[04:33] reward generously especially for
[04:35] duration and now while we're starting
[04:37] small say 1 second on the platform we'll
[04:40] gradually increase that time throughout
[04:42] this session and I'm thinking once she's
[04:44] getting it I should be able to get her
[04:46] to stay on there longer by slowing down
[04:48] the rate at which I reward her I mean
[04:50] that assumes that my prior training is
[04:52] going to have some effect here as
[04:55] well always be sensitive to asking too
[04:58] much of your dog in a lesson like this I
[05:01] should have released her earlier but
[05:02] let's see if she figures out what to do
[05:04] I mean it's better to get a 2C success
[05:07] than it is to get a 10-second almost
[05:09] success and then a failure yes go to
[05:12] your
[05:13] spot oh my
[05:16] God at this point it looks like she's
[05:18] really getting the point so let's change
[05:20] a variable I'm going to walk away and
[05:22] see if I can catch her succeeding at
[05:24] this farther distance yes so this is
[05:27] great but stay doesn't mean much unless
[05:29] they'll do it while distracted so what I
[05:31] like to do is add a minor artificial
[05:33] distraction in order to prepare them for
[05:35] more real distractions later on ha I bet
[05:38] she didn't see that coming yes that's
[05:41] right Master dog trainer at work
[05:43] folks and in this case where her feet
[05:45] come off that plastic it can be tempting
[05:48] to correct her but remember real
[05:49] authentic learning comes down to a dog
[05:52] learning how to anticipate what we want
[05:54] so I do want to avoid telling her
[05:56] literally every step to make and see if
[05:58] she can figure out what I'm asking for
[06:00] here and to nobody's surprise yes she
[06:03] delivers oh
[06:06] good yes I want to be able to dance and
[06:09] jog in place I want to be able to move
[06:12] around and know that she's going to have
[06:13] a reliable stay okay yes good
[06:17] girl but ultimately let's face it
[06:20] biscuits is going to encounter things
[06:21] that are a lot more exciting and
[06:23] distracting than my dance moves and for
[06:26] most puppies other dogs are one of the
[06:28] hardest things of all to resist biscuits
[06:31] is no exception but we've been training
[06:32] for a moment exactly like this and of
[06:35] course my hope here is that she doesn't
[06:37] Advance towards this dog here yes so I
[06:41] definitely think it's worth giving her a
[06:43] treat right here as if to say hey thank
[06:45] you for not approaching that dog
[06:46] biscuits I know you wanted to oh we have
[06:49] a significant distraction
[06:52] yes just trying to avoid her getting too
[06:55] fixated on the dog this is the
[06:58] miraculous power of rein Enforcement
[07:00] Training here we are in a public space
[07:02] with a dog who's only existed on Earth
[07:04] for just a few months at this point and
[07:06] over a relatively short period of time
[07:08] we've been able to not only communicate
[07:10] that we'd like her to go to a spot and
[07:12] stay but we've done that in a way that's
[07:14] powerful enough that she's actually
[07:16] starting to choose to do what we want
[07:19] even in the case where she encounters
[07:21] some really tempting Alternatives like
[07:23] other dogs in public
[07:26] okay yes now I know that I just said
[07:29] resisting other dogs is one of the
[07:31] hardest things you deal with when
[07:32] training a puppy but I may have spoken
[07:34] too soon because it's time now to see if
[07:37] biscuits is permanently emotionally
[07:39] damaged from her last experience taking
[07:42] a bath when Bri attempted to give her a
[07:44] bath not too long ago it didn't go well
[07:46] ideally well n okay okay okay water's
[07:50] off the second she felt that triggle of
[07:52] water she was out are you going to be
[07:55] okay was that a little too scary will
[07:58] you ever be able to take a bath again
[08:00] now ideally it's great if you can teach
[08:01] your dog to voluntarily go into the tub
[08:03] or the sink but in this case biscuits is
[08:06] having no part of that so I'm going to
[08:08] provide some assistance so I think I'm
[08:10] really to going to the next step I need
[08:11] to introduce the faucet here
[08:15] here just want her to see it this
[08:17] doesn't bend down too far here what's
[08:20] this did you let her smell it when you
[08:22] did it no I kind of turned it on while
[08:26] she was far away from it well see this
[08:28] supports that hypothesis too that often
[08:30] when you think you've tried everything
[08:32] really there are smaller steps that you
[08:33] can break it down into if you run into
[08:35] trouble so here I'm just trying to let
[08:37] her little drop like one drop got on her
[08:39] right there did you see that and because
[08:41] of our past training here she's learning
[08:43] that holding one position Works to her
[08:45] Advantage I'm going to move it around
[08:47] I'm going to touch her with it yes see
[08:50] that she's reacting really well
[08:53] yes I've got the faucet pointed over
[08:56] here just to keep it less daunting to
[08:57] her cuz my next step is to turn it on on
[08:59] I wanted to see it though I don't wanted
[09:00] to catch her off guard here see this
[09:06] yes I'm going to let her go explore the
[09:08] water now she's probably going to be
[09:09] like what is that here I think she's
[09:12] less nervous and more trying to get to
[09:14] the food over here at this moment let's
[09:17] see here see she's still taking treats a
[09:20] sign that she's likely not too nervous
[09:22] now of course I am moving extra slowly
[09:24] you would be right to pick up on that
[09:26] seriously by going extra slow you ensure
[09:30] Lightning Fast success I mean if you
[09:32] think about it this has certainly been
[09:34] true with me in the past most setbacks
[09:36] when it comes to grooming or bats or
[09:38] nail trimming and things like that
[09:39] happen because we're trying to do it
[09:41] quickly at least quickly as far as our
[09:43] dog is concerned yes let's see if we
[09:45] keep it streaming like that now she does
[09:49] continue to pursue exiting the sink here
[09:51] but since she is taking treats I think
[09:53] that she's going to get the message that
[09:55] bath time has the potential to be more
[09:58] enjoyable
[10:00] see will she cross over near it very
[10:03] good well done going to turn it off so
[10:07] that way it's not like an eternal
[10:08] waterfall that happens it comes on we
[10:10] turn it off and since she is a little
[10:12] bit nervous I think it might be a good
[10:13] idea to probably use a washcloth to
[10:15] clean her up a bit it looks like the
[10:17] running water is a bit much for her
[10:19] right now so we're going to take a step
[10:20] back and I'm having to troubleshoot here
[10:23] do you think it's because of the damage
[10:24] that I did no I know when we first met
[10:27] her she was really gross so she
[10:28] obviously had had a bath between then
[10:31] and now so I don't know how that
[10:33] experience or experiences went but
[10:35] that's okay we're going to make it good
[10:36] hold
[10:37] on hey
[10:40] look it's okay good girl what's this see
[10:45] this good girl it's okay that look feel
[10:49] how warm that is let me see if she's
[10:51] even taking treats here do you want this
[10:54] she taking
[10:55] treats good girl very good so this is
[10:58] similar to the peanut butter idea you
[11:00] had that's my peanut butter technique
[11:03] peanut butter wall has never failed me
[11:04] before looks like she's a little lower
[11:07] stress now she's still up here well you
[11:09] thought of a way to not run the water
[11:11] which for some reason didn't even occur
[11:13] to me a spongebath so right now I'm just
[11:16] getting her comfortable with being wiped
[11:18] down she's not super happy but the idea
[11:21] is over time hopefully she gets enough
[11:24] of these experiences and she realizes
[11:26] it's not that bad let me get a little
[11:28] shampoo now hello how are you you doing
[11:32] okay trying to communicate in the best
[11:34] way that I can as a person that I'm calm
[11:37] everything's fine I care about her I'm
[11:40] not really out to get her she doesn't
[11:43] understand why we're doing this yeah I
[11:45] mean she's being trusting she's propped
[11:46] up here but she's not totally trying to
[11:49] jump out she doesn't seem beside herself
[11:51] with fear at the moment okay so I think
[11:53] we've isolated the running water as the
[11:56] thing that's Biscuit's least favorite
[11:58] part of this experience experience so by
[12:00] minimizing that aspect the running water
[12:02] it looks like she's tolerating this bath
[12:04] a lot better now but we've come this far
[12:06] so we still have to get this shampoo off
[12:08] of her so if I could just rinse her
[12:12] now with this that might be
[12:16] nice yeah good girl I think that's
[12:20] enough water so I can sponge rinse her
[12:22] now and you can see that she's
[12:23] definitely feeling a little bit more
[12:25] stressed and she doesn't want treats
[12:26] anymore and we know that generally at
[12:28] least in this situation that if a dog
[12:30] stops taking R treats where they were
[12:31] previously interested that that is a
[12:33] sign that they're getting a little bit
[12:35] too uncomfortable to make meaningful
[12:36] progress so in this case I'm doing my
[12:38] best to finish this bath as quickly and
[12:41] painlessly as possible for biscuits
[12:43] hello we're almost done okay I know this
[12:45] is the worst thing ever isn't it you're
[12:48] being so good I know this is hard I do
[12:52] you're going to get really good at these
[12:55] but she is calming down now that the
[12:57] water's been turned off look how Brave
[12:58] she yes after she eats her tummy gets so
[13:02] plump she kind of feels like a tiny
[13:04] HoneyBaked H all done you did great all
[13:09] right let's get you dry thanks Zach you
[13:12] really pulled through on that one I mean
[13:14] I see what you're talking about yeah it
[13:15] wasn't really the smoothest bath but we
[13:18] got through it and you know it's just
[13:20] the kind of thing you have to be
[13:21] sensitive to things we could have done
[13:22] better looking back we could have turned
[13:24] this on while I was doing training in
[13:26] the background or something like that
[13:28] you know like show show it to her give
[13:29] her some treats now let's go play some
[13:31] fets you know outside of bath time
[13:33] rather than trying to introduce all of
[13:35] this to her at once you know this is
[13:37] reality that is often the position we
[13:39] find ourselves in I think it's a
[13:41] scientific fact that baths trigger
[13:43] Zoomies in about 80% of dogs legit show
[13:47] me your sources sounds like fake news
[13:49] today it is fake news I made it up here
[13:51] we go okay shake
[13:57] off actually
[14:00] I should probably reinforce that
[14:01] shouldn't I yeah there's the post bath
[14:04] energy we're looking for it's worth
[14:06] mentioning if biscuits was feeling
[14:09] overwhelmed she does go under the couch
[14:13] remember that's what I like to see look
[14:16] at that ultimate trust
[14:21] behavior that was even biscuit saying
[14:23] okay I'm done I'm going to take a break
[14:25] and andersa took the hint really well I
[14:27] mean that's good dog to dog
[14:28] communication measured healthy
[14:30] self-regulating we like it when that
[14:32] happens sometimes though we do find
[14:34] ourselves when we're training a puppy
[14:36] having to move more quickly than we
[14:37] would like take trimming a puppy's nails
[14:40] for example that's something that you
[14:41] ideally would like to do in a single
[14:43] sitting but it has the potential to go
[14:45] way wrong if you move too quickly and
[14:47] potentially set you back years so
[14:50] Biscuit's nails are getting pretty long
[14:52] they need to be cut it's towards the end
[14:54] of the day for her right now so she's
[14:55] had plenty of exercise mental
[14:57] stimulation and Hope hopefully she's
[14:59] going to be in a more relaxed mindset to
[15:01] be tolerant here should I just kind of
[15:03] Go Fast uh no we don't want to just go
[15:05] fast okay let her smell it okay yes so
[15:09] I'm just letting her nibble on a soft
[15:11] treat that I have here so we're doing
[15:12] two things with these treats we're
[15:13] distracting her and also conditioning
[15:16] her like getting her nails clipped means
[15:17] she gets a good treat let her smell it
[15:19] again okay let her interact with it a
[15:21] little bit it's Clippers yes good
[15:23] they're going to go like this mhm now go
[15:25] ahead and touch her foot okay good yeah
[15:28] just go ahead do everything but cut her
[15:30] nails right now and then let go before
[15:33] you get resistance from her but the
[15:34] point is to like it don't just jump into
[15:36] it all at once biscuit seems pretty
[15:38] unbothered she's really into the treats
[15:40] too so that's a good sign so I think
[15:42] we're good to try the very first nail
[15:44] clip I'm going to do the first just do
[15:46] one and back off don't try I'll give you
[15:47] a 3 two one uhoh did you notice anything
[15:50] there biscuits pulled her paw away so
[15:52] that probably means we're going a little
[15:53] bit too fast oh the squeezy of her paw
[15:55] is throwing her off let me squeeze her
[15:57] paw oh good idea yeah great realization
[15:59] by Brie if you can resist the temptation
[16:01] to just power through when a situation
[16:03] like that arises in the end you're going
[16:05] to almost certainly have better and
[16:07] faster progress it's always nice when
[16:09] you have an extra person to do this with
[16:11] we always want to show you different
[16:12] ways this is pretty smooth biscuits is
[16:14] fine with getting a paw squeeze now see
[16:16] that didn't take long let's go for the
[16:17] clip three two one good girl how about
[16:21] that now look at that biscuits doesn't
[16:24] react at all to her very first nail trim
[16:26] but there are still 19 toes to go
[16:30] good job see so you can see that if you
[16:32] like went in and just jumped into it
[16:34] some dogs would be like oh my God what's
[16:36] happening I have done that honestly I
[16:38] mean you can only imagine how different
[16:40] this would go if we just focused on
[16:42] restraining her and getting it done
[16:43] super quickly but she's really
[16:45] tolerating this like a champ if you just
[16:47] focus on clipping just a tiny Edge tip
[16:49] of their nail it's likely to be a lot
[16:51] less stressful for both you and your dog
[16:54] and our main goal here is to keep this
[16:55] experience as enjoyable as possible for
[16:58] business gets cuz now she's going to
[17:00] have that Association of having a good
[17:01] time while getting her nails trimmed she
[17:03] gets a great treat and hopefully that
[17:05] will be the case in future nail trimming
[17:06] sessions if we keep this up you have
[17:08] four feet really some feet are more
[17:10] sensitive than others some toes are more
[17:12] sensitive than others we've been through
[17:13] this but we do have one more curveball
[17:15] here that throws a lot of dogs off back
[17:18] Fe oh the back legs biscuits doesn't
[17:20] mind being held on her back and cradled
[17:22] like a baby yeah we'll see how much
[17:24] square one oh this isn't so bad y she's
[17:26] pretty into that treat right now all
[17:28] right ready one two three getting her to
[17:31] comply like that took less than one
[17:33] treat throughout that entire session
[17:35] there we go good girl she did it this
[17:38] was the size of the treat I was using
[17:40] and this is how much of it is left so
[17:43] good bit of it she's so into these
[17:44] treats and I think that's going to go a
[17:46] long way towards helping her look
[17:47] forward to getting her nails trimmed in
[17:49] the future and when you sign up for a
[17:50] bark box or a super chewer box you're
[17:52] going to get a free very high quality
[17:54] memory foam dog bed not to mention the

[00:00] puppies are not bound to adhere to our
[00:02] expectations
[00:04] as i am reminded often why is nothing
[00:06] with you easy i mean the hardest part of
[00:09] training a new puppy is knowing what to
[00:11] teach when because when dogs are all
[00:13] over the place it can get overwhelming
[00:15] very quickly today biscuits the puppy is
[00:18] going to throw all kinds of curveballs
[00:20] at me but there is one age-old question
[00:22] i've always had why do dogs get the
[00:25] zoomies
[00:26] wow
[00:28] she's so fast
[00:30] i've got an idea what is going on in my
[00:32] dog's head right now
[00:34] send i can get them
[00:36] video just like this jordan's from fuzzy
[00:39] and she's telling me zoomies are a great
[00:41] way for dogs to show their excitement
[00:43] and joy for an activity what there's a
[00:47] science word for zoomies frenetic random
[00:49] activity period raps is no one else
[00:52] amazed by this
[00:54] fraps
[00:55] who knew
[00:56] wow these aren't just random people
[00:58] fuzzy is going to give you actual
[01:00] contact with true veterinary
[01:02] professionals is there any general
[01:04] advice you have on keeping her joints
[01:06] healthy question mark i've used this
[01:08] before this is a good product you can
[01:10] ask as many questions as you want
[01:11] sometimes your dog has some weird
[01:12] diarrhea sometimes your dog gets into
[01:14] things i think you guys should
[01:15] definitely take advantage of this
[01:17] they're giving you a free seven-day
[01:18] trial i'm gonna have my special link
[01:20] yourfuzzy.com
[01:22] in the description and tell me what you
[01:24] think i've been thoroughly impressed
[01:25] with the service you know i probably
[01:27] should have known at the start of this
[01:28] day that biscuits was in a pretty wild
[01:30] mood
[01:35] get hurt
[01:36] you tell her good job inertia be sure
[01:39] you're subscribed if you like seeing
[01:40] real world dog training when puppies are
[01:42] biting like this and they're just really
[01:45] extra playful it's probably a sign that
[01:47] you need to get out and do some training
[01:49] so
[01:50] i think we need to get this girl out
[01:52] hopefully we can get some of this energy
[01:54] out and we can teach her how to
[01:57] walk better on leash
[01:59] not as easy as you might think with
[02:00] these small dogs why is nothing with you
[02:03] easy
[02:07] the moment we started driving away to
[02:09] our training location for the day
[02:10] biscuits immediately started stressing
[02:12] out in her crates we really want her in
[02:14] the best mood possible when we go into
[02:16] our training session so all of those
[02:18] brain chemicals linked with frustration
[02:21] aren't necessarily going to help me
[02:24] though she should understand how to
[02:25] process those emotions as she
[02:27] gets older but i think we can still get
[02:30] a lot of benefit by showing her how to
[02:32] calm down and relax so it became clear
[02:34] to me i need to pull over because i've
[02:35] got to address this am i really like
[02:37] that dad that's like hey quiet back
[02:39] there i'm going to pull the car over so
[02:41] bree took over driving duties while i
[02:43] decided to try to teach biscuits how to
[02:45] feel more comfortable what i'm going to
[02:47] do is i'm just going to wait for her
[02:49] to get quiet
[02:51] quiet
[02:52] yes
[02:53] i'm waiting for just a moment
[02:56] a moment guys
[02:58] of quiet look at that tail
[03:02] got a reward for that now i know you're
[03:04] thinking hey you're rewarding her for
[03:06] the barking no i'm not i'm rewarding him
[03:08] for the quiet do you hear any barking
[03:10] yes
[03:11] so in all seriousness though this is
[03:13] what you have to look for this is how
[03:14] you have to change your
[03:16] viewpoint when you're training it on i
[03:18] mean let's face it as people when we're
[03:20] teaching puppies most of our instinct is
[03:22] to correct correct correct rather than
[03:24] acknowledge success from our puppies so
[03:26] my game plan here is to reinforce the
[03:29] quiet behavior periodically so she's
[03:32] doing well while the vehicle is
[03:33] completely still i'm curious to see if
[03:35] the moving vehicle
[03:37] triggers her
[03:39] and
[03:40] makes her freak out
[03:42] we're gonna try to preempt that
[03:44] by giving her some of her dog food
[03:48] as we start to move okay
[03:50] here we go
[03:52] yes
[03:53] so i'm gonna be preempted
[03:59] okay she started barking before i could
[04:01] deliver that treat i really need to find
[04:03] a fraction of a second of quiet to
[04:04] acknowledge here
[04:06] yes
[04:08] quiet good girl
[04:10] i'm gonna wait a little bit longer this
[04:12] time
[04:14] yes
[04:15] see how i'm not letting her get to that
[04:18] point
[04:19] of whining it's all about timing here
[04:22] now naturally you don't do this forever
[04:24] this is how you get traction this is how
[04:26] you start to communicate a new concept
[04:28] in this case quiet or calm behavior yes
[04:39] very good
[04:40] and so i'll probably try to reward
[04:42] between every 15 seconds to a minute
[04:47] with a small piece of kibble on a
[04:49] production note though
[04:51] the continuity is driving us nuts it's
[04:53] more pleasant to come down here off of
[04:55] the hill into the city of anchorage to
[04:57] do our dog training because there's no
[04:59] snow down here but all the shots from
[05:01] our house have snow everywhere
[05:03] so understand we live on the side of one
[05:05] of those mountains over there that's why
[05:07] we have snow there
[05:09] and not here we're doing pretty good
[05:11] here we're on kind of a
[05:12] minutes long streak
[05:14] i probably haven't rewarded her in about
[05:16] two minutes now just like teaching kids
[05:19] what words mean right this is a really
[05:21] good example and quite interesting to
[05:23] see how finding the good behavior to
[05:25] reward can truly be effective i talk
[05:28] about it not being intuitive a lot i
[05:30] mean most people i think if left your
[05:31] own devices would you know yell at the
[05:33] dog try to scold them try to get them to
[05:35] be quiet some people might hit the crate
[05:37] some people might you know go farther i
[05:39] don't know but if we can just hold off
[05:41] on that negative emotion and try to
[05:43] understand the periods of ideal behavior
[05:46] yes
[05:47] like quietness
[05:49] so at first you're trying to get in
[05:51] there and say yes that that that bat
[05:53] right there and that's why we reward
[05:54] super
[05:55] rapidly uh when we're introducing a new
[05:58] concept but here you can see in a single
[06:00] training session how we're dramatically
[06:02] lowering the rate of reinforcement
[06:06] looks like i waited too long there she
[06:08] started to whine again
[06:14] quiet
[06:15] yes
[06:18] i'm gonna take a step back i'm gonna up
[06:20] that rate of reinforcement a little bit
[06:21] right now just to let her know quiet
[06:23] still pays
[06:25] yes
[06:25] [Music]
[06:28] good girl
[06:29] yes
[06:31] i'm just gonna grab her now i really
[06:33] hope you do well on leash walking today
[06:35] i do because you were a mess last time
[06:38] no special treatment for small dogs
[06:41] whoa
[06:42] mushrooms are more closely related with
[06:45] humans and animals than they are to
[06:47] plants
[06:50] and i know a lot of mushrooms up here
[06:52] especially can be toxic and harmful to
[06:54] dogs so yeah that's why zac is holding
[06:56] biscuits right now i just wanted to show
[06:58] him that yeah that's exactly why
[07:00] not because i just want to
[07:03] cuddle with a puppy not not at all
[07:06] we're gonna do leash training out here
[07:08] but i'm not just gonna jump into it i
[07:10] think that's important to mention in
[07:11] these types of lessons she has a lot of
[07:13] pent-up energy and she wants to get out
[07:16] there and see what the world is about
[07:17] she doesn't want to necessarily go into
[07:19] school sometimes just running around and
[07:21] sniffing and being a dog is all they
[07:24] really need to get primed for a training
[07:26] session like today's i see that sock
[07:29] who's gonna leave a sock in the middle
[07:31] of a field notice how the leash on
[07:33] biscuits is being used to manage her and
[07:35] not to deliver a correction
[07:38] yes then notice the alternative
[07:40] incompatible behavior i asked for when
[07:42] you see how intensely she's after that
[07:45] sock on the ground i mean that was great
[07:47] i guess she knows how to not pick up
[07:49] things off the ground now perfect if
[07:52] only it were that easy biscuits
[07:56] let go all right looks like i need to do
[07:57] a pretty standard real life leave it
[07:59] training session and remind her what
[08:01] leave it means leave it my mindset when
[08:04] i have to do this is to start completely
[08:07] over to not assume that she has retained
[08:09] any of the leave it training i've done
[08:11] so far because there's so many variables
[08:13] that have changed number one i'm asking
[08:14] her to leave this stick alone we've
[08:16] never done a leave-it training session
[08:18] with this stick i'm asking her to do it
[08:20] in a brand new environment where she's
[08:22] obviously very interested in everything
[08:24] around her so you can understand why it
[08:26] might take a lot of reminding to your
[08:28] dog when you're teaching them how to
[08:30] leave things alone in the real world yes
[08:33] good girl
[08:35] this is the leave it look at me combo
[08:37] which we've been doing in a variety of
[08:39] different ways like when she goes for
[08:40] the carpet and i give her that
[08:41] alternative behavior getting her
[08:43] attention on me biscuits yes
[08:46] good i think a lot of people think of
[08:48] dog training as these formal lessons
[08:50] that you do but really the dogs are
[08:52] truly taught in those brief moments
[08:55] throughout the day when you take 30
[08:56] seconds here and 30 seconds there yes
[09:00] you're doing great and you can see a
[09:02] huge improvement here i mean you can see
[09:04] how she's more calm now yes
[09:06] because we've let her adjust we've
[09:08] exercised her
[09:09] okay good girl got a ball over here
[09:12] that's got to be tempting i don't know
[09:13] if she's ever seen a ball like that yes
[09:15] but
[09:17] she's stable i love the stand stay i
[09:20] really like it when a dog can learn to
[09:22] stand
[09:23] and hold the position instead of sit
[09:24] sometimes just as an alternative it's
[09:26] cool when they know both you know i i
[09:29] love you very deeply
[09:31] and it's not just puppy love either well
[09:33] i mean i guess
[09:34] it kind of is puppy love literally
[09:36] speaking but i'm ready to get on with
[09:38] our walk this is just kind of an example
[09:40] of what my pre-routine with her is when
[09:42] i go to a new environment like this so
[09:44] i'm mostly
[09:46] confident that she's got it in her to
[09:48] have some success today on leash walking
[09:51] we'll see i feel a certain amount of
[09:53] pressure when i'm doing these type of
[09:54] lease training sessions because i want
[09:56] her to perform well but then again she
[09:59] might not be ready for a lesson like
[10:00] this so there's still a lot of discovery
[10:02] going on with her good girl
[10:04] she i mean look how curious she is i
[10:07] i don't know if she's ready for a real
[10:09] leash training session yet well i mean
[10:11] she has four months
[10:13] so we can't i mean we just have to keep
[10:14] our expectations realistic guys okay
[10:19] come on so i'm trying not to pull her
[10:21] along here when she's getting fixated
[10:24] ideally a nice walk she should be free
[10:26] to sniff then we go and you know have a
[10:29] nice cadence to it i mean that's pretty
[10:31] serious pulling right there that she's
[10:33] doing she said i don't care about the
[10:34] treat but let me go over here and check
[10:36] this out so i'm gonna let her do that
[10:37] for a sec
[10:39] just a sec though
[10:42] biscuits
[10:43] come on
[10:44] good girl so the environment is very
[10:47] reinforcing to her so i need to look at
[10:49] this as how can i give her access to the
[10:51] environment when she's behaving well so
[10:55] i'll be looking for just tiny bits of
[10:57] success and then maybe longer periods of
[10:59] enjoyment of the environment at first
[11:02] again it's just about getting traction
[11:04] and communicating those very initial
[11:06] concepts and as clear away as we can and
[11:09] sometimes that's not always obvious come
[11:11] on let's go
[11:13] good girl she's generally pretty good
[11:15] about moving when i call her
[11:17] or encourage her to keep moving by
[11:19] saying biscuits come on
[11:23] i use that higher pitch voice because
[11:25] she's more responsive to it for those of
[11:27] you who have naturally high-pitched
[11:28] voices you have a real gift that you can
[11:31] use when training your dog and for those
[11:33] of you that don't
[11:35] do your best
[11:36] i love that about small dogs that you
[11:38] can quickly gain control of them if an
[11:41] off-leash dog comes up to them that
[11:42] you're not sure about so just an
[11:44] additional way to control the
[11:45] environment with the smaller dog of
[11:47] course you can't do that with every dog
[11:49] so that's why the leash is important and
[11:51] that's also one of the reasons we're
[11:52] having such a heavy emphasis on calm
[11:54] behavior in public especially when other
[11:57] dogs are within sight
[11:59] oh whoa whoa what is that here we go can
[12:02] i have a sip please yeah
[12:05] yes
[12:06] you know this apple is a nice tempting
[12:08] object that i'd like to teach biscuits
[12:10] to resist
[12:11] restricting her access yes
[12:14] when she
[12:15] looks up at me
[12:16] go ahead and give her a little treat
[12:18] things that don't move are a little bit
[12:20] easier for a dog to resist than things
[12:22] that do move why did i reward there
[12:26] yes
[12:27] because i feared that if i move that
[12:29] apple or actually pick it up
[12:32] that she's going to be tempted to break
[12:34] and go for it so i'm trying to ease her
[12:35] into it
[12:37] see just moving it did it
[12:39] hypothesis supported so i'd love for her
[12:42] to learn to resist this moving apple
[12:45] core yes hear me out if she can resist
[12:47] it while it's moving she's likely to be
[12:49] able to resist it while it's still in
[12:51] the future yes
[12:53] see but see that timing
[12:56] yes
[12:57] catching her succeeding
[13:00] here yes
[13:08] here
[13:09] yes
[13:11] biscuits okay
[13:14] good and then
[13:15] calling her away from the distraction
[13:16] really good opportunity
[13:18] to practice that come on girl over here
[13:20] i mean you can see that when you start
[13:22] practicing in a variety of different
[13:23] contexts with different items in
[13:25] different places that your dog starts to
[13:27] generalize concepts like leave it alone
[13:29] and don't pick up things but that takes
[13:31] months of practice but these lessons are
[13:34] designed to help you lay that foundation
[13:36] so they know how to draw upon those
[13:37] things moving forward and that's also
[13:39] why we try to show you adult dogs who
[13:41] have a lot of bad habits as well in
[13:43] these series so that you see a variety
[13:45] of different approaches and dogs and
[13:47] behaviors this is also really good
[13:49] having her sit still at the street like
[13:51] this i mean eventually she should learn
[13:52] how to hold her stay when presented with
[13:55] a street see if she's receptive to the
[13:57] reward yep she is you're doing so great
[14:00] and since she's doing so well now i'm
[14:01] going to continue on with my walk here
[14:04] well actually no i'm not the dogs are
[14:05] coming back over here biscuits come good
[14:08] girl yes
[14:10] see there so i was able to call her away
[14:11] from the approaching dogs i'm going to
[14:12] secure her now because they're off leash
[14:14] though they seem very friendly but
[14:18] yeah i'm going to keep her kind of load
[14:20] this time this is actually turning out
[14:22] to be some great desensitizing to dogs
[14:25] just waiting to get on into the
[14:27] neighborhood here so i think right now
[14:28] since her focus is kind of all over the
[14:30] place we're in a neighborhood that has
[14:32] pretty wide streets so i might start off
[14:35] doing kind of a version of a free walk
[14:37] i'm going to shorten the leash though so
[14:39] she doesn't have too much freedom and my
[14:42] plan is to just kind of wait for her to
[14:43] offer me brief moments of compliance and
[14:46] attention and see how that works with
[14:48] her right now i'm just letting biscuits
[14:51] do her thing not focused on training
[14:53] right now it's kind of a free walk of
[14:55] sorts well the point i'm trying to make
[14:57] is that i'm letting her be wild kind of
[14:59] i think this is the most valuable
[15:00] takeaway in today's training so far that
[15:02] our dogs can't learn everything at once
[15:04] and knowing when to insist on a learning
[15:06] moment versus when to let things go can
[15:08] make a huge difference after all if i'm
[15:10] constantly requiring her to listen to me
[15:12] at every single moment i'm likely to
[15:14] induce frustration and that will be
[15:16] counterproductive to our lesson then all
[15:18] of a sudden we have three distinct
[15:19] distractions happen in rapid succession
[15:22] a car driving by
[15:23] see she noticed it a barking dog not too
[15:26] far in the distance
[15:27] she hears a barking dog and a low-flying
[15:30] airplane directly above us i mean all at
[15:32] one time and this did seem to cause at
[15:34] least some temporary stress with
[15:35] biscuits i think she's a bit nervous at
[15:38] the moment she stopped taking the treat
[15:39] she's been taking treats all day
[15:42] and she jumped up on me as though she
[15:44] was saying hey i don't know what that is
[15:46] it's normal for her to be going through
[15:48] bouts of fearfulness as a puppy so we
[15:51] want to be sensitive to that i took this
[15:53] as my cue to keep things low-key as we
[15:55] continued on our walk okay come on let's
[15:57] go
[15:59] here
[16:00] seems to have recovered from
[16:02] her fearfulness there yes
[16:05] right here i'm just rewarding not fast
[16:07] walking when there's yes
[16:09] when the leash is loose
[16:12] yes i'm going to acknowledge it okay yes
[16:16] look at that these are the moments to
[16:19] seize on when you're training a dog i
[16:20] mean today polite leash walking as
[16:22] you've seen has been pretty hard to come
[16:24] by but finding literal seconds of nice
[16:27] loose leash walking to reinforce is
[16:29] likely to transform how she walks on
[16:31] leash moving forward but of course
[16:33] something caught her attention in the
[16:34] bushes come
[16:37] and she ignored come when called
[16:40] and by shrinking my training bubble and
[16:41] being more obvious with the treat lore
[16:44] come on yes i was able to get a
[16:46] successful come win call to my second
[16:48] attempt
[16:49] here
[16:50] biscuits yes
[16:54] good
[16:55] we'll turn around here
[16:57] biscuits
[17:02] see how she's fighting the impulse to go
[17:04] and explore with
[17:06] yes paying attention to me
[17:08] very good example you're watching
[17:10] learning unfold
[17:11] biscuits here
[17:15] yes
[17:19] here
[17:24] good
[17:25] okay you can see all right
[17:27] see here's a dog so
[17:30] let's let's test again
[17:32] she's not she's not interested in treats
[17:34] she's a bit nervous
[17:36] i'm not going to pick her up here i want
[17:37] to know i want her to understand she can
[17:38] cope with it
[17:40] yes
[17:46] okay we'll go away from it if you want
[17:48] good
[17:49] come
[17:52] yes
[17:55] good girl come here it's gonna be easier
[17:57] for her to come to me than it is walk
[17:59] beside me i think the easiest way to get
[18:01] her to pay attention to me while we walk
[18:03] together is for me to walk backwards and
[18:05] have her come to me for a treat i'm
[18:07] making sure to reward when she's really
[18:10] close to me like that
[18:12] good obviously we can't walk backwards
[18:14] and feed her treats constantly moving
[18:16] forward so now you know we've been
[18:18] working on teaching her
[18:20] how to turn yes
[18:23] into the spin right there periodically
[18:25] she just stops and looks around you can
[18:27] see her using her senses and the leaves
[18:30] are blowing around getting her attention
[18:31] those are going to look a lot more
[18:33] enticing to her than to us from her
[18:35] perspective
[18:38] good look at her little back up
[18:41] okay yes
[18:43] so we got her coming in front
[18:44] and now going to the side by now you
[18:46] should be getting a sense of the pace of
[18:49] a training session like this we're
[18:50] taking advantage of moments when she's
[18:52] compliant while being tolerant during
[18:54] moments when she's distracted
[18:57] almost
[18:59] all right she's getting the idea so now
[19:02] the idea is i can get her in those
[19:03] positions by teaching her how to move
[19:05] her body like this use her back legs her
[19:07] front legs teach her how to pay
[19:09] attention when in a new environment like
[19:11] this and do it in a way that she seems
[19:13] to enjoy if one were to keep this up you
[19:15] would think that she would tend to make
[19:17] a lot of progress moving forward okay
[19:20] yes
[19:23] yes
[19:28] really trying to reward over here just
[19:29] to keep her on one side of me
[19:32] yes you can do whatever side you want
[19:34] i prefer the right
[19:36] but ultimately dogs should know both
[19:38] we're just trying to lay foundation
[19:40] while she's four months old here i'm not
[19:42] expecting perfection at all my
[19:43] competition is this side of the road
[19:46] with all of this vegetation here
[19:50] yeah
[19:51] yes
[19:52] good so a lot of restraint right there
[19:54] okay
[19:55] just like before when we were in the car
[19:56] and we were looking for a quarter second
[19:58] of silence from her here we're looking
[20:00] for a quarter step with walking on a
[20:02] leash and staying next to me and then
[20:04] hopefully we build up to a full step and
[20:06] then two steps and four steps today i'm
[20:09] just trying to get at least four she's
[20:11] looking at me like she's interested
[20:13] in training i like it when she goes into
[20:16] the sit and looks at me automatically
[20:18] i've been rewarding heavily for that
[20:20] it's a way for her to say hey i'm into
[20:22] playing that game that we do when you
[20:24] teach me new things and i get treats
[20:26] yes
[20:29] here
[20:30] good
[20:34] good girl
[20:36] nice correction there did you see how
[20:37] she looked up at me as she went past
[20:39] that was cool
[20:40] here
[20:41] yes
[20:43] look at that
[20:45] i stole a few extra steps there because
[20:47] she was so focused
[20:49] okay come on
[20:51] yes
[20:52] teaching your dog how to walk nicely on
[20:54] a leash without pulling can be
[20:56] challenging at times it's not as simple
[20:58] to teach as things like sit or stay or
[21:00] come i mean there's a variety of reasons
[21:02] it's really unnatural dogs didn't really
[21:04] evolve nor does it appear we selected
[21:06] for dogs to be good at leash skills
[21:08] usually they had to perform tasks that
[21:10] were far away from us think herding
[21:12] livestock or hunting dogs but there's a
[21:14] lot more danger in today's society so
[21:18] it's vital that we have to keep them on
[21:20] leash but remember don't be discouraged
[21:22] by that because the one thing that dogs
[21:24] were selected for above all else was
[21:26] taking direction from people and
[21:28] co-existing well with us
[21:31] yes
[21:32] now with the mental and physical workout
[21:34] that she's had today i'm curious to see
[21:36] how she's going to do on the car ride
[21:37] home happy to report so far
[21:40] that we're
[21:42] driving several minutes now she's been
[21:45] quiet
[21:47] just goes to show what a good workout
[21:50] can do for a dog and training just
[21:52] getting that energy out giving them that
[21:54] satisfaction
[21:55] tends to reduce anxiety tremendously if
[21:58] you're new to having a puppy i think you
[22:00] should try fuzzy's free 7-day trial so
[22:02] that you have veterinary pros on standby
[22:05] anytime that you need them in order to
[22:07] get that free trial you'll have to use

[22:13] tock instagram subscribe to my channel
[22:15] get a copy of both of my books i still
[22:17] have a lot of fun interesting things to

[00:00] we're continuing on with the biscuit
[00:01] series and we're almost at the end of it
[00:03] and i have been so proud of everything
[00:04] that biscuits has accomplished so far
[00:06] we've had some rocky moments
[00:08] we've had some smooth moments but all of
[00:10] the moments have been completely
[00:12] enjoyable being a youtube dog trainer
[00:14] with a good-sized following opens me up
[00:15] to a fair amount of critiques which i
[00:18] welcome and i honestly think it's
[00:20] probably one of the best gifts i could
[00:21] receive but today i'm gonna go there i
[00:24] know a lot of people who watch my videos
[00:26] have puppies and they're looking for a
[00:28] great way to keep their training on
[00:29] track you might want to consider signing
[00:31] up for pupbox i mean when you're new to
[00:32] training a puppy one of the most
[00:34] challenging things is knowing what to
[00:36] work on when and that's the problem that
[00:38] pupbox tries to help you with every
[00:40] single month they're going to give you
[00:41] training advice based on your puppy's
[00:43] specific age and you get a ton of
[00:46] information on a card like this both
[00:48] sides so for example this card comes
[00:50] with a three-month box so a
[00:51] three-month-old dog you know the
[00:53] priorities are developing a bond
[00:54] focusing on positive reinforcement
[00:56] training how to address potty training
[00:58] and of course the inevitable puppy
[01:00] biting look at her she's chewing on the
[01:01] carpet right now this is a great toy
[01:03] we're gonna get her interested in this
[01:05] instead now she's interested in that and
[01:08] not my carpet you get these ultra high
[01:10] quality treats as well every item in a
[01:13] pup box is designed to help you train
[01:15] your dog pumpkin flavored teething
[01:17] grains that's what it's like getting a
[01:19] pup box when you have a young dog you're
[01:20] like this is exactly what i've been
[01:22] missing in my life if you want to try
[01:24] pup box they're going to give you half
[01:25] off your first box when you sign up for
[01:27] a plan by going to my special link
[01:28] pupbox.com zac and using code zac i'll
[01:32] have the info below there's this
[01:33] seemingly endless debate in dog training
[01:35] on what methods should be used in what
[01:37] specific contexts training dogs is
[01:40] objectively a scientific field and that
[01:43] means critical thinking and the
[01:44] implementation of the scientific method
[01:46] are the best tools that we have to
[01:48] achieve success and it's true that
[01:50] different trainers are going to have
[01:51] different goals and different outlooks
[01:52] when it comes to teaching dogs our goal
[01:54] is to bring about optimal behavior
[01:56] without compromising a dog's quality of
[01:58] life or having unintended consequences
[02:00] now in the 18 years that i've been
[02:01] training dogs i've encountered things
[02:03] that have caused me to re-evaluate and
[02:05] alter the way that i teach dogs as well
[02:07] as how i advise you guys in fact the
[02:09] more that i train dogs the more i
[02:11] realize how much i don't know
[02:13] and i embrace that but being a
[02:15] professional dog trainer part of my
[02:16] obligation is to participate in the
[02:18] spirit of peer review and i think we all
[02:21] do this in the interest of progress so
[02:24] there's nothing personal about this i
[02:25] certainly don't take it personally when
[02:27] i'm criticized now when we use the term
[02:29] balance dog training technically that
[02:31] means using a combination of methods
[02:33] that involve rewards as well as
[02:35] corrections it can be easily argued that
[02:38] every dog trainer on earth is using some
[02:40] level of correction or punishment in
[02:42] their dog training after all limiting a
[02:43] dog's access to chasing a squirrel
[02:45] across the street can be defined as
[02:47] being unpleasant to a dog so by that
[02:49] measure well i guess i'm a balanced dog
[02:51] trainer but what i'm talking about is
[02:52] using physically aversive methods like
[02:54] leash pops or using electric collars
[02:57] proactively delivering an unpleasant
[02:59] feeling to discourage undesired behavior
[03:02] and the thing is these approaches
[03:03] represent like a huge percentage of my
[03:07] dog training peers and so it's not like
[03:09] it's just a fringe segment of the dog
[03:11] training community i always have to say
[03:12] this when i talk about this topic my
[03:14] critiquing or criticism here is not
[03:16] aimed at everyday pet guardians out
[03:18] there it is aimed at professional dog
[03:20] trainers who advise you how to train
[03:21] your dog and deep down i am glad that
[03:23] they're there nobody gets into this
[03:25] profession who doesn't have a deep love
[03:27] for dogs and want to help them become
[03:30] better and i totally get it i mean if
[03:32] the aim is to stop an unwanted behavior
[03:35] with a quick prompt correction and that
[03:38] works in the moment it certainly appears
[03:40] as though there's benefit there i mean
[03:42] if a dog is pulling on a leash and you
[03:43] pop them with a choke chain to
[03:45] discourage the pulling and the dog seems
[03:47] to stop pulling well great it works
[03:50] however it's the unintended consequences
[03:52] of this type of training that are just
[03:54] not discussed enough a dog's experiences
[03:57] shape how they live and relying on a
[03:59] strategy that has the possibility to
[04:02] cause a dog to behave fearful or to be
[04:04] intimidated is bound to catch up with us
[04:06] now i understand that is not the
[04:08] intention of trainers who train this way
[04:10] however it does appear that this is the
[04:12] likely consequence of using these
[04:14] methods in many many cases now
[04:17] intuitively this makes sense after all
[04:18] we know that if something unpleasant
[04:21] happens to a dog after they do something
[04:23] that's likely to reduce the odds of that
[04:25] behavior happening in the future i agree
[04:27] with that but it turns out there's more
[04:29] than one way to get dogs to stop doing
[04:32] things we don't like now one of the most
[04:33] valuable things that i've learned as a
[04:35] dog trainer is to beware of intuition
[04:39] hypothetically let's say you appear on
[04:41] planet earth with no education you're
[04:43] just here it'd be very easy to conclude
[04:46] hey the earth is flat and you'd look up
[04:48] at those lights in the sky and probably
[04:50] conclude they're just that lights in the
[04:51] sky not realizing that their other star
[04:54] systems with their own set of planets
[04:56] and on and on there's nothing intuitive
[04:58] about that i think we can all agree
[05:00] there are so many areas in life where we
[05:03] have no idea what it is that we don't
[05:06] know in fact we can't know what we don't
[05:08] know until we know it
[05:11] and this point exactly is what to me is
[05:14] at the heart of so much dysfunction
[05:17] in this whole dog training industry
[05:19] surely you guys have experienced this in
[05:21] other areas of your life i mean the more
[05:23] you learn about a subject the more you
[05:25] realize how much you actually don't know
[05:27] about it now if you've been following
[05:28] this series with biscuits the puppies so
[05:30] far you'll know that teaching her how to
[05:32] accept her crate and be comfortable in
[05:35] it has been quite the challenge
[05:39] one of the things that i want to show
[05:41] her is how to stay at the crate door
[05:44] when i open it but you can imagine if
[05:45] she's been in there for an hour or two
[05:47] she might be really excited to come out
[05:49] and i want to teach her proper conduct
[05:53] on exiting the crate one powerful
[05:55] example of positive reinforcement
[05:56] training that i'm hoping to illustrate
[05:58] in this lesson is how we don't simply
[06:00] get biscuits to tolerate the crate but
[06:03] to prefer being in her crate instead of
[06:06] out of it let's see where we are let's
[06:08] do a baseline
[06:10] she goes in there great
[06:12] my objective here is to have her stay
[06:14] while i open the door
[06:16] that's what she does naturally so right
[06:18] there i want when i open that door i
[06:21] want her to think sit stay see the
[06:24] scratching right there see she's a
[06:25] little frustrated probably that's what i
[06:27] think that means
[06:28] good so i'm going to try to bring down
[06:30] the frustration level yes
[06:32] i'm going to immediately look for
[06:34] reasons to stay to say yes to keep her
[06:36] engaged see on one hand i could accept
[06:39] older and worse information like i don't
[06:41] know i'm the alpha you have to be in
[06:43] that crate and you just need to tolerate
[06:45] it because those are the rules and
[06:46] that's the way you have to learn of
[06:48] course we know these days that accepting
[06:50] the outdated be the alpha or the pac
[06:53] leader is a long outdated concept and of
[06:55] course there's tons of scientific
[06:57] literature to back this up but again the
[06:58] goal isn't simply hey just tolerate
[07:00] being in that crate and be good we want
[07:02] to address the underlying emotional
[07:04] state of biscuits yes
[07:07] good girl
[07:09] give her a quick review okay come
[07:12] yes
[07:13] good
[07:15] lots of things get you treats here good
[07:18] i'm gonna break this down into smaller
[07:19] steps to help her understand yes
[07:22] by not pushing her to frustration and
[07:24] also while looking for smaller successes
[07:26] we can make progress without risking the
[07:28] setbacks
[07:30] yes
[07:31] do you see how i'm trying to avoid her
[07:33] failing at all in that example we
[07:35] literally had the door open for a split
[07:37] second before she could react and
[07:39] provided her with something she liked a
[07:41] piece of her meal before she could even
[07:43] attempt to run out of the crate we've
[07:44] gotten her comfortable with being in the
[07:46] crate i'm throwing down a couple of
[07:48] kibbles there
[07:49] yes i'm catching her succeeding while
[07:52] opening the door failing would be her
[07:54] going out of the crate on purpose so
[07:57] right now for this training lesson i'm
[07:59] trying to teach her the concept of
[08:01] coming out only with permission
[08:05] okay good okay not quite there yet she
[08:07] anticipated more than i'd like i'm
[08:09] trying to avoid closing the door to
[08:11] prevent her from running out because i
[08:12] want her to think more
[08:14] see how i'm doing it a bit more
[08:16] realistically as we continue on with the
[08:18] training session so let's try not to say
[08:20] no this is what trips people up there
[08:22] like if you don't correct them how will
[08:23] they ever learn so really good example
[08:26] it's on me to try and catch her
[08:27] succeeding here let's see there's
[08:28] nothing wrong at all with saying the
[08:29] word no however i point this out to show
[08:31] how overused and unnecessary it is in so
[08:34] many cases for example if i were relying
[08:36] on disciplining or correcting her here
[08:38] for not behaving as i wanted to in the
[08:40] crate i don't think i would see her
[08:42] optimistic body language like those
[08:44] bright eyes coupled with her tail
[08:45] wagging and holding her position and
[08:48] again i understand that tail wagging
[08:49] doesn't always mean a dog is happy but
[08:51] the totality of her body language here
[08:54] appears as though she's in a reduced
[08:56] stress state so my back is turned
[08:59] i'm gonna just like
[09:00] let her check out first just a second
[09:02] not too long because i still want her
[09:04] engaged in this particular training
[09:06] session but i'm gradually trying to
[09:08] simulate more and more realistic
[09:10] conditions
[09:12] yes
[09:15] okay we've communicated so strongly that
[09:18] staying in the crate works for her that
[09:20] she's actually reluctant to come out of
[09:22] it okay come on good girl she had to
[09:25] think there and that's really what we're
[09:27] trying to make happen here
[09:29] she's like being in here is wonderful
[09:32] yes that's what's so fun about positive
[09:34] reinforcement training you get to really
[09:36] find lots of fun reasons to interact
[09:39] with your dog in a way that they enjoy
[09:40] and you enjoy and i mean just watching
[09:43] her learn is special isn't it
[09:49] okay
[09:50] oh interesting moment there it's like
[09:53] she started to break and then she sat
[09:56] and then i preemptively released her and
[09:58] she's like no i'll stay here instead i'm
[10:00] thrilled with this training session
[10:02] right here she's not perfect yet for her
[10:04] first training session on this
[10:05] particular thing i think this was a
[10:07] great example of how to connect with the
[10:09] dog in a way that is enjoyable for you
[10:12] and your dog by the way so many of you
[10:14] have been asking about our sponsor's
[10:15] crate the diggs revel it's really sturdy
[10:17] and high quality and i love that it
[10:19] gives you lots of options for your dog
[10:21] to reward them from the top for example
[10:23] and unlike most dog crates it actually
[10:24] looks good i'll have a link below now
[10:26] one of the more advanced tasks that i'm
[10:27] working on with biscuits is teaching her
[10:29] how to go to and stay at a
[10:31] pre-determined mark in this case a
[10:34] cutting board you might remember we were
[10:36] using the cutting board to get her to go
[10:38] to her yes
[10:39] to go to her mark okay
[10:42] let's see if we can get her a little
[10:43] warmed up real quick believe it or not
[10:44] we see many trainers use electric
[10:46] collars to teach a dog how to go to a
[10:48] spot and stay like this using electric
[10:50] collars on a low level which provides a
[10:52] constant slightly unpleasant feeling to
[10:54] the dog until the dog inadvertently
[10:56] stumbles upon the mark at which time
[10:58] they'll relieve the pressure of the
[11:00] electric stimulation and that's
[11:01] literally what the dog is working for
[11:04] now look if that method were the only
[11:05] way or even a more effective way i could
[11:07] attempt to appreciate it but here i'm
[11:10] doing an experiment and seeing if i can
[11:11] do this by relying exclusively on
[11:14] positive reinforcement training and
[11:15] without using this unnecessary step of
[11:18] providing an unpleasant consequence to
[11:20] the dog in this case electric
[11:22] stimulation at their neck you can see
[11:24] how adding the component of distance me
[11:26] being farther back over there seems to
[11:28] make it a little more complicated i can
[11:30] reliably get her to do it by
[11:32] coming over here
[11:34] yes
[11:36] and walking with her can i phase in a
[11:38] hand signal this way okay come on let's
[11:40] go
[11:44] yes
[11:45] second she makes contact okay
[11:48] with that cutting board
[11:50] here
[11:53] yes
[11:59] okay
[12:00] yes
[12:03] go to your spot
[12:05] here's a clear example of her doing
[12:07] something i definitely don't want her
[12:09] doing i don't want her scratching at her
[12:11] mark like that how can you use positive
[12:13] reinforcement exclusively in an instance
[12:15] where your dog is doing something that
[12:17] you definitely don't want them to do
[12:19] biscuits
[12:22] yes and see even there it's tempting to
[12:25] really get in there and say no don't do
[12:26] that but really if you give them that
[12:28] alternative thing to do in this case
[12:29] coming to me did you see the spirit with
[12:31] which she was running towards me that's
[12:32] what we want her mood isn't killed
[12:34] you're not frustrated the magic moment
[12:36] comes when she's looking at my finger
[12:38] and then looks ahead of her that's what
[12:39] i'm looking for yes
[12:41] i love how she's troubleshooting okay
[12:44] come
[12:45] good
[12:46] i'm going to elect not to reward there
[12:48] just to keep it random starting to phase
[12:50] out treats a bit let me give her a point
[12:56] yes
[12:59] yes
[13:00] a little little guidance back there to
[13:01] get all four paws on there yes
[13:05] notice how she's not breaking on the
[13:06] word yes
[13:07] she knows the difference between yes
[13:10] and the letters o and k
[13:12] by walking around her i'm kind of
[13:14] encouraging her to reorient herself too
[13:27] i have no idea what that's about
[13:30] what do you see girl what is it
[13:32] i think she must have heard something in
[13:33] the bedroom i've got inertia in there
[13:37] you can see her pile of erection right
[13:38] here that's where their hair stands up
[13:40] usually means a dog is a little unsure
[13:42] so in this case i'm not going to yell at
[13:44] biscuits or discipline her i'm going to
[13:46] give her a second to recalibrate when
[13:47] she realizes this isn't really getting
[13:49] or anything and see what happens the
[13:51] real goal of training dogs is to teach
[13:53] them how to think for themselves and
[13:54] problem solve go to your spot yes
[13:58] nice
[14:00] very good
[14:04] okay good releasing her
[14:08] go to your spot
[14:11] yes
[14:17] and you remember
[14:21] yes
[14:22] good you see how she put them on there
[14:24] for a second all four with a point while
[14:27] this skill is so often trained with
[14:28] negative reinforcement or applying a
[14:30] physical punisher i want to let you
[14:32] decide if it looks easier and more
[14:34] pleasant to the dog to train it using
[14:36] positive reinforcements mixing play like
[14:39] this in with training can really be
[14:40] beneficial maybe that's in the form of
[14:42] playing with a dog or fetch or anything
[14:43] but it's a really good way for their
[14:45] brain to reset
[14:48] she's a terror i mean i was a kid who
[14:50] loved recess so i don't know about you
[14:53] guys but that's what it reminds me of
[14:56] notice how cautious inertia is to not
[14:58] step on her with her back feet and i
[15:00] hear some of you out there right zach
[15:02] that's all great but what do you do when
[15:03] you're out of your nice cozy living room
[15:05] and you gotta go train in the real world
[15:07] that is how some of you sound you know
[15:09] but i applaud the question let's make
[15:10] our way down the mountain
[15:12] snowy this is zach's literal first time
[15:15] driving on snow where i'm from in
[15:17] atlanta if there's ice anywhere in the
[15:19] city on the road we're shut down in here
[15:21] solid snow
[15:23] i got four-wheel drive though baby well
[15:25] all wheel drive so
[15:27] yeah we're in trouble fortunately down
[15:30] here there's no snow when you're having
[15:32] your dog exit the car it's a really
[15:34] vital time to teach them how to
[15:37] stay in this specific context
[15:41] yes good i'm just reminding her because
[15:43] i actually haven't done this in public
[15:45] yet you can see there's a car coming so
[15:47] i'm going to be extra careful here
[15:48] always be aware of your surroundings
[15:51] notice i haven't said stay either in
[15:53] other words with her i think it's good
[15:55] if she just assumes this is how i behave
[15:58] when a human comes near the crate here
[16:01] okay let's go good girl got a little bit
[16:04] of traffic out here today nice amount of
[16:06] healthy distractions socialization
[16:09] opportunities wow this place beautiful
[16:12] love good dog training weather now we
[16:14] all know that going in public with a dog
[16:16] presents tons of unknowns i mean you can
[16:19] expect just about anything from mundane
[16:21] everyday events to i don't know a giant
[16:23] parachute monster coming out of the
[16:25] ground and charging at biscuits oh oh
[16:28] wow holy cow
[16:30] oh shoot you know i didn't even think
[16:33] about it but she's trying to gain
[16:35] distance in training there's lots of
[16:36] different options when it comes to
[16:38] handling an issue like this and believe
[16:40] it or not some trainers would actually
[16:41] firmly correct a dog for leaving the
[16:44] immediate area of the trainer even
[16:45] though the dog was scared by something
[16:47] and the way that a trainer may justify
[16:49] this is look i've got to keep my dog
[16:51] safe they can't be running away from me
[16:52] like this they need to know you've got
[16:54] to stay in my immediate area no matter
[16:56] what and trust me and the aim is noble i
[16:59] understand why they do that but i have
[17:01] to ask myself is there a way to help a
[17:04] dog work through an event like this
[17:06] without forcing them to stay in one spot
[17:09] i like to avoid correcting a dog who's
[17:11] experiencing fear as i don't want to
[17:14] amplify that fear by doing something
[17:15] that's unpleasant to them because that
[17:17] can really complicate training in the
[17:18] future i mean dogs remember things they
[17:20] could easily remember hey that one time
[17:22] i was scared i had that additional
[17:24] stressful event imposed upon me that
[17:26] unpleasant correction and now i'm not so
[17:28] into that training session so what i opt
[17:30] to do in these situations is allow them
[17:32] to seek safety within reason in this
[17:34] case biscuits wanted to walk away and
[17:36] ideally i like them to be able to
[17:38] observe the thing that's causing them to
[17:39] feel uncomfortable from a safe distance
[17:42] she's learned she could come to me
[17:44] for safety here i'm gonna let her take
[17:46] it in from her level looks like they're
[17:47] doing lessons of some kind to learn how
[17:49] to fly them huh and so in a case like
[17:51] this where she's made sense of the
[17:53] parachute probably i'm in a position to
[17:55] reinforce now her newfound confidence
[17:58] one thing i'm really paying attention to
[18:00] is what is the ratio between her
[18:02] willingness to pay attention to me
[18:04] during a training lesson versus her
[18:07] wanting to check out her environment i'm
[18:08] hoping to really balance those two
[18:10] things it's also really beneficial to
[18:13] understand what your dog is into at any
[18:15] given moment not always easy by the way
[18:17] now all of us know that biscuits has
[18:18] been knocking it out of the park on fly
[18:20] down from her past lessons remember lie
[18:23] down but look at her right here she's
[18:25] not honoring my request to lie down and
[18:27] it seems really tough for her to
[18:28] remember lie down out here this is
[18:30] something she was doing at the house so
[18:32] well very recently the aversive approach
[18:35] here would be look i know you know this
[18:37] i'm gonna make you do it so you
[18:39] understand dog that this is not optional
[18:41] but in reality i really need to do my
[18:43] best to understand things from her
[18:45] perspective for example is the texture
[18:46] of the grass throwing her off is it all
[18:48] the distractions is it the environment
[18:50] is it some scent in the air all of these
[18:52] things should be considered as potential
[18:54] contributors to her not complying with
[18:56] my request so while i could just as
[18:57] easily stand on the leash or force her
[19:00] to lie down to take direction from me
[19:02] she'd most likely not be in the most
[19:04] optimistic mindset moving forward and
[19:06] that can kill your progress ideally i
[19:08] really want her in a favorable state of
[19:10] mind not only now but in future
[19:12] instances like this later in life it's
[19:14] not just as simple as getting your dog
[19:16] to do whatever it is you're trying to
[19:18] get them to do you have to consider
[19:20] their overall mindset so instead i'm
[19:22] thinking okay let's not push the issue
[19:24] here let her check out the things around
[19:26] her and what can i do to become more
[19:28] interesting to her and more worth
[19:30] listening to you know a genuinely fun
[19:33] attitude and good treats often go a
[19:36] really long way remember lie down
[19:39] yes good
[19:42] okay
[19:43] good
[19:46] we really need to be tolerant of that
[19:48] such a young dog or any dog who's
[19:50] unsocialized with the world
[19:52] good girl okay
[19:54] good job
[19:57] yes
[19:58] she just goes back in the city right now
[19:59] i mean we're just doing some screensaver
[20:01] training but i'm really
[20:03] acknowledging that she's behaving well
[20:05] and calmly around all these distractions
[20:06] out here today this is good
[20:09] but then again for whatever reason i
[20:11] don't know what's going on in her head
[20:13] biscuits becomes uneasy when a couple of
[20:15] young people walk by an aversive
[20:17] approach would likely require me to
[20:19] deliver a prompt physical correction to
[20:22] quell that symptom the barking but my
[20:24] goal isn't to stop the barking my goal
[20:27] is to focus on the cause most likely
[20:29] biscuit's lack of exposure to strangers
[20:31] appearing out of nowhere in her short
[20:33] life and in this case just being a
[20:35] little understanding was all that was
[20:36] necessary to get a prompt recovery
[20:40] oh
[20:40] one of the things that i'm hoping to
[20:42] work on with her today that's a bit new
[20:44] to her is come to me
[20:46] when she's distracted this is the first
[20:48] artificial distraction i'm going to use
[20:50] out here you can see how much she loves
[20:52] it here you go
[20:53] get that toy sit
[20:58] here
[20:59] okay
[21:00] yes there we go
[21:02] good start i'm loving it see if we can
[21:05] improve on that
[21:07] one of the great things about an
[21:08] exercise like this is that you can
[21:10] really start to combine things
[21:12] like leave it
[21:13] look at me
[21:15] come
[21:16] sit
[21:17] throw and lie down there and you can see
[21:20] how well i mean first time every time
[21:22] there that was a nice little example i
[21:23] think really one of the bigger takeaways
[21:25] from this particular lesson with me is
[21:27] the tempo it's like sometimes she'll
[21:28] give me 10 seconds sometimes she'll give
[21:30] me two minutes and then she needs a
[21:32] break and if you can really be there to
[21:33] capitalize on it when they are willingly
[21:35] giving you their attention over time
[21:37] that will trend into being able to get
[21:38] their attention when you ask for it it's
[21:40] really interesting getting to know her
[21:42] this is why we're always talking about
[21:43] getting to know your individual dog and
[21:45] understanding them because not all dogs
[21:47] respond the same way she's getting a ton
[21:49] of socialization of tall grass today i
[21:51] appreciate that tall grass is something
[21:53] she's going to have to deal with i mean
[21:55] most grass is probably taller than her
[21:57] anyway biscuits
[21:59] come
[22:00] dogs aren't just little robots they are
[22:02] actual life forms and they will act
[22:05] unpredictably at times and i'm under no
[22:07] illusion that because i like to train a

[00:00] not going to get triggered in this video
[00:01] i'm not
[00:03] i've got some things that i've got to
[00:04] get off of my chest
[00:06] today now keep in mind the things i'm
[00:08] going to talk about today are very much
[00:09] from a dog trainer's perspective there's
[00:12] a few scenarios that i can think of
[00:14] right
[00:14] now where i have to be borderline rude
[00:18] with people when i'm out and about and
[00:20] then it leaves me wondering are they
[00:21] going to complain about me on the
[00:23] internet and try to get me cancelled the
[00:25] thing is sometimes it can be hard to
[00:27] advocate for your dog while
[00:29] simultaneously being nice to strangers
[00:31] the irony is that this video is probably
[00:34] more for people who don't have a dog
[00:36] than who do have a dog recently our dog
[00:38] inertia had surgery bree and i had
[00:41] talked about it we decided to wait until
[00:42] she was a bit older to spay her due to
[00:44] the research that we've done we felt
[00:46] better about that and you know after
[00:48] your dog goes to a medical event like
[00:49] that you've got to let them recover and
[00:50] you know inertia was convinced she was
[00:52] fully recovered practically the next day
[00:55] my dog was spayed six days ago period
[00:58] how long until she can play fetch again
[01:00] question mark does anyone else do
[01:02] dictation instead of typing fuzzy is a
[01:04] service that we continue to use all of
[01:06] the time it's like if your best friend
[01:08] was a vet or vet tech and you could just
[01:11] text them anytime you wanted to every
[01:13] time we've done this less than a minute
[01:14] wait time and see that's good she
[01:16] thought to ask for a picture i happen to
[01:18] have one right there oh savannah's
[01:19] typing that's great nice job keeping her
[01:22] from licking the incision thank you very
[01:23] much savannah so basically she's saying
[01:25] inertia looks like she's on the tail end
[01:27] of her recovery but i should probably
[01:28] still work up to fetch at least over you
[01:30] know about three more days and that is
[01:32] why i am a dog trainer and not a vet or
[01:36] vet tech fuzzy is going to give you
[01:37] seven days of totally unlimited
[01:39] questions completely free go to
[01:41] yourfuzzy.com i think a lot of you guys
[01:43] are going to relate with this i mean
[01:44] when you have a cute dog which dog is
[01:47] not cute everybody in the world wants to
[01:50] pet them and look deep down honestly i
[01:52] want to pet everyone's dog too i get it
[01:54] but look if you're training a dog it's
[01:57] probably not the best idea to let said
[01:59] dog be pet by anyone who wants to bet
[02:01] them so in general when you're outside
[02:03] of the house and family there are two
[02:05] types of people seemingly that want to
[02:08] pet your dog i mean there's this type of
[02:09] person who'll see your dog and they just
[02:11] cannot resist asking you to pet your dog
[02:14] but then there are people who don't ask
[02:16] at all to pet your dog and pet them
[02:18] without asking and believe it or not i'm
[02:20] not just talking about toddlers here
[02:22] like grown-ups do this all of the time
[02:24] all right but let's talk about the first
[02:26] type first like people who come up to
[02:27] you in public and they ask very nicely
[02:29] can i please pet your dog there's
[02:31] nothing wrong with that i mean your
[02:32] dog's amazing it's nice that other
[02:34] people realize that but almost all of
[02:36] the time i'm still going to tell them no
[02:38] i'm always asking myself how can i do
[02:41] that without being a jerk i mean
[02:43] someone's actually paying you a
[02:44] compliment when they get up the courage
[02:46] enough to ask you if they can pet your
[02:47] dog i can't tell you how many times that
[02:49] someone's asked this and i've told them
[02:51] no not right now i'm training my dog
[02:53] yeah in training trying to teach her not
[02:55] to run up to dogs you can't help but
[02:58] feel like they're somewhat offended by
[02:59] that or at least really thrown off
[03:01] because i think the average person would
[03:03] say yeah sure go ahead i'm not saying
[03:05] you should never ever let anybody pet
[03:07] your dog when you're out in public but
[03:08] generally especially if you're training
[03:10] your dog it's probably not a good idea
[03:12] to let anyone who wants to pet them pet
[03:13] them i mean obviously lots of dogs have
[03:15] different personalities i mean maybe
[03:17] your dog is perfectly happy and loves
[03:19] people but you might risk having them
[03:21] have that excitement and that jumping
[03:23] behavior and that exuberance be
[03:25] reinforced by getting pet by another
[03:27] person and that's not exactly compatible
[03:29] with having a well-behaved dog in public
[03:31] or at the other end of the spectrum
[03:33] maybe your dog's really nervous or
[03:34] doesn't like being approached by
[03:35] strangers that could potentially make a
[03:37] dog really uncomfortable or maybe it
[03:39] just is throwing off your rhythm and
[03:41] training in general who knows but you
[03:43] know look i understand it's a fine line
[03:45] when you're socializing a young puppy
[03:46] too and i believe deeply in
[03:48] socialization with people and strangers
[03:50] but you know there's a time and a place
[03:52] for puppy socialization and when you're
[03:54] out in public training your dog and you
[03:56] don't have any planned socialization
[03:58] events in mind particularly with
[04:00] strangers that's probably not the most
[04:02] ideal situation of course these are just
[04:04] general guidelines there's going to be
[04:05] situations where you decide this is a
[04:07] great opportunity for someone to pet
[04:09] your dog but of course you want to make
[04:11] that decision now let's talk about the
[04:13] second type of person which is really
[04:15] helping me kind of get at the heart of
[04:16] things that i need to really
[04:19] get off my chest today the person who
[04:21] comes up to your dog does not ask and
[04:24] puts their hands on them or attempts to
[04:26] i think most of you watching this video
[04:29] know and understand how inconsiderate
[04:31] that can be i cannot think of a single
[04:33] scenario where it's okay to go up to
[04:35] somebody's dog when the person is there
[04:37] with them and interact with them without
[04:40] permission i mean this can go so wrong
[04:42] in so many ways with so many dogs even
[04:45] if your dog is a super happy dog who
[04:48] loves to be pet by strangers you still
[04:50] run the risk of reinforcing them that
[04:51] hey there's a stranger i get to jump on
[04:53] that stranger and get pets and that is
[04:55] likely to make life difficult for you
[04:57] moving forward and also like i said
[04:59] before there is a time and a place to
[05:00] socialize your dog but randomly without
[05:03] a plan i mean that's just not it you
[05:05] guys can help me with this i mean what
[05:07] can we do to help generally educate the
[05:10] public to number one don't go up to a
[05:12] dog without permission and pet them and
[05:14] secondly if someone tells you no when
[05:17] you ask to pet their dog don't be
[05:18] offended you know as a side note i mean
[05:20] we've accepted this basic etiquette with
[05:22] service dogs in public for a long time
[05:24] most people are supposed to know that
[05:26] you don't go up to a working dog and try
[05:28] to pet them and if they don't know that
[05:30] they'll probably be corrected by any
[05:32] service dog handler but personally i
[05:34] mean my feeling is i think we should
[05:36] extend this courtesy to any dog in
[05:38] public who's being walked or trained or
[05:40] whatever this next point hits home with
[05:42] me and i think it will with a lot of you
[05:44] as well when i run into people in public
[05:46] let's say like a subscriber or something
[05:48] they usually fall broadly speaking into
[05:50] a couple of categories sometimes they
[05:52] just wave say hi like your videos
[05:54] sometimes they want to stop and chat and
[05:56] interact with the dog that i'm working
[05:58] with and sometimes they want to talk a
[05:59] little bit longer and get a photo very
[06:02] flattering and not realizing that most
[06:04] of the time if i'm working with a dog in
[06:06] public i really do need to keep like a
[06:10] hundred percent of my attention on the
[06:12] dog that i'm training i mean number one
[06:14] for safety and secondly to make sure
[06:16] that my training doesn't go off the
[06:17] rails and i also want to make sure that
[06:19] i'm a responsible trainer to the dog
[06:21] that i'm working with even if i risk
[06:23] coming off a bit rude i mean especially
[06:25] if i'm working with a dog that's very
[06:27] delicate or likely to start reacting to
[06:29] something at any moment i don't really
[06:31] have a lot of time really at all to
[06:34] explain to them what i'm doing and
[06:35] that's because the second your attention
[06:37] is divided things are likely to
[06:39] deteriorate quickly with the dog that
[06:41] you're training so i mean the dilemma is
[06:43] i always find myself trying to be really
[06:45] nice and polite to the person while also
[06:47] keeping my training on track and so my
[06:49] case i just about always elect to keep
[06:51] my focus on the dog that i'm working
[06:53] with and even if that means being
[06:54] shorter than i'd like with very friendly
[06:57] people in public and it's a really good
[06:59] idea to think ahead of time about what
[07:00] you're going to say to people whether
[07:02] it's a friendly stranger a neighbor or
[07:03] whoever in my case i'll usually say
[07:05] sorry i've been training right now
[07:07] thanks for asking if i can even get it
[07:09] out seriously in some touchy situations
[07:11] maybe i can get three words in what can
[07:13] you say in three words
[07:15] not now by
[07:16] of everyone on the planet you guys know
[07:19] how dogs can be so look if you've got to
[07:22] be short with someone to keep your dog
[07:23] under threshold don't feel bad about
[07:25] that i think especially dog lovers will
[07:27] understand this next one is actually for
[07:29] people who do have dogs but you know
[07:32] look at this one
[07:34] i'm not going to get triggered in this
[07:35] video i'm not sometimes it's not a
[07:38] person at all that comes up to you
[07:40] surely most of us have experienced
[07:42] having an off-leash dog approach us when
[07:46] we're on a walk with our dog and look a
[07:47] lot of that's on us i mean if you're
[07:49] gonna take your dog to an area where
[07:51] it's either legal
[07:52] and or customary for dogs to be off
[07:55] leash then you need to take that into
[07:56] account as well now personally i try to
[07:59] avoid putting myself in situations like
[08:01] that and in much of the united states
[08:03] it's not legal to have your dog off
[08:05] leash in many public areas i actually
[08:07] don't mind seeing other off-leash dogs
[08:09] even if it is technically against the
[08:11] rules i mean after all i've had my dogs
[08:13] off leash plenty over the years in
[08:16] environments where they weren't supposed
[08:18] to be off leash but keep in mind i mean
[08:20] i spent considerable time training them
[08:21] and effort making sure that they were
[08:23] reliable in an environment like that
[08:25] before
[08:26] doing that you can see how we did a lot
[08:28] of off leash training with inertia but
[08:30] even today she's just not off leash
[08:31] willy-nilly anywhere but only in places
[08:34] where she's reliable and by reliable i
[08:36] mean she'll hold a down stay she'll come
[08:38] to me when i call her and so on even if
[08:40] she sees another dog and the thing is
[08:42] like if a dog is running up to my dog
[08:45] that is immediate evidence that they are
[08:47] not reliable and should not be off leash
[08:49] in that situation i think it must be
[08:51] common for a lot of people to assume
[08:53] that hey my dog is so friendly even if
[08:56] they run up to someone they're so
[08:58] non-threatening and they probably just
[09:00] want to say hi and after all if someone
[09:01] can't take a nice greeting from a dog
[09:03] what kind of person are they i think
[09:05] what we have to remember is that dogs
[09:08] are pretty complex beings i mean not
[09:10] every dog is welcoming of a strange dog
[09:13] coming up to them that really puts other
[09:16] people in a very awkward situation it
[09:18] can be really upsetting i mean if you've
[09:20] worked with your dog very hard and
[09:21] you're keeping them on leash and you're
[09:23] abiding by the rules and you still have
[09:24] to deal with unplanned or unwanted
[09:26] encounters it's certainly stressful to
[09:29] the person it could be very stressful to
[09:31] your dog as well and obviously it could
[09:33] even be dangerous depending on context
[09:35] you know personally inertia is the first
[09:38] dog that i've had that really enjoys the
[09:41] company of other dogs with my first
[09:44] generation of border collies i have a
[09:46] lot of experience of keeping dogs away
[09:48] from my guys i'm gonna tell you what my
[09:50] protocol is when an off-leash dog
[09:53] approaches me i'm not saying you should
[09:54] do this i'm just telling you how i
[09:56] handle it number one i'm gonna make sure
[09:57] my dog is in a down stay and i will not
[10:01] in any circumstance that i can think of
[10:03] right now
[10:04] allow a strange dog that i don't know to
[10:08] interact with my dog spontaneously like
[10:10] that i mean i don't care how friendly
[10:11] they look how sweet they are i will
[10:13] physically step in and prevent a dog if
[10:16] necessary from interacting with my dogs
[10:18] now fortunately most dogs are pretty
[10:20] good at understanding body language so a
[10:22] prompt no or ah or whatever is probably
[10:25] something that they've heard before and
[10:27] usually body language like that from me
[10:29] and being very obvious i don't want this
[10:31] dog near my dogs really clues the other
[10:33] person in so hopefully the dog has a
[10:35] good recall and runs back if not then
[10:37] you know i try to create a physical
[10:39] barrier more or less the thing is i'm
[10:41] obviously a dog lover i hope that's
[10:42] obvious anyway and i wish i could meet
[10:44] and interact with every dog on earth but
[10:47] again it really does come down to the
[10:49] setting there's a time and a place for
[10:51] dog to dog interaction i know that when
[10:53] brie and i are on a walk together we
[10:55] have a system where one of us will take
[10:57] care of the dog while the other keeps
[10:59] the off-leash dog away so if you have a
[11:01] partner that can be helpful i mean guys
[11:03] understand an interaction between two
[11:05] dogs can go so many different ways and
[11:08] not all of them are positive i feel like
[11:11] i've worked with enough dogs to
[11:13] understand that i can't be so arrogant
[11:15] to think that i can size up and know
[11:17] what a dog is thinking or feeling or
[11:19] what their motivations are in two
[11:20] seconds and even if they're completely
[11:22] friendly
[11:23] you don't know what my dog's going to do
[11:24] i mean my dog's going to play with them
[11:26] but another dog might not so what about
[11:28] when you're pressured by someone else
[11:30] who has a dog say a perfectly friendly
[11:32] well-trained dog and they insist
[11:35] we should have our dogs play together
[11:36] and again as i've said throughout this
[11:37] video i'm all for this in a specific
[11:40] situation but almost never with a dog
[11:42] that i've just met i mean i got a page
[11:44] of questions to ask i need to get to
[11:46] know this dog before i have them
[11:48] interact with my dog i mean you think
[11:49] about the moira series i didn't think
[11:51] moira and inertia had a similar enough
[11:54] playstyle to necessarily interact during
[11:56] that series right i didn't even have
[11:58] them interact at all brie and inertia
[12:00] are down there but moira is like really
[12:03] really wound up however moira since has
[12:05] shown she's wonderful when she interacts
[12:07] with other dogs and in hindsight i think
[12:10] inertia and moira probably would have
[12:12] been great friends but i wasn't
[12:13] completely sure so that was the call
[12:15] that i made think about it even in your
[12:17] immediate circle with your friends and
[12:19] your family it's kind of this common
[12:20] expectation like oh i've got a new dog
[12:22] or you've got a new dog they should
[12:24] become best friends right now if you're
[12:26] comfortable with this and you know your
[12:28] dog really well and you feel like you
[12:29] know the other dog very well set up a
[12:31] play date let them play if you're pretty
[12:34] sure they'll be good together but not
[12:35] completely sure remember you can always
[12:37] use things like a basket muzzle on the
[12:39] dogs which are a really humane way to
[12:41] keep them from biting each other but
[12:43] look i'm telling you if you feel like
[12:46] your dog's play style does not match
[12:49] that dog's play style do not hesitate to
[12:52] say no never feel obligated to have your
[12:55] dog interact with another dog if you're
[12:58] uncomfortable with it full stop you're
[13:00] the one who's taking agency and your
[13:02] dog's upbringing so don't feel like you
[13:05] need to succumb to pressure from
[13:06] strangers friends family or anybody else
[13:10] that's what i think anyway
[13:12] i wonder what fuzzy thinks hey fuzzy

[00:00] so if you haven't heard we have a new
[00:01] puppy and her name is veronica by the
[00:03] way i'm zach george i train dogs this is
[00:05] my wife bree george hello we're gonna
[00:07] show you how we train veronica
[00:08] absolutely everything are you interested
[00:11] in learning how to teach your puppy or
[00:12] how we teach our puppy well then
[00:14] consider subscribing to our channel like
[00:16] in this episode for example i'm going to
[00:17] show you an exercise that takes minutes
[00:19] to train that will show you how to teach
[00:21] your dog to pay attention to you here at
[00:22] least i hope it goes that way i'm going
[00:24] to try to see if i can get veronica to
[00:26] sleep all the way through the night and
[00:27] hopefully we'll make some progress on
[00:29] excessive barking from this young lady
[00:31] but why do i have the feeling that we're
[00:32] really gonna have to play the long game
[00:34] on this one oh you stopped arcing now
[00:36] okay can pop box tell me how to get her
[00:38] to stop biting me right now uh oh
[00:40] it's like pop box knows what our dog is
[00:43] thinking before we or they know it and
[00:46] somehow this is a product we can buy
[00:48] they give you advice based on your
[00:50] puppy's specific age
[00:53] and i always love the tips that i get on
[00:55] this card it's packed with info front
[00:57] and back so there's plenty to work on
[00:59] for month-to-month classic right here
[01:01] always a hit and the reason i like toys
[01:04] like this they're fun to bite on for
[01:06] dogs they're engaging like this one has
[01:08] a squeaker most importantly i've got her
[01:10] attention if i've got her attention i
[01:11] can teach her anything like this month
[01:13] they actually gave us two things that
[01:15] i've gotten for us before this really
[01:18] good enzyme cleaner and wipes for our
[01:20] puppy all of you can get half off of pup
[01:22] box when you use my special link
[01:24] pupbox.com zac and use code zack i'll
[01:27] have the info below hey let's go to the
[01:29] studio and teach you how to pay
[01:30] attention yes please hey bri yes i think
[01:34] you and i should talk about what we've
[01:37] learned about her because we've had her
[01:38] a few days now okay what do you think
[01:40] what have we learned about her i've
[01:42] learned that
[01:43] she definitely doesn't know that much
[01:46] yet
[01:46] [Laughter]
[01:48] she's a lot to learn it seems like but i
[01:50] feel like she's really smart i'm excited
[01:52] to watch her learn stuff to say she
[01:54] doesn't know a lot that would make
[01:56] perfect sense because she's a younger
[01:58] dog and everything it's been a couple of
[02:00] days now i feel like the real veronica's
[02:02] coming out
[02:04] she's starting to bite a little bit more
[02:06] be a little more demanding
[02:10] her separation anxiety needs work so far
[02:12] she does not like to be alone and that's
[02:15] a tough issue and really i think one of
[02:17] the reasons she doesn't like to be alone
[02:19] is that she's been very well loved in
[02:21] foster care before us well yeah she's
[02:23] never been alone as far as i know she's
[02:25] lived with a bunch of other dogs at
[02:27] least even if people left for a while
[02:29] she had six litter mates and she loves
[02:32] being with people which really is a
[02:34] great blessing but if we want to go out
[02:36] to eat for three hours forget it unless
[02:39] we want to deal with a very anxious dog
[02:41] at home her relationship with inertia
[02:43] has been mostly
[02:46] slowly evolving i think but they did
[02:48] have a setback yesterday
[02:51] i mean physically she seemed totally
[02:52] fine i think it just scared her a little
[02:54] bit but i don't want her to be scared of
[02:55] inertia yeah she and inertia have gotten
[02:57] along in everything but still veronica
[03:00] hasn't really embraced inertia fully i
[03:02] guess she's like only when i'm in the
[03:04] exact right mood do i want to play and
[03:06] that may be her personality she may be
[03:07] like that forever or she may come out of
[03:09] her shell and they might start to
[03:10] roughhouse a lot more you still haven't
[03:12] taught her usually the first thing that
[03:13] you teach a dog and i thought that was
[03:15] kind of weird what's the deal why
[03:16] doesn't she know how to leave it yet
[03:18] when you work with as many dogs as we do
[03:19] it's fun to mix things up and try and go
[03:21] in different orders and see if one
[03:23] offers an advantage and so with her in
[03:25] the first few days i really wanted the
[03:27] main focus to be on the bond and getting
[03:28] to know her personality not on how many
[03:30] tricks or things she can do but really
[03:32] just get to know her before we start
[03:34] really getting into training but i've
[03:36] been touching on one or two things a day
[03:38] with her just like real low-key just to
[03:39] kind of introduce the concept and i
[03:41] guess yeah we should continue that today
[03:43] with leave it leave it's tough for a
[03:45] puppy because you're asking them to hey
[03:47] don't do that thing you want to do which
[03:49] is get that treat so
[03:51] we shall see we teach leave it because
[03:53] it teaches impulse control and lessons
[03:55] like this are also great for teaching
[03:56] them how to think in general it's also a
[03:58] great lesson in showing you the person
[04:00] how to communicate with your own dog too
[04:02] it's really incredible how much traction
[04:04] you can gain from a simple training
[04:06] session just like this one yes
[04:08] initially i want to catch her
[04:10] accidentally leaving a treat alone for
[04:12] just a fraction of a second then i'll
[04:13] say yes and i'll give her a treat so yes
[04:16] means something as if to say i love that
[04:18] tiny bit of restraint you accidentally
[04:20] offered me just now
[04:24] leave it
[04:27] yes
[04:30] you're doing a great job but just
[04:32] leaving something alone isn't really
[04:33] what i'm trying to teach her here really
[04:35] it's about pausing her and getting her
[04:38] attention on me so that i can direct her
[04:40] and guide her and it's a clear easy way
[04:42] to introduce that concept for the first
[04:44] time and in a way that gets her to do it
[04:47] completely voluntarily without any
[04:49] physical pressure of any kind here yes
[04:53] and i love that snappy turn that she's
[04:56] doing there with her eyes leave it
[04:59] here yes
[05:01] so that was a really good example what
[05:03] you're asking a dog to do in this case
[05:05] is really tough you're asking them to
[05:07] take their eyes off of that thing they
[05:08] want and to pay attention to you instead
[05:10] that's counterintuitive to them i can't
[05:12] emphasize enough how much i'm really
[05:14] trying to find just my new reasons to
[05:16] reward veronica here yes
[05:18] it can be so easy to frustrate a dog at
[05:20] this really fragile point in their
[05:22] training if you ask them to do too much
[05:24] but lessons like this are some of the
[05:26] most impactful magical lessons you'll
[05:29] ever have with your dog by setting the
[05:31] tone from the very beginning that you
[05:33] veronica can think on your own and i'll
[05:35] be here to help you grow that reasoning
[05:37] process without undermining your
[05:39] intelligence or your trust in me see
[05:41] that the streets are completely out of
[05:43] sight as she's looking up at me right
[05:44] now just to really point out why we like
[05:47] positive reinforcement so much in the
[05:49] dog training world it really flips
[05:50] things rather than you having to correct
[05:52] for things you don't like in order to
[05:54] eventually get your dog to behave here
[05:56] you're going to see your dog going out
[05:57] of their way to offer good behavior
[06:00] that's been really heavily reinforced in
[06:02] the past so right here i'm not asking
[06:04] for a lie down i'm not asking for a look
[06:06] at me i'm not asking for a stay why is
[06:09] she giving it to me because she's been
[06:11] reinforced and as time goes on and they
[06:12] learn these things you don't have to
[06:14] reinforce quite as much yes
[06:16] didn't even have to ask for a look at me
[06:18] there see how she's looking at me as if
[06:20] to say okay wait a minute i think i'm
[06:22] starting to get it if i leave those
[06:24] treats alone
[06:25] and i look at you at the same time it
[06:27] works out in my favor yes
[06:29] do you see that do you see that quick
[06:31] snap right there it's almost like a
[06:33] light bulb went off
[06:35] see if she does it again she relaxed and
[06:37] she's like wait a minute
[06:41] yes
[06:43] well before i was just setting the piece
[06:44] of food in front of her now i'm tossing
[06:46] it a little bit so it has movement yes
[06:49] i can't emphasize enough that things
[06:51] that move like that
[06:53] are really enticing
[06:56] yes and there that's that's the biggest
[06:59] home run there on this exercise so you
[07:01] know a much more challenging exercise
[07:03] for a dog to do something like this let
[07:06] me let her know it's over
[07:08] and okay
[07:11] yes
[07:12] so great lesson on leave it and the
[07:14] leave it look at me combo we'll be using
[07:16] some variation of this training for
[07:18] years and years in the future for
[07:19] example when she becomes distracted by a
[07:22] squirrel or a dog in public and i ask
[07:24] for her attention on me this is the
[07:26] lesson that will have set the tone for
[07:28] that type of training keep in mind also
[07:30] i talk a lot about this in both of my
[07:31] books i'm going to have links below one
[07:33] area that is in absolute disarray in our
[07:37] training
[07:38] is create training
[07:40] she has what seems to be severe
[07:43] separation anxiety more than any puppy
[07:46] we've had in these series maybe ever and
[07:48] i've got to tell you at this point i
[07:50] don't know if she's the kind of dog that
[07:51] just isn't really a candidate for krait
[07:54] my hope is that we can counter condition
[07:56] her that is change her association with
[07:58] the crate and get her to stay in there
[08:01] voluntarily
[08:03] here
[08:06] offer her treats
[08:08] are you going to close the drink this i
[08:10] love i love that she'll go in there she
[08:12] doesn't hate the crate so much that she
[08:13] won't go in there and by design i mean
[08:16] we have been really trying to work with
[08:18] her on going into the crates we've been
[08:20] feeding her her meals in there we've
[08:22] been giving her her water in there in
[08:25] general as long as i'm here and i'm
[08:27] throwing him in there it looks like so
[08:29] far
[08:32] she's pretty
[08:33] accepting of it you can see she'll get
[08:35] her treat and very often
[08:37] she's likely to come right back out
[08:39] after she gets her treat if i close it
[08:44] you can see she looks up she notices
[08:46] that
[08:48] okay
[08:50] i'm preemptively telling her okay to
[08:51] exit the crate because eventually we're
[08:53] going to work on stay at the crate door
[08:55] here until i say it's okay just for
[08:57] safety and yes i love that for this
[09:00] training session for the most part all
[09:01] the treats are going to be inside the
[09:03] crate in other words if you want those
[09:05] that's where you got to go to get them
[09:06] and the logic here isn't just hey go
[09:08] follow a treat in there and bribe them
[09:10] the logic here is to have her associate
[09:13] being in the crate with something really
[09:16] good something that she likes something
[09:17] that she has a positive emotional
[09:19] response to i like how she didn't try to
[09:21] run out of the crate there when she saw
[09:22] it closing
[09:25] and here she sees the open door she
[09:26] comes walking out i'm not having to say
[09:28] no or close the crate in her face
[09:31] instead i'm just going to put that over
[09:32] there
[09:33] keep throwing those in there until she
[09:35] kind of inadvertently decides to stay
[09:37] she's thinking about it see i'm just
[09:39] waiting for it to go in and reason
[09:40] through
[09:41] hey that's where you're gonna get the
[09:42] treats for this particular lesson
[09:45] not out here because she's looking at me
[09:46] like hey this this works for me a lot
[09:49] i'm sitting
[09:50] and remember i'm using veronica's meal
[09:52] for a lot of this training that's a
[09:53] great way to train puppies since you can
[09:55] give them lots and lots of rewards but
[09:57] still keep them healthy
[09:58] see this is where the fun is over here
[10:01] and look at that look at this see how
[10:02] she's starting to look back towards the
[10:04] crate now rather than running out and
[10:06] saying no i'll never go in there again
[10:08] it's a really common thing when a dog
[10:10] doesn't love being in a crate yes
[10:14] yes
[10:18] yes that's what i'm looking for there
[10:20] for her not to come running out
[10:22] yes
[10:26] if i walk away i'm gonna walk all the
[10:28] way over here for a sec
[10:30] yes
[10:32] that's really good behavior
[10:35] because it's when you start to walk away
[10:37] or move away from her and she's
[10:39] in the crate simply having her stay in
[10:42] the crate is one thing but that's how
[10:43] alert she is she knows that we're
[10:45] engaged in a primary training session
[10:47] here that is one where we're really
[10:49] trying to accomplish a specific action
[10:52] it would be great if i could get her to
[10:54] relax and start chewing on a chew while
[10:56] in there so we're gonna let her gnaw on
[10:58] that for a little bit and i mean this is
[11:00] perfect this is what i'm looking for
[11:01] because sometimes you've got to find
[11:03] just the right chew for them or just the
[11:05] right thing that's why i like having a
[11:06] variety of different things dogs like
[11:08] people get in the mood for different
[11:10] things and the attempting even intuitive
[11:13] thing to do a lot of the times
[11:15] if your dog is stressing in the crate is
[11:16] to yell at them some people will bang
[11:18] the crate to try and scare them so that
[11:20] they don't continue to bark and i
[11:22] understand it can be frustrating when
[11:24] you're trying to sleep at night because
[11:25] ultimately this dog is going to end up
[11:27] sleeping with us for sure because we
[11:29] like having dogs in the bed however it's
[11:31] so important to us in these beginning
[11:34] stages that the dogs are comfortable
[11:36] being alone because they can't be with
[11:38] us all the time they're going to be
[11:39] times where we have to leave the house
[11:40] go out to dinner go run an errand or
[11:43] whatever so they have to be content i'm
[11:45] gonna continue to walk away too because
[11:47] distance is a major factor as well being
[11:51] farther away from her being out of sight
[11:52] those are the things that tend to
[11:54] trigger anxiety within veronica so i
[11:57] think really just
[12:00] going in and out of sight here she's
[12:02] looking at me but she's really into that
[12:04] so basically she has the experience of
[12:06] doing something that's really enjoyable
[12:09] enjoying her life being in the crate
[12:11] with me far away out of sight in this
[12:14] case over here now and
[12:17] not feeling that anxiety that she's been
[12:19] prone to feel see what i mean so this is
[12:22] one more way that we're trying to
[12:23] address the underlying
[12:25] emotional condition now i'm hoping that
[12:28] she'll just indefinitely chill out there
[12:30] and she'll rest if i could get a 10
[12:32] minute nap in there that would be cool
[12:34] ideally i would like to let her out
[12:36] before she starts stressing or if i do
[12:39] see some mild stress emerging i might
[12:42] see if it passes rather than just
[12:44] letting her out immediately because i
[12:45] also don't want a conditioner that
[12:47] anxious barking is what gets her out of
[12:49] the crate either so it's really this
[12:51] fine line that we have to walk like i
[12:54] don't want her stress to get so far that
[12:55] she starts hating the crate but so far
[12:58] this is definitely one of her more
[12:59] significant issues though we are just
[13:02] barely getting to know her right now it
[13:04] looks like she has finished the majority
[13:06] of that salmon shoe now this is a real
[13:08] delicate moment when she's run out of
[13:10] food is she going to bark as if to say
[13:13] okay i'm done let me out i've had enough
[13:16] time and i think that's where this is
[13:17] headed so do you yeah see man do i can i
[13:20] read a dog or can i read a dog so this
[13:23] is the point do i try to let her just
[13:25] chill do i give her something else that
[13:27] might pacify her like i don't want to
[13:29] just give her food all day because
[13:31] she'll get fat
[13:34] there's a couple of things here i'm
[13:36] gonna wait for periods of silence so i
[13:38] can acknowledge the quiet she doesn't
[13:40] like that i'm far away over here yes so
[13:42] the yes is for that moment of quiet
[13:44] before this barking gets going and i'm
[13:47] doing this to kind of buy time while i
[13:49] think about what i want to do here the
[13:51] other option is to quit while i'm ahead
[13:53] here and let her out so yeah since she
[13:56] did pretty well i think we'll let her
[13:57] out but let's see if we can let her out
[13:59] during a moment of
[14:01] let me get her leash ready
[14:09] okay
[14:10] good girl yeah you did so good
[14:13] so i mean that's an example right there
[14:15] i would have liked to have gotten more
[14:16] but at the same time i'm glad we got
[14:18] what we got and her stress level didn't
[14:20] appear to get so over the top that it
[14:24] would have
[14:25] worked against us do you know what i
[14:26] mean still work to do this is real world
[14:29] dog training so it's not like it's
[14:31] magically fixed in one lesson you know
[14:33] we've had one accident right one just
[14:36] one that's pretty amazing and there you
[14:38] go good girl in my personal opinion i
[14:41] think it's time for bree to supervise
[14:43] veronica overnight all right hey we're
[14:46] not gonna let you keep us up we're gonna
[14:47] get her nice and tired before bed
[14:49] playing some fetch with her oh you guys
[14:51] i really want to sleep tonight so i'm
[14:54] pulling out all the stops we're getting
[14:56] veronica's extra energy out with some
[14:58] fetch right before bed and i'm gonna
[15:00] give her her dinner in her crate so
[15:01] maybe she'll get that full belly sleepy
[15:03] feeling like when you eat a really big
[15:05] meal and then you just pass out i love
[15:07] using slow feeding bowls like this it
[15:09] really stretches out how long she enjoys
[15:11] her food especially while she's in the
[15:13] crate and i covered her crate with a
[15:14] blanket to maybe block out additional
[15:16] distractions too there we go good night
[15:20] okay guys that worked for a couple of
[15:22] hours but
[15:24] then veronica seemed pretty anxious so i
[15:28] did my best to wait for just a micro
[15:30] second of quiet but i let her out of her
[15:31] crate pretty much right away are you
[15:33] really sad it's gonna be okay
[15:36] we're good to see you in the morning and
[15:38] morning is not that far away now nice to
[15:40] see you
[15:42] you want to try to go potty really quick
[15:44] honestly if she's waking me up because
[15:46] she needs a bathroom break i am totally
[15:48] fine with that now the trick is getting
[15:50] her back to sleep though i'm hoping a
[15:52] new chewy treat will help her settle
[15:53] down
[15:54] guys it worked she slept the whole rest
[15:57] of the night i can hardly believe it i
[15:58] hope she didn't disappear veronica are
[16:00] you still in there yup she's in there
[16:02] she seems pretty excited to get out
[16:07] good too
[16:09] good morning angel
[16:13] hey funny girl
[16:15] i just want to give her a bunch of love
[16:16] because she did so well i know it's hard
[16:19] veronica when i was little i was scared
[16:21] to sleep alone too i understand all
[16:24] right i'm calling it overnight training
[16:26] complete yeah not likely but it was a
[16:28] pretty good start veronica seems like
[16:31] she's feeling really happy and confident
[16:33] this morning so i want to give her
[16:34] another chance to play with inertia
[16:36] hopefully things will go better this
[16:37] time than last time oh no
[16:40] oh no
[16:43] inertia what are we gonna do
[16:46] that's all right you can hang out with
[16:47] me until you're ready
[16:49] i know you're so good you're so close i
[16:51] can tell
[16:52] you just need a set to make sure that
[16:53] you're definitely feeling brave oh she
[16:55] brought you a toy does that help seems
[16:57] like inertia is ready to do whatever it
[16:59] takes to get veronica to play though
[17:01] she's even trying to share her favorite
[17:03] hammerhead shark toy wow maybe if you
[17:05] drop it right on top of her
[17:08] success it looks like inertia had the
[17:10] right idea sharing her toy veronica's
[17:12] getting much braver now yeah i get it
[17:14] inertia good job
[17:17] maybe a little too brave huh
[17:20] i've seen this before good girl in her
[17:22]  don't worry we'll teach her how to
[17:23] share well it looks like veronica is
[17:25] really coming out of her shell now in
[17:27] the next episode we'll tackle her
[17:29] barking at other dogs and whatever other
[17:31] crazy puppy habits she develops between

[00:00] in today's episode i'm going to attempt
[00:02] to show my wife how to train our dog how
[00:05] hard could this really be and we really
[00:07] have to get this puppy's barking and
[00:09] separation anxiety under control you
[00:11] know what the problem with the world is
[00:12] there's not enough really good dog food
[00:15] and i'm serious nom nom has taken it
[00:17] upon themselves to create home-cooked
[00:19] food that's optimized for your
[00:21] individual dog so that they can live the
[00:24] best life possible it's nutrient dense
[00:27] it's freshly made and it's the most
[00:29] ultra real dog food i've ever seen they
[00:32] ship the food right to your house frozen
[00:34] i'll usually take a couple of bags out
[00:36] and put them in the fridge to let them
[00:37] thaw overnight you never have to worry
[00:39] about over or underfeeding your dog
[00:41] because each meal is perfectly portioned
[00:44] for your individual dog try it out and
[00:46] see if your dog likes it of course
[00:47] they're going to but to make it extra
[00:49] easy to try non-mom's going to give you
[00:51] 50 off a two-week trial at my special
[00:54] link trinom.com
[00:55] zack i'll have that link in the
[00:57] description now let me see if i can
[00:58] teach my wife how to teach our dog do
[01:02] you think i should take her off leash
[01:03] yes for this training session i do yeah
[01:05] we have a controlled environment if we
[01:07] can't get her staying with us
[01:08] voluntarily during this lesson then
[01:10] we're doing something wrong like the
[01:11] lead shouldn't even matter for a lesson
[01:13] like this this is a clicker there's a
[01:15] button right there see that and look at
[01:17] this
[01:18] that's what it does this is a very neat
[01:22] effective way to get a dog listening to
[01:25] you uh rapidly i'm gonna give that to
[01:27] you because i'm gonna be tempted to do
[01:29] it you're gonna do all the training yeah
[01:31] i'm gonna try because this is my dog i
[01:33] mean for this lesson yeah you keep
[01:36] trying to claim this dog i mean i
[01:38] picked her i never found her we're one
[01:41] person now i guess because we're married
[01:42] so we can share her congratulations you
[01:44] have a
[01:45] maybe chihuahua mix her dna results are
[01:47] almost processing okay clicker training
[01:50] i'm so excited all that clicking sound
[01:52] is going to mean to veronica is good i
[01:55] like that you get something good so why
[01:57] can't we just say good dog or yes well
[02:00] we can but you might find especially if
[02:03] you're a beginner though you can be a
[02:04] seasoned pro and use these i use clicker
[02:06] training all the time that it really
[02:07] helps you improve your timing it puts
[02:09] you in a position like you're on a game
[02:11] show or something and you can be like oh
[02:13] that's it
[02:14] oops for clicker training it's probably
[02:16] a good idea to use something a little
[02:17] extra special and we're using some
[02:19] really good tasting treats can you wake
[02:21] up for treats
[02:22] maybe here
[02:26] yes and see that's what i've been doing
[02:28] and she's learned yes means hey
[02:31] i get a treat that artificial sound is
[02:34] extra attention getting and with a dog
[02:36] that's so new to learning how to
[02:38] communicate with a person it can be a
[02:40] very definitive way to say i'm talking
[02:42] to you right now to load the clicker all
[02:44] we have to do is click and follow it up
[02:47] with a tiny treat that tastes really
[02:49] good look like this ready
[02:52] she was surprised i maybe should have
[02:54] done it farther away yes
[02:55] good good note but i think she's okay
[02:57] just cause some dogs that can freak them
[02:59] out good girl right now we're not asking
[03:01] them to sit we're not asking for
[03:02] anything all we're trying to do
[03:05] is communicate to them that that click
[03:07] means they're getting a treat that's it
[03:10] nothing to it
[03:11] the natural impression if you're not
[03:12] familiar with clicker trading too is
[03:14] that you use it to signal your dog to do
[03:16] something when actually the click occurs
[03:19] as your dog performs a desired behavior
[03:21] yeah it doesn't signal them to
[03:23] yeah it doesn't signal them to do
[03:25] something it signals that they did
[03:28] something right and i see your instinct
[03:29] just kicked in because as she went down
[03:31] i saw you do a more purposeful click to
[03:33] mark the down which was excellent timing
[03:35] this is what's wonderful about clickers
[03:38] they can really help you pinpoint
[03:40] an exact moment in time if you will and
[03:43] your dog learns oh that made the clicker
[03:45] go off and it's
[03:46] really attention-getting
[03:49] yes she looked at me
[03:51] yeah she seems to be making the
[03:52] connection usually within like 10 or 15
[03:55] or 30 clicks they get it
[03:57] maybe 32 if you're a dachshund i now
[04:00] you're ready to start marking behavior
[04:02] you want to see repeated in the future
[04:04] we're already ready to do it look at me
[04:07] yes
[04:08] so you're saying look at me i've been
[04:10] saying here i like the shortness of here
[04:14] since i asked for it so much that's cool
[04:16] she can learn look at me she can learn
[04:17] here i don't think it'll be confusing
[04:19] veronica yes
[04:22] and her name i feel like her name means
[04:24] look at me too yeah exactly and i heard
[04:26] you sneak in a yes with the click too as
[04:28] if to say hey these kind of mean the
[04:30] same thing yes
[04:32] oops
[04:34] all right veronica
[04:37] yes
[04:38] you're good at this no i'm not it's
[04:41] natural to want to click and treat at
[04:43] the same exact time but having a delay
[04:45] between the click and the treat is
[04:47] probably more advantageous to you
[04:49] because your dog learns okay it might
[04:51] take a second but i know i did something
[04:53] to trigger the treat-giving sequence i
[04:56] think she's doing really well with look
[04:57] at me and puppies do roll over and if so
[04:59] that's my request you want to do roll
[05:01] over straight away can we just let's
[05:03] what's the clicker really a play dead is
[05:05] basically a half a roll over will you do
[05:07] that one can i trade with you
[05:09] you want me to do it yeah i think so i
[05:10] want to see the difference oh my
[05:12] goodness
[05:13] this treat was twice this big when i
[05:15] started she's so small i've been taking
[05:17] like a rum of it yeah that's right so
[05:19] and it works because it is true you do
[05:21] need to be conscious of extra calories
[05:23] with your dog you want to take it into
[05:25] account with their food you don't want
[05:26] them to have a diet based on treats
[05:29] either that's why you keep them special
[05:30] and small and good tasting i've been
[05:32] continuing to use some of my favorite
[05:34] training treats by pupford the reason i
[05:35] like them so much is because they're
[05:37] made from real freeze-dried meat and
[05:39] veggies so they're obviously really
[05:41] healthy and more importantly for our
[05:43] purposes dogs love them and you'll see
[05:45] how i continue to rely on puffer's
[05:46] amazing chews and rewards for dogs too
[05:49] so if you've got a puppy or really a dog
[05:51] of any age i think you're going to love
[05:53] puppets products i'll have a link below
[05:56] okay i'll take the sit
[05:58] it's interesting how she started to go
[06:00] into a down
[06:01] and then i clicked and she froze as if
[06:03] to say whoa i did something she couldn't
[06:05] be in a more awkward position to teach
[06:07] roll over to it's like her hips are one
[06:08] way but then her shoulders are another
[06:11] see i'm not like putting or luring all
[06:13] the way on her back
[06:15] i'm just going slow yes
[06:17] this is one version of play dead yes
[06:22] and in essence
[06:23] yes
[06:26] good job very good well done
[06:29] in essence i'm really also clicking for
[06:32] following allure lets you get a little
[06:35] nibble of this treat because i have the
[06:37] lure right at her nose and i kind of
[06:39] release a tiny bit as she
[06:42] continues to succeed
[06:46] see so i liked all the moments
[06:47] ultimately my favorite play dead is
[06:49] where they're flat on their back
[06:51] like that
[06:52] and see i'm not restraining her that's a
[06:54] really important point that'll that's
[06:56] the fastest way to freak a dog out with
[06:59] something like this good girl you're so
[07:00] smart i'm not gonna really focus on
[07:02] saying roll over or play dead right now
[07:04] i'm really just in these early lessons
[07:06] focused on getting her to go through the
[07:08] motion and see what i mean though but
[07:09] having the clicker like this it really
[07:12] teaches you
[07:13] that there's so many smaller moments
[07:15] that you can reward which can really
[07:19] get you to where you want to be faster
[07:21] silly i like that she's crawling there
[07:23] see even you can do spontaneous clicks
[07:25] as well anytime you like what your dog
[07:27] is doing so here i just happen to have
[07:29] her in this position where it's easy to
[07:31] get her to sneak up on it
[07:33] but that's not confusing
[07:35] i don't think it's confusing because
[07:36] really even though we're teaching
[07:37] rollover and play dead we're also having
[07:40] a first
[07:42] our first real luring training session
[07:44] with her as well so we're also kind of
[07:46] teaching her hey following the lure like
[07:48] this
[07:49] is going to give you access to the thing
[07:51] i'm luring with and this is how the hand
[07:53] signals tend to get introduced so like
[07:55] you know in the short term i would like
[07:56] my hand signal to be this rather than
[07:58] right at her mouth but right now i got
[08:00] to be right at her nose and encourage
[08:02] her to go
[08:04] good
[08:06] and so now you might also notice i'm
[08:09] clicking
[08:10] a little bit less because she's starting
[08:12] to get the picture so i don't have to be
[08:14] like click click click i can be like
[08:15] click
[08:17] click
[08:18] click the way that i have approached
[08:21] clicker training in the past is i will
[08:23] use it a lot during the first 6 to 12
[08:25] months of training dogs once
[08:27] communication between you and your dog
[08:28] starts to come into focus and they can
[08:30] really begin to differentiate when
[08:32] you're talking to them versus talking to
[08:34] another person i tend to phase it out
[08:36] but there's no rule saying that you have
[08:37] to phase it out at all in fact maybe
[08:39] it's even better not to i don't know yes
[08:42] much less effort that time
[08:44] let's see if we can teach her to exit
[08:46] from over here this position so good and
[08:51] okay good yeah
[08:52] all the way keep this on your wrist yeah
[08:55] use it i will training sessions like we
[08:57] just did are great but the real world
[08:59] happens all of the time and it's just as
[09:02] important to know what to do when the
[09:03] environment around you changes
[09:05] unexpectedly i'm out here playing some
[09:07] frisbee with the dog
[09:10] and hopefully dogs at some point we'll
[09:11] see if she likes it but we've got
[09:13] someone putting on a roof over here
[09:15] across the street and i mean
[09:17] construction sounds and banging and
[09:18] things like that that's a real common
[09:20] thing for dogs to get nervous about so
[09:23] we have that added benefit here of being
[09:26] able to desensitize veronica
[09:29] to these sounds if you want the best
[09:31] trained dog possible look for random
[09:33] opportunities to expose them to new
[09:34] things like this and see what you can do
[09:36] to get them acting normal and having fun
[09:39] specifically if you can get them playing
[09:40] their favorite game like fetch or
[09:42] whatever then that's a pretty good idea
[09:44] meanwhile brie has been doing a great
[09:46] job of getting out and giving veronica
[09:48] extra exposure to the world every single
[09:50] day too it's really amazing how many
[09:52] interesting things you can find right
[09:54] outside of your front door no matter
[09:55] where you are we were walking down the
[09:57] levee and i noticed veronica started to
[09:59] get a little nervous so i looked around
[10:02] and would you believe it it's okay
[10:04] good girl it's normal
[10:09] hello
[10:10] i don't know if she's ever seen an
[10:11] umbrella before
[10:14] good girl see that's normal he's
[10:16] friendly good job
[10:19] she barely had time to take in that
[10:21] umbrella and then a bike was coming past
[10:23] too look at that at least you did better
[10:25] with that one good for you you're being
[10:27] very brave you ready to keep going
[10:29] let's go come on we continue to get so
[10:32] many unexpected benefits every time we
[10:33] take a walk she experiences something
[10:35] new every time she goes outside plus
[10:38] there's the obvious benefit of getting
[10:40] some of that energy out too last night
[10:43] was rough
[10:47] zach has successfully had her in the
[10:49] crate overnight a couple of times and
[10:50] last night was my first night trying to
[10:53] be in charge of having her in the crate
[10:54] and i really wanted to do a good job man
[10:57] it was so hard it was so much harder
[10:58] than it seemed for zach
[11:01] [Music]
[11:03] i'm a very patient person and i know the
[11:05] night is only so long even if i wake up
[11:07] all the time
[11:09] the night will come to an end it doesn't
[11:11] feel like that when it's the middle of
[11:12] the night it just feels like never
[11:14] ending and how can this be happening and
[11:15] how are you still not going to sleep i
[11:17] really want to come up with her too and
[11:18] so i'm like man you just you want what i
[11:20] want we both want this i know i
[11:22] shouldn't take you out but i really want
[11:24] to i held strong and she did
[11:26] spend the whole night in her crate with
[11:28] the exception of a potty break i got
[11:30] like two and a half hours of sleep and
[11:32] so now i'm a little worried because i'm
[11:33] going into tonight now i'm tired
[11:35] i really love this puppy
[11:37] and
[11:38] she's clearly stressed out when she's
[11:40] crying like that and so i don't want to
[11:42] just make her be stressed i i want to
[11:44] make sure this is for a proactive
[11:46] purpose we've been testing her during
[11:48] the day and she's been good for long
[11:50] periods at a time several hours
[11:52] sometimes and zach has succeeded
[11:55] overnight almost flawlessly so i was
[11:57] like okay it's night three of her doing
[11:59] this you've had two fabulous nights he's
[12:02] like a miracle worker and apparently i
[12:05] don't know how to work miracles because
[12:06] it was really hard for me we have to
[12:07] weigh her diminishing stress over time
[12:10] like ideally you'd like no stress but
[12:12] since it's slowly phasing out i think
[12:14] we're on a pretty clear path to be
[12:16] successful at this and the reality is in
[12:18] our life they're going to be periods of
[12:20] time where she needs to be alone in a
[12:22] controlled environment like if we want
[12:23] to go to work if we want to go to dinner
[12:26] or hang out with our friends or whatever
[12:28] what am i going to do
[12:31] i guess i can help
[12:32] yeah do you want me to help you this may
[12:34] be a good example of where a dog is
[12:36] contextually
[12:37] figuring out how to behave around each
[12:39] individual person so maybe if she
[12:41] continues to think that you're likely to
[12:43] let her out as we have done liberally
[12:46] in the first many days both of us and
[12:48] then i've just been the first one so far
[12:50] really getting her to just chill i'm not
[12:52] sending the clearest message i think
[12:53] you're right well why don't i sleep
[12:55] downstairs tonight man the predator
[12:57] danger with this little dog is very real
[13:00] for eagles
[13:02] juvenile
[13:04] we have to stay aware of this when we're
[13:05] out in the real world man that's scary
[13:08] and something tells me as this series
[13:10] goes on that's going to continue to be a
[13:12] very real challenge that we have to deal
[13:14] with there's danger everywhere oh man
[13:18] so i have been tasked for the rest of
[13:21] the day with
[13:23] getting veronica comfortable with being
[13:24] in her crate or being in a controlled
[13:26] area i'll say that's really the most
[13:28] important thing sometimes though when i
[13:30] walk away that's when her anxiety has
[13:33] been arising but it's been getting a lot
[13:35] better let's see what happens here let
[13:37] me switch the camera
[13:39] and see this is what brie is talking
[13:41] about she gets really anxious so what
[13:43] i'm doing is i'm making sure that every
[13:45] time she barks like that i'm not going
[13:46] to advance towards her rather in moments
[13:49] when she's quiet
[13:50] i'm going to walk towards her we've been
[13:52] really trying to
[13:54] strike the right tempo with her
[13:58] but see the more that goes on
[14:02] the tougher it makes our job
[14:07] good
[14:09] and i'm only saying good because of the
[14:11] quiet there and since she's still being
[14:14] quiet i'm going to advance towards her
[14:16] i'm going to hang out over here for a
[14:17] second relax
[14:19] okay i was really hoping she'd settle
[14:20] down there but now she's sitting instead
[14:23] of barking at me that's an improvement
[14:27] my prediction is
[14:29] that's a good sign right there usually
[14:30] when she runs into the crate she's like
[14:32] ah there's stuff to do in here and she's
[14:34] been lying down just for the last day or
[14:36] so we'll see if this continues let's see
[14:38] so far hypothesis supported those
[14:41] outbursts kind of come in waves and
[14:42] she's like oh yeah i've got food over
[14:44] here and again we're gonna test
[14:47] she's just looked up at me
[14:53] all right so perhaps i should
[14:55] try and do something halfway not so far
[14:57] away
[14:59] good there she goes such a curious
[15:01] monkey so i'm just going to hang out i'm
[15:03] going to move the bed a little bit
[15:04] farther away and kind of find the sweet
[15:06] spot
[15:07] see what happens thanks for being a good
[15:09] girl
[15:11] this used to be you you know
[15:13] we know she most likely doesn't have to
[15:15] go to the bathroom she's had a lot of
[15:18] exercise she's getting her dinner right
[15:20] now well done good girl
[15:23] see so there's been a couple of waves
[15:25] and then she returns to being good i'm
[15:27] going to stand up and walk around
[15:30] right there as i stood up she started to
[15:32] have another wave and i sat down
[15:35] and she's like let me think better of
[15:36] that when she's being good i'll stand up
[15:39] and kind of walk towards her and my goal
[15:40] is kind of walk around in the same area
[15:42] here maybe see how that goes
[15:45] that way i'm not just walking straight
[15:47] away from her
[15:49] hey i'm testing just like you guys would
[15:51] have to i mean really what you're seeing
[15:53] here is me brainstorming on ways that i
[15:56] can encourage her to de-escalate on her
[15:58] own now this can be particularly tough
[16:00] to do when a dog is having an episode
[16:02] like this by the way i wrote two whole
[16:04] books on troubleshooting common training
[16:06] issues like this i'll have links in the
[16:08] description
[16:10] sweet girl hey good
[16:13] good girl that was really nice she liked
[16:15] the acknowledgement you're being a good
[16:17] girl since she's being calm i'm going to
[16:19] make this behavior really work for her
[16:21] and give her something that she's likely
[16:22] to value in other words frantic barking
[16:25] gets her nothing but quiet gets her
[16:27] something great so that kind of gives
[16:29] you a taste of what i guess brie is
[16:31] dealing with i think if we give a little
[16:32] bit of time here she's bound to just
[16:34] settle down and relax and
[16:36] adjust
[16:37] i think she's just a little amped up
[16:39] right now i've given her a bully stick
[16:41] to chew on it's not so much that you're
[16:43] just trying to distract them that you i
[16:45] guess you are to a degree but you're
[16:46] also teaching them how to do something
[16:49] they enjoy in their own space and that
[16:51] they can be independent they just don't
[16:53] know they're learning that yet they will
[16:55] find value in being alone as they get
[16:57] older hopefully what do you think
[17:00] you do really well when you're alone
[17:02] she just moved into her crate which is a
[17:04] really good sign and i've been noticing
[17:06] that that's her pattern that's when she
[17:08] starts to settle down for real at least
[17:11] as of recently but you know things
[17:13] change and puppy's behavior is always
[17:14] changing just because they establish a
[17:16] routine one day doesn't mean they'll
[17:17] keep it the next day necessarily so you
[17:19] look for those changes because they
[17:21] happen a lot with young dogs especially
[17:24] they're still learning how to exist in
[17:25] their own skin you know there's a fine
[17:27] line between ignoring them and trying to
[17:30] be compassionate and let them know that
[17:32] you're there and you're gonna take care
[17:34] of them this has been many minutes now
[17:36] of her relaxing and i'll expect her to
[17:39] probably
[17:40] get hyper in a second but hopefully not
[17:42] some during one of these waves she's
[17:44] actually gonna fall asleep my goal is
[17:47] literally to accumulate minutes with her
[17:49] being in an enclosed safe area without
[17:53] being overly stressed and actually be
[17:56] comfortable and i count sleeping minutes
[17:58] all right i have to go warm up the
[18:00] toaster oven
[18:04] okay oh it's already on good just making
[18:07] sure
[18:08] that's good though i was able to come
[18:09] over here
[18:10] able to be farther away i'm gonna walk
[18:12] around i really want veronica to be
[18:15] aware of me in the background moving
[18:16] about being closer and farther away from
[18:19] her while she's also being content
[18:21] simultaneously walking over here good
[18:24] job
[18:26] so i did a lap around the house she's
[18:28] still
[18:30] hanging out where are you sleeping
[18:31] tonight you sleeping down here with me
[18:33] or upstairs with mama
[18:35] inertia it's bedtime
[18:37] all right let go i gotta get the puppy
[18:39] to sleep
[18:41] thank you
[18:48] we're getting there slowly but surely
[18:50] outdoors like this don't go away all at
[18:52] once we're looking for her anxiety to
[18:54] get less and less over time and you can
[18:56] see she seems to be less frantic now
[18:58] than she has been in the past i'm
[19:00] getting the feeling that she might
[19:02] actually settle down for the night soon
[19:04] right well it's fully dark now
[19:09] she seems like she's pretty comfortable
[19:10] by herself in her sleeping area right
[19:12] now i'm gonna go upstairs
[19:14] she's nice and relaxed
[19:16] night gorgeous girl
[19:18] and the saga of veronica's separation
[19:19] anxiety is complete
[19:22] yeah just kidding we're going to have to
[19:23] show you a few more tricks from our
[19:25] playbook before we're through with this
[19:26] one and to try the best dog food i have

TRANSCRIPTION:

[00:00] my husband is a dog trainer still
[00:01] working on teaching my puppy veronica to
[00:03] like having her teeth brushed i wanted
[00:05] to show you how good our dog inertia is
[00:07] in the meantime so you can see what
[00:08] we're working towards come on come you
[00:10] know you know the drill now i'm not
[00:12] saying that our dog inertia loves having
[00:15] her teeth brushed but she is extremely
[00:17] tolerant even to this day with inertia i
[00:20] still go really slowly with her i don't
[00:22] want to force this upon her you really
[00:25] have to read your dog well when doing
[00:26] sensitive things like this whether it's
[00:28] clipping their nails or brushing their
[00:29] teeth also take note of how i'm not
[00:31] really restraining her i think so many
[00:33] of us wait until our dog is in the
[00:36] position of having to have their teeth
[00:37] brushed like we're on a schedule we need
[00:39] to get it done really quick here we go
[00:42] wow
[00:43] it's important to really set up these
[00:45] sessions in the way that we are with
[00:47] veronica right now super low-key and
[00:49] understanding good job

[00:05] youtube i would love some honest
[00:07] feedback from you guys i think this is
[00:09] probably

[00:13] realistic dog training videos that we
[00:15] have ever made and i've
[00:17] made a lot of dog training videos tell
[00:19] me what you think though training a
[00:21] totally untrained dog is one thing but
[00:23] trying to train them when your routine
[00:24] and environment are changing every
[00:26] single day does present a new set of
[00:28] challenges you know exactly like we're
[00:30] doing traveling across two nations on
[00:32] our way to alaska the most dynamic dog
[00:35] training series we've ever made today
[00:38] i'm going to show you how i train dogs
[00:39] to be obedient in the face of some of
[00:41] the deadliest animals in north america
[00:43] and ursa there's a moose over there
[00:45] which has become a very real concern
[00:46] with our new super mobile lifestyle
[00:49] and we continue to be reminded of how
[00:51] unpredictable things can really be okay
[00:54] we need to talk about something that
[00:56] happened while you were letting veronica

[00:00] training a totally untrained dog is one
[00:02] thing but trying to train them when your
[00:04] routine and environment are changing
[00:06] every single day does present a new set
[00:08] of challenges you know exactly like
[00:10] we're doing traveling across two nations
[00:12] on our way to alaska subscribe to see
[00:15] the most dynamic dog training series
[00:17] we've ever made today i'm going to show
[00:19] you how i train dogs to be obedient in
[00:21] the face of some of the deadliest
[00:22] animals in north america and ursa
[00:24] there's a moose over there which has

[00:28] super mobile lifestyle
[00:30] and we continue to be reminded of how
[00:32] unpredictable things can really be okay
[00:34] we need to talk about something that
[00:36] happened while you were letting veronica
[00:38] out veronica went from totally fine to
[00:40] this crazy foamy mouth in just like a
[00:43] second that is alarming the closest vet
[00:45] of any kind was 40 minutes away that is
[00:48] one of the risks of traveling like this
[00:50] too we're often very far away from
[00:51] medical care i have a bunch of vet
[00:53] friends in my pocket i can text and ask
[00:55] about this fuzzy is a telehealth service
[00:57] so that you can use the power of your
[00:59] iphone videos pictures and actually get
[01:01] someone on the line via text a medical
[01:04] professional like that i spend about 300
[01:08] less time panic googling doomsday
[01:10] scenarios about our dogs because i could
[01:12] just text fuzzy so samantha at fuzzy was
[01:14] awesome i shared the video with her she
[01:16] told me she thought veronica's stomach
[01:17] might have been upset or something i had
[01:19] no idea about she said the dogs
[01:21] sometimes get super drooly when they get
[01:23] a hit of a certain kind of pheromone
[01:25] what so then she gave me a bunch of
[01:27] advice thank you samantha you scared us
[01:30] so much so they've agreed to give
[01:32] everyone a seven day trial completely
[01:34] free of fuzzy to try out see if you like
[01:36] it see if it's as good as we're saying
[01:37] it is we'll have a link below your
[01:39] yourfuzzy.com to get that free trial we
[01:41] had just gotten settled in the rocky
[01:43] mountains and wouldn't you know it we
[01:45] were taking a walk down this forest road
[01:47] and we saw a huge moose these are the
[01:50] moments that as a dog trainer are
[01:52] particularly important to me i mean look
[01:54] i know that we're giving advice to so
[01:56] many people all around the world i have
[01:57] to make sure this advice in practice is
[02:00] working with my own dogs nature isn't
[02:02] always guaranteed to forgive you if your
[02:04] dog screws up i'm gonna give him his
[02:06] distance but i got my bear spray ready
[02:09] well you have to test them to make sure
[02:10] they work this is bear spray i'm telling
[02:12] you when you're out here in this part of
[02:14] the country we don't go anywhere without
[02:16] this stuff they're the most dangerous
[02:18] animal out here even though there's
[02:19] bears and other predators he's watching
[02:22] us yeah they'll stop you to death they
[02:24] will kill you they'll kill your dog if
[02:25] your dog charges them that's why we
[02:27] spend so much time focusing on the
[02:28] multitude of ways to train stay and come
[02:31] and in every conceivable context that we
[02:34] possibly can the nurse said there's a
[02:35] moose over there
[02:37] i don't know
[02:38] yeah she sees him that's amazing at our
[02:40] home in alaska we've seen moose in the
[02:42] past but like through the window or in
[02:45] the yard maybe all in a place where
[02:47] there was a layer of safety should
[02:49] things have gone south and inertia barks
[02:51] out of him yeah she likes to bargain a
[02:52] lot of moose-like animals for more
[02:54] long-time viewers who have seen how i've
[02:56] trained inertia around ungulates you'll
[02:59] know that it's been a process to get her
[03:00] to be obedient anytime she detects any
[03:03] type of large mammal when she was a
[03:04] puppy and i would take her to the french
[03:06] quarter in new orleans we would
[03:07] encounter mules and she would lose her
[03:09] mind because inertia is more naturally
[03:13] reactive to those things than some other
[03:14] dogs are fortunately she's doing really
[03:17] well and continues to impress us so
[03:18] here's what i'm thinking at this moment
[03:20] i'm like all right i put in the work
[03:21] with inertia i want to test my training
[03:24] at a safe distance so the mousse looks
[03:27] relatively stable as long as i don't get
[03:29] probably one inch closer you've gotten
[03:31] to know moose a little better now than
[03:32] you used to know them i wonder if i
[03:34] could train a moose inertia
[03:36] come
[03:37] good girl so that's the first instance
[03:39] of me being able to call inertia off of
[03:42] a moose without a wall between us i've
[03:44] done training like this in our alaska
[03:46] house where she would see one out the
[03:47] window and i was able to call her moose
[03:49] in our backyard
[03:50] but here you know she definitely was
[03:52] perked up and focused on the moose now
[03:54] it's able to say
[03:59] job inaudible that was really good i
[04:01] just picked veronica up because we are
[04:03] not there yet she's still so young i
[04:05] can't expect her to have this kind of
[04:07] impulse control right now and when we're
[04:08] encountering a wild animal and we're
[04:10] with our dogs our attitude is pretty
[04:12] much to de-escalate or get away we don't
[04:16] want our dogs barking at animals yeah
[04:18] dogs have a way of escalating the
[04:20] situation when they see a wild animal
[04:22] and that's usually not what you want i
[04:23] hate to say this to you guys but there's
[04:25] no way to train your dog how to
[04:27] magically not be intrigued by wild
[04:30] animals all at once i'm going to show
[04:32] you how we go about training veronica to
[04:35] be obedient around wild animals yeah
[04:38] that's the cool thing about this series
[04:39] is we can just literally show you like
[04:42] in real life as we do it what do you
[04:44] guys think are you guys enjoying the
[04:45] real-time training where we're literally
[04:47] showing you multiple examples in real
[04:49] life as they occur one area of
[04:51] improvement for veronica that she
[04:53] desperately needs is stay i mean she's
[04:55] really good at stay when i say sit
[05:00] and i even move around a little bit
[05:04] okay
[05:05] and i release her from the stage she's
[05:06] doing really good with that but really
[05:08] that's only one type of state
[05:09] traditionally we dog trainers think of
[05:11] stay in three broad categories stay for
[05:14] a period of time stay with distance
[05:16] that's when we're farther away from our
[05:18] dog and stay while distracted which is
[05:21] when they stay when something is moving
[05:22] or exciting them and they summon the
[05:24] self-discipline to hold that position
[05:27] of course veronica has a long way to go
[05:29] with her self-discipline
[05:31] see right there she's distracted by
[05:32] something
[05:34] very alert this isn't just a yappy bark
[05:36] this is a dog who's
[05:38] sees something the wind blowing i'm not
[05:40] sure yes
[05:41] i'm going to go ahead and acknowledge
[05:42] the fact that she came back to me there
[05:44] i'm letting her bark intentionally here
[05:46] to satisfy her curiosity given where we
[05:48] are right now also it could be a bear
[05:51] it's so tempting to discipline barking
[05:53] but keep in mind
[05:55] dogs need to bark yes
[05:57] it's a it's a natural expression for
[05:59] them granted we don't want them doing it
[06:01] all the time but to expect the dog to be
[06:02] quiet all the time is just
[06:04] it's not ethical but the real question
[06:06] for me is can i get her under control
[06:08] after a brief barking outburst and then
[06:10] hopefully we can minimize unwanted
[06:11] barking over time that's because if
[06:13] you're trying to resolve a behavior you
[06:15] want to understand why they're barking i
[06:17] think a lot of people will look at that
[06:18] and say zach you're just letting her
[06:19] bark you're not addressing it at all i'm
[06:21] doubling down on this idea that it's
[06:24] important for her to be able to express
[06:25] emotions she's having within reason
[06:28] allow her to adapt for a second and then
[06:30] try to communicate with her once her
[06:32] state of excitement is a little bit
[06:33] lower and in the spirit of positive
[06:35] reinforcement training my emphasis is on
[06:37] letting her know what i do like instead
[06:39] of what i don't like it is shocking how
[06:41] much progress you can make with that
[06:43] strategy and we really continue
[06:45] negotiating this barking issue while
[06:48] trying to train other things like stay
[06:50] in this case i think the problem that
[06:52] most of us have with stay is when our
[06:54] dog wants to go after something you can
[06:56] say stay all day long but if i say stay
[06:58] and i throw that
[07:00] i mean you see how she just went after
[07:02] it she needs to know to hold stay when
[07:04] she's distracted that could have just as
[07:06] easily been a sprinting moose out of the
[07:08] forest or a bear while we're taking a
[07:11] walk or a pronghorn wow look they hopped
[07:14] they did the thing here
[07:16] good
[07:21] yes
[07:25] see how she wants to come towards me
[07:27] when i put her in that stay just asking
[07:29] her to sit in this context is asking her
[07:31] to stay but also use the word stay
[07:33] because it certainly can't hurt so sit
[07:34] means stay and stay means stay right why
[07:37] even teach stay often when i'm teaching
[07:39] more nuanced behaviors it's a really
[07:42] good thing to be able to pause your dog
[07:44] right there like say you're teaching bow
[07:46] and you want to be able to be like stay
[07:47] right there stay means freeze sip means
[07:50] hold that position until you're released
[07:52] so this down are your pencils on fire
[07:54] sit
[07:56] yes
[07:58] it's called stay
[08:00] i'm trying to be able to
[08:02] back away a sec come here give her a
[08:04] reward
[08:06] yes
[08:11] the goal is to have her hold that sit
[08:12] position which she's not quite doing the
[08:15] thing about veronica though is she tends
[08:16] to close that distance by breaking state
[08:19] coming up a few inches and then sitting
[08:21] so i really think i need to make this
[08:22] easier for her by promptly acknowledging
[08:25] successful stays more quickly yes now
[08:28] stay with me and you're going to see
[08:30] this evolve quickly
[08:31] yes i know it looks like i'm using a lot
[08:33] of treats here keep in mind these are
[08:35] tiny treats but they're very high
[08:36] quality see how i'm building the
[08:38] distance and promptly rewarding i'm not
[08:40] combining distance with a period of time
[08:43] right now she is just going nuts over
[08:44] the ground sense really making our
[08:46] training extra challenging yes
[08:50] yes
[08:54] yes
[08:56] and i love how we're not having to
[08:57] intervene and say no no when she's not
[09:00] doing the right thing if your dog isn't
[09:01] doing the thing you want break it down
[09:03] smaller catch them succeeding and when
[09:05] you get that tiny bit of traction that's
[09:08] all you need and this is why positive
[09:10] reinforcement is so powerful you don't
[09:11] wait for them to fail it's predictable
[09:13] she's going to fail so i don't want to
[09:14] correct her when she fails i want to
[09:17] celebrate her when she's succeeding
[09:20] good
[09:21] okay instead of having to do this fast
[09:23] dancing with her i really need to try to
[09:25] teach her how to slow dance now
[09:31] yes
[09:32] see how i'm slowing down the rate at
[09:34] which i'm rewarding now
[09:39] yes
[09:45] okay
[09:47] yes and i'm gonna reward her on that so
[09:50] a little bit better that time you saw
[09:52] how we went from yes yes yes to
[09:55] yes
[09:57] yes
[09:59] yes and so you can see where this is
[10:01] trending right i think a lot of people
[10:03] will see that is too many treats right
[10:05] there that is not realistic for everyday
[10:07] people there's a path forward to not
[10:09] being reliant on treats and as
[10:10] counter-intuitive as it is the trick is
[10:12] to use more treats especially in the
[10:14] beginning of training something new yeah
[10:16] the fastest way to get to using less
[10:18] treats
[10:19] is to use more treats it's no different
[10:21] than when you're a kid and your teacher
[10:22] gives you candy or whatever their
[10:24] reinforcement was you don't require
[10:26] candy to solve two plus two anymore you
[10:29] learn how to do the thing without the
[10:30] reward but in the beginning it's very
[10:32] helpful for new tasks i like to use a
[10:34] really top-notch high-quality treat
[10:37] we've been using pupford as a substitute
[10:39] for real meat all the time on this trip
[10:41] for obvious reasons it's not really a
[10:43] subsidy it is real meat that's true but
[10:45] it's freeze-dried and so you can put it
[10:47] in your pocket without being nasty
[10:50] getting caught without treats is the
[10:52] easiest mistake to make as a new trainer
[10:54] or even an experienced one literally my
[10:57] morning routine at this point is i wake
[10:59] up i grab a handful of freeze-dried
[11:00] chicken and i shove them in the pocket
[11:02] of my jeans the most effective known way
[11:06] to teach another animal is through
[11:08] reinforcement so by giving them a treat
[11:11] that they really like you're sealing in
[11:13] that behavior more and more and the
[11:15] great thing about pupferd is they have
[11:16] so many different types of super high
[11:19] quality treats we'll have a link in the
[11:20] description where you can check out
[11:22] pupford's awesome treats sit yes
[11:28] oh we got a dog
[11:32] this is the thing about training in the
[11:34] real world things like that are going to
[11:36] happen you're going to see off-leash
[11:37] dogs we saw an off-leash moose earlier
[11:39] today and we're asking for it right
[11:41] we're out here in public we're trying to
[11:42] experience the world and all of those
[11:44] random things that the world has but
[11:46] there is such little room for error and
[11:49] with our being a small dog there's even
[11:51] less room for error being alert at all
[11:53] times is really important when you're
[11:55] training a dog she seems to understand
[11:57] stay in a limited capacity unless
[11:59] something exciting happens i don't know
[12:00] about you guys but that's when i want my
[12:02] dog to stay the most she's demonstrated
[12:05] that she wants to chase a moving stick
[12:07] or a rock or whatever it is my objective
[12:09] is to keep her from doing that and then
[12:11] hopefully once she understands that i
[12:13] can build on that for her to start
[12:14] generalizing stay when a number of
[12:17] moving or exciting things happen around
[12:19] her in other words we're trying to teach
[12:21] her more mature impulse control so i'm
[12:23] gonna zoom in on the action here and go
[12:26] in slow motion
[12:28] right so here yes
[12:30] at this point honestly i don't care if
[12:31] it's a down stay a sit stay or a stand
[12:33] stay i just don't want her going after
[12:35] this
[12:37] yes
[12:39] by making these movements more subtle
[12:41] and slowing them down and allowing her
[12:43] time to process what i'm asking veronica
[12:46] is more likely to succeed than if i were
[12:48] to throw the sticks several feet away
[12:50] really fast several times in a row if
[12:52] your dog is failing that's because
[12:54] you're asking too much of them and they
[12:56] haven't been appropriately set up for
[12:57] the thing you're asking them to do full
[12:59] stop we have to take accountability
[13:01] yes
[13:02] i am gonna start to teach her the word
[13:04] stay stay
[13:06] yes when she's innocent or when she's in
[13:09] a down it's implied that she needs to
[13:10] hold that position and stay however i'll
[13:13] still use the word stay in combination
[13:15] with these behaviors sometimes as well
[13:17] let's try a rock that's significant
[13:19] because it's a completely different
[13:20] object this time it's not a stick yes
[13:23] and she knows that and she's doing great
[13:25] good girl
[13:27] typically the risk of failure is going
[13:28] to be higher when a variable like this
[13:30] is changed which is why i want to get
[13:32] her used to staying in a variety of
[13:34] different contexts sometimes a stick
[13:36] flies past her sometimes a rock drops
[13:38] from the sky and sometimes a dog runs
[13:41] down the road ultimately in the future
[13:42] i'm going to expect her to stay in all
[13:45] of these circumstances as she develops
[13:47] these skills okay come on good girl
[13:50] you're probably noticing how i'm doing
[13:51] something a little different by training
[13:53] her to stay for that distraction i'm
[13:55] really close to her dogs are much more
[13:57] likely to listen to us the closer we are
[13:59] to them so when introducing a really
[14:01] tough concept for a dog like stay when
[14:03] you want to go being close to them is
[14:05] likely to help before when i would
[14:07] suddenly surprise her and throw a stick
[14:09] she instantly broke her stay but let's
[14:11] see if i can duplicate that same action
[14:13] but have her stay this time veronica
[14:15] here stay
[14:17] yes
[14:20] and so there i'm trying to surprise her
[14:22] a bit more and not give her as much
[14:24] notice you see that i just want to point
[14:25] out how we haven't had to use any type
[14:27] of physical correction at any point
[14:29] during any of this training stay
[14:32] yes
[14:34] so now look what we're doing we're
[14:35] adding the distraction while i'm moving
[14:37] a little farther away so we're combining
[14:40] both elements distance and distraction
[14:42] in one lesson that's some fancy schmancy
[14:45] dog training right there stay
[14:48] yes
[14:52] stay
[14:54] here
[14:56] come sit
[14:59] yes
[15:00] so right there i stole a couple of extra
[15:02] skills to give her a treat and that's
[15:04] what i like to do when they start to get
[15:05] it okay i'm so proud of her staying for
[15:08] rocks and sticks is good and it's a step
[15:10] in the right direction but we need our
[15:11] dogs to do even better i think in a
[15:13] future episode we're going to cover how
[15:14] we take that to the next level yeah we
[15:16] need to do that like now okay we'll do
[15:18] it next video okay but there's still
[15:19] more to do in this video i know we can't
[15:21] build roman today there's still a lot of
[15:23] work to do but we still need to get
[15:24] around and see what's around here i just
[15:26] can't imagine that we're going to run
[15:27] into any more wildlife at all
[15:30] look at that
[15:32] these two are working together
[15:34] i started recording once i saw this so
[15:36] you can see when veronica just sees
[15:39] someone she just starts barking everyone
[15:41] she's like it's someone hey guys it's
[15:43] someone look someone hello someone
[15:46] but brie is getting so good at just
[15:48] snapping into training mode getting our
[15:49] attention on her continuing to do that
[15:51] consistently yeah the pocket treats make
[15:53] all the difference yeah one treat in
[15:55] your pocket i don't know if we've done a
[15:56] thumbs up for bree in a while you really
[15:58] need one she's been killing it with
[15:59] veronica hasn't she you don't have to
[16:01] this place is crazy veronica you are
[16:04] seeing so much right now i hope you
[16:06] appreciate it inertia loves sniffing
[16:09] she's getting so many smells this is her
[16:11] favorite thing in life all right it's
[16:12] veronica's first rushing river what do
[16:14] you think veronica has been very noise
[16:17] sensitive and we're taking a walk in
[16:19] this neighborhood really tiny town in
[16:20] colorado in the rocky mountains i think
[16:23] this feeds the colorado river actually
[16:25] veronica's seeing new things left and
[16:26] right and she definitely thinks this
[16:28] bridge is a little sus there you go you
[16:30] guys gave her confidence she's not used
[16:32] to it either actually
[16:33] she's more nervous than veronica they
[16:35] should be this is dangerous
[16:40] dry land
[16:42] good job you want to go see what you
[16:44] conquered oh now she's happy because she
[16:46] did it hey we can't do zoomies here
[16:49] veronica be good
[16:51] yeah she's working on it and our
[16:52] adventure has led us to this location
[16:55] lake granby we're in the rocky mountains
[16:58] i think there's like an incredible
[16:59] drought in the region nonetheless
[17:01] veronica's getting a kick out of it
[17:03] inertia is loving the smells
[17:06] you can just see she's in heaven right
[17:08] now i bet this smells really unique
[17:10] because it was recently covered in water
[17:12] veronica this is her first time on sand
[17:14] so she's getting to know that new
[17:15] texture see if she'll go in the water
[17:19] what do you think
[17:22] seems like she likes the water
[17:24] she got muddy so fast oh no
[17:28] you're getting an uber home good job
[17:30] veronica
[17:31] rocky mountain water going to a dynamic
[17:33] environment like this is yet another
[17:35] opportunity to show our dogs how varied
[17:38] and diverse their world is experiencing
[17:40] new places is a huge part of
[17:42] successfully training dogs there's a
[17:44] large body of water lots of different
[17:47] rocks of varying textures and
[17:48] composition sand to experience and feel
[17:51] and run in
[17:53] relax veronica a variety of plants and
[17:56] zillions of other scents that you and i
[17:59] can't even detect i know you do try
[18:01] especially with those rocks though look
[18:03] at this one yeah it looks so interesting
[18:06] yeah very oh look it's so brittle break
[18:08] it oh you broke it there you go isn't
[18:09] that beautiful
[18:11] it's just ancient sand or something no
[18:13] it tastes like ancient sand yeah i
[18:15] thought it might be salty it hasn't seen
[18:17] the light of day in millions of years i
[18:18] know now it does she's like why are we
[18:20] tasting these rocks what do you think
[18:22] does it taste ancient heads up if we
[18:24] have any geologists or people who are
[18:26] really interested in rocks i'm probably
[18:28] gonna have a lot of questions moving
[18:29] forward you can email him
[18:31] and i found these awesome plants and
[18:34] they're so cool and i really want to
[18:35] take veronica's picture and she will not
[18:37] stay even with the treat sit of course
[18:39] you're perfect now
[18:41] oh my gosh it's beautiful this was a
[18:42] really productive outing and it was time
[18:44] to go back and rest and you would like
[18:46] to think that that meant oh okay i'm
[18:48] done dog training not with our guys
[18:51] inertia has seen a tea kettle for the
[18:53] first time i think it's okay that's
[18:55] normal
[18:56] veronica it's in the kitchen silly dog
[18:59] i know that's annoying
[19:01] i thought it tells us that it's done
[19:03] good girl
[19:04] good job veronica that was so good
[19:08] okay veronica sweetheart
[19:10] good yes i like that you looked at me
[19:12] that time
[19:16] quiet yes
[19:18] that's right quiet she's definitely
[19:20] starting to know what quiet and relax
[19:22] means
[19:25] or not
[19:30] and as we've talked about many times
[19:31] with veronica barking is natural for
[19:33] dogs in many if not most cases when dogs
[19:36] bark they're expressing a very real
[19:38] emotion and learning to understand that
[19:40] emotion rather than just label it as oh
[19:42] i don't want to hear that because it
[19:43] doesn't make sense to me it's helpful
[19:45] ultimately long term we want our dogs to
[19:47] be able to vocalize and express emotions
[19:49] we just want them to do it in a way that
[19:51] is less offensive to us people i guess
[19:53] in the same way that kids scream and cry
[19:55] a lot of the time it's because they
[19:56] don't know how to talk or express their
[19:58] emotions yet
[20:00] okay
[20:01] yes
[20:03] girl looking at me and behaving nicely
[20:06] will get you stuff
[20:08] veronica
[20:11] here yes but really her barking is
[20:14] starting to become more reserved it is
[20:15] starting to become quieter in many more
[20:17] instances
[20:18] relax very good nice
[20:22] and relaxed doesn't just mean lie down
[20:23] for three seconds it means chill out yes
[20:26] [Music]
[20:27] good girl
[20:28] there you go
[20:30] and repeat as necessary sometimes when i
[20:33] do this she like barks as soon as she
[20:34] gets her treat i know and i feel like
[20:36] she's starting to get well then you
[20:38] don't just stop there i think you got to
[20:39] now follow up every 30 seconds or 10
[20:41] seconds or two seconds or five minutes
[20:43] depending on where you are in the
[20:44] training depending on that particular
[20:47] context context how riled up is a dog in
[20:49] that moment are they easier to work with
[20:51] or are they really over threshold you
[20:53] know you gotta like weigh all of those
[20:55] variables in every individual situation
[20:57] with every individual dog
[20:59] yep and i've been trying to do that but
[21:00] you're definitely making faster progress
[21:02] although okay whoops
[21:04] veronica hey can you relax notice her
[21:07] processing my request then looking out
[21:10] of the window maybe thinking about
[21:12] barking and then looking back at me and
[21:14] ultimately relaxing as requested yay and
[21:18] show them what how you look when you say
[21:20] relax i've been filming her in case she
[21:21] does it because i don't want to so i try
[21:22] not to let her see a tree you know
[21:24] because i don't want it to have to be
[21:26] contingent upon getting a treat for her
[21:28] to do the thing so relax with a hand
[21:30] signal yeah relax that's how i do it i
[21:32] mean you know you could do relax if you
[21:34] wanted you could do relax it doesn't
[21:36] really matter what you do but
[21:39] there we go good and see this is a more
[21:41] proper relaxed you can see your position
[21:43] here how she's curled up she's not in
[21:45] that like sphinx down or looking for
[21:47] another treat seems like she's starting
[21:49] to understand the concept these are what
[21:51] i'm most proud of with these videos is
[21:53] we are really capturing the transitional
[21:55] behaviors leading up to the completed
[21:57] behavior i love a good settle scene it's
[21:59] so satisfying yeah cause that is a hard
[22:01] thing to capture on video yeah you can't
[22:03] just like show how to train an organic
[22:05] settle in like a setup training lesson
[22:07] you really have to capture it in the
[22:09] moment yeah as it happens for real
[22:11] that's normal
[22:13] i know he's right there it's normal look
[22:14] he's really tougher yes
[22:16] veronica
[22:18] okay bree is trying to preempt a serious
[22:20] barking outburst
[22:25] yes good girl i like that she's not
[22:27] barking right i think it's fantastic
[22:29] she's like barely listening to me but
[22:31] she's not barking
[22:32] yes quiet good i don't mind if you watch
[22:36] if you're quiet oh you do you want to
[22:38] relax look at that she just offered it
[22:40] yeah
[22:41] good girl
[22:43] that's relax that's so good just because
[22:47] you leave home to live in a tiny trailer
[22:50] does not mean that the landscape people
[22:52] don't still come by and do their thing
[22:54] we just had a new exposure here with her
[22:56] seeing
[22:57] these hard-working people in the
[22:58] background doing their thing and
[23:01] using shovels and cutting branches yeah
[23:04] you can see in how we're in this like
[23:06] battle in air quotes
[23:08] of she'll do it for a second but you
[23:10] need it longer than a second it is
[23:12] getting easier by the day to quell these
[23:14] outbursts one of the things that's key
[23:15] to this is regular exercise pretty much
[23:18] daily she's got some energy in being
[23:19] able to harness that energy and get it
[23:21] to expel from her in a very specific way
[23:25] on our schedule is important for me i
[23:28] like when she expels it by running
[23:30] instead of barking you can pick the way
[23:32] that you want the energy to come out it
[23:34] can come out in the form of excessive
[23:36] barking or digging
[23:38] chewing up your house crazy leash
[23:40] pulling or you can prioritize teaching a
[23:43] polished game of fetch one area that she
[23:46] has to improve on is bringing it
[23:48] directly back to us yes she does so we
[23:51] found this fenced area here and we're
[23:53] letting the dogs get some exercise 70
[23:56] degrees hey it's 90 in new orleans right
[23:58] now by the way i really like to take
[24:00] advantage of cool weather where we can
[24:02] and we knew that the rocky mountains
[24:04] were cooler than new orleans right now
[24:06] by a lot
[24:08] yes
[24:12] what one big air that was so good
[24:20] veronica the frisbee dog good she's
[24:23] doing so well
[24:25] you're so good ready could not agree
[24:27] more she's continuing to excel with her
[24:29] fetch so exercise like this definitely
[24:31] makes training easier going forward if
[24:33] you're looking for a shortcut this is
[24:34] the closest thing i know of yes i don't
[24:37] think we've said it enough treats in
[24:39] your pocket and exercise guys
[24:42] hey looks good
[24:44] yeah thanks for cooking
[24:46] my pleasure i enjoyed it we're in the
[24:48] rocky mountains right now staying at
[24:50] this campground i'm watching the moon go
[24:52] up and i'm like why is there a chunk out
[24:55] of the moon it's a lunar eclipse i've
[24:58] never accidentally looked at an eclipse
[24:59] before to my knowledge it's called a
[25:01] super blood moon eclipse yeah well
[25:04] relating it to dog training when dogs
[25:06] see something new they're like i've
[25:07] never seen that before that's unusual
[25:09] cutting what it's like seeing a super
[25:11] blood moon eclipse i guess what's that
[25:13] that's weird that's what training is
[25:14] about teaching our dogs to understand
[25:16] things that they don't understand here
[25:17] it looks like a big red planet in the
[25:20] sky
[25:22] that's neat this unusual rare super
[25:25] blood moon eclipse is probably an omen
[25:27] for things to come because this dog
[25:28] training series is not business as usual
[25:31] by any stretch we're in colorado we've
[25:34] made it to the rocky mountains and we've
[25:35] seen that these mountains are full of
[25:36] moose and chock full of other wildlife
[25:39] unpredictable weather nothing about this
[25:41] part of the country is predictable we've
[25:43] just had to make an emergency stop you
[25:45] need to be honest about veronica's potty
[25:47] training it's going so great veronica
[25:49] peed on my bed last night oh man i want

[00:00] I'm a dog trainer I want to show you
[00:01] what I do when a dog has a barking
[00:04] Outburst during the middle of a training
[00:06] session
[00:08] Veronica has a long way to go with her
[00:10] self-discipline
[00:11] see right there she's distracted by
[00:13] something
[00:15] very alert this isn't just a yappy bark
[00:17] this is a dog who's
[00:19] sees something the wind blowing I'm not
[00:21] sure yes I'm going to go ahead and
[00:23] acknowledge the fact that she came back
[00:24] to me there I'm letting her bark
[00:26] intentionally here to satisfy her
[00:28] curiosity given where we are right now
[00:30] also it could be a bear it's so tempting
[00:32] to discipline barking but keep in mind
[00:35] dogs need to bark yes it's a it's a
[00:38] natural expression for them granted we
[00:40] don't want them doing it all the time
[00:41] but to expect the dog to be quiet all
[00:43] the time is just it's not ethical but
[00:46] the real question for me is can I get
[00:47] her under control after a brief barking
[00:50] outburst and then hopefully we can
[00:51] minimize unwanted barking over time
[00:53] that's because if you're trying to
[00:54] resolve a behavior you want to
[00:56] understand why they're barking

[00:00] if your dog won't stay there's a good
[00:01] chance you're missing one critical thing
[00:04] if your dog isn't doing the thing you
[00:06] want break it down smaller catch them
[00:08] succeeding and when you get that tiny
[00:10] bit of traction that's all you need
[00:11] traditionally we dog trainers think of
[00:13] stay in three broad categories stay for
[00:16] a period of time stay with distance
[00:18] that's when we're farther away from our
[00:20] dog and stay while distracted which is
[00:23] when they stay when something is moving
[00:24] or exciting them and they summon the
[00:26] self-discipline to hold that position i
[00:28] think the problem that most of us have
[00:29] with stay is when our dog wants to go
[00:32] after something if i say stay
[00:34] and i throw that
[00:36] i mean you see how she just went after
[00:38] it she needs to know to hold stay when
[00:40] she's distracted that could have just as
[00:42] easily been a sprinting moose out of the
[00:44] forest or a bear while we're taking a
[00:46] walk or a pronghorn wow look they hopped
[00:49] i'll show you how i continue to work on
[00:51] this with veronica follow us here on
[00:52] tick tock and everywhere

[00:00] lately i've noticed a lot of pushback
[00:02] when it comes to my advice on preventing
[00:05] a problem or unwanted barking so the
[00:07] advice basically goes if you have a dog
[00:09] who's barking and barking
[00:11] to find a minuscule minute fraction of a
[00:14] moment of quiet to acknowledge yes i
[00:16] like that quiet and follow it up with
[00:18] the reward the criticism is that zach
[00:21] the dog isn't going to realize that
[00:22] you're rewarding them for being quiet
[00:23] the dog is going to think oh barking is
[00:26] what made them get the reward this is
[00:27] how nuanced dog training can be if you
[00:30] can get in there for that micro second
[00:31] and say yes
[00:33] yes now you've prolonged that period of
[00:36] silence your dog very quickly comes to
[00:38] realize it's not the barking that's
[00:40] getting me the reward it's when i'm
[00:41] quiet when you're committed to training
[00:44] your dog in the positive reinforcement
[00:45] quadrant of training you have to find
[00:48] little ways like this to communicate to
[00:50] them what you do like and you would be
[00:52] shocked at how effective this can be
[00:54] without any unwanted side effects to
[00:56] your dog for more advice like this

[00:01] [Music]
[00:03] what kind of things you do with your dog
[00:05] on a daily basis let's take her
[00:06] temperature and see how motivated she is
[00:09] to play
[00:10] get it
[00:11] show me come on
[00:13] good all right
[00:16] we
[00:18] we keep going keep going keep going okay
[00:21] to keep them trained to keep them
[00:23] exercised and to just keep them happy
[00:25] tell me in the comments below because
[00:27] we're always looking for ideas usually
[00:28] during sessions like this i mostly focus
[00:31] on playing frisbee but i like to throw
[00:32] in a few tricks and obedience just to
[00:34] keep her extra sharp while she's in that
[00:36] ambitious mindset i make sure down stays
[00:38] are reliable probably more than anything
[00:41] i like a down stay because even if your
[00:43] dog is going to break you have a little
[00:45] bit more notice when they're in a down
[00:46] versus a stand or a sit when i see an
[00:48] off-leash dog in the area i'll practice
[00:50] down and stay just to make sure that at
[00:52] least my dog is stable this is her
[00:54] preferred brake position
[00:56] frog legs as we call it in the industry

[00:00] that is my biggest fear of this rv trip
[00:03] that she'll run out of that door it
[00:04] changes where it leads to every day but
[00:06] it's always somewhere dangerous let me
[00:08] give you an idea of what we're working
[00:09] towards our dog inertia has been in
[00:11] training now stay
[00:12] for a long time and i want to be able to
[00:14] have that wide open door
[00:17] with lots of exciting things going on
[00:21] and have her hold that stay right so
[00:22] throwing sticks she loves those
[00:25] sometimes your dog hears the call of the
[00:27] wild when you're out here in the rockies
[00:28] and you want them to stay that's a lot
[00:30] easier said than done especially when
[00:31] you have the smells of the outdoors here
[00:33] and it being a new exciting environment
[00:35] dogs are so curious by nature do you
[00:37] want to help me train veronica i'll tell
[00:38] you what i'm going to put you out here
[00:39] come
[00:42] heel
[00:43] lie down
[00:44] stay so here we're getting some bonus
[00:46] double dog training for multi-dog
[00:48] households where you have one dog who's
[00:49] pretty trained but the other one is
[00:51] still in training

[00:00] that's unusual isn't it i hate your
[00:02] boobs no need to punish the barking no
[00:04] need to scold her or tell her to be
[00:06] quiet usually it's just a matter of
[00:07] desensitizing which is giving them
[00:09] exposure at a distance that doesn't
[00:11] totally overwhelm them so here you can
[00:13] see she's like right on the fence hence
[00:15] the bargaining and of course barking
[00:16] when someone's on your property isn't
[00:18] always the worst thing either we just
[00:19] want to keep it within reason inevitably
[00:21] when people see me petting a dog near a
[00:24] barking outburst like that they'll say
[00:26] zach you're reinforcing the barking
[00:28] encouraging her to bark by providing a
[00:30] positive outcome around the barking
[00:33] i think it's different here why is she
[00:35] barking she's unsure that's the most
[00:37] likely reason so i want to address that
[00:41] it's okay
[00:43] so i'm not trying to even distract her i
[00:45] want her to observe it barking outbursts
[00:47] like we just saw have virtually
[00:49] everything to do with a lack of exposure
[00:51] to the world and the things in it this
[00:53] is actually a pretty prolonged process
[00:55] that we're going to focus on for the
[00:56] next two to three years

[00:00] veronica was successful at basic
[00:01] training inside but now we're outside
[00:03] and this can be 10 times harder for some
[00:05] dogs given all of the smells sights and
[00:07] sounds of the outdoors sit
[00:10] yes
[00:11] i'm going in slow motion right now
[00:13] because i'm really trying to get
[00:14] accumulated seconds here while she holds
[00:16] that sit
[00:17] see there's an unexpected distraction we
[00:19] have some debris flying around over here
[00:21] that's where i think a lot of people
[00:23] might be tempted to correct a dog but
[00:24] i'm going to be understanding of the
[00:26] fact that she has no idea what that
[00:27] flying bag and the wind was about let me
[00:29] see if she reorients here
[00:32] to her sit hey here yes
[00:36] and so again here's another case where
[00:38] treats not quite as reinforcing right
[00:40] now the environment much more
[00:42] interesting to her so
[00:44] trying to shove a training session down
[00:46] her throat is probably not the best
[00:47] thing to do and probably the better
[00:50] thing
[00:51] to do here is just to let her
[00:53] check it out see that's normal it's no
[00:55] threat to her it's not even interesting

[02:03] brianna's birthday as well make sure to
[02:05] give a thumbs up and happy birthday to
[02:07] brie i have a lot of plans for veronica
[02:09] i want to do some training with her and
[02:11] so i want to make sure that my older dog
[02:13] over here is satisfied mentally and
[02:16] physically lie down
[02:18] stay
[02:20] good girl man her fetch is on fire today
[02:24] i was really struggling out here because
[02:26] they mowed the grass this morning and
[02:27] she just wanted to eat like literally
[02:29] every blade and chunk of grass
[02:31] let's go
[02:32] what you couldn't get her interested in
[02:34] fetch no i was really struggling
[02:36] do you know how to sit yes
[02:38] okay go look at that brain what a proper
[02:41] little sit that was yeah she was smart
[02:43] young
[02:43] you were being so good about not being
[02:45] jealous she was trying to put it on your
[02:46] shoulder just you know in case you
[02:47] forgot it was there if i'm gonna have
[02:49] any hope at tackling this grass clawed
[02:52] issue i need to make sure that i get her
[02:54] warmed up first and that starts with
[02:56] acknowledging every little thing that
[02:58] she does that i like i like that she's
[03:00] holding it down stay here
[03:03] okay
[03:04] yes
[03:05] good work i like how she's going into
[03:07] that stand on okay yes
[03:10] and and i like how she's not moving her
[03:12] feet rewarding your dog for every little
[03:15] thing that you like is a great way to
[03:16] get them feeling positive and motivated
[03:19] okay good work and good i like the
[03:22] default set too what's really
[03:23] significant isn't what she's doing right
[03:25] now it's her focus good this is
[03:27] kindergarten to her she's doing so well
[03:29] i'd love to reinforce this down stay
[03:32] she's offering and encourage her to hold
[03:33] it for an extended period i think i'm
[03:35] going to go with my good old-fashioned
[03:36] good here that's very good yes strategy
[03:40] here good
[03:41] here
[03:43] veronica that's very good
[03:45] yes you guys know that those goods often
[03:48] lead to yeses which always lead to a
[03:50] reward that the dog really likes in that
[03:53] moment did you hear that vocalization
[03:55] too
[03:56] i don't want that because barking is the
[03:58] one thing that i want to not work for
[04:00] her because she's going through a
[04:02] serious barking phase here yes so
[04:05] instead i'm going to choose something
[04:06] alternative easy here or look at me
[04:10] yes
[04:15] here
[04:16] very good that's excellent yes i've got
[04:19] to be so careful here you know her real
[04:21] well you can see how if i was being too
[04:23] stingy right now during this delicate
[04:26] phase she could be vocalizing and
[04:28] barking and getting very demanding so
[04:30] i'm trying to keep her below that while
[04:31] also not having to give her a treat
[04:33] every half second veronica
[04:37] here i want eye contact
[04:40] yes
[04:41] our existing communication is pretty
[04:43] decent we have sit look at me down come
[04:46] when called stay to a degree one of her
[04:49] biggest issues has been grabbing things
[04:52] while on a walk especially things like
[04:54] grass i mean she's about to do it right
[04:55] now veronica thinks like bird poop yuck
[04:58] leave it i'm gonna drop some treats
[04:59] right in front of her and make sure that
[05:01] she can leave them alone when i ask her
[05:03] to
[05:05] yes just because she can do this yes
[05:08] doesn't mean that she'll just leave
[05:10] everything alone i'm just trying to get
[05:11] that part of her brain primed and then
[05:14] i'm going to try and bridge from a
[05:15] really structured leave it where i drop
[05:18] a treat in front of you to a more
[05:20] generalized leave things alone on the
[05:23] ground that you encounter a message that
[05:24] she hasn't gotten yet so okay she's got
[05:27] the point there but what she really
[05:29] struggles to resist are those random
[05:31] treasures she finds in her environment
[05:33] like this clump of old gross grass so i
[05:36] want to practice with this we're still
[05:38] doing this in a structured way but we're
[05:40] really trying to spell it out for her to
[05:42] default to checking in with me when she
[05:44] gets confused leave it
[05:46] yes
[05:48] did you see how she gave that an extra
[05:50] eye because that's a different variable
[05:52] leave it
[05:53] yes
[05:55] leave it
[05:56] yes good you notice i'm not just setting
[05:59] it in front of her i'm dropping it i'm
[06:01] trying to make it enticing because i
[06:02] think she's at that point where she can
[06:04] have that level of impulse control
[06:06] that's very good this is the training
[06:08] drill but then real life doesn't always
[06:11] go like you trained for if you don't
[06:13] really address it i can almost guarantee
[06:15] you that if i stand up she's gonna go
[06:18] for it she just gravitates over here and
[06:20] so i'm trying to like show it to her
[06:21] leave it do you see how we're trying to
[06:23] merge a setup training drill with a
[06:26] real-life use case see this is the
[06:28] missing link that's so easy to miss and
[06:31] something that the vast majority of
[06:32] people with dogs overlook when they're
[06:34] teaching them i'm trying to be
[06:36] deliberate and change only one variable
[06:38] at a time in this training session after
[06:40] all if there's a breakdown i need to
[06:42] know exactly where it is and what to
[06:44] work on i'm just going real slow here
[06:46] because i'm trying to mimic something
[06:48] that's more like real life i'm not gonna
[06:49] be sitting on the ground with her when
[06:51] she encounters something she wants to go
[06:53] after i'm gonna be most likely standing
[06:55] or walking or something like that so i
[06:57] need to really spell it out for her here
[07:01] good
[07:04] yes
[07:06] good girl you see she almost was like i
[07:08] really want that grass but i was able to
[07:10] squeeze a glance at me and really
[07:12] communicate to her that was the right
[07:13] answer good girl leave it
[07:18] yes all right she's really getting the
[07:20] hang of leaving this grass alone but
[07:21] again the point here is to help her
[07:23] learn to actually walk past things that
[07:26] she wants without trying to grab them
[07:28] and derailing our walks yes look at this
[07:31] look at this do you see all this grass
[07:32] do you see how she's not picking it up
[07:34] there you go nothing in life could be
[07:36] more exciting than this when you have a
[07:37] puppy so i think we're finally ready to
[07:39] get into some leash training and if it
[07:41] seems like i'm a bit confused on how to
[07:43] move forward it's because i am let's go
[07:45] hey veronica every single dog that i
[07:47] work with is different really i just
[07:49] want to do some troubleshooting does she
[07:50] stay with me when i walk does she pull
[07:52] ahead does she get distracted does she
[07:54] tune me out i just kind of want to see
[07:55] what kind of frame of mind she's in
[07:57] right now while walking i say this all
[07:59] the time though context is everything
[08:00] with dog training sometimes a dog needs
[08:02] to be able to walk slowly next to you on
[08:05] a busy sidewalk other times they need to
[08:07] be free to roam on a 20 or 30 foot lead
[08:09] when you're in a big field doing a free
[08:11] walk and tension is bound to occur yeah
[08:15] okay interesting something's caught her
[08:16] attention there is a car right there
[08:19] oh gosh
[08:20] i'm not gonna let that barking work for
[08:22] her it's a fine line dogs need to be
[08:23] able to bark sometimes she barked and
[08:25] then she looked at you like okay
[08:26] sometimes i get a treat how do you know
[08:28] when to ignore the barking and reward
[08:30] for the attention in public which is
[08:32] huge as well and that's so case by case
[08:34] leave it
[08:37] yes
[08:38] she did kind of go for it but i just
[08:40] kept the leash where it was i didn't
[08:42] pull her back in other words she's still
[08:44] really tempted by those bits of grass so
[08:46] i want to take the time to periodically
[08:48] remind her here
[08:50] good girl yes but i can really minimize
[08:53] or even prevent frustration if i can
[08:55] keep it upbeat and give her something
[08:56] that she thoroughly enjoys in lieu of
[08:59] that clump of grass leave it
[09:01] yes
[09:03] okay come that was great she really took
[09:07] the time to think about the grass and it
[09:08] clearly wasn't an easy choice but she
[09:11] did decide to leave it alone in the end
[09:13] she's getting it clump on the rights
[09:15] she avoids it perfectly
[09:17] are you serious
[09:19] [Music]
[09:21] she's like but that was so hard
[09:24] yes
[09:25] that was i know you were so conflicted
[09:28] that was wonderful girl your
[09:30] progress has been stunning young lady
[09:33] you're a very smart dog you're as smart
[09:35] as any big dog i've ever seen here
[09:38] yes
[09:39] took her a second but she processed the
[09:41] request this is exactly what i was
[09:43] hoping for
[09:44] i'm gonna turn here step in front of her
[09:47] carefully good girl i kind of like how
[09:49] she stayed on my side too
[09:52] yes all right moment of truth this is
[09:54] probably the biggest juiciest clump of
[09:56] grass yet leave it
[10:00] yes
[10:01] good job veronica a plus but there is
[10:03] still this whole issue of separation
[10:05] anxiety that veronica has she actually
[10:08] just doesn't really like to be separated
[10:10] from any of us you meet inertia like if
[10:13] any one of us is gone she is a little
[10:15] bit obnoxious you're right there is that
[10:17] separation anxiety we have dinner plans
[10:19] for tonight and i want to be able to
[10:21] give veronica a nice full day can
[10:24] somebody tell me where i am because
[10:26] this is so alien this is an ancient toll
[10:29] road from like the
[10:30] 1800s yeah ancient to us but yeah i
[10:33] guess they would have horse and buggies
[10:35] go down here and it was an expensive
[10:37] toll of like five cents or something
[10:39] we're just literally finding
[10:41] litter that's from the 1800s while
[10:44] taking a walk we discovered something
[10:46] crazy what better place than an
[10:48] abandoned ghost town for the dogs to
[10:50] explore
[10:53] no it's not food it's supposed to be
[10:55] gold
[10:56] i don't see any not all of the buildings
[10:58] have survived in this town towns like
[11:01] these are harder and harder to find but
[11:02] there are a fair amount of abandoned
[11:04] mining towns like this all over north
[11:06] america and i'm discovering that i
[11:08] really love training dogs in places like
[11:10] this because number one there aren't too
[11:11] many distractions and secondly they are
[11:14] amazing to explore for us the humans the
[11:17] detail in the beams up here it's
[11:20] definitely eerie
[11:22] freaking out right now all built in
[11:24] 1868. what was the purpose of it they
[11:26] would preserve their food and especially
[11:28] their whiskey in here what do you think
[11:30] inertia
[11:31] does it smell like 1860.
[11:33] okay the moment of truth is here all the
[11:36] training we've done today we've done
[11:38] with this night in mind bree and i would
[11:40] love to be able to go out to dinner
[11:41] together without our dogs from time to
[11:44] time but we obviously need to prepare
[11:46] veronica for this because she's less
[11:48] than thrilled about being left alone i
[11:50] like to make sure the dogs are crated so
[11:51] they just chill out i'm thinking that
[11:53] veronica is less likely to have severe
[11:56] anxiety if we leave her in the car as
[11:58] opposed to leaving her in the rv because
[12:00] she's used to being in the car with us
[12:02] for long periods at this point while we
[12:04] drive so she tends to love to get in
[12:06] there to get her treats and there's
[12:08] inertia we have great weather the
[12:10] windows are cracked anyway just for some
[12:12] fresh air i like to prevent any
[12:13] unforeseen circumstances so our strategy
[12:16] is to get veronica comfortable with
[12:17] being alone by leaving her alone in the
[12:20] car while we're nearby i wanted to stay
[12:22] just outside the car here for a few
[12:24] seconds just to make sure they weren't
[12:25] too upset and
[12:27] i mean you can hear no barking they've
[12:29] had a really active day fortunately we
[12:31] were able to get a table right here
[12:33] where we can
[12:34] monitor the dogs they're
[12:36] that truck right there but it's nice to
[12:39] do this and be close where we can
[12:41] actually verify that they're calm at
[12:43] least they're not expressing vocally
[12:45] which for veronica means she's
[12:47] definitely calm yes she is very loud
[12:50] when she's not calm she definitely lets
[12:52] us know the temperature started to drop
[12:54] quickly so i decided i needed to go to
[12:56] the car to get a hoodie
[12:58] still not barking
[12:59] good job
[13:04] it's okay sweet girl
[13:05] so there she is
[13:07] good girl she barked and it was because
[13:09] i was in there with an iphone camera
[13:11] trying to get a shot of her sleeping
[13:12] yeah so that i back off so she was a
[13:14] little excited but i think she's going
[13:16] to recover did you put some treats
[13:18] no but i probably should have i was
[13:20] really just trying to be quick about it
[13:21] i just heard a bark just a little one
[13:23] yeah i think i made a big mistake i'm
[13:26] gonna see if it passes all right well
[13:28] some small barks i think veronica did
[13:30] great she barked like three or four
[13:32] times yeah like short burst she didn't
[13:34] go on and on she recovered it's always a
[13:36] big moment when you get to the point
[13:37] where you can start to go out to dinner

[00:00] veronica is making it crystal clear she
[00:02] wants out of her bedroom i don't want
[00:04] all of this when i go to open the crate
[00:06] good
[00:07] my whole objective is to make sure that
[00:09] i let veronica out of the crate only
[00:12] when she's behaving calmly but we appear
[00:14] to be a long ways off from that so
[00:17] yes look at that there's a half second
[00:20] of calm and that is where we start
[00:23] death by puppy

[00:00] just waiting for it to go in and reason
[00:01] through hey that's where you're going to
[00:03] get the treats for this particular
[00:05] lesson not out here because she's
[00:07] looking at me like hey this this works
[00:09] for me a lot I'm sitting and remember
[00:11] I'm using Veronica's meal for a lot of
[00:13] this training that's a great way to
[00:15] train puppies since you can give them
[00:16] lots and lots of rewards but still keep
[00:18] them healthy the logic here isn't just
[00:20] hey go follow a treat in there and bribe
[00:22] them the logic here is to have her
[00:25] associate being in the crate with
[00:27] something really good and here she sees
[00:29] the open door she comes walking out I'm
[00:31] not having to say no or close the crate
[00:33] in her face instead I'm just going to
[00:35] put that over there
[00:37] keep throwing those in there until she
[00:39] kind of inadvertently decides to stay
[00:41] she's thinking about it see this is
[00:42] where the fun is over here and look at
[00:44] that look at this see how she's starting
[00:46] to look back towards the crate now
[00:48] rather than running out and saying no
[00:49] I'll never go in there again
[00:53] yes that's what I'm looking for there
[00:55] for her not to come running out
[00:57] yes

[00:00] this is the story of how we introduced
[00:02] our out-of-control crazy puppy to our
[00:05] cats she in general seems to be doing
[00:07] well with other dogs our own included
[00:09] but cats is kind of a wild card when are
[00:12] cats not a wild card i know angela is
[00:14] very accustomed to coming downstairs to
[00:16] socialize with me in the evenings and
[00:18] she is not about to let veronica stand
[00:20] in the way of her evening ritual
[00:24] veronica is a really playful puppy and
[00:26] she clearly wants to chase angela this
[00:30] is one of the reasons i'm keeping her on
[00:31] leash one of many reasons and the great
[00:33] thing about the leash you're managing
[00:35] her so you're keeping it from escalating
[00:36] so at least this desire to chase the cat
[00:39] isn't getting established
[00:42] they still definitely have a long way to
[00:44] go but it really seems like over time
[00:46] veronica is learning that she does not
[00:49] usually get to chase angela when she
[00:51] sees her hopefully i can keep it that
[00:53] way
[00:54] good girl
[00:58] that's so good

[00:00] when people tell me their dog acts like
[00:01] this I'm like your dog hasn't gotten
[00:03] enough exercise yep there you go look at
[00:05] that they'd be right
[00:09] work inertia
[00:15] one thing I'm loving so far about this
[00:17] trip is how every night we have
[00:20] something totally different for the dog
[00:21]  good job inertia hi how you doing
[00:24] you having fun oh look at her
[00:26] she came up to see you she's having so
[00:28] much fun
[00:31] imagine the most perfect fall day that
[00:35] you possibly could
[00:36] and that's what it's like here in
[00:38] British Columbia but then imagine
[00:41] in the wilderness
[00:44] when else for like miles and miles
[00:48] it allows me to think about dog training
[00:50] a lot

[00:00] I'm Bree this is my husband Zach he's a
[00:02] dog trainer we're showing you how we
[00:03] train both of our dogs everything
[00:05] everywhere we go in this episode we're
[00:07] getting into some serious training with
[00:09] my new puppy this is Veronica in case
[00:10] you don't know and getting her attention
[00:12] at all in the real world needs a lot of
[00:15] work unlike Zach who has endless ideas
[00:17] for training opportunities and he's just
[00:19] like constantly inspired I actually tend
[00:21] to hit a lot of plateaus with my
[00:23] training where I get a little complacent
[00:25] unless I have Something There to Remind
[00:27] me to keep pushing forward I want to
[00:29] show you the best hack I've found
[00:30] besides our videos of course for
[00:32] actually keeping myself excited and
[00:34] motivated and on the right track with
[00:36] Veronica's training this is a training
[00:39] card it has suggestions for everything I
[00:41] need to work on based on Veronica's
[00:42] actual age I get one of these every
[00:44] month in my pup box along with relevant
[00:47] supplies toys and treats the suggestions
[00:50] they give on the card They also give you
[00:52] stuff you can use to work on training
[00:54] that another amazing tug toy drop it oh
[00:57] yes that was good Zach's been working on
[00:59] that one I can't take credit and
[01:01] obviously great quality training treats
[01:03] I've got a dental supply definitely need
[01:05] this dental treats that's amazing look
[01:08] at this thing it's got ridges I'm gonna
[01:10] start catching up right now on this
[01:12] dental work she loves it popbox has been
[01:14] a game changer for me and Veronica I
[01:17] just want to make sure that you guys
[01:18] have a chance to try it out too you can
[01:19] get 50 off your first pup box when you
[01:21] sign up at our special link it's
[01:22] pupbox.com Zach I really hope you guys
[01:26] are subscribed to this channel because
[01:28] this has to be one of the more original
[01:30] dog training series on YouTube at the
[01:32] moment how do you train your dog to not
[01:34] get eaten by a bear I'm asking you
[01:37] oh me yeah if I'm really simplifying it
[01:40] it's teaching your dog how to reliably
[01:42] stay even when they want to go and come
[01:44] when called and Veronica is not perfect
[01:46] on either one of those by any means
[01:48] virtually no dog is perfect on those
[01:50] things but our goal is to just get it as
[01:52] reliable as we can and that's going to
[01:54] be my top priority that is if we can
[01:56] find a place to sleep tonight from here
[01:58] until we pull into our driveway in
[02:01] Alaska it's Wilderness it's this look
[02:04] we've been seeing Wildlife like this for
[02:06] hours with all of this peace and quiet
[02:09] the animals really get to just be
[02:11] themselves but when a bear is being
[02:13] himself I am scared of him we found a
[02:15] good place to stay for the night do not
[02:17] leave me alone out here I'm not okay
[02:21] good girl we're scared to get out
[02:25] there you go yeah I think I'll feel
[02:27] safer in the morning and I'll be able to
[02:29] exercise them out there tomorrow
[02:34] but I want to give you an idea of where
[02:35] we stand with inertia so that you can
[02:37] see what we're working towards with our
[02:39] puppy Veronica I want to make sure stay
[02:41] is really good out here with a
[02:43] distraction
[02:44] good now I want to make sure I can call
[02:46] her away from a distraction albeit minor
[02:48] in this case come
[02:49] throw in a heel for good measure yes
[02:53] good look at me okay and so all this is
[02:56] just demonstrating that I have her under
[02:58] control off leash in this uncontrolled
[03:00] environment let out good girl being able
[03:02] to have motion here with toys that she
[03:04] likes throwing some treats a frisbee we
[03:07] all know she likes frisbee very much
[03:08] come and then being able to get her to
[03:10] ignore those things and come to me is
[03:12] critical when I had a TV show in Britain
[03:14] we called this temptation alley where
[03:16] we'd have all sorts of amazing things
[03:18] laid out before the dog and we would
[03:20] train them how to come past all of those
[03:22] things
[03:23] so I'm hoping to do some of that with
[03:25] Veronica she's really interested in
[03:26] those toys which for purposes of this
[03:29] lesson are going to be substitutes for
[03:31] grizzly bears you got to start somewhere
[03:33] sit all I'm doing right now is getting
[03:36] her warmed up to make sure she
[03:37] understands sit and essentially stay in
[03:39] this environment if she didn't that
[03:41] would say okay she's a little over
[03:42] stimulated maybe I need to change the
[03:44] environment make it a little bit easier
[03:46] for her because just by virtue of being
[03:47] outside that's hard for a lot of dogs
[03:50] especially young dogs come up here I'm
[03:52] gonna come over here
[03:54] okay I'm gonna release her close make
[03:57] sure she can do come
[03:59] here okay come I really want to
[04:02] reiterate to you that you cannot over
[04:04] reward come and stay you want to have
[04:07] those treats throughout your house in
[04:09] your pocket you never want to leave the
[04:10] house without them you don't want to
[04:11] take the attitude of oh they know it or
[04:13] I expect them to come to me because I'm
[04:15] the alpha or I expect them to come to me
[04:18] because they love me or any other number
[04:19] of reasons find ways to make it worth
[04:22] their while nice little warm-up primed
[04:24] for this lesson I hope I'm gonna drop a
[04:26] treat in front of her this is impulse
[04:28] control that is pay attention to me when
[04:30] you want something else that is huge I
[04:32] mean that is so much of dog training
[04:33] there's almost certainly going to be
[04:35] confusion on her part with a lesson like
[04:37] this so I want to be mindful of that and
[04:39] try to minimize that to the best of my
[04:41] ability
[04:42] ah could be better you see she was like
[04:44] I want to get that treat but uh I see
[04:47] that that's impossible so I'll come to
[04:48] you but I'd rather her not go for the
[04:50] treat to begin with sit leave it
[04:53] here
[04:55] come yes good
[04:58] see that that's where it starts I think
[05:00] a lot of people order this impression
[05:02] that once you have something like that
[05:03] hauling them off a major distraction
[05:05] should be super easy and it's not I
[05:08] think we need to find something a little
[05:09] bit more distracting than a treat for
[05:11] Veronica and then we can gradually
[05:14] increase the level of distraction from
[05:16] there small steps just to verify that
[05:18] she loves her little tennis ball she
[05:20] loves going after those is it reasonable
[05:22] to expect her to leave it alone and stay
[05:24] I think yes sit good if I ask her to
[05:27] stay that means stay even if I'm
[05:29] throwing something that you normally go
[05:31] after don't get too hung up on the
[05:33] difference between leave it and stay in
[05:35] this case the bottom line is I want her
[05:36] to hold position
[05:38] while there's a distraction good see how
[05:40] I'm making it more and more distracting
[05:43] here oh
[05:45] failure on my part no one's perfect
[05:47] leave it here yes
[05:53] notice how far away I am from Veronica
[05:55] here come
[05:57] yes and these skills are very new to her
[06:00] so she's really starting to do well here
[06:02] stay
[06:03] here come
[06:06] oh did you get distracted along the way
[06:09] here
[06:10] will you be patient with her here for a
[06:12] second something there's a new scent
[06:14] there she's not going after the
[06:16] distraction that I introduced
[06:19] here
[06:20] good girl the number of times in a day
[06:24] where I stop whatever we're doing and
[06:26] let Veronica investigate something I
[06:28] mean it takes up like 50 of my day
[06:30] that's a piece of puppy Parenthood that
[06:33] I underestimated a little bit one of the
[06:34] reasons we're losing ground a lot of
[06:36] dominance training techniques in the
[06:38] public is because of impatience no you
[06:40] shouldn't sniff on the ground when I
[06:41] just gave you a request I'm not going to
[06:43] let you do that I'm going to make you do
[06:44] that thing and what I think people don't
[06:46] realize is if you don't let them satisfy
[06:48] their Curiosities more towards the
[06:50] beginning part of their training it's
[06:52] likely going to hinder your training in
[06:53] the future I need to go back over there
[06:55] yeah yeah because you you might see that
[06:57] I'm breaking through here I've got
[06:58] multiple balls now I dare you to juggle
[07:01] stay for anyone who's had a dog that has
[07:03] chased an animal before you will
[07:05] understand how important stay income are
[07:07] so for purposes of this lesson this is a
[07:10] grizzly bear this is an elk this is a
[07:12] moose this is a coyote and this is a
[07:14] wolf sit
[07:16] the tendency for a lot of people is to
[07:19] try to jump to the major distraction and
[07:21] aggressively correct a dog perhaps in
[07:24] many cases when their dog doesn't listen
[07:26] to stay or come in a situation like that
[07:28] but really this is one of the missing
[07:29] links doing exercises like this okay
[07:32] come she wanted to make absolutely sure
[07:34] I don't know if you caught her jump
[07:35] there that was cute you get them in the
[07:38] habit of using their brain to resist
[07:40] temptation and come to you or pay
[07:42] attention to you instead yes I'm gonna
[07:44] do stay with distance now before I was
[07:46] calling her away from the thing here I'm
[07:49] hoping to have her address that
[07:50] Temptation head on all right needs work
[07:53] ignore the Temptation and come straight
[07:55] to me
[07:56] good
[07:57] all right here's a moose here good
[08:00] here's a wolf here's a squirrel oh no
[08:03] Wolverine that's a bear will she come
[08:05] come
[08:07] yes well done she even had to avoid them
[08:11] when she came to me obviously we can't
[08:13] just go from little balls to Bears we
[08:16] have to find other things that
[08:16] temperatures now we know that she's a
[08:18] frisbee dog in the making stay
[08:21] wolf moose bear coyote squirrel
[08:28] polar bear
[08:30] uh-oh really good example she's like oh
[08:32] I'll stay for those balls those are easy
[08:34] but that frisbee I gotta have that she
[08:36] loves her frisbee to people watching
[08:38] this they might think oh well she left
[08:39] the balls alone Frisbee's not that
[08:41] different but actually it was clear
[08:42] there the Frisbee was a different class
[08:44] of distraction to her I like that she
[08:46] likes frisbee I don't want to quell her
[08:48] desire in that frisbee but at the same
[08:50] time she won't stay with a rolling
[08:52] frisbee how's she gonna stay when she
[08:53] encounters a wild animal yes when I
[08:56] zoomed in on the Frisbee distraction she
[08:59] was able to summon enough self-control
[09:01] to knock her after it when I asked her
[09:03] to leave it alone yes if she's prepared
[09:05] to resist multiple distractions that
[09:08] means she's stronger mentally on this
[09:09] skill
[09:10] leave it
[09:14] come
[09:18] on come on come on come on yeah
[09:20] beautiful and come here I'm going to
[09:23] continue to address this in as many
[09:24] different ways as I know how to perfect
[09:26] let's see if we can do a little bit of a
[09:28] frisbee lesson see where she is right
[09:29] now frisbee is a great way to satisfy
[09:31] mentally physically get them nice and
[09:33] happy tired grow their brain there's a
[09:35] million reasons so I'm doing a
[09:37] combination of tug of war ER get it yeah
[09:41] and then I'm doing rollers to keep her
[09:44] low on the grounds you try to get it by
[09:45] the rim regularly she's around six
[09:47] months old so we do rollers for the most
[09:49] part but we toss it too sometimes just
[09:51] want to be conscious of her over jumping
[09:53] notice how we're keeping our frisbee
[09:54] game nice and short here go every once
[09:56] in a while I'll even sneak in a throw
[09:58] well done she's doing great on bringing
[10:00] it back too go
[10:02] yeah so her frisbee game continues to
[10:06] look great it is a great way to exercise
[10:08] her and build communication which is
[10:10] what we are all about doing when I do a
[10:12] fetch video like this pointing out how
[10:13] it's a good way to satisfy them mentally
[10:15] physically to get their energy out
[10:16] someone will invariably say but you're
[10:19] just going to get them in better shape
[10:20] and they're going to become more
[10:21] difficult to tire and satisfy as though
[10:24] keeping your dog in really good physical
[10:25] shape is somehow a detriment I really
[10:28] think this is the wrong way to look at
[10:30] this what's not being taken into account
[10:31] is how much communication you're
[10:33] building with your dog when you're
[10:34] teaching them how to play fetch how to
[10:36] play Frisbee how to do all of these
[10:37] tricks so in those times where they are
[10:39] becoming difficult to manage you have
[10:41] this whole bed of experience that you've
[10:43] built with them where you can easily
[10:45] communicate okay we're not going to play
[10:46] fetch right now but can you relax maybe
[10:48] later we'll go out so I really think it
[10:50] is a poor argument to avoid playing
[10:54] regular fetch or frisbee or whatever
[10:55] with your dog because you're worried
[10:58] about them becoming extremely fit and
[11:01] requiring more of your time you're not
[11:03] creating a monster by keeping them in
[11:05] shape you're creating a healthy dog who
[11:06] understands how to listen to you better
[11:08] that's how I've always seen it look
[11:09] maybe I'm wrong what do you guys think
[11:11] tell me in the comments we are getting
[11:13] this close to the Alaska Canada Highway
[11:15] also known as the owl can it's a very
[11:17] epic drive that very few human beings
[11:19] have done it's not without risk
[11:21] obviously we've talked about the animals
[11:22] but you know there's mechanical failure
[11:24] there's weather I mean we think we're
[11:26] prepared I thought we were ready for
[11:27] this and I do not anymore it's all fine
[11:30] that she did great today but in our next
[11:32] episode you're gonna see what happens
[11:33] when it doesn't go so great
[11:36] and my training goes completely off the
[11:39] rails if you want every Advantage you
[11:41] can get with training your dog make sure

TRANSCRIPTION:

[00:00] with us today is Veronica hey inertia
[00:02] we're going to be talking about unwanted
[00:04] barking leash reactivity I have a
[00:06] feeling today we're going to get into
[00:07] some controversial politics in the dog
[00:09] world there is no controversy in the dog
[00:11] world have you guys gotten a Furbo yet
[00:14] furbo's today's sponsor and it's a
[00:16] product that we have genuinely I mean
[00:18] this we have genuinely used for years
[00:20] and years now verbo is a dog camera that
[00:22] allows you to interact with your dog no
[00:24] matter where you are you can talk to
[00:26] them it's HD video you can toss treats
[00:29] to that the latest version of the Furbo
[00:31] is the Furbo perfected it's almost
[00:33] unrecognizable now it's like iPhone one
[00:36] versus iPhone 14. you can turn the
[00:38] camera around 360 degrees now you can
[00:41] also subscribe to dog Nanny this is
[00:42] really what separates Furbo sometimes
[00:45] guess what you get busy and you don't
[00:47] remember to check in on your dog and
[00:49] that's where this artificial
[00:50] intelligence comes in with dog Nanny it
[00:52] will actually notify you on your
[00:53] smartphone that's a lot of Furbo alerts
[00:56] it says she's crying so I'm gonna check
[00:57] it
[00:58] is barking if they're eating or drinking
[01:00] which they may not always be supposed to
[01:01] do for a book can detect a person in
[01:03] your house verbal can detect emergencies
[01:05] there's so much that Furbo can do you're
[01:07] gonna take my job away I love the Furbo
[01:09] all of this is really good for training
[01:10] too so she was bunking for a second but
[01:12] then she resettled it can be very useful
[01:14] to know if your dog is making noise when
[01:16] you're not at home how many of you live
[01:18] in an apartment you guys need a Furbo
[01:19] okay we've got to get into the video
[01:20] here bottom line if you ever leave your
[01:23] dog alone it'll really appreciate having
[01:25] it around we'll have a link below well
[01:27] if you're crazy and pretty unusual
[01:29] questions have been pouring in so we're
[01:32] gonna answer them what is the most
[01:34] difficult Behavior case you've ever
[01:36] taken on that's a hard question part of
[01:38] my process when working with a dog is
[01:41] who is this dog that I'm working with
[01:43] what are their capabilities what do they
[01:45] like what don't they like what do they
[01:47] cut out for what are they not cut out
[01:48] for I can think of some tough cases that
[01:50] we've had on YouTube over the years so
[01:52] can I remember the golden retriever
[01:53] pretty hyper today but no surprise we
[01:55] expected that I caught a lot of heat
[01:56] that was a lease training session
[01:58] because he was out of control it was
[02:00] like 98 Degrees and he didn't know it I
[02:03] sure did because I'm drenched in sweat
[02:05] the whole time in the end you didn't
[02:07] make that much progress that day a lot
[02:09] of balance trainers have used this to
[02:11] come at me online too they'll show clips
[02:13] of this dog pulling me all over the
[02:15] place I think they missed the point of
[02:17] that video and the point of that video
[02:18] is yeah sometimes it's hard sometimes
[02:20] you don't get instant results and when
[02:22] you're not willing to sacrifice the
[02:24] long-term well-being of a dog in order
[02:26] to get results
[02:28] then you know this is sometimes what
[02:30] training looks like not Everyone likes
[02:32] to show their struggles on the internet
[02:34] I mean look if we're not going to show
[02:36] realism what are we going to show we're
[02:37] just going to show look how good a dog
[02:39] trainer I am I mean dog training is one
[02:41] of the most ego based professions out
[02:44] there it's kind of put in the category
[02:45] of magicians or All-Star athletes who
[02:48] are really gifted at something and dog
[02:50] training is not like that sure certain
[02:52] people are more talented because they
[02:54] put more time into it or they're more
[02:55] interested in it when you look at dogs
[02:57] training the way that we do it is a
[02:58] scientific profession we try to remember
[03:00] that at all times when we're working
[03:01] with dogs but to name names the golden
[03:03] retriever was a difficult day
[03:06] oh the tree attacking dog we got there
[03:09] and we were like okay take us for a walk
[03:11] show us your dog attacking the tree
[03:12] let's see how bad this really is
[03:14] whatever I was expecting
[03:17] it was not for that dog to just fully
[03:19] attack every tree he saw he goes right
[03:21] after it I mean my goodness definitely
[03:24] an outlier dog training appointment do
[03:26] you remember Chloe the rescue dog
[03:28] whenever you show up to an animal rescue
[03:30] place and say Hey I want to train a dog
[03:32] give me a tough case they are happy to
[03:34] do so what are you biting my shoe for
[03:36] it's my shoe I was afraid that she might
[03:39] play bite you into the ER on that day
[03:42] you were concerned I know yeah you're
[03:44] stiff arm with the leash and holding her
[03:46] away from you was really good it wasn't
[03:48] malicious biting but it was puppy biting
[03:50] that had gone unchecked with that adult
[03:52] strength it made it really challenging
[03:55] to work with her more recently you guys
[03:56] will remember chop 15 minutes ago
[04:02] I was ready to quit being a dog trainer
[04:04] forever we did a whole series with chop
[04:07] he was really challenging mainly because
[04:09] he was extremely strong he sees dogs he
[04:12] is like I've got to get to them geez he
[04:15] was completely untrained when I got him
[04:16] and he'd been moving outside not just
[04:18] outside but like on the streets with you
[04:21] know very little structure or Direction
[04:23] in his life he had no idea how to live
[04:25] in a human world but in all of those
[04:27] cases I was like all right what does it
[04:28] take to motivate the dog to at least get
[04:31] some traction do they like toys do they
[04:32] like treats do they like the environment
[04:34] how can I reinforce events that I wish
[04:36] to see repeated that's always what I'm
[04:38] asking myself even though dog training
[04:40] is a science the nuances from dog to dog
[04:42] are quite different so you really have
[04:44] to cater to the individual dog in the
[04:46] same way that you would a person when we
[04:48] label a dog hard to train to me that's
[04:51] more of a red flag that we don't
[04:54] necessarily understand where that dog's
[04:56] strengths or weaknesses are yet we
[04:58] haven't gotten to know the dog even in
[05:00] the case where a dog may have a learning
[05:02] disability or even mental illness it's
[05:04] logical to assume that some dogs do have
[05:06] that you as their teacher can calibrate
[05:08] to that and hold them to a standard that
[05:10] is acceptable for that individual dog
[05:12] we'll see it all too often online
[05:14] someone will slap a choke chain on a dog
[05:16] and be like look at that they don't pull
[05:18] now because I just strangled them at the
[05:20] neck for a few seconds or popped a leash
[05:22] or or added pressure if we want to be
[05:24] diplomatic and you know that's not
[05:26] getting to know the dog and I think that
[05:28] is very risky we can't just train
[05:31] without quality of life in mind that's
[05:33] not just you saying that there's a lot
[05:34] of science to back that up so far I
[05:36] don't want to be on the wrong side of
[05:37] science I really don't that is not a
[05:39] good place to be what is the toughest
[05:41] experience you've ever had overcoming a
[05:43] behavior issue or not overcoming it
[05:45] maybe you're currently struggling with
[05:47] it my dog barks all the time at what
[05:48] seems like nothing Well dogs don't bark
[05:50] at nothing unwanted barking I mean yeah
[05:53] it's a thing virtually all dogs will go
[05:56] through a barking phase at some point in
[05:58] their life has your dog ever gone
[05:59] through a barking face are they
[06:00] currently an excessive barcode do you
[06:02] like the fact that your dog barks to let
[06:03] you know for example when someone is at
[06:05] the door it's really easy to get annoyed
[06:08] with barking especially when it's really
[06:10] excessive I think a lot of us really get
[06:12] in the habit of dismissing those
[06:13] vocalizations as being meaningless but
[06:16] remember dogs can't speak words they
[06:18] have only so many ways they can express
[06:19] what's going on inside of them do your
[06:22] best to understand that there is a
[06:24] reason behind your dog's vocalizing and
[06:26] address the cause of the dog sparking
[06:28] rather than just trying to suppress the
[06:31] symptom whatever it is they're trying to
[06:32] say if you have a dog who's excessively
[06:34] barking ask yourself are you
[06:35] inadvertently reinforcing The Barking I
[06:38] don't know maybe your dog's barking
[06:39] because it's dinner time and they want
[06:41] food and you're like okay okay just be
[06:43] quiet here's your food that is teaching
[06:45] them how to ask for their food by
[06:47] barking right and so in that case you
[06:50] would either want to feed them sooner
[06:51] before The Barking occurs or wait for a
[06:53] significant period of Silence maybe in
[06:55] the beginning just a few seconds and
[06:57] then feed them barking itself can be
[06:59] reinforcing I think to some dog like
[07:01] when they have pent up energy and
[07:03] they're just like bark bark bark which
[07:05] is why the number one way to resolve
[07:08] unwanted barking you guessed it exercise
[07:10] early in the day anecdotally we have
[07:12] actually dealt with this ourselves
[07:14] recently whenever the sun goes down
[07:18] my little dog seems Disturbed or barks
[07:22] at least it feels like she's saying
[07:24] what's going on the world disappeared
[07:29] the darkness that makes her bark or if
[07:31] it's Reflections in the window that
[07:33] suddenly appear that weren't there
[07:34] before or if it slights outside there's
[07:37] something about that shift from daylight
[07:40] to dusk yeah that makes Veronica want to
[07:43] bark even though I don't fully
[07:44] understand what she's barking at I'm not
[07:46] just like be quiet stop barking I try to
[07:49] let her know that's okay that's normal
[07:51] that happens every day thanks for
[07:52] letting me know notice how cautious brie
[07:55] is being as to claiming why the Barking
[07:57] is occurring I think that's important
[07:59] whenever we're analyzing anything with
[08:00] our dogs even though I don't know for
[08:02] sure why she's barking I can still
[08:04] validate that emotion I can still say
[08:07] you're barking at something it must be
[08:09] strange it's okay though don't worry
[08:11] that's normal it's all right
[08:14] foreign
[08:20] thanks for letting me know I don't want
[08:22] her to feel like I don't hear her when
[08:24] she's trying to say something to me even
[08:26] though I don't speak dog and so I think
[08:28] acknowledging her barking before I just
[08:31] ask her to be quiet is the way to go
[08:33] what does your dog bark at because some
[08:34] of us don't understand what our dog is
[08:36] barking at we took our dog to the vet
[08:37] for a bath and now he's petrified to
[08:39] enter a bathroom with running water even
[08:41] when vets and groomers are really
[08:44] careful and they really in a good faith
[08:46] way try to get a dog comfortable with a
[08:48] bath the fact that there's a time limit
[08:50] they have to get it done you're paying
[08:51] them to get it done unfortunately this
[08:53] is probably quite common because of that
[08:55] any time that I've watched you try to
[08:57] get a dog comfortable with a bath or
[08:59] anything similar when they're
[09:00] uncomfortable your effort is almost
[09:03] completely focused on Breaking the
[09:06] process down so that you can really
[09:08] specifically identify the exact point
[09:11] where a dog gets uncomfortable you know
[09:13] she's not taking treats that's a sign
[09:14] that she's a little anxious and maybe I
[09:16] should just take a step back it sounds
[09:17] like they have correlated their dog
[09:19] getting really nervous service when they
[09:21] hear running water yes makes sense so
[09:23] stop the running water yeah maybe fill
[09:25] up the tub when your dog's not present
[09:27] then it's a matter of really counter
[09:28] conditioning them that is reversing
[09:30] their current emotional state and trying
[09:32] to create a more optimistic emotional
[09:34] state in the presence of that water and
[09:36] that's great but I do understand it's
[09:38] not always that simple I mean I filmed
[09:40] my first several baths with inertia and
[09:43] even though inertia is perfect in the
[09:46] bath she hears me talking about inertia
[09:48] is perfect in the bath she doesn't like
[09:51] them though she doesn't enjoy them I
[09:53] know we're not gonna take a bath We're
[09:55] not gonna take a bath sweet girl
[09:57] she just put herself in her crate this
[09:59] is what she does when I when I say take
[10:01] a bath she's never had what I would
[10:04] consider a bad bath experience it seems
[10:06] like she's like can we just get this
[10:07] over with so if your dog is super scared
[10:10] break it down into smaller steps in the
[10:12] meantime there are doggy wipes you can
[10:15] use a sponge bath there are things you
[10:17] can do to sort of keep them as hygienic
[10:20] as possible and be taller and understand
[10:21] most dogs don't enjoy getting a bath
[10:23] what does your dog think about taking a
[10:25] bath you know there's dogs out there
[10:26] that are like I can't wait for this it's
[10:29] another thing we're doing yeah I love
[10:31] dogs like that and tell me how you
[10:33] taught that so that I can get some tips
[10:35] what do you do when a dog is not very
[10:37] motivated by food or toys it's almost a
[10:40] bad question and here's why all dogs
[10:42] assuming they're healthy must eat so to
[10:45] say that they're not motivated by food
[10:46] is disingenuous what most people mean
[10:50] when they say this is my dog won't take
[10:52] a treat in a particular context they're
[10:54] in the middle of a reaction towards
[10:56] another dog or the barking at something
[10:58] out of the window and they won't take a
[11:00] treat that's different than a dog not
[11:01] being motivated by a tree they're not
[11:03] motivated by a treat in that particular
[11:05] instance and you're likely trying to
[11:07] take a step that is too big by saying
[11:09] hey just try this you should like this
[11:11] you don't get to determine what
[11:14] motivates your dog in a given context
[11:17] that's why we always break things down
[11:19] into smaller steps versus trying to do
[11:21] damage control when they're well over
[11:23] threshold and that's the thing virtually
[11:25] all dogs are not going to take treats
[11:27] when they're over threshold when they're
[11:29] over stimulated and so our job is to
[11:31] manage them and not put them in that
[11:33] situation until they're ready for it and
[11:35] that's a steady progression that we take
[11:37] our time on which we've demonstrated
[11:38] many times on this channel when many
[11:40] people ask this question it means they
[11:42] have not yet gotten proficient at
[11:45] identifying their dog's threshold levels
[11:47] yet if your dog isn't motivated by food
[11:50] then you're likely asking them to
[11:54] perform a certain way when they're over
[11:56] that Thresh hold and that's not where
[11:59] your training efforts need to go that's
[12:00] your cue I put my dog in a situation
[12:02] where they're not receptive so much to
[12:04] learning what I want to teach them right
[12:06] now and I need to find easier versions
[12:08] of this now as far as toys go that's a
[12:11] little bit of a different story there
[12:12] are definitely a good amount of dogs out
[12:14] there who are not motivated by toys but
[12:16] more dogs are motivated by toys than one
[12:20] probably realizes so often when people
[12:22] try to introduce a toy to a dog they're
[12:24] just like throw it at them or toss it
[12:26] and like hey if you like this if you
[12:28] like that they're not really trying to
[12:30] get their dog engaged when I introduce a
[12:32] toy to a dog tug of war is what I
[12:34] usually go for so I'll just jiggle that
[12:36] toil move it around like a little
[12:37] squirrel and you see how she perks up
[12:39] when I did that whereas if I was just
[12:40] like hey here I see so many people
[12:43] they'll get their dog excited about a
[12:45] toy and then they just nip that
[12:48] excitement in the bud by being like now
[12:49] sit before I throw it meet your dog
[12:51] halfway and play some of the game they
[12:54] want to play too instead of just
[12:56] insisting they play the game game you
[12:58] want to play in the beginning you want
[12:59] that excitement even if it's sloppy and
[13:01] they're jumping all over you right and
[13:03] you got to throw it don't don't hold
[13:04] them to a standard great Point can you
[13:06] train two puppies in the same house with
[13:09] two different people training each dog
[13:10] there's a couple of ways to answer this
[13:12] question number one can two people focus
[13:14] on training their project their dog or
[13:16] puppy while the other person focuses on
[13:19] training theirs yeah one person per dog
[13:20] you mean yeah I guess you could do that
[13:22] why not can two people successfully
[13:24] train one dog without confusing them
[13:26] though it's a good idea to be on the
[13:27] same page where you run into trouble is
[13:29] where you have competing philosophies of
[13:31] how to teach this dog you really want to
[13:33] make sure that you both take agency in
[13:35] the dog's well-being long term and that
[13:37] you're really focused on long-term
[13:39] results and not short-term results I
[13:41] would caution anyone from getting two
[13:42] dogs at one time that's not something
[13:44] that I think I would do though life is
[13:46] long you never know but even as a
[13:48] professional trainer I wouldn't welcome
[13:50] that because it feels like two dogs are
[13:52] about four times the word for those of
[13:54] you who have multiple dogs and multiple
[13:56] people in your household how do you
[13:58] approach that do you have one main
[14:00] trainer or is everyone supposed to train
[14:01] equally do you care about consistency or
[14:04] does everyone have their own way of
[14:05] working with a dog this is good data for
[14:07] us we both try to work with both dogs we
[14:09] try to be on the same page yep and but
[14:11] even in spite of that we still have
[14:13] differences from time to time you saw
[14:14] recently Bree loves using the bungee
[14:17] leash are you trying to be provocative
[14:18] is that provocative it's provocative why
[14:21] I still use it yeah and it seems to be
[14:23] working out okay so maybe we are on the
[14:25] same page Why does the leash trigger my
[14:26] dog to have an outburst towards other
[14:28] dogs the reason a lot of dogs will start
[14:31] barking and lunging when on leash versus
[14:34] not being on leash is because it's very
[14:36] restrictive it can be very frustrating
[14:38] this is the thoughts our dogs need to be
[14:40] on leash in a lot of situations so as
[14:43] someone hey hi cutie okay we have dogs
[14:47] now one of the things that I've done to
[14:48] combat leash reactivity in my own dogs
[14:50] including inertia is to really
[14:52] prioritize free walks on a long lead
[14:55] they can behave a bit more naturally
[14:57] they can Pace back and forth go ahead a
[14:59] few feet stop smell something on the
[15:01] ground now run back it gives them a lot
[15:03] more freedom to interact with the world
[15:04] it should occur in a place where there
[15:06] aren't a lot of dogs you can always
[15:07] drive to a park some old ball field
[15:09] there's a lot of ways to let your dog
[15:11] Roam and smell for those of you who are
[15:13] lucky enough to live in a more rural
[15:15] area yes slow traffic dirt roads or some
[15:18] of my favorite places to walk reactive
[15:20] dogs because it's naturally wide it's
[15:22] wide enough for a car so you have all
[15:24] that space and visibility to really keep
[15:26] your eye out for animals and other dogs
[15:28] so just be understanding of the fact
[15:30] that a leash is restrictive to a doll
[15:32] and that can cause frustration and it
[15:34] takes time to teach them how to adjust
[15:37] to that I think this goes without saying
[15:39] but unleash greetings especially for a
[15:41] dog who's reactive not a good idea I
[15:44] don't do unleash greetings it seems like
[15:46] there's a decent percentage of people
[15:48] that are dealing with their dog barking
[15:50] and lunging while on leash specifically
[15:51] is that something you guys have dealt
[15:53] with let me know in the comments hi from
[15:55] Sweden Sweden is well known as one of if
[15:59] not probably the most Progressive
[16:02] country when it comes to the treatment
[16:04] of dogs crates are illegal here right so
[16:07] are prong collars and e-collars I don't
[16:09] like prawn collars or e-collars again
[16:11] because they approach behavior from the
[16:13] outside in rather than truly motivating
[16:15] a dog how to behave and the science
[16:17] indicates strong only that there are
[16:20] long-term welfare concerns when using
[16:23] those types of training methods so what
[16:25] are your thoughts on the fact that all
[16:27] three of these things are illegal is it
[16:29] equivalent interesting we use crates
[16:31] yeah I use crates I frequently show
[16:33] people how to use crates yet I am very
[16:36] much against the other things but
[16:37] they're all kind of put into that
[16:38] illegal category so I mean what's going
[16:40] on here am I behind the times maybe
[16:42] maybe crates are tomorrow's shock
[16:44] collars I think it is easier to neglect
[16:47] a dog when you have a dog proof box to
[16:49] put them in but are they inherently bad
[16:51] or neglectful it feels like there is no
[16:54] way to use a prong collar or an e-collar
[16:56] except as intended except as an aversive
[17:00] but when a crate is used as intended
[17:02] it's a safe box for your dog I suspect
[17:04] the reason it's illegal is because of
[17:05] misuse of the crate and putting dogs in
[17:07] there for an extended period of time and
[17:09] neglecting them because dogs are very
[17:11] active animals in general they need to
[17:13] be able to walk and run and they can't
[17:14] spend too many hours a day in a crate
[17:16] without their quality of life really
[17:18] being used the way that we use crates
[17:21] are kind of as a bedroom for a dog I
[17:23] always use an oversized crate so they
[17:25] have plenty of room I mean inertia right
[17:27] now the door is wide open well yeah you
[17:29] saw her let herself into that crate when
[17:32] she wanted comfort in fact because we
[17:34] let her know that she was not going to
[17:36] have to take a bath and she chose to go
[17:37] in there so I'd say in inertia's case
[17:39] yeah that's her happy place that's where
[17:41] she goes when she wants to feel
[17:42] comfortable yeah I mean I don't ever
[17:44] have to force her into a crate or
[17:45] anything like that crates are not good
[17:47] for all dogs or some dogs who just do
[17:49] not do well in a crate and for those
[17:51] dogs we shouldn't use crates the fact is
[17:53] that at least as I see it it's important
[17:56] to be able to control our dog's
[17:58] environment at times if someone's at the
[18:00] door for example and I don't want my dog
[18:03] jumping on them I can say go to your
[18:04] crate now I'm going to go answer the
[18:06] door so they're controlled for a few
[18:07] minutes until everything dies down and I
[18:09] can let them out so I don't fully
[18:11] understand the logic behind making crazy
[18:13] illegal I certainly personally this is
[18:16] an opinion wouldn't put them in the
[18:18] category of of choke chains or prong
[18:20] collars or electric collars I do think
[18:23] that those are more harmful than not for
[18:25] dogs especially since we know that
[18:28] positive reinforcement training has been
[18:30] shown time after time to give us
[18:33] fantastic results probably quicker
[18:36] results at least as fast that's what the
[18:38] science says do you guys know of any
[18:40] studies on crates out there I'm curious
[18:42] because I'm aware of a fair amount of
[18:44] science that indicates that aversive
[18:46] tools like prong and e-collars are not
[18:50] advisable in pretty much any
[18:51] circumstance with a dog but I'm not
[18:54] aware of science around crates and it
[18:56] could just be that I'm not aware of it
[18:57] so please let me know it seems as though
[18:59] the motivation behind the law is to
[19:01] increase the quality of life for dogs I
[19:04] can always appreciate that for those of
[19:05] you who live in countries where crates
[19:07] aren't common do you miss them do you
[19:08] agree with this idea that the crate
[19:11] should be illegal and if so why is it to
[19:13] make sure that the lowest common
[19:14] denominator are people who misuse them
[19:16] don't have that opportunity or is it
[19:18] because you think they there's something
[19:19] inherently wrong with using a crate to
[19:22] control your dog's environment what are
[19:24] your thoughts on the term owner and
[19:25] parent Etc I don't like the term owner
[19:28] and the reason I don't like the term
[19:29] owner as it relates to having a dog it
[19:31] doesn't really describe the relationship
[19:33] accurately I'm an owner of my car I'm an
[19:36] owner of the chair that I'm sitting on I
[19:38] own the computer but those aren't people
[19:40] yeah you know what I mean but these days
[19:43] I think we're starting to settle on the
[19:44] word Guardian I think that encapsulates
[19:47] what it means to have a dog so that's
[19:49] the term that I use I am my dog's
[19:51] Guardian how do you guys call yourselves
[19:54] as the caretakers of your pet do you
[19:56] have a word do you say parent someone
[19:58] says hey I'm my dog's owner it's not
[20:00] like I think oh gosh they're a terrible
[20:02] person or whatever that because that's
[20:03] what we say in society I just don't
[20:05] think it's the most accurate word we
[20:06] could use I mean legally technically I
[20:08] believe it's accurate as of now dogs are
[20:11] classified as property and not as
[20:13] persons although for those of you who
[20:15] are interested let's talk about
[20:16] personhood for dogs in the comments too
[20:18] tell me what you think interesting you
[20:19] don't know what I'm talking about maybe
[20:21] we'll make another video about it
[20:23] someday ahead of your time did you guys
[20:25] enjoy this video should I should I never
[20:26] make a video like this again or do you
[20:28] want to see more of these your feedback

[00:00] all right here we go it's going to say
[00:01] this out loud I witnessed an alien
[00:04] invasion the other day proof I will
[00:07] specimens
[00:08] what else can make that sound they come
[00:10] in many sizes and they come in peace too
[00:12] super tuber toys are made of
[00:14] indestructible alien space material you
[00:17] know you could put peanut butter or
[00:19] yogurt right in the center your dog
[00:21] would enjoy it it's dishwasher safe this
[00:23] is really ergonomic so your dog can get
[00:25] a grip while they lick the peanut butter
[00:27] out this is space food but it's also
[00:29] like a level one puzzle maybe a level
[00:32] two puzzle for Veronica look at this
[00:34] little fringy bit that's so shakeable
[00:36] it's that attention to detail this is
[00:39] superior technology this makes me happy
[00:41] just as a dog person look at how you
[00:44] have the elastic here to play tug with
[00:46] you have a squeaker with dense material
[00:50] surrounding it so a dog has to really
[00:52] Chomp to get the squeak both boxes come
[00:54] with lots of high quality treats and dog
[00:57] chews if you're a bark subscriber tell
[00:59] me if your dog likes the treat and if
[01:00] you're not go to barkbox.com dog
[01:02] training or superchewer.com dog training
[01:05] and get a free extra month when you sign
[01:06] up over our last several videos I've
[01:08] attempted to make the case that there is
[01:10] a legitimate crisis in the dog training
[01:12] industry right now and by that I mean
[01:13] that many dog trainers are advising that
[01:16] people use scientifically problematic
[01:18] methods now look we have frequently
[01:21] touched on how a lot of this has to do
[01:23] with the culture surrounding how we
[01:25] teach dogs and it may have more to do
[01:27] with that than it does the scientific
[01:29] soundness of the methods at least here
[01:31] in America the field of dog training is
[01:33] completely unregulated and with that
[01:35] it's a given that at least some
[01:37] percentage of those people are going to
[01:38] be using methods that are outdated Brie
[01:41] and I were doing a thought experiment
[01:42] recently trying to project the future of
[01:44] dog training and we realize that okay
[01:47] well we have a pass to look at we ended
[01:49] up down a rabbit hole of 400 years of
[01:52] animal and dog related legislation I
[01:54] promise this is going to be way more
[01:56] interesting than you might think it is
[01:58] we've selected five interesting and
[02:00] controversial events in history that all
[02:02] influence dogs rights today and we're
[02:04] also going to talk about why and how
[02:06] people resisted those changes every step
[02:09] of the way my hope is that we can put
[02:10] this in context with present day and see
[02:12] if we can make some sense of where all
[02:14] of this is going let's start with the
[02:15] 1600s and Renee Descartes he was a
[02:18] famous philosopher scientist and
[02:20] mathematician he invented analytical
[02:21] geometry and the concept of skepticism
[02:24] in the scientific method he did a lot of
[02:26] great things but like all of us he was
[02:28] also wrong about some things including
[02:30] the idea that animals were just machines
[02:32] without emotions and feelings Descartes
[02:34] famously thought that animals were
[02:36] simply an assembly of pieces like a
[02:39] watch or a clock this belief permeated
[02:41] in society it's common for people to
[02:43] this day to believe some variation of
[02:45] this but by the mid-1700s new ideas
[02:47] concerning dogs were starting to emerge
[02:50] in the 1750s there was a Swiss
[02:52] philosopher named Jean-Jacques Rousseau
[02:54] he argued that we are bound to do no
[02:56] harm to our fellow creatures not because
[02:58] they're rational but because they're
[03:00] sentient sentient just means they're
[03:02] able to feel feelings and just a few
[03:04] decades later in the 1780s that's where
[03:06] we're at now there was a philosopher
[03:08] named Jeremy Bentham he was advocating
[03:10] for the separation of church and state
[03:11] freedom of expression equal rights for
[03:14] women and the right to divorce the
[03:16] decriminalizing of homosexual acts and
[03:18] the rights of dogs he said the question
[03:21] is not can they reason nor can they talk
[03:24] but can they suffer I think virtually
[03:26] every single one of us watching that
[03:28] would agree with all of that right but
[03:30] in his time there were a lot of people
[03:32] that disagreed with these basic concepts
[03:34] so now we're only 200 years ago and we
[03:36] start to see the rise of animal
[03:37] protection organizations like the
[03:39] society for the prevention of cruelty to
[03:41] animals SPCA the first SPCA helped pass
[03:44] legislation that regulated The Carriage
[03:46] horse business at the time these horses
[03:48] were forced to work in all kinds of
[03:50] weather year round all without
[03:52] sufficient rest it was really common
[03:54] practice to beat their horses if they
[03:56] weren't able to work because they were
[03:57] just trying to make as much money as
[03:59] possible and horses were just viewed as
[04:01] property after the success with the
[04:02] carriage business they started to expand
[04:04] to include the rights of dogs and other
[04:06] animals horses and dogs
[04:08] it's always been horses and dogs so the
[04:11] SPCA forms in order to improve the
[04:13] treatment of animals but they still face
[04:15] resistance from Carriage drivers and
[04:17] others who believe that these animals
[04:19] were just property I think it's
[04:20] interesting too how dogs and horses and
[04:23] lots of animals have had to ride this
[04:25] line of are you property or do you have
[04:28] rights because even today like they have
[04:30] rights but they're still properties
[04:32] yeah it's gray exactly so around 50
[04:35] years later one of the most
[04:36] controversial issues of the day was
[04:39] vivise section that is the dissection of
[04:42] living animals and it was a dog who
[04:44] would play a major part in bringing this
[04:46] practice into the public eye
[04:48] physiologists at the time were often
[04:50] criticized for inhumane medical
[04:52] practices on animals and that included
[04:54] dissecting them without anesthesia often
[04:57] in front of audiences audiences of
[04:59] medical students right yeah in 1875 the
[05:02] British government recommended reforms
[05:04] including a total ban on experiments
[05:07] like this with dogs apparently there was
[05:09] a lot of resistance from the medical
[05:10] community at the time and let's remember
[05:12] we are a product of our time these
[05:15] people were just doing their jobs and
[05:17] doing what they thought was best these
[05:19] doctors and scientists genuinely believe
[05:20] that they were helping Humanity with
[05:22] these experiments and many of them were
[05:24] very important experiments and also
[05:26] remember during this time dogs were not
[05:28] considered complex creatures who
[05:30] deserved rights so a huge portion of the
[05:33] population didn't really see a problem
[05:34] with these inhumane experiments being
[05:36] performed because remember they didn't
[05:38] feel that dogs were capable of complex
[05:40] feelings anyway at least a lot of people
[05:42] so this clash between animal rights
[05:44] activists and members of the medical
[05:45] community really came to a head between
[05:47] 1903 and 1910. essentially the
[05:51] vivisection of a small brown
[05:53] terrier-like dog went viral and it
[05:55] incited large-scale protests and riots
[05:58] in the Streets of London it started when
[06:00] two women info infiltrated a lecture at
[06:02] the University of London and they
[06:04] witnessed these experiments on the dog
[06:05] firsthand when they told people what
[06:07] they saw widespread outrage across
[06:10] London so in 1906 they erect this bronze
[06:13] statue of the dog the plaque on the
[06:16] Statue listed statistics of vivisections
[06:18] and there was a quote that it ended with
[06:20] men and women of England how long shall
[06:23] these things be and let me give you an
[06:25] example of how people resisted this
[06:27] change this plaque outraged medical
[06:30] students in England it was so frequently
[06:33] vandalized that they had to install a
[06:34] 24-hour police guard to protect it from
[06:37] what they called anti-doggers this issue
[06:40] of dog welfare gets Tangled Up with the
[06:42] major issue of women's rights in 1907
[06:45] you've got hundreds of medical students
[06:47] marching through the streets of
[06:48] Trafalgar Square they're waving Effigies
[06:50] of the brown dog on sticks you've got
[06:53] dog rights activists women's rights
[06:55] activists these medical students 300
[06:57] police officers and it became known as
[07:00] the brown dog riots it was an all-out
[07:03] battle it's a really interesting moment
[07:05] in history because of all of the Nuance
[07:07] four years after the dog statue went up
[07:10] in 1910 they secretly the local
[07:13] officials took down the statue in the
[07:15] middle of the night because they were so
[07:17] tired of the controversy so this went on
[07:19] for years and years but a replacement
[07:20] statue was reinstalled in 1985. way to
[07:24] make it right in the 1930s big things
[07:26] were happening in the TV and film
[07:27] industry have you ever heard the phrase
[07:29] no animals were harmed in the making of
[07:31] This film at the time there were
[07:33] significant animal abuses on movie and
[07:35] TV sets like tripping horses with wires
[07:38] to make them fall or deliberately
[07:40] injuring or even killing some animals
[07:41] for scenes when the no animals were
[07:43] harmed disclaimer was introduced in the
[07:45] 30s there was wide resistance from
[07:46] producers and trainers and their
[07:48] arguments were that it would increase
[07:50] their costs and that it would limit
[07:52] their artistic and creative freedom but
[07:54] the public perception was changing and
[07:56] moviegoers started to boycott films
[07:58] where animals were known to be harmed in
[08:00] real reality though our interpretation
[08:02] of the phrase no animals were harmed has
[08:05] changed considerably since the 1930s
[08:07] back then if an animal were injured or
[08:09] killed between takes or if they were
[08:11] hurt in transport to a set for example a
[08:13] film could still easily receive the no
[08:16] animals were harmed stamp essentially
[08:18] what it meant back then originally was
[08:20] that no animals were intentionally hurt
[08:23] or injured for the camera but look how
[08:24] far we've come as a culture when you
[08:26] think about things like this today we
[08:27] have much higher expectations as to how
[08:29] animals should be treated throughout the
[08:31] entire process of filming these days
[08:34] there's significant outcry if an animal
[08:36] is harmed on set even today there are
[08:38] still a lot of controversial things that
[08:40] do happen when making movies even on the
[08:43] sets of films that ultimately receive
[08:45] the no animals were harmed stamp so next
[08:47] between 1965 and 1979
[08:51] something really significant happened
[08:54] this is my favorite part of this whole
[08:55] video this is this is great yeah I like
[08:59] maybe we should just make this part its
[09:01] own video the five freedoms of Animal
[09:03] Welfare were developed in the UK there
[09:06] are simple checklist of needs to make
[09:08] sure that an animal has a high quality
[09:10] of life what are these five magical
[09:12] fundamental aspects of Animal Welfare
[09:14] tell me if you agree with all of these
[09:16] by the way number one freedom from
[09:18] hunger and thirst I think that one
[09:19] speaks for itself number two freedom
[09:22] from discomfort by providing an
[09:23] appropriate environment including
[09:24] shelter and a comfortable resting area
[09:28] so that's like no chained up dogs
[09:29] outside number three freedom from pain
[09:32] injury or disease number four freedom to
[09:35] express most normal behavior and number
[09:38] five Freedom From Fear and distress by
[09:40] ensuring conditions and treatment which
[09:42] avoid mental suffering I think it should
[09:45] be a given that dog trainers are bound
[09:47] by this very common sense criteria we
[09:49] are obligated to make sure these
[09:51] fundamental needs are met when we have
[09:52] dogs in our custody so let's look at how
[09:54] we can use these five guidelines in
[09:56] terms of training our own dogs I'd like
[09:58] to zoom in on number three four and five
[10:00] so let's look at number three freedom
[10:02] from pain injury or disease we can make
[10:04] a reasonable case that at the very least
[10:06] choke prong and electric collars are
[10:09] walking right up to that line of causing
[10:12] pain remember they appear to work
[10:14] because they cause discomfort and that's
[10:16] when used as directed basically what I'm
[10:19] saying is even if it is only discomfort
[10:21] and it isn't painful it's unnecessarily
[10:24] approaching pain and we should be going
[10:27] the other direction and while I know
[10:29] that proponents of using these tools
[10:31] will say the ends justify the means this
[10:33] is still highly problematic given what
[10:35] we know and the Alternatives available
[10:37] number four the freedom to express
[10:39] normal behavior let's talk about this
[10:42] this is really about a dog's right to be
[10:44] a dog but when we use punishment to
[10:46] completely suppress behaviors that come
[10:48] naturally to dogs things like barking
[10:50] jumping chewing having tons of extra
[10:53] energy to burn we're potentially harming
[10:55] our dog's quality of life unnecessarily
[10:57] that doesn't mean we let them do what
[10:58] they want but it's important to let dogs
[11:00] be able to practice those behaviors in
[11:03] ways that we find acceptable too and in
[11:05] all honesty we see this very often in
[11:08] the dog training industry the use of
[11:09] these punishing Tools in order to
[11:11] suppress behaviors like this and number
[11:13] five Freedom From Fear and distress I
[11:16] think this is one of the more obvious
[11:17] ones because we know that aversive
[11:20] methods with all animals including dogs
[11:22] including people and every other animal
[11:24] have been shown to potentially
[11:26] contribute to stress and fear at the
[11:27] very very least aversive training
[11:29] methods come very close to crossing the
[11:32] line of three of these five and
[11:35] objectively sometimes they definitely do
[11:37] I get it I know a lot of you are
[11:39] wondering why are you harping on this so
[11:41] much Zach I hear you but remember right
[11:44] now even though many dog trainers are
[11:46] very divided on this issue there is a
[11:48] scientific consensus that aversives are
[11:50] not necessary as part of a dog training
[11:52] or behavior modification plan in
[11:54] addition to that they're potentially
[11:55] detrimental to a dog's welfare and
[11:57] should not be used in training in spite
[12:00] of the divide and dog training none of
[12:02] us can deny the fact that there's been
[12:04] so much progress in the treatment of
[12:06] dogs today at least 35 countries
[12:08] recognize the sentience of animals
[12:10] remember that's the ability to feel and
[12:12] experience emotions do you guys think
[12:14] dogs have sentience tell me and that
[12:15] would be a good poll question tell me in
[12:17] the comments though do dogs have
[12:19] sentience in your view that would be
[12:21] eye-opening so what are things looking
[12:23] like a present day there are many issues
[12:25] that are still being debated around the
[12:27] world World in relation to dogs for
[12:30] example ear and tail cropping greyhound
[12:32] racing dog chaining that's just chaining
[12:35] dogs up I guess in certain situations
[12:37] outside without shelter some aspects of
[12:39] dog breeding are quite controversial and
[12:41] of course aversive dog training methods
[12:43] which is the reason I'm chiming in on
[12:46] this issue what do you guys think dog
[12:47] training is going to look like in 100
[12:48] years in 400 years we should all
[12:50] acknowledge that progress is not
[12:52] guaranteed I mean people have gone up
[12:55] and down on these issues lots of times
[12:57] throughout the eons if history is an
[13:00] indicator things are not likely to stay
[13:02] as they are but what will they be like
[13:04] what do you think the nearest and
[13:06] biggest change is that's on the horizon
[13:08] in dog training do you think we're
[13:10] likely to see a lot of change or do you
[13:12] think we've got it figured out and where
[13:14] we are is where we should stay we've
[13:16] come a long way in the understanding of
[13:18] dogs and their place in our society but
[13:20] we still face the challenge of aligning
[13:22] our cultural beliefs and our ethics with
[13:24] our scientific understanding of how we
[13:27] should treat dogs at least in dog

[00:02] looking at people who train dogs in
[00:03] public and just trying to see what I can
[00:06] learn from them look at these guys we
[00:08] see that they've got a long lead on
[00:09] their dog look at that look at the rate
[00:11] of reinforcement there rewarding
[00:14] duration this person knows what they're
[00:15] doing right here
[00:17] get that dog in public by giving the
[00:19] treats over and over like that a lot of
[00:21] people think oh you're feeding your dog
[00:22] too much but really you're just
[00:24] communicating hey staying there is what
[00:26] equals rewards like this this person is
[00:29] training like a pro trainer right here
[00:30] okay so he's going for a really nice
[00:32] long duration here
[00:34] for a release I bet we can look for it
[00:36] let's see if he does it there you go and
[00:37] there's the release and there's the
[00:38] reward with the ball nice work is this a
[00:41] new series idea going in public and

[00:00] you know what I think has contributed to
[00:02] this dog training crisis with social
[00:04] media just being dominated by choke
[00:06] chain prong collar and electric collar
[00:07] trainers what it's a hypothesis I've
[00:09] been playing with during covid everyone
[00:11] went out and got a dog and we all know
[00:13] that we didn't have that much notice
[00:14] that the world was going to shut down at
[00:16] the beginning we just thought it was
[00:17] going to be shut down for three months
[00:18] or something tops or a couple of weeks
[00:20] even and people ran out and impulsively
[00:22] it seems got dogs and I think some of
[00:25] them were myopic or short-sighted and
[00:28] are facing behavior problems now because
[00:30] maybe they didn't put in the time it
[00:32] took to train the dogs and they're
[00:34] looking for these desperate Quick Fix
[00:35] methods that are everywhere on social
[00:38] media and that's what I think might be
[00:40] contributing what do you guys think do
[00:42] you guys think there's any truth to that
[00:44] because pre-covered it wasn't like this
[00:46] more people were willing to put in the
[00:48] time with their dogs

[00:00] where's the best place to start off
[00:01] leash training if you don't have a
[00:03] fenced yard or if it's not private I
[00:06] like to seek out janky fenced baseball
[00:10] fields personally places where it's not
[00:13] too well kept because you're probably
[00:14] going to get kicked out of those places
[00:15] in the United States it depends where
[00:17] you are like if you're in the more rural
[00:18] areas they're far more tolerant but I
[00:20] like public Sports Fields so I would
[00:22] very strongly suggest finding a fenced
[00:24] environment and using a 20-foot lead
[00:27] simultaneously at least a 20 or 30 or
[00:30] 50. that double redundancy is really
[00:33] going to keep mistakes from happening in
[00:36] fact sometimes in semi-fenced areas when
[00:39] you get to a certain point in your
[00:40] training and I demonstrated this in my
[00:41] videos I will work against a single
[00:44] fence so if I know everything in front
[00:46] of me is blocked off and I can kind of
[00:49] greed the dog pretty well and look into
[00:50] their eyes like are they thinking about
[00:52] Dart and right or left then I can be one
[00:53] step ahead of them get their attention
[00:55] on me quickly again this is providing
[00:57] you've gotten to a certain point your
[00:58] dog training

Settle training breakthrough! Teaching Chop the wild Alaskan rescue dog to relax inside a house for the first time! Full episode here: https://youtu.be/JNdHxS4XH6w

TRANSCRIPTION:

[00:01] since inertia riled up chop a bit I'm
[00:03] going to put his leash back on for just
[00:05] a few minutes to help him get back into
[00:07] that stationary calm state of mind and
[00:10] after a couple of minutes chop seems to
[00:11] be back in a more settled mindset so off
[00:14] comes the leash again I mean there's no
[00:16] shortcut around this when you're really
[00:18] trying to teach a dog to relax you have
[00:20] to wait for them to genuinely relax and
[00:23] be there to reinforce it and I
[00:25] understand that usually when you want
[00:27] your dog to be calm it's because they're
[00:29] not being calm so it's not realistic at
[00:32] first to get them to just shift from
[00:34] that excited mindset to a relaxed

[00:00] remember that dog training is not about
[00:02] the physical positions a dog is in that
[00:04] is old school thinking that's the
[00:07] problem is we are willing to get a dog
[00:08] in a physical position regardless of
[00:10] what's going on up here in their mind
[00:12] and how they feel emotionally if we
[00:14] manage their emotions first getting them
[00:17] into said physical positions or to do
[00:19] tricks or catch frisbees or come when
[00:21] called and stay walk on a leash nicely
[00:24] all of that comes much easier when your
[00:26] dog is in an optimistic frame of mind as
[00:28] it would you dogs and humans are not as
[00:30] different as many will have you believe
[00:32] while they are a different species we
[00:34] are both mammals our brains behave
[00:36] similarly there's a lot of interesting
[00:38] data even at the neuronal level we
[00:41] understand how dogs learn it just
[00:44] happens that being kind to our dogs is
[00:46] more effective you don't have to do it
[00:48] out of obligation but you will get
[00:50] better results at least that is what the

Description:
In this video, we discuss the controversial topic of whether it's bad to exercise high-energy dogs and address some common arguments presented by balanced dog trainers. We explore the belief that relying on exercise to manage a dog's mental and physical state can lead to an unsustainable situation and potential adverse effects on the dog's well-being. We also delve into the prevalent attitudes in certain dog training cultures that emphasize strict control over dogs and challenge the notion that dogs need to be strictly controlled to achieve calmness.

We advocate for a more compassionate and empathetic approach towards training, focusing on the importance of physical and mental stimulation for a dog's well-being. Exercise not only promotes the release of brain chemicals such as endorphins, serotonin, dopamine, and oxytocin, but it also contributes to a longer, healthier life by maintaining a healthy weight, strengthening bones, joints, and muscles, and reducing the risk of diseases and health problems.

Furthermore, we highlight the significance of exercise and play as bonding opportunities, creating a strong relationship between dogs and their owners that makes training and communication more effective. We acknowledge the individual differences in dogs, emphasizing the need for tailored exercise routines and the importance of providing physical and mental outlets for high-energy dogs to encourage natural behavior in acceptable ways.

While recognizing the need for moderation in exercise to prevent over-exercising and ensure adequate rest and recovery time, we also discuss the additional benefits of exercise, such as decreasing boredom and destructive behavior, building confidence, improving socialization, and enhancing mental and problem-solving skills. Join us in this informative and thought-provoking discussion to better understand the role of exercise in a dog's life and how it impacts their overall well-being and training success.

[00:00] I must weigh in on this debate that's
[00:02] going around so the latest version of
[00:04] the don't exercise your dog too much or
[00:07] they will become too athletic and you
[00:09] won't be able to keep up with their
[00:10] needs and desires thing is back I'm Zach
[00:13] George I train dogs I can follow for
[00:15] more it seems that many dog training
[00:16] professionals are of the mind that
[00:19] exercising a dog frequently is just
[00:22] going to encourage them to have more and
[00:23] more stamina and that this ultimately
[00:26] just keeps going and it's unsustainable
[00:28] so if you're an average person you're
[00:30] making your job more difficult by
[00:33] creating an In-Shape dog how do you guys
[00:35] feel about this I think everyone has a
[00:37] measure of what a trained dog is some
[00:39] people are going to prioritize a dog's
[00:41] obedience and physical response over the
[00:43] dog's feelings and mental well-being and
[00:46] I think that's kind of what's always
[00:47] rubbed me a little bit wrong about this
[00:50] type of advice in that it favors the
[00:53] humans sometimes to an unreasonable
[00:55] degree if we're viewing training our
[00:57] dogs as a true partnership we have to
[00:59] consider the those needs now I'm not
[01:01] saying our dog shouldn't know how to
[01:02] settle down and chill out and relax on
[01:04] request but it's really just this
[01:06] underlying way of looking at this issue
[01:08] that really deserves consideration let's
[01:10] do a thought experiment let's say we've
[01:12] got a moderately active pretty energetic
[01:14] dog and let's say we only exercise them
[01:18] twice a week when four might be better
[01:20] suited for this dog you really have two
[01:22] major options and obviously there's a
[01:24] spectrum between those two options on
[01:26] one end you could focus on suppressing
[01:27] that energy on the other end you could
[01:30] focus on giving your dog a natural and
[01:32] acceptable way to dispense of that
[01:35] energy you see exercise is not just
[01:38] about tiring Dogs Out humans can relate
[01:40] with this the endorphins that are
[01:42] released during exercise can be very
[01:44] beneficial in many ways serotonin
[01:46] dopamine and oxytocin all are very
[01:48] beneficial for both learning and bonding
[01:51] so if our dogs are happy and they're
[01:53] calmer post-exercise that means a you
[01:56] satisfied them and B you have set them
[01:59] up for are the most productive training
[02:02] session of their life a freshly
[02:04] exercised dog is a way that I try to
[02:07] make dog training easier for myself when
[02:09] I have a hyperactive dog an exercise dog
[02:11] is less likely to be destructive or
[02:13] bored one of the benefits I've enjoyed
[02:15] of exercise is you get increased
[02:17] socialization opportunities so when
[02:19] you're playing fetch in new places your
[02:21] dog gets to experience new places when
[02:23] in that Pleasant state of mind and even
[02:26] post-exercise in that calm state of mind
[02:28] which allows them to absorb new
[02:31] environments a lot more efficiently
[02:33] sometimes people are skeptical that
[02:35] positive dog trainers don't work with
[02:37] high drive dogs when really high drive
[02:39] dogs are a dream for positive
[02:41] reinforcement trainers why do you think
[02:43] so many people get high drive dogs for
[02:45] Dog Sports because they're the easiest
[02:47] to train which makes it an extra red
[02:50] flag if people need to use aversive dog
[02:52] training techniques with those highly
[02:54] motivated dogs I'm not saying that we
[02:56] all need to be perfect when it comes to
[02:58] making sure that our dogs get that
[03:00] regular physical activity what we should
[03:02] always keep in mind the optimal route I
[03:04] think virtually everyone with a dog is
[03:06] willing to strive and give their dog
[03:07] some time and attention to optimize that
[03:10] dog's life and so the message of 2023 in
[03:12] dog training so far has been are we
[03:15] considering the dog's emotional state
[03:16] enough when we're setting them up to
[03:18] learn new things but all dogs regardless
[03:20] of their condition after significant
[03:22] physical activity require recovery time
[03:24] so every day isn't usually necessary
[03:27] even for High Drive dogs so what I'm
[03:29] saying is an hour of exercise four days
[03:32] a week is probably going to be good for
[03:35] a whole lot of dogs there will be some
[03:37] that require a little more than that and
[03:39] some don't require anywhere near that
[03:41] much and it's definitely possible to
[03:43] over exercise a dog and cause issues
[03:45] later in their life so it is important
[03:46] for us to be somewhat conservative and
[03:49] take precautions when we're exercising
[03:50] our dogs but if you strike that optimal
[03:52] amount of activity there's a lot of
[03:54] benefits your dog's probably going to
[03:56] have a healthy weight they're probably
[03:57] going to have healthy muscles and bones
[03:59] and Joints a dog who's in shape just
[04:01] like people are less likely to have
[04:03] long-term health problems I think these
[04:05] are pretty significant issues to
[04:07] consider before we advise that people
[04:09] not exercise an energetic dog anyway my
[04:13] advice would just be to exercise your
[04:14] dogs in proportion to their needs a lot
[04:17] of dogs are content with a 15-minute
[04:19] walk or less so on the Spectrum where do
[04:21] you guys fall on this do you go out of
[04:23] your way to try and provide adequate
[04:25] exercise for your dog one of the best
[04:27] ways to make sure you're getting the
[04:28] most out of your dogs exercise and their
[04:30] training is to make sure you're giving
[04:32] them a really good food completely
[04:33] Frozen they arrive like this so you put
[04:35] them in your freezer and Nom Nom makes
[04:37] this fresh food that's optimized
[04:39] specifically for your dog it's all
[04:40] pre-portioned and ready to go and even
[04:42] if you don't want to commit to feeding
[04:43] it full time you can integrate it into
[04:45] your dog's regular diet so that they get
[04:47] some fresh food Nom Nom is going to give
[04:48] you half off a two-week trial so that
[04:51] you can really try this food and see if
[04:53] it's for your dog you have to use my
[04:54] special link trinom.com Zach I'll have a
[04:58] link in the description to don't resist
[05:00] exercise if your dog doesn't know how to
[05:02] do a polished game of fetch you can see
[05:04] my YouTube channel just search how to
[05:06] train dog to fetch on YouTube I'm sure a
[05:07] good video will come up

[00:00] inertia just is infatuated by this dog
[00:03] she really likes to take a look at him
[00:04] every time we come out I want to test
[00:06] her in this situation it's a controlled
[00:08] circumstance she's on a long lead
[00:10] yes
[00:12] why did I say yes there because she was
[00:14] reacting appropriately she was looking
[00:15] but she was still being a good dog even
[00:18] if they're looking at the dog sometimes
[00:21] especially if you're fairly far along in
[00:24] the reactivity training process it can
[00:26] be a good idea to say yes I appreciate
[00:28] that you're looking at the dog and not
[00:30] lunging and barking in a situation like
[00:32] that I just really want to make sure
[00:33] that inertia is under control so I'm
[00:36] going to put her into a precautionary
[00:38] heel just to make sure she's right there
[00:40] we're not using the leash as a
[00:42] communication tool we're using it as a
[00:44] management solution and as a safety net
[00:47] there's no need to provide a harsh
[00:48] correction you can stop the behavior by
[00:50] managing and that's step one step two is
[00:53] just to train your dog what you want
[00:54] them to do if you like tips like this

TRANSCRIPTION:

[00:00] here's another example of where inertia
[00:01] used to have a hard time this is another
[00:03] barking dog that catches a nurse's
[00:06] attention when inertia sees a dog
[00:08] actually trying to engage her and bark
[00:10] at her she gets very curious by that and
[00:12] in the past she would bark very heavily
[00:14] in return but one of the many things
[00:16] that's been very helpful is to
[00:17] acknowledge her good behavior before one
[00:19] of those events takes place where she
[00:21] starts barking uncontrollably even if
[00:24] she's looking at the dog and that might
[00:26] seem counter-intuitive but in reality
[00:28] we're saying I don't mind you looking at
[00:30] the dog but I like the fact that you
[00:32] didn't go over threshold Yes again
[00:35] marking the fact that she's remaining
[00:37] and keeping herself under a threshold
[00:39] that's what the point of that is I still
[00:40] continue to reinforce her when she
[00:42] behaves well and I continue to test her
[00:44] no tension was needed on the leash I
[00:46] think that's worth mentioning it really
[00:48] is just like teaching a child honestly
[00:49] there are more similarities than there
[00:51] are not at least as it relates to
[00:53] teaching and learning

[00:00] have you ever felt impatient when
[00:01] training your dog it's so easy to get
[00:03] caught up in wanting instant results
[00:05] especially when your dog can be out of
[00:08] hand sometimes but we all know that real
[00:10] change takes time and consistency in
[00:12] everything that we do in life and dog
[00:14] training is no exception imagine for
[00:16] example if you were learning to play an
[00:17] instrument you wouldn't expect to master
[00:19] it overnight right but I'm sure you
[00:20] would understand that becoming
[00:22] proficient to training your dog won't
[00:23] happen overnight when we're training our
[00:25] dogs remember to be kind patient and
[00:27] celebrate small victories there's a
[00:29] reason I talk about this a lot that's
[00:31] because it's the fastest path to getting
[00:33] a well-behaved dog it's in these little
[00:36] moments that we build trust and that is
[00:38] what makes the difference the next time
[00:39] you're working with your dog take a deep
[00:41] breath enjoy the journey and cherish the
[00:43] progress you're making together it is in
[00:45] these moments that we truly bond with
[00:47] our dogs and isn't that the most
[00:48] rewarding part of it all give me any
[00:50] example at all of something small that
[00:52] your dog has achieved recently if you
[00:54] can tell me how that small victory led
[00:55] to something big in your dog training I
[00:57] think that would be helpful to everyone

Rewarding your dog for good behavior, starting calm during training sessions, and making sure to be a source of comfort and safety to your dog when they’re unsure are just a few super simple ways to build trust with your dog, which will strengthen your relationship, which will improve your dog training overall!

Trust is key in creating a strong bond between you and your dog, and it can significantly impact your training experience. By cultivating trust, you can help your dog become more receptive to your guidance, overcome fears, and develop new skills.

Dog training, trust, and building a deep connection are essential for a happy and harmonious relationship with your furry friend. We'll discuss the importance of being patient, consistent, and understanding in your interactions with your dog. Positive reinforcement, such as rewarding and praising good behavior, can help establish trust and improve your dog's overall behavior.

Staying calm and patient during training sessions is crucial for building trust with your dog. By maintaining a calm demeanor, you create a positive learning environment and encourage your dog to focus on the task at hand. Being a source of comfort and safety for your dog strengthens your bond and helps your dog feel secure in your presence.

Helping your dog overcome fears and challenges is another powerful way to build trust. In the video, we highlight the example of a dog's first bath. When a dog trusts their person, they are more willing to face their fears and calmly accept unfamiliar sensations, like water and soap. By fostering trust, you can guide your dog through new experiences with confidence and ease.

Remember that trust is essential for a successful and fulfilling dog training experience. By incorporating these 5 trust-building techniques, you can deepen your bond with your dog and see the incredible impact it can have on their learning and development.

[00:00] can you remember a moment when you felt
[00:02] a deep sense of trust with your dog oh
[00:04] my gosh oh my gosh when our dogs trust
[00:07] us they're more likely to listen and
[00:09] respond positively to our guidance we
[00:11] can cultivate trust by being consistent
[00:13] patient and understanding in our
[00:15] interactions for example we can reward
[00:17] and praise our dog for good behavior we
[00:19] can stay calm and patient during
[00:21] training sessions and we can be a source
[00:23] of comfort and safety for our dogs one
[00:25] powerful example of trust is when a dog
[00:27] is facing a new or challenging situation
[00:29] like getting their first bath if they
[00:31] trust their person they'll be more
[00:32] willing to face their fears and calmly
[00:34] accept the unfamiliar sensation of water

[00:02] have Veronica on a long lead in these

[00:05] don't let any dogs of mine off leave and
[00:08] a completely uncontrolled situation
[00:10] under the age of two and she's only one
[00:12] she still has a lot of proofing to go
[00:14] and in training sessions like this
[00:15] Veronica does a really good job of
[00:17] staying nearby there's rarely tension on
[00:20] the leash which means as far as she's
[00:22] concerned the leash isn't even necessary
[00:24] but I still want to see many more
[00:25] examples of that leash not being
[00:27] necessary even in new and exciting
[00:29] environments before I'm going to trust
[00:30] Veronica to be totally off leash setting

What is your dog’s personality like?

Understanding your dog’s personality can truly make a world of difference when training them! 

Quick story about our own dogs that really shows the power of their personalities: 

When we first brought Veronica home, she seemed really nervous of Inertia. 

She started to get confident… but then suddenly she got nervous and let out a squeal 😱

It was a reset moment for both of them.

Instead of pushing Veronica, Bree and I focused on understanding her unique personality

We allowed Veronica to do her own thing and we asked Inertia to give her space… and it turned out pretty great for them! 

Veronica overcame her fear and has formed a really strong bond with Inertia. 

And you know what? Her confidence also grew! Which makes our training sessions more successful!

Remember to take the time to understand your dog’s individual personality. It can really change the game when it comes to training!

[00:00] this is a really good application of
[00:02] heel that's where they stay to one side
[00:04] of you I've taught inertia both a left
[00:06] heel and a right heel one of the reasons
[00:08] I teach feel on both sides is that I
[00:10] want inertia to be able to stay between
[00:13] me and the road and not pull anything
[00:15] crazy because she gets startled by a car
[00:17] I used right heel coming here and I'll
[00:19] be using left heel going back you can
[00:22] see a car way in the distance
[00:23] approaching you don't have room to pull
[00:25] over if your dog starts freaking out
[00:27] because a car passes at kind of close
[00:29] range that's not what we want it almost
[00:31] kind of reminds me of Stand By Me when
[00:33] they had to get across the railroad
[00:34] track Bridge it really pays off that
[00:36] we've been working on heel at various
[00:38] speeds as well that way I could minimize
[00:40] our time being vulnerable on the bridge
[00:42] bridges are certainly an oddity to many
[00:44] dogs
[00:45] so encountering them is unusual it would

[00:00] it's not reasonable to just expect dogs
[00:02] to be good because you have the
[00:04] expectation that they should dogs are
[00:06] complex animals that need to understand
[00:07] this world and make sense of it that's
[00:10] where desensitization comes in we
[00:12] desensitize our dogs by gradually
[00:14] exposing them to things and increasing
[00:16] the intensity or the duration of that
[00:18] exposure over time as they are more
[00:20] comfortable with it where we really have
[00:22] a strong emphasis on reinforcing those
[00:24] calm moments an example of desensitizing
[00:27] your dog let's say your dog was scared
[00:29] of young children you might start by
[00:31] giving them some general exposure to
[00:33] older children who don't behave as
[00:35] erratically and giving your dog space
[00:37] and of course advocating for your dog to
[00:39] make sure they don't become overwhelmed
[00:41] during any interactions with kids but
[00:43] the more exposure your dog gets and the
[00:45] more you go out of your way to prevent
[00:46] any undesirable interactions the more
[00:49] likely it is that your dog's going to
[00:50] become accepting of young children I'm
[00:52] going to have a video that goes over
[00:53] this in more detail pinned in the
[00:55] comments

[00:12] little heartfelt communication
[00:15] I'm not going to make her wait for an
[00:16] eternity right there I'm going to pick
[00:18] it up and give it to her and then if she
[00:20] okay and no tension on a leash
[00:24] only because I know because I know
[00:25] that's the instinct to pull them away
[00:27] you should have faith in your
[00:28] communication you should trust that your
[00:30] dog really will know what you mean if
[00:34] you just take a few minutes to
[00:35] communicate with us you want to learn

[00:08] offer choices to your dog allow them to
[00:11] make decisions whether it's choosing a
[00:12] specific toy to play with or to go in a
[00:14] specific Direction on a walk but still
[00:16] put limits like jumping on Strangers or
[00:18] chewing up furniture that way your dog

[00:47] important that we allow our dogs to
[00:49] express themselves and be who they are
[00:51] and on the other hand it's important
[00:52] that we show them the rules and
[00:54] boundaries we expect from them like and

[00:00] electric collars are scheduled to be
[00:01] banned in England starting February
[00:03] 2024. this is a pretty big deal for the
[00:06] past week or so I've been really quiet
[00:07] just listening to the dog training
[00:09] community and their reaction to all of
[00:10] this some people myself included argue
[00:12] that using pain-free dog training
[00:14] methods can lead to better outcomes for
[00:15] dogs everywhere but others are concerned
[00:17] about controlling their dogs
[00:18] particularly around livestock without
[00:20] the use of electric collars the fact is
[00:22] that there is a scientific consensus
[00:24] that electric collars can increase
[00:25] aggression as well as cause other
[00:27] potential negative side effects but in
[00:29] spite of this some dog trainers continue
[00:31] to recommend that the public use these
[00:33] tools in certain situations and even
[00:35] these dog trainers still have a
[00:37] tremendous amount of value because I
[00:38] know that their experience and
[00:40] understanding of dogs goes Way Beyond
[00:42] just the simple use of electric collars
[00:44] and I think that those of us who do
[00:45] train without the use of aversive dog
[00:47] training methods need to be more
[00:49] available than ever so that we can help
[00:50] people cross over and learn alternative
[00:52] less risky ways to train numerous
[00:54] incredible Pioneers in our industry have
[00:56] been educating and advocating for
[00:58] advancements like this share your

[00:00] I'm really glad you're finding
[00:02] screensaver training helpful for those
[00:03] of you that don't know what do I mean by
[00:05] screensaver training screensaver
[00:07] training is essentially where we give
[00:09] our dogs exposure to various stimuli at
[00:12] distances that they're comfortable with
[00:14] over a relatively prolonged period of
[00:17] time so think about a computer monitor
[00:18] with just a screen saver on happening in
[00:21] the background so that our dogs can
[00:23] really get used to various things that's
[00:25] the whole goal of screensaver training
[00:27] it's a term that I coined uh it
[00:32] essentially means desensitizing your dog
[00:33] to things that cause them to either
[00:38] behave excitedly or cause them to be a
[00:40] bit nervous on terms that they're
[00:43] comfortable with over time

[00:00] so this commenter is basically saying
[00:02] that first thing in the morning when
[00:03] they go to let their dog out that their
[00:05] dog just goes crazy no matter what they
[00:08] do they just can't seem to get control
[00:10] of their dog or get them to focus or
[00:11] paying attention and their dog is just
[00:13] interested in everything I'm going to be
[00:15] really quick here but number one slow
[00:17] things down a little bit these energetic
[00:19] dogs need you to go in slow motion I
[00:22] know it seems counter-intuitive but
[00:23] start by teaching your dog how to stay
[00:25] at the doorway during a dedicated
[00:27] practice session in other words don't
[00:28] wait until it's time to go outside to do
[00:31] this training be sure you're using a
[00:32] harness it's much safer for a dog that's
[00:34] a little crazy on leash over the next
[00:36] several weeks even months you want to
[00:38] adopt a plan to desensitize your dog to
[00:41] these things that get him really excited
[00:43] I would also recommend that you do
[00:44] exercise early in the day of course
[00:46] you're not going to fix this issue
[00:47] immediately but if you're playing fetch
[00:50] early in the day you'll probably find or
[00:52] before your training sessions I should
[00:53] say you'll probably find that your
[00:54] training sessions go a lot easier great
[00:56] question hope this helps and if you guys
[00:58] have any questions let me know

[00:37] science behind giving your dog the exact
[00:39] nutritional needs that is really hard to
[00:41] replicate if you don't know exactly what
[00:43] you're doing it's one of the reasons I
[00:44] find great value with Nom Nom it's not
[00:47] like their food is just chicken beef and
[00:48] some vegetables their nutritionists have
[00:50] carefully balanced each meal and made
[00:52] sure to add everything that dogs need
[00:55] which is different than what people need
[00:57] ideally with all of the beneficial
[00:59] ingredients in nom nom sweet your dog
[01:00] will be too busy enjoying their meal to
[01:02] bar everyone in our audience can get
[01:04] half off a two-week Supply with my
[01:07] special link I'll have it in the
[01:08] description trynom.com Zach now let's
[01:11] get back to discussing all the other
[01:13] things you can do about that barking to
[01:15] achieve long-term success in barking
[01:17] issues it's vital that we address the
[01:19] underlying cause rather than just the
[01:21] symptom which is the Barking by
[01:22] comprehending the reasons behind your
[01:24] dogs barking you can help your dog feel
[01:25] more comfortable and more secure barking
[01:27] is a natural way for dogs to express
[01:29] their emotions and to communicate with
[01:31] humans and other dogs here's a few
[01:33] common reasons that dogs tend to bark
[01:35] alerting like signaling that people are
[01:37] at the door or unfamiliar noises for
[01:39] example this is our win When someone
[01:41] knocks at the door our wind goes crazy
[01:43] runs to the door she lunges she wants to
[01:46] see what's going on it's really
[01:47] difficult to get her under control
[01:49] because she's just so focused on what's
[01:51] going on another type of barking is
[01:53] attention seeking barking or boredom
[01:55] barking Behavior this is Calliope why do
[01:58] you think she's barking right now I
[02:00] think she really wants our attention she
[02:02] typically marks when she wants something
[02:03] she also barks when she wants our
[02:05] attention um you know especially if
[02:07] we're doing something cooking dinner
[02:09] putting up the dishes it sounds like she
[02:11] barks under all possible search stances
[02:13] pretty much some dogs bark because of
[02:15] fear or anxiety it might be reacting to
[02:17] unfamiliar situations like fireworks or
[02:19] storms or new people or new places so
[02:21] whenever a new person walks in the house
[02:23] expecting a man she's more apprehensive
[02:25] as she gets scared she barks her hair
[02:28] raises up I was over here a few days ago
[02:30] and I could see she was really
[02:31] uncomfortable in that presence I mean
[02:33] when I stood up for example she was
[02:35] really thrown off by that and if your
[02:36] dog barks excessively when they're alone
[02:38] that might be a manifestation of
[02:40] separation anxiety inertia wanting to be
[02:43] near me when I go out this is normal for
[02:45] puppies I mean they love being near us
[02:47] some dogs seem to bark because of a
[02:49] territorial issue that's where
[02:50] unfamiliar people or things enter their
[02:53] sphere he loves loves people when I met
[02:56] him a couple of days ago I came over
[02:57] here to meet you guys and he went crazy
[02:59] when he saw me out there he was like who
[03:01] are you what are you doing over here
[03:02] barking can also be a social behavior
[03:04] exhibited amongst dogs so dogs can bark
[03:07] in response to other dogs barking dogs
[03:09] can bark out of frustration sometimes I
[03:11] mean think about it some sometimes when
[03:13] people are frustrated they vocalize so
[03:15] do dogs so those are the most common
[03:17] reasons that dogs bark that I can think
[03:19] of but how do you decide which of those
[03:21] reasons applies to your dog or is it a
[03:24] combination or more than one of those
[03:26] reasons the best way to do this is to
[03:28] observe the dog's Behavior their body
[03:30] language and the context in which
[03:31] they're barking that'll help you
[03:33] identify the underlying cause you can
[03:35] see her tail in between her legs and her
[03:37] ears back as she barked indicating that
[03:39] she just really wasn't comfortable see
[03:40] how her tail is waxed that's more of a
[03:43] nervous tail lagging kind of waving back
[03:46] and forth rather than wagging vigorously
[03:48] looking at her pylo erection that's when
[03:50] their hair stands up on the back of
[03:52] their neck and it seems to have gone
[03:53] down that's good I mean she's a little
[03:54] bit more comfortable consider factors
[03:56] such as the time of day specific
[03:58] triggers and the duration and the
[04:00] intensity of The Barking paying
[04:02] attention to these details are going to
[04:03] give you a lot of valuable insight into
[04:05] your dog's needs that's going to help
[04:07] you address this issue far more
[04:09] effectively now you can also look at
[04:10] things like their specific vocal tones
[04:12] which might be able to clue you in to
[04:14] specific messages that your dog is
[04:16] trying to exhibit of course every dog is
[04:18] different you know your dog best for
[04:20] example a low growl might signal a
[04:23] warning or a Potential Threat
[04:26] you heard that growl right there
[04:27] oftentimes when a dog growls we have
[04:30] this Association that oh that means that
[04:31] they're aggressive or they're about to
[04:33] do something mean actually growling is a
[04:35] pretty good thing largely speaking
[04:37] because of the dog being very open about
[04:39] their emotions and expressing how they
[04:42] feel high-pitched Yelps or wines could
[04:44] indicate pain fear or distress
[04:46] continuous or rapid high-pitched Sparks
[04:48] oh boy off guard there might signify
[04:51] alertness excitement urgency or even
[04:53] fear howling that can occur for several
[04:55] reasons including loneliness
[04:57] communication or responding to certain
[04:59] sounds form a hypothesis as to why your
[05:02] dog might be barking
[05:04] now we'll develop a strategy to address
[05:06] it what is it that you do to get your
[05:08] dog's attention on you when they start
[05:10] barking or doing something that you
[05:11] would prefer they not do and the
[05:13] majority of circumstances you will not
[05:15] stop all barking at one time your goal
[05:17] is going to be to create a trend of less
[05:20] sparking over time oh and over here good
[05:22] so right there just a little bit of
[05:24] barking so we're already starting to see
[05:26] a bit of improvement here that will be
[05:28] our measure of success what if your dog
[05:30] is barking to alert you or warn you
[05:32] about something
[05:35] I mean to me and many of you this isn't
[05:38] the worst thing a dog can do but if you
[05:39] don't teach your dog that one or two
[05:41] barks is enough this can easily escalate
[05:44] until it's out of control
[05:45] see right there she's distracted by
[05:47] something which is probably why a lot of
[05:49] you are watching this video I'm guessing
[05:51] very alert this isn't just a yappy bark
[05:54] this is a dog who's
[05:55] sees something the wind blowing I'm not
[05:57] sure yes now in those cases we want to
[06:00] acknowledge our dog's concern thank you
[06:02] for letting me know dog and then
[06:03] redirect their attention to an
[06:06] appropriate activity let's go
[06:08] we're going to teach our dogs a word
[06:10] like quiet or relax when it's time to
[06:13] stop barking we'll cover more on that a
[06:15] little later it's so tempting for many
[06:17] to discipline barking but we have to
[06:20] remember dogs need to be able to it's a
[06:23] natural expression for them now granted
[06:25] we don't want them to do it all of the
[06:27] time and we can definitely reduce
[06:29] sparking but to expect them to be quiet
[06:31] a hundred percent of the time isn't very
[06:34] ethical the real question for me is can
[06:35] I get her under control after a brief
[06:37] barking outburst and then hopefully we
[06:39] can minimize unwanted barking over time
[06:41] a lot of people would look at this and
[06:42] say Zach you're just letting her bark
[06:44] you're not addressing anything at all
[06:46] but I really want to double down on this
[06:48] idea that it is okay for a dog to
[06:51] express an emotion in a natural way my
[06:54] emphasis is on letting her know what I
[06:55] do like instead of what I don't like it
[06:58] is shocking how much progress you can
[07:00] make with that strategy if your dog
[07:02] barks When someone knocks on the door or
[07:04] when you get visitors or someone rings
[07:06] the doorbell
[07:08] you can teach your dog to associate
[07:10] those events with something really good
[07:13] for them as well as calmer Behavior not
[07:15] one time good go ahead and knock three
[07:18] times
[07:19] good work very good my long-term game
[07:22] plan here is that when she hears a knock
[07:23] on the door I'm teaching her to look to
[07:25] me for direction rather than just
[07:27] reacting go a little bit out of your way
[07:29] to desensitize your dog to the sound of
[07:32] someone knocking or a doorbell to get
[07:34] them used to those sounds happening and
[07:36] in addition to that show them how you
[07:38] would prefer they behave instead see by
[07:40] easing her into it she's a lot more
[07:42] responsive
[07:44] whenever you get quiet Behavior if you
[07:47] will reinforce that by giving them
[07:49] something that they like whatever it is
[07:51] make quiet work for your dog and the
[07:54] same goes for attention seeking Behavior
[07:56] or boredom barking you want to reinforce
[07:59] quiet behavior that can be a little
[08:01] challenging sometimes though she's
[08:02] saying I really want to play with that
[08:04] ball what are you waiting on but we want
[08:05] to let him know we're only going to get
[08:07] this ball when you're quiet so we want
[08:09] to make sure that we time our rewards
[08:11] during moments of quiet
[08:13] yes good there was a brief moment of
[08:15] silence there start with just a half a
[08:17] second or a full second or maybe two
[08:19] seconds six
[08:22] pushed her to failure I'm gonna take a
[08:24] step back look at me buy it one two
[08:28] three yes
[08:29] okay I'm gonna try ten seconds again
[08:33] eight
[08:34] nine
[08:36] ten yes good I'm gonna give her a really
[08:38] extra big reward there this is how we
[08:40] can prevent confusion so that a dog
[08:43] doesn't start to think oh The Barking is
[08:45] what got me the treat which would be a
[08:47] good question if you were wondering that
[08:49] we start to insist on just slightly
[08:51] longer periods of time after the barking
[08:53] and most dogs will figure out that it's
[08:55] the quiet and not the Barking that's
[08:57] getting them the treats make sure you're
[08:59] providing them with regular exercise as
[09:00] well as mental stimulation we can't
[09:02] forget about that part what's your
[09:03] favorite thing to do to provide mental
[09:05] or physical stimulation for your dog
[09:07] when you're training them and a
[09:08] well-socialized dog might be less likely
[09:10] to bark as well so you can set up play
[09:12] dates with dogs who have similar play
[09:14] styles to your own dog when it comes to
[09:16] vocalizing due to fear or anxiety we
[09:20] have to understand that these emotions
[09:22] can be very complex and really vary from
[09:25] dog to dog and addressing the underlying
[09:28] cause might be challenging in some of
[09:30] these situations it's really important
[09:31] to make sure that they have a safe space
[09:33] to go to where they feel secure for many
[09:36] dogs this might be a crate that they
[09:37] enjoy or their bed in a corner of the
[09:40] living room I am going to have a more
[09:41] detailed video that addresses fear and
[09:44] anxiety in the description but in short
[09:46] you'll want to get them used to things
[09:48] that cause them fearfulness and anxiety
[09:50] on terms that your dog is comfortable
[09:52] with as well as change their emotional
[09:55] response to these various triggers do
[09:58] you want this
[10:00] and look at this it's amazing what
[10:01] turkey will do you can see she's a lot
[10:03] more comfortable she's in a playful mood
[10:05] there we go there's the tug that's what
[10:06] I'm looking for tug of war is a really
[10:08] natural game for dogs to play and if you
[10:10] can get them playing tug that's a
[10:11] Surefire sign that they're very
[10:13] comfortable with you with separation
[10:14] anxiety related barking opening this
[10:18] see it's right when I open the door we
[10:19] can identify that as the trigger we want
[10:22] to make sure we're addressing the
[10:23] underlying cause as well are they
[10:25] getting enough physical exercise and
[10:27] mental exercise are you training them
[10:29] regularly are you doing it early in the
[10:30] day or just before leaving your dog
[10:32] alone for example ideally you'll want to
[10:35] make sure your dog is comfortable with
[10:36] being alone for short periods even if
[10:38] it's just 10 seconds in the bedroom
[10:40] while you're in the living room yes good
[10:43] right there what was it like a half a
[10:45] second of Silence nice job really
[10:47] spending some time around the thing
[10:49] that's triggering her to bark right here
[10:51] now here let me see what happens when I
[10:52] go over the threshold yes
[10:55] good work very good now I want to be
[10:58] clear this is no magic answer to solving
[11:00] this type of anxiety this is just
[11:02] working her through how to behave and
[11:04] short bursts this would require a lot of
[11:06] repetition over time
[11:08] oh look at that I got the door shut and
[11:10] everything start there and then
[11:11] gradually increase the time that your
[11:13] dog spends a load to help them become
[11:14] more comfortable with Solitude over time
[11:16] odds are that when you do address that
[11:18] underlying cause and you do slowly get
[11:21] your dog comfortable with being alone
[11:22] that this excessive barking is very
[11:25] likely to subside again we're looking
[11:27] for trends of less and less barking now
[11:29] if your dog is barking because they're
[11:31] behaving territorially or seeming to
[11:34] defend their area it's vital that you're
[11:37] present in those situations you have to
[11:39] actively supervise them so that you can
[11:42] show them how you want them to behave
[11:44] it's really normal for dogs to feel
[11:45] protective of their living space or to
[11:48] be thrown off when something comes into
[11:50] that space so the idea is that over time
[11:52] we can communicate to them that they
[11:54] don't need to feel so protective for
[11:57] example if your dog tends to really bark
[11:59] fiercely in the yard as people or dogs
[12:01] walk by sorry be sure that you're
[12:03] prioritizing training exercises where
[12:06] your dog voluntarily pays it attention
[12:08] to you outside of these over threshold
[12:11] moments where your dog is too excited to
[12:13] listen to you currently the way that I
[12:15] typically teach this is hey dog leave
[12:17] treat Alone look at me instead okay you
[12:20] get a treat and then I gradually start
[12:22] making that exercise more and more
[12:24] challenging introducing toys introducing
[12:27] sounds introducing fast-moving objects
[12:30] introducing stay when they normally
[12:33] don't have to such as when I'm throwing
[12:35] a Frisbee and tell them to stay in
[12:37] mid-stride okay
[12:39] this is how we teach our dogs to listen
[12:41] to us quickly and abruptly in situations
[12:43] that are surprising or exciting to them
[12:46] she's about to be surprised
[12:49] yes good lie down you almost saw her
[12:52] think about barking there I was able to
[12:54] intervene there and get the attention on
[12:56] me before the Outburst occurred that
[12:59] really is your best time dogs will give
[13:01] you a little bit of foreshadowing just
[13:03] about all of the time for example you'll
[13:05] see their eyes light up or their ears
[13:07] perk up and they look very alert
[13:09] sometimes they only give you a micro
[13:11] seconds notice focus on really getting
[13:13] to know your dog in that way and that'll
[13:15] put you in a much better position to
[13:17] work on issues like this practice
[13:19] interrupting your dogs barking by
[13:21] calling them and rewarding them for
[13:23] compliance Behavior now again this is
[13:25] something you need to set up in practice
[13:27] this not only helps you address the
[13:29] unwanted behavior of barking but you're
[13:31] also helping to instill a recall with
[13:34] distractions all right another jogger
[13:36] coming up over here and she's right up
[13:38] on them inertia come
[13:40] yes good
[13:43] lie down perfect stay
[13:49] yes love how she looked at me you've
[13:51] heard me talk about the leave it look at
[13:53] me combo that was an example she looked
[13:54] at the distraction and then looked at me
[13:56] so I was able to give her guidance there
[13:58] when they're too excited to come to you
[14:00] when you call them where they otherwise
[14:02] would comply if they weren't as excited
[14:04] that's your cue to take a step back and
[14:06] focus on training things like come when
[14:08] called or look at me around more minor
[14:11] distractions first and of course while
[14:13] you're working on this type of training
[14:14] you can focus on managing your dog's
[14:17] barking and reduce it in other ways by
[14:19] modifying their environment for example
[14:21] if your dog is barking at something on
[14:22] the street you can close your curtains
[14:24] or blinds in addition to that be sure to
[14:26] open those windows when you are paying
[14:28] attention to your dog so that you can
[14:30] reinforce calm Behavior at first when
[14:32] nothing is outside of the window and
[14:34] then when a car drives by and then when
[14:37] maybe a person walks by and you catch
[14:40] them before they bark and you're there
[14:42] to reinforce and say hey I like that
[14:44] that's where you really start to make
[14:46] progress time your rewards during
[14:48] moments of quiet I like to use the word
[14:50] yes to communicate to my dog I like that
[14:53] exact Behavior right there yes I mean
[14:55] right there you can see it in her eyes
[14:57] she was really thinking about barking
[14:59] she used some minor restraint we need to
[15:01] acknowledge those those small bits of
[15:03] progress and sometimes it's challenging
[15:05] to catch those very tiny moments of
[15:07] quiet
[15:09] notice I'm being very careful to not
[15:11] reward during The Barking I've had with
[15:13] some dogs to Mark the yes as they're
[15:16] taking a breath for their next bark yes
[15:18] I mean right there you could see it in
[15:21] her eyes she was really thinking about
[15:22] barking she used some minor restraint
[15:24] now ultimately we still would like to
[15:26] have the option to have our dogs respond
[15:28] to a word like quiet or relax
[15:32] I know he's right there it's no look
[15:33] he's really tougher Veronica
[15:37] okay Bree is trying to preempt a serious
[15:39] barking outburst
[15:43] you really want to focus on finding some
[15:45] way to acknowledge Quiet Moments with
[15:48] your dog he's like barely listening to
[15:49] me but he's good but she's not barking
[15:53] good I don't mind if you watch if you're
[15:55] quiet oh you do you want to relax look
[15:58] at that she just offered it yeah and the
[16:00] way we do that is through capturing for
[16:02] example when they're naturally quiet
[16:03] maybe shortly after an outburst we can
[16:06] say quiet that's relaxed as if to tell
[16:10] them what they're doing so that they can
[16:12] start to understand over time the
[16:14] context of when you say that word this
[16:17] is probably the most important one
[16:18] anticipate situations where you think
[16:21] your dog might bark we have another dog
[16:23] coming up and prevent the behavior at
[16:26] least at first by asking them to do
[16:28] something incompatible before they even
[16:30] have the chance to start barking you can
[16:33] see she's looking a little alert there
[16:35] stay she's just discovered the other dog
[16:37] good girl
[16:38] nice job I love that automatic look at
[16:41] me right there she's giving me and
[16:42] remember what we said earlier nobody
[16:44] knows your dog like you do and I'm
[16:45] willing to bet that you're able to
[16:47] predict when they are about to start
[16:49] barking with great accuracy inertia come
[16:53] good girl I know you hear that
[16:55] conflicted vocalization good girl I know
[16:58] it's hard you're doing great if at any
[17:01] point during this training you find that
[17:03] your dog is just too inconsolable and
[17:05] nothing you're doing seems to get
[17:06] through to them that means for now you
[17:09] need to have a strong emphasis on
[17:10] management while you set your dog up for
[17:13] Success doing a variety of the exercises
[17:15] we've talked about so far you can use
[17:16] techniques to reduce barking triggers
[17:19] such as making sure your dog has a
[17:21] comfortable space perhaps in another
[17:23] bedroom where you can insulate them from
[17:25] triggers it's up to you as your dog's
[17:28] person and trainer and parent to make
[17:30] sure that you're doing everything you
[17:31] can keep your dog comfortable and at
[17:34] ease making sure that you're able to
[17:35] provide something that your dog can do
[17:37] instead like a really good dog chew or a
[17:40] food dispensing toy have a consistent
[17:42] routine where you get up you exercise
[17:44] your dog nice and early so that they can
[17:47] feel fulfilled physically and mentally I
[17:49] know some people have found it helpful
[17:51] to have background noises like soft
[17:53] music music or a fan to distract from
[17:55] other things that might tempt a dog to
[17:57] bark and of course when we're addressing
[17:58] barking consistency and patients are key
[18:01] everyone in your household must be on
[18:03] the same page for best results make sure
[18:05] to regularly practice these training
[18:07] exercises and be consistent when you go
[18:09] to reward your dog way longer than you
[18:12] think you need to be very clear when
[18:14] you're communicating with your dog
[18:15] throughout the process and understand
[18:17] that your dog isn't going to generalize
[18:19] this quiet behavior and understand that
[18:21] they need to be quiet in all of the
[18:23] contexts that you want them to be quiet
[18:25] in very quickly so we need to be patient
[18:28] and have realistic expectations when it
[18:30] comes to this if you can manage to get
[18:32] your dog to this point again be patient
[18:34] with it it's not going to come very
[18:35] easily initially but when it comes
[18:37] you're able to really get a lot of
[18:39] traction if you follow the
[18:40] recommendations that I've given here I
[18:41] would expect you to start to see a
[18:43] reduction in barking within the first
[18:45] couple of weeks never forget that
[18:47] barking even the excessive variety is
[18:50] communication it's so critical to avoid
[18:53] use using harsh punishing methods
[18:55] because you actually run the very real
[18:58] risk of inadvertently creating a
[19:01] negative association with things that
[19:03] your dog is barking at and that can be
[19:06] very problematic moving forward if you
[19:08] do use positive reinforcement and you
[19:10] exhibit patience and management and all
[19:12] the things we've talked about you're not
[19:13] only going to get a handle on this
[19:15] Behavior but you're actually going to
[19:17] grow closer with your dog in the process
[19:19] strengthening your overall communication
[19:22] that's the beauty trinom.com Zach

My favorite hack for exercising and training dogs no matter where we are! Most dogs won’t listen in brand new places, especially with distractions around! Here’s some advice 😊

NEW EPISODE: Does your dog show signs of aggression? Learn more about signs to watch out for, and how to handle all kinds of aggressive behavior in my NEW video: https://youtu.be/iUpUCbdLNhk

TRANSCRIPTION:

[00:00] we bring our dogs when we travel so it's
[00:01] really important that we make sure that
[00:03] they are satisfied mentally and
[00:05] physically one of the hacks I picked up
[00:07] over the years are finding Sports fields
[00:08] in local small towns like this using
[00:10] them to my advantage well I like fenced
[00:13] areas like this for our dogs fences are
[00:15] also great for keeping unknown dogs out
[00:17] I think you guys will find that most
[00:19] dogs are less likely to listen to you in
[00:21] brand new places that they've never been
[00:23] to given the wide variety of smells
[00:25] sights sounds that a new place has to
[00:27] offer having it fenced you have that
[00:28] peace of mind that they're secure and
[00:30] you can actually get a reliable
[00:32] realistic idea as to how they're going
[00:34] to behave you've got like a big
[00:35] volleyball that's enticing to a lot of
[00:37] dogs in fact what I'll do because I want
[00:39] to do a little proofing with her right
[00:40] now I'm going to have her play fetch in
[00:42] the direction of this to make sure she
[00:44] sees it and to make sure she's reliable
[00:46] this is something that would have really
[00:47] distracted her at one point in her life
[00:49] there we go good and you can see I don't
[00:52] know if you caught that but you can see
[00:53] how she looked back like oh that's a
[00:54] little different but continue to do
[00:57] business as usual which I appreciate

How do you STOP possession aggression? This is the ultimate guide to resource guarding! 🥕 Get 50% OFF Nom Nom: https://trynom.com/zak

Watch this video for an in-depth understanding of resource guarding in dogs and effective ways to manage it.

Delving into the realms of ethology, we shed light on why some dogs guard resources while others don't. 

Spotting the early signs of resource guarding is vital for effective management. From subtle avoidance to more intense reactions like growling, each step up on this behavioral ladder signifies a dog's increasing defensiveness. Understanding these signs can help you employ strategies to calm the situation before it escalates.

The video takes you through the science behind resource guarding and its connections to the primal fight-or-flight response. 

We also debunk common misconceptions about resource guarding and explain why punishment is not a viable solution. It's about addressing the root cause – the fear and stress driving the dog's protective behavior.

Early intervention can make a significant difference, especially in puppies. We use my puppy, Inertia, as an example to demonstrate a slow and steady training process that shapes a puppy's developing brain and gradually lessens their need to guard resources.

With adult dogs, managing resource guarding can be a bit more challenging, but it's far from impossible. This video walks you through strategies of desensitization and counter-conditioning, aimed at gradually reshaping a dog's emotional reactions to certain triggers.

I'll also give advice for parents who are dealing with resource guarding around children.

This video offers advice on when to reach out to dog behaviorists, trainers, and vets for guidance, too.

In essence, resource guarding is a call for understanding, empathy, and patience. Through consistency and positive training methods, we can help our dogs feel secure, fostering a bond built on trust and mutual respect.

[00:13] reduce your dog's anxiety about food

[00:50] of the ingredients in there I'm gonna
[00:52] have a special link in the description
[00:53] trynom.com Sac to get half off a
[00:56] two-week Supply resource guarding isn't
[00:58] just a dog thing it's something that
[00:59] virtually all animals do even humans
[01:02] it's all about trying to protect
[01:03] something perceived as valuable this
[01:06] behavior is really instinctive in dogs
[01:08] so why would one dog be more likely to
[01:10] guard resources than another dog
[01:12] behaviors like this are a pretty complex
[01:14] mix between their genes and the
[01:16] environment that they grow up in this is
[01:17] why you might notice some differences in
[01:19] how some dogs react and why some dogs
[01:21] are more set off than others and even
[01:23] though resource guarding behavior is
[01:25] common in a lot of different animals
[01:27] every dog is unique so it's all about
[01:29] understanding your dog's individual
[01:31] Behavior and I'm going to help you with
[01:33] that to really understand what's going
[01:35] on here we have to look at something
[01:36] called ethology the study of animal
[01:39] behavior our dogs have a really clever
[01:41] way to tell us when things are not okay
[01:43] in their mind it's all about their body
[01:45] language at first the signs of resource
[01:48] guarding can actually be quite subtle
[01:50] your dog might avoid this situation they
[01:52] might freeze up her face kind of tensed
[01:54] up you might even notice them avoiding
[01:56] eye contact or even showing the whites
[01:57] of their eyes
[01:59] and if an individual dog still feels
[02:01] threatened they can escalate their
[02:02] behavior through growling snapping or
[02:05] even biting okay think of this as an
[02:08] escalating ladder each step up means
[02:11] they're feeling more defensive and so
[02:13] those reactions become more intense when
[02:16] a dog starts to Resource guard there's a
[02:18] lot happening under the hood their
[02:20] neurochemical balance changes their
[02:22] heart rate and their breathing might
[02:23] start to speed up and they're generally
[02:25] more alert it's kind of like their
[02:26] body's natural alarm system is going off
[02:29] spotting these signs early is key if you
[02:31] want to address resource guarding
[02:33] effectively you'll want to step in with
[02:35] strategies that help de-escalate things
[02:37] or calm things down but don't worry
[02:39] we're going to get into that now if we
[02:40] peel back the layers the science of
[02:42] resource guarding really reveals the
[02:44] classic fight or flight response so for
[02:46] example imagine your dog spots a threat
[02:49] to their favorite toy a surge of
[02:51] adrenaline rushes through them preparing
[02:53] them to either stand their ground or
[02:55] flee from the situation remember this
[02:57] isn't about a dog being stubborn burn or
[02:59] having faulty genetics it's a survival
[03:01] Instinct that's part of their evolution
[03:04] and can be more pronounced in some dogs
[03:06] over others when it comes to Resource
[03:08] guarding our dogs amygdala is at work
[03:10] that's the Primal part of our brain and
[03:13] theirs that Sparks off these
[03:14] fight-or-flight reactions so let's think
[03:16] of a human example like walking down a
[03:19] dark alley and we hear a sudden noise
[03:21] but we can't see what's causing the
[03:22] noise you might feel certain
[03:24] physiological Sensations like your heart
[03:26] pounding or the desire to quickly get
[03:28] away from the situation that's your
[03:30] amygdala reacting to a potential
[03:32] perceived threat before you even have a
[03:34] chance to make sense of what's going on
[03:36] and these physiological responses are
[03:38] consistent with both dogs and people
[03:40] this reaction isn't personal it's just
[03:43] them responding to a perceived threat
[03:46] this is the uncomfortable part sometimes
[03:48] that when our dog does respond in this
[03:51] way it can trigger our own amygdala
[03:54] which could actually cause us to
[03:56] disproportionately react to our dog own
[03:59] disproportionate reaction so watch for
[04:02] that one broadly speaking our aim here
[04:04] is to manage our dog's reaction while
[04:07] managing our own reaction try to
[04:09] comprehend our dog's action and respond
[04:12] in an appropriate manner we really do
[04:15] need to clear up some frequent
[04:16] misunderstandings about resource
[04:18] guarding though one prevalent myth is
[04:20] that using punishment particularly
[04:22] physical Corrections with our dog will
[04:24] deter resource guarding without causing
[04:26] unwanted side effects do you see why
[04:28] addressing the cause is so important
[04:31] when addressing this if our dogs are
[04:33] likely to be fearful that they're going
[04:35] to lose something and then we punish
[04:37] them for reacting that way probably
[04:39] taking the item away too haven't we
[04:41] validated Their Fear how is that
[04:43] addressing the dog's underlying
[04:44] emotional cause that's what we need to
[04:46] ask ourselves if we're trying to be
[04:48] intellectually honest about this now
[04:50] sure it's true that punishing a dog
[04:52] might stop an outburst in that moment
[04:55] because your dog is suppressing their
[04:57] instinctive reaction to avoid avoid
[04:59] punishments but it's not tackling the
[05:01] root of the problem which is the dog's
[05:03] desire to defend what they feel is
[05:04] theirs so punishing dogs through a
[05:06] resource Garden can actually form a link
[05:08] between the object that they're guarding
[05:09] and the punishment that they are used to
[05:12] receiving which can actually amplify
[05:13] their guarding Behavior over time or
[05:16] cause them to even more fiercely guard
[05:18] an object when you their primary teacher
[05:20] or trainer are not presents wherever
[05:22] possible preventing resource guarding
[05:24] from taking place or before it escalates
[05:27] well that's ideal I mean by the time
[05:29] that your dog feels the need to snap
[05:31] that's not a productive time to address
[05:34] this they're likely way too triggered to
[05:36] learn anything meaningful this is really
[05:39] true with all kinds of aggressive
[05:41] behavior so keep that in mind when we
[05:42] talk about topics like this I mean let's
[05:44] take my own puppy inertia for instance
[05:46] who displayed some resource guarding
[05:48] behavior that was actually the first
[05:49] time I had ever seen her display any of
[05:52] this Behavior at all now when she first
[05:53] started signs of guarding her food I
[05:56] knew that I needed to take the time to
[05:58] show her her how to feel more relaxed I
[06:02] want to get her really comfortable with
[06:04] me going in her food bowl taking it away
[06:06] giving it back taking early action like
[06:08] this can really help shape your puppy's
[06:11] developing brain and that reduces the
[06:13] chance of strong neural Pathways which
[06:15] ultimately lead to and reinforce
[06:18] resource guarding this is why we talk
[06:20] about environmental factors that can
[06:22] influence resource guarding her most
[06:24] significant guarding Outburst was with
[06:26] my wife Bree when inertia was eating a
[06:29] doggy snowball which is really just
[06:31] shaved ice and chicken broth with
[06:33] inertia I adopted a pretty standard
[06:35] strategy of showing her that when humans
[06:37] approach her during meal time that's
[06:39] actually a good thing for her so we'll
[06:41] give her a chance to get into it here
[06:42] just like she was before okay I'll take
[06:45] the camera we're going to create a trail
[06:46] away from the chicken broth and ice
[06:50] good and then yeah another Trail good
[06:57] give her one more piece maybe ask her to
[06:59] lie down and stay lie down
[07:03] now come over and pick it up
[07:08] that's great perfect I took your chicken
[07:12] broth that's good and now maybe just
[07:14] give it back to her and do you see how
[07:15] this can have the effect of changing
[07:18] your dog's emotional response instead of
[07:20] being nervous that they're going to lose
[07:22] something that they want they actually
[07:24] learn to become excited when humans
[07:27] approach them or at the very least to
[07:30] not be fearful these days with inertia
[07:32] all signs of resource guarding have
[07:34] completely subsided here's your recipe
[07:36] picture this your puppy is eating right
[07:38] you calmly approach maybe you drop a
[07:40] delicious piece of chicken or a treat in
[07:42] their food bowl or around their food
[07:43] bowl just enough to convey hey when I
[07:46] approach I bring amazing things now this
[07:48] might help your puppy associate you
[07:51] approaching with those positive
[07:52] experiences rather than becoming nervous
[07:54] or scared that's going to diminish their
[07:56] desire to protect their food this
[07:58] approach provides you with the
[07:59] opportunity to potentially take away
[08:01] your dog's resource for a brief moment
[08:03] and immediately give it back before they
[08:05] even have a chance to react so that you
[08:07] can convey to that them look even if I
[08:10] do take it it's not going away forever
[08:11] and what we're reinforcing here is the
[08:13] idea that they don't need to protect the
[08:15] item that they can trust you and that
[08:18] you will return that item now it is
[08:20] possible that a dog could start to show
[08:22] signs of uneasiness during that process
[08:25] good job okay right there he's a little
[08:27] bit possessive and if that's the case
[08:29] you're likely moving too quick and you
[08:31] need to reassess I'm not going to pull
[08:32] it away from him I want him to leave it
[08:33] alone voluntarily leave it
[08:36] yes if we see any undesirable emotions
[08:39] from our dogs during this process then
[08:41] we need to be very careful and move very
[08:43] slowly you'll be well on your way to
[08:45] resolving this issue when you focus on
[08:47] the underlying emotion that your dog is
[08:49] experiencing now it might be a little
[08:50] bit trickier with dealing with a
[08:52] resource Gardener who happens to be an
[08:54] older dog because the behavior has
[08:56] become more habitualized or solidified
[08:58] over time when he first came to us he
[09:00] was much more defensive around
[09:02] possessions like this
[09:04] just look however there is still hope in
[09:07] managing and resolving this issue we're
[09:09] going to rely on counter conditioning
[09:10] and desensitizing now I know this sounds
[09:13] like jargon but it's straightforward and
[09:14] very easy to understand an example of
[09:16] desensitizing would be getting used to a
[09:19] loud sound for example when I was a
[09:21] young adult I once lived right next to a
[09:23] railroad track the train was so loud and
[09:25] I had to ask myself will I ever be able
[09:28] to sleep through this loud noise but it
[09:30] quickly became normal for me to be able
[09:32] to sleep all through the night with that
[09:34] loud train because I became desensitized
[09:37] to that loud noise we really want to pin
[09:39] down what is setting off our dog's
[09:41] guarding Behavior it might be particular
[09:43] people other dogs or children when they
[09:46] approach your dog or other specific
[09:47] scenarios that you've identified all
[09:49] she's ever known is if I want something
[09:51] I gotta take it she's used to having to
[09:52] really assert herself to get what she
[09:54] wants she was the smallest dog in that
[09:57] entire group once you have a grip on
[09:59] what's causing your dog to react in this
[10:02] way you can develop a plan where you can
[10:04] grad visually expose them to those
[10:06] factors but in a way that is comfortable
[10:09] for them so the idea is to not just
[10:10] confront her and confirm her fears the
[10:13] idea and it's just to let her know
[10:14] there's no need to protect it when we're
[10:16] dealing with complex issues like this
[10:17] it's all about keeping them under
[10:20] threshold not getting them to go above
[10:22] threshold to then correct them in hopes
[10:25] that this will have some meaningful
[10:26] long-lasting change without negative
[10:28] side effects so if your dog continues to
[10:30] react you are putting them in a
[10:32] situation where they don't feel safe and
[10:35] that's not good dog training it just
[10:36] means we need to work up to that more
[10:38] slowly the idea here is at first we keep
[10:40] our dog's distance from those triggers
[10:43] reasonably far well if your dog feels
[10:45] more comfortable eating their meal
[10:46] behind a baby gate or even in another
[10:48] room that's a great place to start think
[10:50] about ways that you can adjust your
[10:52] dog's surroundings their environment
[10:54] these are all things that we have
[10:56] control over that way you can help them
[10:58] feel more secure while you are giving
[11:00] them General gradual exposure to things
[11:03] that cause them to feel uneasy and I
[11:05] can't stress this enough we want to do
[11:07] this carefully in a way that does not
[11:09] trigger our dog so that's desensitizing
[11:11] in a nutshell makes sense right while
[11:13] desensitizing was just about giving them
[11:16] gradual exposure until they're
[11:17] comfortable counter conditioning aims to
[11:19] fundamentally change our dog's emotional
[11:22] response this is amazing this is easier
[11:25] than it sounds in fact this technique
[11:27] embodies one of psychology's most
[11:29] amazing underutilized discoveries do you
[11:32] understand that we can essentially
[11:34] override an unpleasant emotion in our
[11:37] dog and we can do it through purposeful
[11:39] very straightforward actions okay so
[11:41] sticking with the food bowl example or a
[11:43] toy whatever you want say they become
[11:45] uncomfortable as a person approaches
[11:47] we'll start approaching them at a
[11:49] distance that doesn't stir up a reaction
[11:51] we'll want to offer them a high quality
[11:53] treat something that they love even more
[11:55] than what it is that they're guarding if
[11:57] we're dropping a piece of steak while a
[11:59] dog is chewing on a bone I mean most
[12:01] dogs are probably going to find that
[12:03] steak more appealing so I'm might toss
[12:05] turkey or chicken or really good dog
[12:07] treats in the vicinity of that dog bowl
[12:09] while they eat well I remain way back
[12:12] here this is a great way to really
[12:14] de-escalate your dog and put them at
[12:15] ease good man look at that and I can
[12:19] pick up the bone by being back here I'm
[12:21] desensitizing them so they're
[12:23] comfortable eating with me being here
[12:25] and I'm counter conditioning them by
[12:27] showing them hey you get great things
[12:29] when I am in the general area and guess
[12:32] what if I keep doing that I I can
[12:34] probably do it from right here same
[12:36] thing and before you know it your dog's
[12:38] looking to you saying this is great news
[12:40] for me the overall goal with counter
[12:42] conditioning as it relates to Resource
[12:44] guarding is to get your dog to associate
[12:46] your approaching them with favorable
[12:48] outcomes as perceived by them see what
[12:51] we're actually doing here is we're
[12:52] working to flip our dog's emotional
[12:55] response to that trigger we're
[12:57] transforming an experience that they
[12:59] previously found stressful into a
[13:02] positive experience for them and as you
[13:04] do this exercise a few times you'll
[13:06] probably start to see that your dog
[13:07] begins to trust you more and trust is
[13:10] the Bedrock on which we build dog
[13:12] training success every dog is unique and
[13:14] what could seem like a small step for
[13:16] one dog could be a huge leap for another
[13:18] now when it comes to dogs who resource
[13:20] guard in the presence of children by far
[13:23] the most important thing is supervision
[13:25] both kids and dogs lack fluency in one
[13:29] another's language and communication
[13:31] cues this can be just catastrophic
[13:33] combination which is why it is your
[13:36] responsibility as a parent to make sure
[13:38] things remain safe for all parties
[13:40] involved you must prevent any unpleasant
[13:42] interactions and that's completely in
[13:44] your power I'm going to tell you how
[13:46] right now do not allow your children to
[13:49] interact with your dog during these
[13:51] sensitive moments kids can often behave
[13:53] very unpredictably and this can
[13:55] contribute to a dog's anxiety your goal
[13:58] is to teach your kids that they need to
[14:01] respect your dog's space particularly
[14:03] when they're playing with their toys or
[14:05] during meal time or other instances
[14:07] where your dog might feel defensive
[14:09] while we're on this topic children
[14:11] should also be taught not to approach
[14:13] and disturb dogs while they're sleeping
[14:14] too either way both dogs and children
[14:16] are learning to coexist with one another
[14:18] and you need to be the parent who keeps
[14:21] things under control in that situation
[14:23] by managing the dog and the child and
[14:26] keeping things from escalating people
[14:27] especially kids don't always recognize
[14:30] those early warning signs in dogs
[14:32] Sometimes some of those lines that are
[14:34] tough to pick up on for people
[14:36] especially kids are simple freezing a
[14:39] dog might freeze before they're about to
[14:41] snap and that might not inherently look
[14:43] aggressive but it could well turn into
[14:46] that now if at any moment you don't feel
[14:48] qualified or comfortable to address this
[14:50] or maybe your dog has a more extreme
[14:52] case of resource guarding don't hesitate
[14:55] in fact I would encourage all of you
[14:57] struggling with this issue to bring in a
[15:00] competent professional well-versed in
[15:02] modern conditioning methods that do not
[15:04] use aversive dog training techniques I
[15:07] have to say that because probably close
[15:10] to half to a majority of dog trainers
[15:13] will come in and use aversive techniques
[15:16] that could potentially make this issue
[15:17] worse throughout this video you've been
[15:19] seeing clips of how I address this and
[15:21] I'll have links to those videos in the
[15:22] description plus I'm going to have links

[15:35] see if there are any underlying medical
[15:36] conditions that might be contributing to
[15:38] this particularly in cases where the
[15:40] behavior seems new or out of the blue
[15:42] resource guarding can be a complex issue
[15:44] and it has deep evolutionary influences
[15:46] it's not a mark of a bad dog or a

[15:50] dog asking for empathy and understanding

[00:00] resource guarding isn't just a dog thing
[00:02] it's something that virtually all
[00:03] animals do even humans it's all about
[00:05] trying to protect something perceived as
[00:08] valuable this behavior is really
[00:10] instinctive in dogs so why would one dog
[00:12] be more likely to guard resources than
[00:14] another dog behaviors like this are a
[00:16] pretty complex mix between their genes
[00:18] and the environment that they grow up in
[00:19] this is why you might notice some
[00:21] differences in how some dogs react and
[00:23] why some dogs are more set off than
[00:25] others and even though resource guarding
[00:27] behavior is common in a lot of different
[00:29] animals every dog is unique so it's all
[00:32] about understanding your dog's
[00:33] individual Behavior and I'm going to
[00:35] help you with that to really understand
[00:37] what's going on here we have to look at
[00:39] something called ethology the study of
[00:41] animal behavior our dogs have a really
[00:43] clever way to tell us when things are
[00:45] not okay in their mind it's all about
[00:47] their body language

[00:00] now ultimately we still would like to
[00:01] have the option to have our dogs respond

[00:09] he's really tougher Veronica
[00:12] okay Bree is trying to preempt a serious

[00:18] you really want to focus on finding some

[00:27] yes quiet good I don't mind if you watch
[00:30] if you're quiet oh you do you want to
[00:33] relax look at that she just offered it
[00:34] yeah and the way we do that is through
[00:36] capturing for example when they're
[00:38] naturally quiet maybe shortly after an
[00:41] outburst we can say quiet that's relaxed
[00:45] as if to tell them what they're doing so
[00:47] that they can start to understand over

How to Stop Dog Aggression for Everyday People:  https://youtu.be/iUpUCbdLNhk

TRANSCRIPTION:

[00:00] we really need to figure out some
[00:01] frequent misunderstandings about
[00:03] resource guarding one prevalent myth is
[00:05] that using punishment particularly
[00:06] physical Corrections will deter resource
[00:08] guarding without causing unwanted side
[00:10] effects do you see why addressing the
[00:13] cause is so important if our dogs are
[00:15] fearful that they're going to lose
[00:16] something and then we punish them for
[00:18] reacting that way probably taking the
[00:20] item away too haven't we validated Their
[00:22] Fear how is that addressing the dog's
[00:24] underlying emotions that's what we need
[00:26] to ask ourselves if we're trying to be
[00:28] intellectually honest about this it's
[00:30] true that punishing a dog might stop an
[00:33] outburst in that moment because your dog
[00:34] is suppressing their instinctive
[00:37] reaction to avoid punishments but it's
[00:39] not tackling the root of the problem
[00:41] which is the dog's desire to defend what
[00:43] they feel is there punishing dogs who
[00:45] are resource guarding can actually form
[00:46] a link between the object that they're
[00:48] guarding and the punishment that they
[00:49] are receiving which can actually amplify
[00:51] their guarding Behavior over time or
[00:53] cause them to even more fiercely guard
[00:55] an object when you their primary teacher
[00:58] or trainer are not presents

How to Stop Pulling: Don’t Fall for the Leash Training Lie https://youtu.be/tB4ocofBZc8

If your dog pulls constantly on walks, it can feel impossible to figure out where to even start with teaching them to stop pulling. 

Thinking that you need to wait for big successes to start rewarding your dog could be what’s holding you back! 

Don’t stress so much about the behaviors you don’t want. Focus on rewarding what you DO like - even if it’s only tiny glimmers of what you like at first! 

Point those little moments of success out to your dog by rewarding them with something they love. You might be surprised how quickly you start to see more of the behaviors you DO like on your walks!

Click here: https://youtu.be/tB4ocofBZc8
 to see a full-length episode where I will give you tons more advice and exercises for dogs who pull on leash!

[00:00] look for opportunities to reinforce calm
[00:03] Behavior there's a lot of power in this

[00:09] a long way towards helping you make

[00:18] to keep moving no need to stop because
[00:20] we know he's sensitive to dogs and
[00:21] that's really good and consider using a
[00:24] variety of things to reinforce that calm
[00:26] Behavior sometimes it can be play
[00:28] sometimes it can be food sometimes it
[00:30] can be further access to the environment
[00:32] whatever your dog values

TRANSCRIPTION:

[00:00] never forget that barking even the
[00:02] excessive variety is communication it's
[00:05] so critical to avoid using harsh
[00:08] punishing methods because you actually
[00:10] run the very real risk of inadvertently
[00:13] creating a negative association with
[00:16] things that your dog is barking at and
[00:19] that can be very problematic moving
[00:21] forward if you do use positive
[00:22] reinforcement and you exhibit patience
[00:24] and management and all of the things
[00:26] we've talked about you're not only going
[00:27] to get a handle on this Behavior but
[00:29] you're actually going to grow closer
[00:31] with your dog in the process
[00:33] strengthening your overall communication
[00:35] that's the beauty

[00:00] this is the answer you've been looking
[00:02] for this handy 30-foot lead goes so much
[00:05] deeper than you realize now I'm not
[00:06] suggesting that this should replace your
[00:08] shorter lead in every instance of course
[00:10] what we're covering in this lesson is
[00:11] what you can do in addition to the other
[00:13] leash training that we frequently cover
[00:15] here the key to real leash training has
[00:17] very little to do with the leash at all
[00:20] by training an inappropriate setting
[00:21] with a much longer lead you'll allow
[00:24] your dog to engage with the world in a
[00:25] way that's more natural for them walking
[00:27] ahead and behind and Meandering on
[00:29] either side at will not in a straight
[00:31] line because that's how dogs more
[00:32] naturally engage the Earth for the first
[00:35] several days to weeks when you're
[00:36] introducing a long lead to your dog
[00:37] don't have too much of an emphasis on
[00:39] requiring them to do too much the
[00:41] emphasis here is just getting them used
[00:43] to the lead letting them explore this is
[00:44] not a small thing understand that
[00:46] exploring the environment shouldn't be
[00:48] viewed as just a perk for your dog it's
[00:50] essential for their mental well-being
[00:52] and the cognitive function which is
[00:54] directly related to walking nicely on
[00:55] leash

TRANSCRIPTION:

[00:00] curiosity about their surroundings is a
[00:02] core cause of leash pulling as we
[00:04] established our dogs have to have an
[00:06] outlet in which to be curious so we
[00:08] really must address the underlying cause
[00:10] if we are concerned with authentic
[00:12] long-term results a long lead does
[00:14] something that shorter leashes can't do
[00:16] it allows for autonomous exploration and
[00:18] self-directed learning and this is how
[00:20] dogs naturally understand and navigate
[00:22] their world

The reason I’m emphasizing fetch and come when called in a leash training video, is because come when called is a version of really paying attention to you when they might be distracted by something else. And fetch is an incredible way to give your dog an outlet for their energy before asking them to walk slowly and politely next to you. 

So, a training session like this with a long lead, where you give your dog some exercise, have some fun, and reinforce some of their important basics like come when called, is a GREAT way to set yourself up for more success before your leash training sessions. 

Try a practice session like this with your dog, and then walk around on the long lead and reward your dog every time they walk calmly near you or check in with you. By reducing the chances that your dog will pull (because you gave them an outlet for their excess energy, and because their lead is longer so they have a little more room to roam without hitting the end of their leash), and rewarding the behaviors you DO like, you're likely to make progress much more quickly, AND feel less frustrated in the process 

Give it a try and let me know how it works for you and your dog! Watch this full video at the link in my bio to see more!

TRANSCRIPTION:

[00:00] one of the best ways to either teach
[00:02] refine or practice come when called is
[00:05] during a game of fetch why when we
[00:07] mutually play with our dogs and they're
[00:09] having a good time it's amazing for
[00:12] training it's an incredible time to
[00:13] reinforce that recall
[00:17] so she wants another toss of that
[00:18] frisbee right what is she doing come
[00:20] she's coming to me the reason I'm
[00:22] emphasizing come when called in a leash
[00:25] training video is because someone called
[00:27] is a version of really paying attention
[00:29] to you when they might be distracted by
[00:32] something else that's a big league catch
[00:33] right there I could easily take off that
[00:35] lead she would be just fine I got there
[00:37] by using a long lead so that I could
[00:39] really keep her on point he started to
[00:41] back away I'm just going straight for
[00:42] the lead you can see that when an
[00:44] energetic dog like inertia has the
[00:46] ability to get that energy out it's
[00:48] going to make leash training a lot
[00:49] easier

TRANSCRIPTION:

[00:00] so often barking and jumping are two
[00:02] sides of the same coin both are ways
[00:04] that dogs often express their needs and
[00:07] they go hand in hand these behaviors
[00:08] aren't random they're connected to our
[00:10] dog's emotions and how they interpret
[00:12] their surroundings those are such
[00:13] powerful clues for example a dog might
[00:15] bark excessively due to fear anxiety or
[00:18] excitement or worry because they're just
[00:20] bored they might jump on you because
[00:21] they're eager to play or because they
[00:22] haven't seen you in so long like five
[00:25] minutes in some cases or more simply
[00:27] they've learned that it gets them the
[00:29] attention they crave by tuning into our
[00:31] dog's emotions we're able to get at the
[00:33] heart of their behavior and that's how
[00:34] we're going to make changes that stick
[00:36] it's about solving a problem not just
[00:37] hitting the mute button on their quirks
[00:40] so we've got to tailor our training
[00:41] approach to really fit their emotions in
[00:43] those moments what do you think are the
[00:45] emotional motivations behind your dog's
[00:47] jumping and barking Behavior tell me
[00:49] below are they excited to see you
[00:50] seeking attention nervous bored or maybe
[00:53] even scared once you start to understand
[00:55] the motivations that are driving your
[00:56] dog's Behavior you're much more equipped
[00:58] to actually address it

Instant Solution: How to swap BAD habits with GOOD behavior instead!! https://youtu.be/HZxjAk8t4Jw

Instead of scolding your dog and telling them what NOT to do… it’s much easier for our dogs to succeed (and for us to accomplish what we’re trying to accomplish) if we replace it with telling them something TO do! 

This is formerly known as “behavior swapping” or “differential reinforcement of an incompatible or other behavior”.

Watch this full video to learn more right now: https://youtu.be/HZxjAk8t4Jw  I’ll show you how to take a scientifically-backed approach that will help you make real progress ASAP!

TRANSCRIPTION:

[00:00] the beauty of behavior swapping is that
[00:02] it doesn't suppress your dog's
[00:04] excitement it just channels it into
[00:05] something more appropriate they're still
[00:07] rewarded for their behavior it's just a
[00:09] different Behavior this is what's
[00:11] properly referred to as differential
[00:13] reinforcement of an incompatible
[00:14] Behavior or other Behavior sounds fancy
[00:17] but it's just a simple way of saying
[00:18] that we're going to replace an unwanted
[00:20] action from our dogs with something that
[00:22] we find more polite what's so great
[00:23] about this is this approach can be
[00:25] applied to a number of unwanted
[00:28] behaviors from our dogs for example if
[00:29] your dog's chewing on furniture you can
[00:31] swap out the chewing of the furniture
[00:33] with a really good bone that your dog
[00:35] might like if your dog is the type of
[00:36] dog to run out of an open front door you
[00:39] can swap that behavior out for a sit and
[00:41] stay while the door opens ultimately
[00:43] when we're teaching our dogs how to stop
[00:45] pulling on leash we have to swap the
[00:46] pulling Behavior with polite Behavior

TRANSCRIPTION:

[00:00] another key aspect of effective dog
[00:01] training is adaptive learning that's the
[00:03] ability of our dogs to apply lessons
[00:05] that they've learned to new environments
[00:07] and scenarios you see while dogs are
[00:09] incredibly smart they don't naturally
[00:11] generalize well this means even if your
[00:14] dog has learned not to bark excessively
[00:16] in their own house they may not
[00:18] intuitively understand that that rule
[00:20] applies at your friend's house when you
[00:21] bring them over there that's why finding
[00:23] new ways to challenge your dog in
[00:24] practice in new environments is so
[00:26] important think about when you were
[00:28] learning to drive you didn't just
[00:29] practice in one location you practice in
[00:31] parking lots and quiet roads and then
[00:33] busier roads and maybe even highways
[00:35] each new environment presented different
[00:37] challenges it's the same thing with our
[00:39] dogs to help accelerate your dog's
[00:41] adaptive learning you can try changing
[00:44] various variables in your training
[00:45] depending on your dog's skill level the
[00:47] more skill they are the more variables
[00:49] you can play with

TRANSCRIPTION:

[00:00] some people will say the opposition
[00:01] reflex is Amplified when you put a
[00:03] harness on a dog but even if that is
[00:05] true that can happen with a collar or a
[00:06] harness so if pulling is likely to occur
[00:09] I don't want it happening around the
[00:11] dog's neck that interferes with training
[00:13] that causes frustration and it's ideal
[00:15] to have your dog in the most positive
[00:17] mindset that we reasonably can have them
[00:19] in if we're hoping to make progress no
[00:21] harnesses do not cause your dog to pull
[00:24] your dog pulls for a variety of reasons
[00:26] primarily because they haven't been
[00:27] taught how to do otherwise and pulling
[00:29] and walking faster than you is a natural
[00:32] tendency of many dogs modern training
[00:35] really focuses on much more deeper
[00:37] thoughtful communication with dogs and
[00:39] is far less tool focused than it once
[00:41] was and if our dogs aren't acting as we
[00:44] hope that they are whether you have a
[00:46] collar on them or a harness it doesn't
[00:48] matter we have to actually take the time
[00:50] to teach them and help them understand
[00:52] what it is we want

Should you use a collar or a harness when training your dog? Compulsion trainers don't want you to use a harness because they don’t understand how to communicate with a dog unless there’s something around the dog’s neck 😬 Are you confused about choosing the right collar or harness for your dog? This video is your ultimate guide to selecting the perfect training tool that suits your dog's needs and ensures their comfort.

Discover the secrets that old-school trainers don't want you to know: why harnesses, specifically Y-shaped harnesses, are often the best choice for training. Unlike traditional collars that may restrict a dog's range of motion, Y-shaped harnesses offer flexibility without inhibiting your pet's movement. Learn how these harnesses serve not just as a training tool, but as a safety net that supports effective communication with your dog.

In this video, we break down the myths about harnesses and explore why they're often misunderstood by traditional trainers. You'll understand why they believe something must be around a dog's neck to communicate, and how modern training techniques challenge this outdated perspective. Whether it's a Y-shaped harness or a flat collar for a well-trained older dog, we discuss various scenarios to guide you in making the right choice for your unique situation.

Additionally, you'll get insight into how training tools like harnesses and collars are merely secondary to the underlying training methods. Emphasizing positive reinforcement and understanding your dog's emotional state, we'll reveal how the tools themselves don't teach the dog, but aid in creating a strong bond and effective communication between you and your pet.

[00:00] and remember those old school compulsion
[00:02] trainers they don't want you to use a
[00:03] harness because they don't know how to
[00:04] communicate with a dog unless there's
[00:06] something around their neck what type of
[00:07] collar should you use for your dog
[00:08] collar versus harness this is a common
[00:10] question a lot of people ask are you
[00:12] still using a collar to walk your dog or
[00:14] do you use a harness tell me below most
[00:16] modern dog trainers agree on the fact
[00:18] that the primary function of a dog's
[00:21] collar is to hold their ID tags in
[00:23] modern dog training harnesses are the
[00:25] go-to when it comes to keeping our dog
[00:27] safe and under control when we take them
[00:29] out traditionally dog trainers would use
[00:31] a collar around a dog's neck and a leash
[00:34] to provide Corrections or to otherwise
[00:37] communicate sometimes humanely sometimes
[00:40] not but my general feeling now is that
[00:42] we shouldn't be using the leash and the
[00:44] dog's neck to communicate because dogs
[00:46] are much smarter than this they're very
[00:48] capable of taking more sophisticated
[00:51] Direction and responding to more than
[00:53] just a pop on the leash many of you will
[00:55] already know this but there are collars
[00:57] that are specifically designed to be
[00:59] unpleasant to dogs we call those choke
[01:01] chains prong collars and shock collars
[01:03] they're widely used in dog training
[01:04] they're also highly controversial since
[01:06] they undermine the dog's intelligence
[01:08] and use discomfort and pain to
[01:09] communicate and we see these collars
[01:11] getting banned by the day somewhere
[01:12] throughout the world and the reason for
[01:14] this is there have been so many new
[01:16] emerging ways to teach dogs that don't
[01:18] rely on pain and discomfort and remember
[01:20] those old school compulsion trainers
[01:22] they don't want you to use a harness
[01:23] because they don't know how to
[01:24] communicate with a dog unless there's
[01:26] something around their neck now some
[01:27] people will say the opposition reflex is
[01:29] Amplified when you put a harness on a
[01:31] dog but even if that is true that can
[01:32] happen with a collar or a harness so if
[01:35] pulling is likely to occur I don't want
[01:37] it happening around the dog's neck that
[01:39] interferes with training that causes
[01:40] frustration and it's ideal to have your
[01:43] dog in the most positive mindset that we
[01:45] reasonably can have them in if we're
[01:46] hoping to make progress no harnesses do
[01:49] not cause your dog to pull your dog
[01:51] pulls for a variety of reasons primarily
[01:53] because they haven't been taught how to
[01:55] do otherwise and pulling and walking
[01:57] faster than you is a natural tendency
[01:59] see of many dogs modern training really
[02:02] focuses on much more deeper thoughtful
[02:05] communication with dogs and is far less
[02:07] tool focused than it once was and if our
[02:09] dogs aren't acting as we hope that they
[02:11] are whether you have a collar on them or
[02:14] a harness it doesn't matter we have to
[02:16] actually take the time to teach them and
[02:18] help them understand what it is we want
[02:20] that's not to say I never have a leash
[02:22] on a dog's collar my dog inertia is very
[02:25] good on leash so I'll occasionally walk
[02:27] her with a lesion collar for whatever
[02:29] reason because she's well trained and
[02:31] she doesn't pull me so I'm not worried
[02:32] about that tension around her throat and
[02:35] those sensitive areas and even among
[02:37] harnesses some are better than others my
[02:39] wife and I really like to use a y-shaped
[02:41] harness because it doesn't put that
[02:44] unpleasant pressure on sensitive areas
[02:46] and gives dogs a full range of movement
[02:48] this is a y-shaped harness you can see
[02:50] how it looks like a y see we're really
[02:52] trying to avoid harnesses that block
[02:54] their shoulder blades right here so that
[02:56] they have that optimal range of movement
[02:58] tell me what you guys think in the

Seeking videos that showcase aggressive behaviors in dog training is like looking for the worst examples of how to handle aggression. 

Insisting on seeing aggressive outbursts from dogs in videos to “prove” they are “aggressive dogs” only perpetuates misconceptions and undermines the vast body of evidence-backed methods employed by professional trainers.

Why don’t you see me working with aggressive dogs? Well… you do!

[00:00] I have never once seen you train an
[00:02] aggressive dog I get this comment so
[00:04] much and I just want to say thank you if
[00:07] a viewer of dog training content is
[00:10] expecting to see a dog lash out as proof
[00:13] that someone is actually working with an
[00:16] aggressive dog they're missing the mark
[00:18] in modern dog training seeing a dog lash
[00:21] out in an aggressive manner is a red
[00:23] flag not an achievement professional
[00:25] trainers like myself work with reactive
[00:27] or dogs that behave aggressively in
[00:29] certain contexts all of the time without
[00:32] provoking them to snap or bite someone
[00:34] modern dog trainers see aggressive
[00:37] behavior like this as signs of stress
[00:39] that are not necessary to put a dog
[00:41] through in order to treat the underlying
[00:44] cause by understanding the underlying
[00:46] emotional cause of a dog's Behavior we
[00:47] guide them towards healthier responses
[00:49] it's not about dominating a dog and
[00:51] showing them whose boss it's about
[00:52] respecting and working with their
[00:54] emotional state and every single dog is
[00:57] different

TRANSCRIPTION:

[00:00] have you ever been on a walk with your
[00:01] dog and they can't seem to stop sniffing
[00:03] every blade of grass every piece of dirt
[00:05] every tree and don't so many of us get
[00:07] really frustrated when our dogs do this
[00:09] here's a secret you cannot train your
[00:11] dog without understanding their nose I'm
[00:14] actually going to give you specific
[00:15] strategies to help you understand and
[00:18] manage this Behavior effectively and
[00:20] without stifling your dog's Natural
[00:21] Instincts if you're committed to
[00:23] understanding your dog and how and why
[00:24] they behave certain ways and you want to
[00:26] use modern methods click thumbs up
[00:28] subscribe to my Channel tape and Ursa
[00:30] can you sniff out a Simpson for me it
[00:32] actually worked what I love about bark
[00:34] is that their team spends all of their
[00:36] brain energy designing products that
[00:38] dogs love here's evidence look at Homer
[00:41] don't they've got the whole family see
[00:43] that one's Flippy and floppy dogs love
[00:46] that look at this she hides her money in
[00:48] her hair it makes so much sense super
[00:51] true is for dogs who were extremely
[00:53] tough on toys take this toy for example
[00:55] if your dog can squeak that with their
[00:57] jaws then you have a super chewer dog
[00:59] I'm gonna play some treats in here this
[01:01] is a really great way to keep dogs
[01:03] satisfied when the weather's not great
[01:05] outside or you're a little busy these
[01:07] are so well done having these boxes
[01:09] delivered to you every month it
[01:10] motivates me to train more the dogs love
[01:12] it it's just great for all involved when
[01:15] you use our special link you're going to

[01:18] barkbox.com Zach Simpsons and
[01:21] superchewer.com Zach Simpsons links in
[01:24] the description our dog's noses are
[01:25] nothing short of biological Marvels dogs
[01:28] have an olfactory system that's
[01:31] incredibly complex far superior to ours
[01:33] inside their snout they have around 300
[01:36] million old factory receptors if you
[01:38] compare that to us we have around 6
[01:40] million this means your dog's sense of
[01:41] smell is up to 50 times more sensitive
[01:44] than ours and it's not just about the
[01:45] sheer volume of receptors the part of
[01:47] our dog's brain that analyzes these
[01:49] scents is about 40 times larger than
[01:51] ours too this allows them to remember a
[01:54] staggering array of scents they can
[01:56] distinguish individual components in a
[01:58] way that you and I cannot even begin to
[02:00] comprehend I'm sure some of you are
[02:02] already aware of some of the really
[02:04] impressive jobs that dogs are doing with
[02:06] their noses around the world searching
[02:07] rescue missions locating people in the
[02:09] wilderness disaster zones and even under
[02:10] snow and Avalanche areas some dogs are
[02:12] even trained to detect medical
[02:14] conditions like cancer blood sugar level
[02:16] and even seizures before they occur they
[02:18] can do bomb detection drug enforcement
[02:20] Wildlife Conservation all with their
[02:22] nose mind you arson dogs are trained to
[02:24] detect traces of accelerates and that's
[02:25] after the fire this is just the start of
[02:28] what dogs can do with their nose and
[02:30] she's not just smelling the ground right
[02:31] she's smelling the environment smelling
[02:32] all of these molecules in the air that's
[02:34] why dogs don't tend to walk in a
[02:36] straight line all the time on these
[02:37] walks and they go back and forth because
[02:39] they're getting information in the
[02:40] atmosphere around them let me attempt
[02:42] one more time to put this in perspective
[02:44] for you imagine walking into a coffee
[02:47] shop you might smell some coffee
[02:48] possibly some pastries but a dog they're
[02:51] picking up the scent of the Barista who
[02:53] just walked in the type of beans that
[02:54] are being used the milk that's just been
[02:56] heated the customer who just left with
[02:57] their dog the cleaning products they may
[02:59] have used on the floor that morning the
[03:01] dough rising in the back the fresh
[03:02] flowers on the counter the rain coming
[03:04] off of a passerby's coat that's what
[03:07] we're dealing with here and then there's
[03:08] this whole temporal or time aspect to
[03:11] this we humans we live in a world that's
[03:13] dominated by visuals but for dogs every
[03:15] single scent they smell tells a story
[03:17] dogs can actually detect an age of a
[03:19] smell that allows them to perceive a
[03:21] sequence of events through scents as the
[03:24] scent ages the composition of an odor
[03:26] molecule might change some compounds
[03:28] might break down while others are going
[03:29] to interact with other substances in the
[03:31] environment are dog's sensitive noses
[03:33] really detect these subtle changes
[03:35] that's what allows them to distinguish
[03:37] between fresh and older smells this is
[03:39] where it really gets crazy Beyond this
[03:41] dogs have a second olfactory system
[03:44] that's optimized to detect pheromones
[03:47] those are chemical signals that carry
[03:49] social information among members of the
[03:51] same species this whole system centers
[03:53] around the vomero nasal organ or the
[03:56] Jacobson's organ it's located in the
[03:58] bottom of their nasal passage in fact
[04:00] it's right behind there
[04:02] sorry front teeth so have you ever seen
[04:04] your dog like take a super smelly item
[04:07] into their mouth they're not necessarily
[04:09] trying to eat it they may just be trying
[04:11] to get more of those scent molecules and
[04:13] they have a marinasal organ to help them
[04:15] analyze the scents you might be
[04:16] wondering if we have one of these
[04:17] marinasal organs we actually do but it's
[04:22] considered to be vestigial meaning that
[04:24] it's lost its original function this is
[04:27] according to the majority of scientists
[04:29] here's where it gets even more
[04:30] fascinating even though we probably
[04:31] can't smell them ourselves when we
[04:33] humans experience different emotions our
[04:35] body releases pheromones and these
[04:37] pheromones contain distinct scents that
[04:40] our dogs can pick up on do you realize
[04:42] the implications of this that means that
[04:44] your dog may actually be able to smell
[04:47] your emotions not all dogs are equal in
[04:50] this regard your dog's Anatomy can have
[04:52] a huge impact on how well their sense of
[04:55] smell works for them for example some
[04:56] dogs with flattened faces known as
[04:58] brachycephalic dogs might have more
[05:00] narrow nasal passages this can restrict
[05:03] airflow and reduce their ability to
[05:05] detect synths and that can lead to a
[05:06] less efficient sense of smell for these
[05:09] kinds of dogs now some breeds actually
[05:10] have characteristics that take their
[05:12] olfactory skills to the next level take
[05:14] bloodhounds for example you know how
[05:16] they have really long years and Droopy
[05:18] skin these are thought to trap those
[05:21] scent molecules so that they can process
[05:23] them even more so those long ears are
[05:25] thought to sweep the scents towards
[05:27] their nostrils this is unbelievable it's
[05:30] not just their nose it's their whole
[05:31] facial structure that can make each
[05:33] dog's smelling ability unique now you
[05:35] know you're all wondering it right now
[05:37] why do dogs sniff each other's butts it
[05:40] is a good question when your dog sniffs
[05:42] and other dogs rear end they're doing
[05:44] what we might call a scent handshake
[05:46] it's odd to us but it's perfectly polite
[05:48] amongst dogs the anal glands of dogs
[05:51] secrete a unique scent that basically
[05:54] serve as an identity card apparently
[05:56] these scents can tell you a wealth of
[05:59] information about somebody who knew
[06:01] through the scent handshake dogs can
[06:02] detect things like sex diet health and
[06:05] more about other dogs certain changes in
[06:07] a dog scent can tell dogs whether or not
[06:09] a dog has recently gone into heat or if
[06:12] they're sick even a dog's mood can
[06:14] influence that scent on dog's feet they
[06:17] actually have additional scent glands
[06:19] called petal glands those could
[06:21] contribute to a really efficient way to
[06:24] leave behind a scent Trail I know this
[06:26] is a lot to take in but this is going to
[06:28] blow your mind did you know that dogs
[06:30] can smell in Stereo each nostril
[06:33] independent that helps them locate where
[06:35] a particular scent is coming from it's
[06:36] essentially like a GPS system for your
[06:38] dog isn't it we all know what a female
[06:39] is right when your dog pees or urinates
[06:42] during a walk they're doing more than
[06:43] just relieving themselves they're
[06:45] leaving behind a complex mix of sense
[06:47] that other dogs can smell over marking
[06:50] when one dog pees on top of another
[06:52] dog's pee is a behavior that's not
[06:54] really fully understood but it could be
[06:56] a way of a dog adding their information
[06:59] to the mix this really contributes to
[07:01] the whole communal sent conversation
[07:03] that dogs might be having it is our job
[07:06] to allow our dogs the pleasure of
[07:08] sniffing though but sometimes a dog
[07:09] sniffing can really become excessive or
[07:11] disruptive let's remember that excessive
[07:14] sniffing is relative amongst dogs what
[07:16] might seem excessive to us could be
[07:18] perfectly normal for your dog for
[07:19] example have you ever seen your dog do
[07:21] something called scent rubbing they'll
[07:23] smell something on the ground and then
[07:24] rub their body through it to get that
[07:27] smell all over them seemingly this is a
[07:29] widespread Behavior amongst carnivores
[07:31] and there are many hypotheses out there
[07:33] trying to explain why they do it but it
[07:35] still remains somewhat of a mystery as
[07:36] there's no consensus incredibly dogs can
[07:39] also use their sense of smell to
[07:42] navigate their entire environment around
[07:43] them they create a mental map of the
[07:46] world based on scents so that helps them
[07:48] navigate familiar routes and find
[07:50] resources however if your dog's sniffing
[07:52] behavior is causing safety concerns like
[07:55] ignoring requests in dangerous
[07:57] situations or causing really significant
[07:59] interruptions during your walks it might
[08:01] be time to consider some manage training
[08:03] strategies when we talk about managing
[08:05] this excessive sniffing it's not about
[08:07] eliminating this Behavior instead you
[08:09] want to find a balance that respects
[08:10] your dog's Natural Instincts while also
[08:12] ensuring their safety and your peace of
[08:14] mind here's four things you could try
[08:16] number one allocate specific sniffing
[08:18] time during your walks during this time
[08:20] allow your dog to sniff to their heart's
[08:22] content even throwing some treats in
[08:24] there okay she didn't even see me toss
[08:26] that so this is going to be interesting
[08:28] find it there we go and she'll go right
[08:30] to it she she has no problem finding
[08:32] those crumbs we would have to rely on
[08:34] our vision we wouldn't be able to smell
[08:35] that as people dogs are in a different
[08:38] League gives her something to do this is
[08:39] a way that you can really encourage your
[08:41] dog to sniff in case they're saying I
[08:42] don't I'd rather drag you down the
[08:44] street right now this might be an
[08:45] alternative activity that you can do
[08:47] toss some treats into some grass let
[08:50] them sniff it out really get that nose
[08:52] working look how hard she's having to
[08:54] work to get those crumbs right now and
[08:56] she doesn't mind one bit in fact she
[08:58] enjoys the process well you find that
[09:00] their sniff breaks become much shorter
[09:02] order when you just give them the outlet
[09:04] just concede they need to do it then
[09:06] they're satisfied then they're like okay
[09:07] I don't need to melt every time I smell
[09:10] something with my own dog inertia for
[09:12] example she really enjoys sniffing so
[09:14] with her I like to give her a lot of
[09:16] time it's really good for her mentally
[09:18] she enjoys it and it satisfies her I'll
[09:20] give her several minute long sniff
[09:22] breaks throughout the walk accordingly
[09:24] this strategy respects your dog's need
[09:26] to sniff while making sure that your
[09:28] walks are manageable and enjoyable for
[09:30] both of you two let's talk about some
[09:32] training teach your dog skills like
[09:33] leave it and let's go outside of those
[09:36] intense sniffing experiences for example
[09:38] one thing you'll want to make sure your
[09:40] dog knows is how to do a leave it
[09:41] outside not just in your living room
[09:43] leave it
[09:44] look at me come
[09:47] yes so once your dog can do that
[09:49] exercise that's when you would teach
[09:51] them to okay let's go when they're
[09:53] sniffing after you've given them a fair
[09:54] chance to of course let's go let's go is
[09:57] really easy to teach to teach this you
[09:59] would basically encourage your dog to
[10:00] come with you every time they naturally
[10:02] are coming with you with practice you
[10:04] can use these to redirect their
[10:06] attention when they're overly focused on
[10:07] sniffing and there's a nuanced
[10:09] difference between leave it and let's go
[10:11] in the context we're talking about leave
[10:13] it is about breaking focus and ignoring
[10:15] something specific like with a treat or
[10:17] a scent whereas let's go is more about
[10:19] transitioning from one activity to
[10:21] another number three you can try to
[10:24] engage in Scent games at home with your
[10:26] dog I'm going to place it inches away
[10:28] find it the quick way to train this is
[10:31] showing your dog where a particular
[10:32] treat is put it down on the ground you
[10:35] start it at inches away now I'll do it a
[10:37] couple of feet away stay
[10:39] okay
[10:40] find it
[10:41] so I'm releasing her from that stay
[10:43] telling her okay obviously she knows
[10:45] from the context of this training
[10:46] session the object is to go and get the
[10:48] treat something she's very happy to do
[10:50] well we'll throw a curveball to behind
[10:52] your back this is super simple you can
[10:54] just hide little treats around the house
[10:55] and encourage your dog to find them and
[10:58] eventually they'll be able to find
[10:59] things that are totally out of sight get
[11:00] the nose start to immediately go into
[11:02] overdrive you see that and look at that
[11:05] how about that Isn't that cool I've
[11:07] never actually done that exact drill or
[11:09] game with her so that's the first time
[11:10] that happened and so it was really cool
[11:12] to see the nose not simply working but
[11:15] to see her nose like all right let me
[11:17] like really kick it into gear here I'm
[11:19] gonna be nonchalant on this one look
[11:21] look how she's not paying attention see
[11:26] find it
[11:30] yes there you go you can see how this
[11:33] might be as fulfilling to a dog it's a
[11:35] 15-minute walk on a rainy day when you
[11:37] can't go outside it's a fun little game
[11:38] you can see how this is stimulating for
[11:40] the brain and it's allowing them to have
[11:42] an outlet for those sniffing instincts
[11:44] in a controlled healthy environment
[11:46] number four teaching a dog to sniff On
[11:48] Cue can be a very effective way to
[11:50] manage this Behavior see we want to put
[11:52] a word with their sniffing Behavior so
[11:54] that we can tell them sniff right now go
[11:57] sniff this really is as simple as
[12:00] capturing the behavior in day-to-day
[12:01] life so if you're on a walk or your dog
[12:03] is sniffing something you would just
[12:05] simply say sniff over time your dog
[12:07] learns what this means given the
[12:08] specific context in which you're saying
[12:10] the word so you can see how we would do
[12:12] this practically you say sniff as
[12:13] they're sniffing let them do it for a
[12:15] while and then since you've taught them
[12:17] let's go you can say let's go to
[12:19] encourage them to move on but I find
[12:21] that if you're not giving them the time
[12:23] to actually enjoy the sniffing this
[12:26] probably won't work out for you it is
[12:28] very important that you factor the this
[12:30] in when you're taking your overall walk
[12:32] in other words you don't want to just
[12:33] say let's go every single time your dog
[12:35] starts to sniff ask yourself if it's
[12:37] fair for them in that moment you see how
[12:39] this would work to your benefit right
[12:40] over time your dog starts to identify
[12:42] the word sniff with sniffing and let's
[12:45] go with let's move on this is a way we
[12:47] can influence their sniffing Behavior
[12:48] without suppressing their instincts
[12:50] that's what we want to avoid suppressing
[12:52] Natural Instincts there are often side
[12:54] effects every time we do that if your
[12:56] dog's sniffing Behavior seems unusual to
[12:58] you it might be worth considering other
[13:00] causes excessive sniffing could also be
[13:02] a sign of anxiety or stress in some

Description:
Earlier this week, we promised that the voices of those concerned with “Dog Daddy” Augusto DeOliveira’s training methods would not go unheard. Today, that pledge came to life as dog training advocates including https://instagram.com/sitstaystella_ courageously engaged Augusto in a dialogue about his dangerous practices. 

As onlookers gathered, the conversation unfolded. Augusto’s followers and the public were invited to join in this critical examination of dog training methodologies. While differences remain, today marked a significant step toward a more informed and compassionate discourse. 

We are so grateful to Lauren @sitstaystella_ for her bravery, and to all who continue to seek the best for their dogs, guided by evidence and empathy ❤️

Description:
Yesterday, Dog Daddy Augusto DeOliveira failed to appear at his own scheduled meetup. However those who care deeply about the ethical training of dogs showed up and represented! 

We continue to remain focused on raising public awareness about the significant issues associated with the methods Augusto uses with the dogs he trains. 

As of now, his next planned stop is Toronto, Canada. If anyone has information on his specific Toronto location, we urge you to share it so that we can alert the venue in advance of the risks involved with the practices Augusto regularly conducts during his training sessions. 

Canadian Border Services has opened a case file (after independently looking into Augusto’s practices and having their own concerns). They have asked anyone with additional information to submit an anonymous tip - there is a link with instructions for how to do this if you would like: https://Linktr.ee/zakgeorge 

Moreover, it appears that @Peerspace is facilitating his venue bookings. We have reached out to them several times without a reply and it appears as though they have no intention of stopping these bookings from continuing which is deeply disturbing given the public safety risk his methods promote. We’ve publicly called on them to request a statement clarifying why they find it acceptable to support someone with a problematic history in both dog training and breeding practices. If you want to reach out to Peerspace, their website for submitting inquiries is available here: https://Linktr.ee/zakgeorge

Augusto has also announced a world tour. Visit the link in my bio to sign petitions and reach out to local media outlets in your area to alert them about this cause, as well as organizations committed to advocating for humane dog training practices.

Together we can continue to make it clear that outdated, harmful dog training practices will not go unchallenged. 

For those looking to help us in raising awareness about the methods that are being promoted to the public by this contentious trainer, additional resources and links are available here: https://linktr.ee/zakgeorge

Thank you so much to everyone who continues to stand up for dogs and their people ❤️

[00:00] all right apparently dog daddy was a
[00:02] no-show at his own Meetup I understand
[00:04] that he had approximately two people
[00:06] show up for him
[00:07] and we had at least 15 protesters
[00:10] waiting to make their presence known and
[00:12] anyway uh it's possible that he was
[00:14] there and he was waiting for our
[00:16] protesters to disperse because it was
[00:19] getting dark and the park was closing
[00:20] and all that so
[00:23] um yeah there was no substantial meet up
[00:26] for dog Daddy and our protesters were
[00:28] ready to go and I'm so proud of each and
[00:31] every one of them we're going to tag
[00:33] them you guys are incredible Advocates
[00:35] hey
[00:39] so we
[00:41] scared dog Daddy away I don't know
[00:45] um we were successful when we showed up
[00:47] for our protest because he didn't even
[00:49] have the balls to be here

📍TORONTO 🇨🇦 PEACEFUL PROTEST THIS WEEKEND! Andre Yeu from When Hounds Fly Dog Training went on CBC Toronto to discuss “Dog Daddy” Augusto DeOliveira, who is bringing his dangerous and problematic training methods to Toronto on Saturday (Sep 2) and Sunday (Sep 3). 

Stay tuned, follow our Instagram for all kinds of updates you’re not getting here: https://instagram.com/zakgeorge

If you’re in Toronto follow https://Instagram.com/angelkerrdogtraining for on the ground info about peaceful protests in Toronto! 

Local trainers in Toronto are planning to peacefully demonstrate and raise awareness about ethical, modern, evidence-backed dog training methods that effectively address all types of issues (including severe aggression and fear).

DOG DADDY FANS! I am genuinely glad to have you here. If you have questions or concerns please feel free to let me know in the comments! I also made a video just for you to explain in detail what our issues with Augusto’s methods are, and why. You can see it here: https://youtu.be/cJDALfAJrK8

Remember, education is the key to change. By highlighting what's wrong with such methods, we can guide those who might be misinformed towards humane, effective, and scientifically supported methods instead. If we stay silent, we risk allowing these seriously harmful, dangerous and unnecessary techniques to spread further without being challenged. 

Our goal is not to attack an individual, but to empower people with the right information so they’re fully ready to make informed decisions for the well-being of themselves and their dogs. 

For those who would like to peacefully protest his methods, or to be available to kindly try to educate his followers about the issues surrounding the methods Augusto promotes, I encourage you to show up at as many of his events as possible and demonstrate peacefully and nonviolently.

[00:00] as you know we have protests scheduled
[00:03] or if you don't know we have protests
[00:04] scheduled in Toronto where augusto de La
[00:07] Vera is attempting to promote his
[00:10] problematic dog training practices to
[00:12] the citizens of Toronto they're very
[00:13] organized in Toronto in fact the media
[00:16] is covering it the Canadian media is all
[00:18] over this they did a great job I'm about
[00:19] to show you a story that they just did
[00:22] but once again for those who are
[00:24] confused particularly who are not
[00:26] Behavior experts who think that these
[00:28] methods are necessary what we want to
[00:30] make clear to you is that the methods
[00:32] promoted by augusto de Oliveira are a
[00:35] public health and safety risk because
[00:37] they don't under because they don't
[00:38] address the underlying causes of
[00:40] behavior problems he just Yanks and
[00:42] cranks until the dog shuts down but you
[00:45] know
[00:46] as time goes on dogs learn to bottle
[00:48] these emotions up and then you get an
[00:51] explosion with with many dogs so that's
[00:53] why legitimate dog trainers and behavior
[00:55] experts understand that these are not
[00:58] addressing the underlying cause anyway
[01:00] take a look at this if you want to
[01:03] participate in peaceful protests against
[01:06] augusto de La Vera and and the methods
[01:08] he's promoting we're going to have
[01:09] details in the description I know this
[01:12] is the last thing we want to be talking
[01:13] about and I do want to make you aware
[01:15] that we are currently working on another
[01:16] series with shade Kane Corso new puppy
[01:20] Survival Guide is coming back soon so
[01:23] don't worry we're not losing focus of
[01:25] everything but this is a an emergency in
[01:29] our industry there are millions of
[01:31] people who believe that you need to yank
[01:32] and crank dogs and use abusive tactics
[01:34] to resolve complex deep-rooted behavior
[01:36] problems and this kind of misinformation
[01:38] needs to stop Also if anyone has any
[01:41] connections at YouTube even more than me
[01:44] I'd like to reach out to them as well uh
[01:47] thank you
[01:49] want to give you a warning for this next
[01:51] story some of the images may be
[01:53] disturbing to some viewers dog trainers
[01:56] in Toronto are raising the alarm just
[01:58] days before a controversial trainer is
[02:00] set to appear in the city the dog Daddy
[02:03] bills himself as a trainer of reactive
[02:06] and aggressive dogs he uses what's known
[02:09] as averse of conditioning which can
[02:11] include pronged shock choke collars are
[02:14] using leashes to suspend dogs by the
[02:17] neck Tyler cheese spoke with local
[02:19] trainers who say his methods are
[02:21] outdated and harmful
[02:29] the dog Daddy real name Augusto
[02:31] deliviera has almost 3 million
[02:34] subscribers on YouTube he's scheduled to
[02:36] appear in Toronto to offer classes to
[02:38] dog owners this coming long weekend
[02:40] but local dog trainers say his methods
[02:42] do more harm than good
[02:45] I get really concerned when I see that
[02:47] kind of training
[02:48] still present in 2023.
[02:51] Andre you has been a professional dog
[02:54] trainer for 13 years it's really well
[02:56] known that that sort of intervention
[02:58] causes like longer term damage to dogs
[03:01] it doesn't actually help them and in
[03:03] some cases can make dogs more aggressive
[03:05] and more dangerous
[03:08] he says positive reinforcement training
[03:10] is better for dogs and is proven more
[03:12] effective
[03:18] impression we're really not changing
[03:21] Behavior we're just sort of suppressing
[03:22] behaviors
[03:27] I can tell you that this is not a method
[03:30] of dog training that we actually condone
[03:32] at trying
[03:33] Society we do use a positive
[03:35] reinforcement approach that is Humane
[03:38] it's unclear whether the dog daddy could
[03:40] be charged under Ontario's Animal
[03:42] Welfare laws there is a broad
[03:45] provision on distress
[03:48] and one might argue that it creates a
[03:54] situation
[03:55] of distress the way that trainers are
[04:02] interacting or handling dogs
[04:06] the problem is dog training is currently
[04:09] unregulated in Ontario
[04:11] it's an industry that's virtually devoid
[04:14] of any sort of Regulation and this
[04:18] includes public protection and when
[04:21] we're talking about trainers this
[04:24] pertains to
[04:26] the methods of training that they use as
[04:29] well as the scope of their expertise
[04:33] in an email the ministry of the
[04:34] solicitor general says Animal Welfare
[04:36] Services will review and respond
[04:38] accordingly to any complaints received
[04:40] the ministry did not respond to
[04:42] questions about whether the dog Daddy's
[04:44] methods could be considered animal abuse
[04:46] or whether or not the province is
[04:47] looking to regulate the industry as for
[04:50] the local trainers they say they want
[04:52] people to know there are alternative
[04:53] options even for highly aggressive dogs
[04:56] what I want people to know is
[04:58] professionals like us work with dogs
[04:59] like this every single day but because
[05:01] we are more cautious and incremental in
[05:05] our approach you would never know that
[05:07] I'm working with a dog that's dangerous
[05:08] on the Street CBC Toronto requested an
[05:11] interview with the dog Daddy but did not
[05:12] receive a response

[00:01] okay we are going live right now I just
[00:03] wanted to go live I don't do YouTube
[00:04] lives too often but given the
[00:06] circumstances right now I want to make
[00:08] sure that I'm in clear communication
[00:11] with my audience with other people on
[00:13] the issues that are going on while we
[00:15] wait for people to come in right now um
[00:18] I just want to give you some background
[00:21] as to what's going on uh as many of you
[00:24] know uh the YouTuber known as dog Daddy
[00:27] austo DEA is implementing abusive dog
[00:30] training tactics right now and it is
[00:33] unfortunately a big issue and so we are
[00:36] trying to raise awareness around not
[00:38] just him but many trainers who use these
[00:40] methods and lately we have people who
[00:42] just don't understand why they they
[00:43] think this is simply a difference of
[00:45] training methods or whatever so I'm
[00:47] really hoping to take some critical
[00:49] comments to just help us understand
[00:51] what's going on here I think it's so
[00:52] important to reach out to people and uh
[00:57] help them understand hey sports kids you
[01:00] can get a shout out yes how are you okay
[01:03] good now we're starting to get some
[01:03] people in this is great so yeah uh for
[01:06] those of you just joining us we are
[01:07] there's you know we are in a state of
[01:09] emergency in the dog training field
[01:11] right now there are abusive dog training
[01:13] practices being going mainstream in a
[01:16] way that maybe they have before but it
[01:20] it's moving Us in the wrong direction
[01:22] and as someone in this field I've been
[01:24] very outspoken about modern Humane dog
[01:27] training over the years many of you will
[01:29] know this
[01:30] and we have decided to really point a
[01:33] lot of attention at austo DEA known as
[01:36] the dog Daddy because we believe his
[01:38] practices are abusive towards dogs they
[01:40] don't address the underlying cause and
[01:42] that they are a public health and safety
[01:44] risk and I just wanted to make sure I
[01:46] made myself available to not only my
[01:48] audience but his audience as well so
[01:50] that they can understand why we're
[01:51] scheduling protests at every one of his
[01:53] events uh why we are raising awareness
[01:56] around it why we are are why we are
[01:58] asking for license Ure in our field so
[02:02] that abusive dog training tactics can go
[02:05] challenged cuz we're not going to let
[02:07] these methods go unchallenged as a
[02:09] community
[02:10] anymore hi Sno good to see you from
[02:13] Toronto yeah it really is messed up so I
[02:16] don't know how long I'm going to be here
[02:17] I noticed on my last video I posted a
[02:19] Canadian news report and I noticed
[02:20] there's a lot of people who still don't
[02:22] understand why we're doing this a lot of
[02:23] people think that you need to meet a dog
[02:26] with force or aggression particularly
[02:28] when a dog has a aggressive issues this
[02:31] is a you know this seems intuitive to
[02:33] many people and what most people don't
[02:35] realize is that it doesn't address the
[02:37] underlying problem when you're yanking
[02:38] and cranking a dog all over the place
[02:40] and physically punishing a dog who has
[02:42] aggressive issues that's just addressing
[02:44] the symptom it's kind of like putting a
[02:46] Band-Aid on a broken bone you could
[02:49] cover it
[02:50] up you could cover up a fracture but
[02:53] that doesn't mean you've really
[02:54] addressed anything you know what I mean
[02:55] that's a good metaphor here um so this
[02:59] is a good question William why don't you
[03:00] get an aggressive dog he says we
[03:02] actually have many dogs on my Channel
[03:04] with bite histories and what people if
[03:07] you're seeking evidence that a dog
[03:09] trainer is working with a dog uh who has
[03:12] aggression issues by seeing aggressive
[03:15] behavior you're seeking evidence for bad
[03:17] dog training skilled dog trainers know
[03:20] how to not get a dog biting at them so
[03:22] say in dog Daddy's videos or austo you
[03:25] will frequently see him just drag the
[03:27] dog and what happens when you pull a dog
[03:29] who's Fe fearful they'll start biting
[03:32] right they'll start biting they'll start
[03:33] freaking out and stuff and at which time
[03:36] an amateur or charlatan like austo dea
[03:40] uh will say this dog's
[03:42] aggressive when he is the one triggering
[03:45] the aggression once you have a trained
[03:46] eye you know to see these things the
[03:48] public I don't the public doesn't know
[03:50] to look for that they don't understand
[03:51] they're confused about the matter which
[03:53] is why we need lure because there is a
[03:56] ton of confusion around this so yeah and
[03:59] no need give me any money you guys I I'm
[04:01] here just to communicate with you and I
[04:03] I mean I appreciate that's very nice of
[04:04] you um but I'm I'm really here just out
[04:07] of genuine communication to make you
[04:09] aware of what's going on in our industry
[04:11] I feel a responsibility that if I'm
[04:13] going to call out an individual for
[04:14] using problematic dog training
[04:16] approaches that I have the
[04:17] responsibility to communicate why we're
[04:19] doing that and to not only talk to my
[04:22] followers but to his followers as well
[04:24] who are not our enemies they are our
[04:26] friends they're are dog lovers and
[04:27] they're simply confused and we're here
[04:30] to Aid in deconstruction of people who
[04:33] um have believ this outdated idea that
[04:36] you need to use pain and or discomfort
[04:38] to modify Behavior or to train dogs
[04:41] because you don't good I'm I want my Pro
[04:44] dog Daddy people in here dog Daddy shows
[04:46] results of his training so Nance when
[04:48] you this is what you're seeing okay when
[04:50] you see this out ofc control dog and
[04:52] then he Yanks it by the neck until the
[04:54] dog shuts down you are seeing a physical
[04:57] position of a dog no longer jumping and
[04:58] lunging but what has happened here
[05:02] imagine you were pulled over by a
[05:03] corrupt cop who pulls you out of the car
[05:05] and starts beating you with a stick or
[05:07] or putting his knee on your back and
[05:08] just scaring the crap out of you you're
[05:10] either going to fight back you're going
[05:12] to uh try to run away or you're going to
[05:15] freeze we see all of this with the dogs
[05:17] right there is no attempt to connect
[05:20] with a dog um and so even with a dog
[05:23] with a bite history believe it or not if
[05:25] you approach them in the right
[05:27] environment if you have the right data
[05:29] you had your medical exam you never need
[05:32] to see the aggression at all to address
[05:34] it because we're not trying to address
[05:35] the symptom we're trying to address the
[05:37] emotion and one of the things that
[05:39] modern dog training focuses on is
[05:43] constantly measuring the emotional
[05:46] regulation and state of the dogs we're
[05:48] working with it's not enough to just say
[05:50] oh that dog won't let go of a ball poke
[05:52] poke in the liver until the dog I just
[05:55] saw this video from him this morning
[05:56] doing this you know that that is not how
[05:59] we it's unacceptable we can't just go
[06:01] for physical positions because if we
[06:04] don't address the underlying emotional
[06:05] causes of these complex uh animals then
[06:08] we're not going to make the progress we
[06:10] want and there are many elements in our
[06:12] our culture that
[06:14] really promote this idea so and again
[06:18] I'm I'm happy to take I you're not going
[06:20] to hurt my feelings I I really want dog
[06:22] Daddy fans to reach out to me to ask
[06:25] their questions to cuz a lot of people
[06:28] are seeing me as someone who's just
[06:29] picking up fight and I'm really not I
[06:31] see some I see a public being misled and
[06:34] I see great confusion in the public in
[06:37] an unregulated industry as you would
[06:39] expect to see in an unregulated industry
[06:42] if an industry is unregulated you're
[06:43] going to see people rise up who are bad
[06:46] for the industry sometimes uh let me see
[06:49] if I can catch up on some of these
[06:51] comments I've used dog daddy and he
[06:53] didn't do that when I was there that
[06:54] yeah I'm not saying that every time he
[06:56] works with a dog that he's abusing them
[06:57] but how many times do you need to do it
[06:59] if you want to look at any past videos
[07:01] or on Instagram we have compilations of
[07:03] abusive dog training tactics where he
[07:06] literally causes the dogs to defecate we
[07:08] have them cutting off air to a dog's
[07:10] throat with a prong collar while holding
[07:12] them off the ground for an extended
[07:13] period these are not acceptable methods
[07:16] in modern behavior in fact it's not even
[07:19] like they're just different methods and
[07:20] you get to the result a different way
[07:22] this is not one of those things when you
[07:24] use these methods on dogs and you're not
[07:26] addressing the underlying cause you're
[07:28] just making it worse you're actually a
[07:29] Public Safety and Health concern at this
[07:32] point when you're doing that and again
[07:34] he's not the only one there's a lot of
[07:36] dog trainers that train this way he's
[07:37] just one of the higher profile ones
[07:39] which is why I'm talking to you about it
[07:42] um and it's a shame a lot of what he
[07:45] does may even be considered legal in
[07:47] many places but I will point out that
[07:50] there are many things throughout our
[07:51] history that were once legal that should
[07:54] not have been that are now illegal and
[07:57] this is one of those things
[08:00] um how far are we from authorities to
[08:01] regulate how trainers train dogs I don't
[08:04] know that's not my expertise my highest
[08:07] and best use is to raise awareness as a
[08:09] professional in our field and express my
[08:11] concerns uh we are working on another
[08:14] series but while I work on my my
[08:15] part-time job right now is Raising
[08:17] awareness around these issues because it
[08:19] is it is out of hand and it is a problem
[08:21] and we need lure in this field yesterday
[08:24] we have because here's the thing dogs
[08:26] can bite people they can bite other
[08:28] animals they canite members of the
[08:30] public people and when you have people
[08:33] giving this horrible advice that
[08:35] exacerbate these issues that creates an
[08:38] additional public health and safety
[08:41] concern and with austo you know he's got
[08:43] millions of followers I take I don't
[08:44] take that away from them I want dog
[08:46] trainers to be successful who are
[08:48] behaving responsibly so you know at that
[08:51] part more power to him if he's giving
[08:54] great advice but he's not and this is
[08:57] what is not controversial even amongst
[09:00] dog trainers you know how we dog
[09:01] trainers argue all the time the
[09:03] overwhelming majority of professional
[09:05] dog trainers say this guy is a quack and
[09:07] should not be in the industry just if
[09:08] you want to know yes Cesar Milan is also
[09:11] uh right up there right up there um you
[09:15] know he's pass his Prime at this point
[09:17] so and we may address that in the future
[09:19] but it's not about the individual it's
[09:20] about the methods and if we have someone
[09:23] right now who's you know getting a lot
[09:25] of views on his shorts because the
[09:27] public doesn't have a trained eye on
[09:28] what to look for being misled big time
[09:31] it's kind of like it's
[09:34] 1950s it's the 1950s and there are
[09:37] commercials on television where doctors
[09:39] are telling you that cigarettes are good
[09:42] for you which is a historical reality
[09:45] that's the kind of situation we are in
[09:47] with dog training right now that you can
[09:49] just punish behaviors out of a dog scare
[09:51] the crap out of a dog and problem solved
[09:53] when really what happens when you don't
[09:55] address underlying causes is you create
[09:57] create additional problems you're not
[09:59] helping anyone despite the illusion that
[10:01] you've temporarily
[10:04] suppressed um oh Arm and Hammer I'm not
[10:06] even going there with you you are too
[10:07] far gone but I'm here to I appreciate
[10:10] you being
[10:12] here uh I watch dog Daddy and yes it's
[10:14] extreme but I feel like your philosophy
[10:16] a purely Positive Dog Training it's not
[10:18] my philosophy a purely positive first of
[10:20] all that is not a real term I'm not a
[10:23] purely positive dog trainer let me
[10:25] actually explain to you the difference
[10:27] for those of you that are openminded
[10:28] again if you're in here I appreciate
[10:29] apprciate it um when you're a positive
[10:32] trainer really all that means is that
[10:35] you don't bake into your training plan
[10:38] discomfort and pain intentionally
[10:40] delivered right you don't say okay when
[10:43] my dog does this I'm going to make sure
[10:44] there's some type of painful or
[10:46] uncomfortable physically
[10:48] uncomfortable approach that's that's all
[10:50] we're saying for example um if my dog is
[10:54] pulling I can redirect attention on me
[10:57] without uh putting prom in their neck
[11:00] and and uh hurting their emotional state
[11:03] do you see what I'm saying so it's very
[11:06] imperative that we're measuring our
[11:07] dog's emotional state if we're trying to
[11:10] have Real Results this is not my method
[11:13] I wish I could claim that I discovered
[11:15] positive reinforcement training but in
[11:17] the behavior field at large this is well
[11:20] accepted and well established that's why
[11:21] we don't use physical pain for dog I
[11:24] mean for kids in kindergarten or or we
[11:27] shouldn't if we do uh the laws governing
[11:30] Behavior are the same for dogs as they
[11:33] are for people believe it or not they
[11:34] are not different learning laws and this
[11:37] is part of the educational Outreach
[11:38] we're doing here and that's why I'm
[11:40] trying to be an open book here
[11:43] appreciate it
[11:46] Daisy um yeah yeah and so we're just
[11:50] really trying to raise public awareness
[11:53] around this issue right
[11:55] now you're not defending dog daddy
[11:57] you're saying I'm wrong okay well that's
[11:58] all right in order to believe you Arman
[12:00] Hammer I have to now believe the entire
[12:02] behavior science Community is incorrect
[12:04] and you are correct so that's a tough
[12:06] pill to swallow you can understand that
[12:07] can't you why is it that you possess
[12:09] more more knowledge than the uh overall
[12:13] scientific Community would be my
[12:14] question I suppose I love Caesar M's
[12:17] Perfect story personal story and his
[12:19] Charisma agreed I same but right I mean
[12:23] when you're giving problematic advice to
[12:24] the public you've got to be called out
[12:26] and that's why we're calling them out
[12:27] it's not neutral if he was just giving
[12:29] advice that was like it's crap advice I
[12:32] wouldn't be like this I understand and
[12:34] other professionals understand that it's
[12:35] harmful advice and that's why we're
[12:38] staging protests outside every all of
[12:40] his locations where he teaches classes
[12:42] worldwide right now we are very
[12:44] organized on Instagram if you're really
[12:46] trying to follow all of this we have
[12:48] details over there I'm only coming to
[12:50] YouTube selectively just to make sure
[12:52] that you guys understand and again no
[12:54] need to donate money here I appreciate
[12:56] it though it's nice but that's not what
[12:58] we're doing this for we're
[12:59] we're just trying to uh raise awareness
[13:01] yes hi Bri someone says hi thanks for
[13:04] saying hi that's so cool uh yeah Beckman
[13:07] is what we call compulsion trainer he
[13:08] doesn't address underlying causes when
[13:10] we're seeing him use those harsh
[13:11] physical Corrections with
[13:13] dogs Joe it's not a trainer War we're
[13:16] not this is not just a difference of
[13:18] opinion this is this is a public safety
[13:21] matter because to all of those to those
[13:24] people who are like Zack you're just
[13:25] wrong and no I don't want to hear it I
[13:27] understand many people have to accept
[13:29] well I've been implementing this methods
[13:30] does that make me a bad person and I
[13:32] would say no it doesn't make you a bad
[13:33] person you're trusting professionals to
[13:35] advise you responsibly and so you're
[13:38] you're getting I'm just trying to point
[13:40] it out I know some people will not hear
[13:41] it and that is okay that is all
[13:44] right but yeah it's not my point to just
[13:47] start trouble for the sake of trouble
[13:48] I'm not doing that I have a deep concern
[13:50] for ethics in dog training and the
[13:53] industry is out of control right now
[13:55] there's zero regulation zero I mean
[13:57] that's why he's able to get away with I
[13:59] think most people would be shocked by
[14:01] that they saw somebody say why do people
[14:04] think this is a trainer war and I have a
[14:07] personal opinion I think it's because I
[14:09] think closer to the mic y That's okay I
[14:11] know not we're not mik today that's okay
[14:13] uh I think that the majority of people
[14:15] who see this as a training War trainer
[14:18] War are probably only looking at our
[14:23] social media and dog Daddy social media
[14:25] and not going and like looking into this
[14:28] little deeper out outside of that area
[14:30] because I can see how it would just seem
[14:32] like a back and forth if you're not
[14:33] really like taking that into account and
[14:36] and I I don't know I would just
[14:38] encourage people to look into it outside
[14:40] of our two accounts if you think if you
[14:42] think it's personal because it's not
[14:44] yeah exactly um yeah that that what she
[14:47] said I completely agree with that it's
[14:50] um it it really is just a matter of
[14:53] trying to get the right information out
[14:55] there it's it breaks my heart to see the
[14:58] fact that people think that with some
[15:00] dogs you need to cut off their Air
[15:02] Supply with some dogs you need to
[15:04] inflict pain you need to inflict
[15:06] physical discomfort when none of this
[15:09] addresses underlying causes I I also
[15:11] want to point out to you I'm asking for
[15:13] a little bit of humility for those of
[15:15] you who just think I'm totally wrong
[15:17] here I'm asking you to ask yourself this
[15:20] is this is a good faith Point here not
[15:22] trying to start trouble with you okay um
[15:26] ask yourself are you a behavior expert
[15:29] what what do you know how how much do
[15:30] you understand about um Behavior
[15:34] psychology biology ethology
[15:38] neuroscience and I'm not claiming that
[15:40] I'm an expert in any of those fields but
[15:42] what I am claiming is that I listen to
[15:44] people in those fields who make position
[15:47] statements on these matters and take my
[15:49] guidance from there as any responsible
[15:51] dog trainer should be doing rather than
[15:54] thinking that they Encompass more
[15:56] knowledge that has eluded the behavior
[15:59] your science community and they have
[16:01] somehow figured it out in order to
[16:03] believe austo deiva or trainers like him
[16:06] you have to believe that he is correct
[16:09] and the whole scientific Community Based
[16:11] on decades and Decades of research is
[16:15] wrong I think it can maybe feel kind of
[16:18] alienating to some people when you list
[16:21] things like you know animal behavior
[16:23] when you're listing all the Sciences
[16:26] because it can feel like that's not dog
[16:28] training so that's cool but I'm going to
[16:29] listen to a dog trainer and it's
[16:32] important to understand that these
[16:34] fields are dog training they're directly
[16:37] like the science of how dogs learn is
[16:39] dog training and it's important for
[16:41] trainers to understand that um and there
[16:45] there are dog there's crossover of dog
[16:47] trainers in all these other fields is I
[16:48] guess what I'm trying to say that's
[16:50] something that I think a lot of people
[16:52] genuinely don't realize and that's fine
[16:54] um I can I can see how it would be like
[16:56] that's cool you know someone's asking
[16:58] would you repeat what the problem with
[17:00] Caesar Milan is well if you look at
[17:02] Caesar Milan's past he he has put a lot
[17:05] of pseudo science into the population
[17:08] I'm sure he believes it but it's pseudo
[17:10] science pack Theory being the alpha
[17:12] being dominant uh these are all
[17:15] extensively debunked ideas in the
[17:18] scientific Community nonetheless it
[17:21] feels good I suppose to some or you know
[17:23] if if you have a certain worldview where
[17:25] you think man I I want to be able to
[17:27] punish my dog or or whatever I don't
[17:29] want anyone telling me I can't do it
[17:30] there's nothing I can do about that but
[17:32] if we are concerned with progress and we
[17:34] don't want these toxic ideas to get in
[17:37] the way of progress we're just trying to
[17:39] shine a light on that we're taking a lot
[17:41] of heat as you might imagine um even
[17:44] though I've got three three and a half
[17:45] million subscribers on YouTube number at
[17:48] the number one position currently don't
[17:50] know how long that'll be but number two
[17:52] 3 four five maybe six are all compulsion
[17:55] trainers yanking and cranking dogs to
[17:57] address serious behavior problems so I
[18:01] am we are definitely outnumbered in
[18:03] terms of public perception on this
[18:05] because I believe the public wants to
[18:08] believe deeply that if I just do this
[18:11] one thing I can shut a down dog I can
[18:13] shut down the dog like that that
[18:15] addresses and fixes my problem and it
[18:18] doesn't it just doesn't and that's what
[18:20] we want you to understand doesn't mean
[18:22] it has to be some ridiculously
[18:24] complicated task Environmental
[18:26] Management counterconditioning
[18:29] desensitizing our dogs these are all
[18:30] very basic principles making sure you
[18:32] have a medical exam before you address
[18:34] any issues of aggression to make sure
[18:35] it's not medically uh related do you
[18:38] think austo is saying you need to go to
[18:40] a vet and see if there are any medical
[18:41] conditions causing your dog's aggression
[18:43] no he just drags the dog to the center
[18:45] of the room and starts yanking at their
[18:47] neck it's it's unacceptable
[18:51] for a noname person to do it but for
[18:54] someone who is reaching the public no no
[18:57] sir this abusive dog training methods
[18:59] will not go unchallenged any
[19:04] longer um we and yes we are raising hell
[19:07] about this because we think it's a
[19:08] serious issue Instagram I mean we've
[19:10] never seen anything like this guys it's
[19:12] never been uh this heated if you if you
[19:16] need to
[19:17] see can you go ahead and pull me up some
[19:19] voll please from the recent Instagram
[19:21] video you can do it on my phone if you'd
[19:22] like because I know you're keeping
[19:23] comments there and I'll keep it going I
[19:25] just want to have that I want okay
[19:29] do you want to go look at the no it's
[19:31] not that saying of YouTube no I just
[19:33] don't know where Ina is uh she normally
[19:36] doesn't care about moose but if she's
[19:38] allowed to Market a moose I didn't want
[19:39] her to get startled by him so I was
[19:40] trying to go find out okay Boll Boll I
[19:42] think you should start training very
[19:43] aggressive dogs and showing it on
[19:45] YouTube a lot of people say that to me
[19:46] and I do work with dogs with bite
[19:48] histories and I deescalate them rather
[19:51] than escalating them like we see without
[19:52] Al Gusto you guys are a lot of people
[19:54] are being gaslit into thinking he's
[19:56] working with really aggressive dogs but
[19:58] he intentionally triggering it experts
[20:00] can see this very clearly which is why
[20:02] we're outraged by it it is completely
[20:05] unethical to trigger aggression to then
[20:08] punish it out of a dog this is 1920s
[20:11] stuff these are not original methods
[20:13] this is just archaic and a bad idea
[20:16] doesn't fix anything it just scares the
[20:18] crap out of a dog and you're teaching
[20:20] that dog don't give you warning signs in
[20:22] the future and then when a toddler falls
[20:24] on them they attack and murder the dog I
[20:26] mean could you know the kid potentially
[20:28] or the kid or
[20:30] whatever um so there's extensive
[20:33] knowledge we have a lot of people in
[20:34] here who are just going to be like Zack
[20:35] you're star in trouble and that's really
[20:36] what they want to believe and that's
[20:38] okay that is not what we're trying to do
[20:40] here I'm trying to have a good faith
[20:42] conversation I think I've reached out to
[20:44] dog Daddy followers more than he has
[20:46] throughout all of this to really try and
[20:48] make sure that we're communicating why
[20:50] we're doing what we're doing every step
[20:51] of the way um I I've told you again Joel
[20:55] Beckman is is just a symptom of a
[20:58] greater problem here that Society is
[21:00] confused about this matter that they
[21:02] think addressing symptoms are acceptable
[21:06] rather than addressing underlying causes
[21:08] and there are many charlatans in our
[21:12] field
[21:14] um so yeah I mean again we're the point
[21:17] it's not about the individuals it's
[21:19] about the methods but if there are
[21:20] high-profile members of the public
[21:22] propagating this type of BS we're going
[21:24] to call it out we have to call it out
[21:26] not just me I have the backing
[21:29] of of I mean do you know how many
[21:32] organizations have come out in the last
[21:34] two weeks against dog Daddy the pet
[21:36] professional Guild the association of
[21:38] professional dog trainers the rspca has
[21:40] been in direct contact with him trying
[21:42] to discourage him from coming to the UK
[21:45] uh I mean there's more there's Victoria
[21:48] Stillwell has come out Michael shikashio
[21:51] who is a positive trainer who a modern
[21:53] trainer uh behavior is he a behaviorist
[21:55] proper uh specializes in he specializ
[21:58] with dogs with aggression issues he has
[22:00] come out and made a statement and shown
[22:02] you and yeah oh thank you is this this
[22:05] yeah it's Instagram so I'm just I'm just
[22:07] going to hold up my phone here so you
[22:09] can understand what we're talking about
[22:11] here and so you don't just think I'm
[22:12] trying to pick on another individual I'm
[22:14] not I take great I take no joy in it and
[22:17] I think there's exceptional
[22:18] responsibility when you are going to put
[22:20] this type of pressure on an individual
[22:22] so I want you to understand why we're
[22:23] doing it um I need basically b-roll up
[22:25] here but that's okay it's I can't really
[22:27] navigate that I know it's kind I mean I
[22:31] understand that when I show you you
[22:33] understand if I don't show you you think
[22:35] I'm starting
[22:36] trouble I I'm not that familiar with
[22:38] Will Atherton to be honest with you and
[22:41] this isn't about again I don't want us
[22:42] to get too distracted by individuals as
[22:45] much as I want you to understand that if
[22:47] someone is using pain or discomfort as a
[22:50] premeditated approach to train dogs then
[22:53] that is a deeply flawed approach
[22:56] according to every relevant scientific
[22:58] body spanning from fields of biology
[23:00] Psychology ethology and
[23:03] Neuroscience excuse me um and and so I
[23:08] mean I know that this is a passionate
[23:12] issue and I know it's an emotional issue
[23:15] for people but we really do need to move
[23:17] Beyond using pain to train we really do
[23:20] there's no excuse now look let me give
[23:22] you an example cuz I think what a lot of
[23:23] people here when I say that is they say
[23:25] oh you're just going to throw hot dogs
[23:26] at an aggressive dog for example
[23:29] that's not what I'm saying in the event
[23:31] we are dealing with a dog who is
[23:32] actively aggressing we have to do
[23:34] whatever is necessary to quell that
[23:37] aggression even if it means using pain
[23:39] and discomfort to stop it but what we do
[23:42] next is key number one we shouldn't be
[23:44] Tre a true professional knows how to not
[23:46] trigger a dog most of the time virtually
[23:49] all of the time sure there are things
[23:50] that happen where we make bad judgments
[23:52] and a dog aggresses but if they do yeah
[23:55] we got to do what we get do to stop them
[23:57] but don't confuse that with train tring
[23:59] that's not dog training that's
[24:01] management now that we have that
[24:03] information we have to take that into
[24:05] account as we continue to modify the
[24:07] dog's behavior and address the
[24:09] underlying cause Environmental
[24:11] Management is key so take out Gusto de
[24:14] oliv Vera known as the dog daddy and his
[24:16] current class structure he will bring
[24:20] so-called aggressive reactive dogs into
[24:22] one room further escalating stress for
[24:25] any of these dogs he will then pull them
[24:28] by the leash again escalating stress he
[24:30] doesn't know what he's doing here this
[24:32] is why and and the public doesn't
[24:34] understand this either further
[24:36] escalating until we get a reaction at
[24:38] which time he attempts to violently in
[24:41] many cases punish aggression out of
[24:43] these dogs never addressing the
[24:45] underlying cause this is YouTube so
[24:47] hopefully you can navigate a little
[24:48] Smoother by jumping forward and back
[24:50] okay it's the Reon yeah you know I mean
[24:51] we've seen this this is uh this is
[24:54] Nikita he has where he's just yanking
[24:56] and cranking that's what we call
[24:57] trainers like this you're going to see
[24:59] him um yeah I really wish we had better
[25:02] be roll lined up here but we'll show
[25:03] shots here that's okay it's not your
[25:05] fault I went on I just went on you know
[25:07] this is another dog you can see he's
[25:09] just yanking by the neck this is
[25:11] outdated stuff you all this is not
[25:13] something modern dog trainers do anymore
[25:15] I'm not the only one saying this I'm we
[25:17] as a dog training industry are speaking
[25:18] with one voice right now that abusive
[25:21] dog training methods like this won't go
[25:24] unchallenged there he's just poking a
[25:25] dog with a stick just poking a dog with
[25:27] a stick in a crate
[25:28] word has it that he deprived that dog of
[25:31] water
[25:32] allegedly uh and kept him in a crate
[25:35] until he was able
[25:37] to I don't know what the logic is quite
[25:40] honestly um this is a recent YouTube
[25:42] video that's a recent YouTube video I
[25:44] posted and look you know you got he's
[25:46] got a lot of supporters out there who
[25:48] just don't understand and we some of
[25:50] those people are
[25:53] um you know Joel Beckman has much more
[25:57] animal and you ever could okay I mean if
[26:00] that's what you want to think and if
[26:01] that's true then I would ask why he
[26:04] would go against the entire behavior
[26:05] science Community does he know more than
[26:07] the whole behavior science Community
[26:08] it's not about me I suck let's just say
[26:10] I suck you don't I don't have to be a
[26:12] good dog trainer to be correct about
[26:14] this I I don't have to have ever seen a
[26:16] dog to be correct about what I'm saying
[26:18] you know what I'm saying
[26:20] um don't mistake a confident speaker
[26:24] with someone who is scientifically
[26:26] literate mhm
[26:28] I think that is a big problem as well
[26:30] people can be very compelling if you
[26:32] listen to a recent uh conversation he
[26:35] had with austo DEA he talks about how he
[26:37] has to massage AKA manipulate people
[26:40] into being inflicting pain and
[26:43] discomfort on their dog again
[26:46] which does not being Ed you can still be
[26:49] educated and be wrong on something but
[26:51] this isn't an opinion what I am telling
[26:53] you this is the entire behavior science
[26:55] Community you see so in order to believe
[26:58] what you're believing you have to
[26:59] believe that a single individual
[27:01] possesses more knowledge than the body
[27:03] of evidence and that should be a red
[27:05] flag to you if it isn't I don't know
[27:07] what to tell you I mean I'm just trying
[27:08] to help you guys I'm not sure if you've
[27:10] seen this one um it's from Instagram M
[27:14] recently this is a dog in a class uh
[27:18] just like last week I think maybe this
[27:20] week yeah we had protesters outside of
[27:22] this class I believe fearful dog and he
[27:24] just do you see how he's pulling the dog
[27:26] right there just pulling it have Millie
[27:27] pulled up if you don't after this if you
[27:29] can pull up Millie can you take this
[27:31] yeah sure absolutely so right there I
[27:33] mean you know you might look at that and
[27:34] say hey there's no problem with that but
[27:36] right there you're triggering fear
[27:38] intentionally now he's I assure you he's
[27:40] toning his behavior down because we have
[27:42] people watching every move he makes
[27:44] right now including Animal Welfare
[27:46] Services yesterday in Toronto or this
[27:48] weekend in Toronto uh we had protests
[27:51] outside of his venue there we had the
[27:53] authorities on board so of course you
[27:54] know he's on his good behavior right now
[27:56] and if that's what it takes if we have
[27:57] to just
[27:58] go around behind him and make sure we
[28:00] have someone to babysit him everywhere
[28:01] he goes to keep from harming dogs that's
[28:03] what we're going to do we're not having
[28:07] it yeah dogs and wolves are very
[28:09] different that's a mistake so people
[28:11] Zach let's see you work with an
[28:13] aggressive
[28:14] dog what no sorry I was just trying to
[28:16] help you navigate the oh yeah I got you
[28:18] and just do it like this here here we go
[28:21] so I just want to show you some b-roll
[28:22] here of a dog this is this video is a
[28:25] few years old and I this is a dog named
[28:27] Millie that I I worked with I'm trying
[28:28] to get you a KN reflection this is a dog
[28:31] who is nervous I believe this dog had a
[28:33] bite history as well nervous of men in
[28:35] particular do you see how I'm holding
[28:37] out my hand do you see how I'm trying to
[28:39] build trust with that dog I'm not going
[28:42] up there and yanking them me fast
[28:45] forward here get you some good you know
[28:48] here's the dog when I arrived and she's
[28:52] very nervous she's very nervous of
[28:54] coming to me yeah she would have looked
[28:55] just like that dog in the other video
[28:57] this is the kind of dog that austo would
[29:01] have on a leash and pull it towards him
[29:04] how hard is it to offer a dog a piece of
[29:06] meat you could drop it on the ground if
[29:08] if you were worried about getting bit uh
[29:10] I probably should have done that in this
[29:12] case look at the dog you can see the dog
[29:14] is nervous I mean apprehensive barking
[29:16] at me I don't have audio going right now
[29:18] backing away not accepting me you've
[29:20] seen Al Gusto work with dogs like this a
[29:22] million times where he just drags them
[29:24] around and starts cranking away there's
[29:27] no effort to build trust here all I'm
[29:29] doing right here I'm not training the
[29:30] dog I'm simply trying to make the dog
[29:32] comfortable with me right this is all
[29:35] we're doing here again dog is still very
[29:37] nervous not staying in my company but
[29:40] he's like well or she's like maybe I
[29:43] might want to come back for some more of
[29:44] that cuz that's some good stuff you look
[29:46] at that the international language of
[29:48] Peace for a dog is meat I'm pointing out
[29:51] some body language here showing the
[29:52] dog's uneasiness something we don't see
[29:54] from austo he's not uh literate in dog
[29:56] body language at all or if he is he
[29:58] doesn't care right again still very
[30:00] nervous let me fast forward a bit cuz
[30:04] you can always watch this video maybe
[30:06] someone can put it in the
[30:16] comments and so here you can see by the
[30:18] end of the video not only am I petting
[30:20] the dog I'm playing with the dog I'm the
[30:22] dog is rolling over I mean we are best
[30:24] buddies here and we've addressed the
[30:27] underlying cause fear do you see what
[30:30] we've done here this is how modern dog
[30:33] behavior and dog trainers go about this
[30:35] you reduce the fear you deescalate you
[30:38] don't escalate matters this is an
[30:40] outdated idea and I know I'm not going
[30:43] to convince everybody of this but there
[30:45] is an element of our culture that really
[30:48] values punishment of dogs and it's
[30:51] unfortunate I appreciate that Mario is
[30:53] there a list of resource of positive dog
[30:55] trainers out there yeah I mean there yes
[30:57] there are and fortunately the public is
[30:59] confused on this so we do live and that
[31:03] this confusion that the public has is
[31:05] underscores the need for lure in our
[31:08] profession so that the public can trust
[31:10] that if they are working with a
[31:11] professional dog trainer that this dog
[31:13] trainer has some level of knowledge
[31:16] rather than this garbage crap training
[31:19] we're seeing from austo De Olivera known
[31:21] as the dog Daddy you that's not meant to
[31:22] insult that is that is a reality that is
[31:24] a
[31:26] fact uh you were saying I'm sorry oh I
[31:29] didn't know well did they see the play
[31:31] part the end of this video where she's
[31:33] comfortable and playing which was happen
[31:35] without her ever being put on a leash
[31:37] yeah I never needed a leash I never
[31:39] needed to touch the dog in order to get
[31:42] that type of energy out of her and her
[31:44] body language here I mean she's still
[31:47] you know she's like okay cool I'll play
[31:48] with you like I think we might be
[31:50] friends I think I'm okay she's not like
[31:51] you're my best friend I love you but
[31:53] she's definitely getting so much more
[31:54] comfortable I only showed that to you
[31:56] not to say oh look at how great I am I
[31:58] say that to so that you understand that
[32:00] we must address underlying causes not
[32:02] merely the symptom and that is why it is
[32:05] tragic that so many people are being
[32:07] duped by the snake oil salesman known as
[32:10] the dog Daddy who doesn't have a clue
[32:11] what he is doing or if he does he's not
[32:14] showing us that he knows what he's doing
[32:16] you know and again I'm not trying to
[32:17] just trash talk people but this is a
[32:20] problem right now it's a big
[32:22] problem uh and and and part of me coming
[32:24] live right now is merely to to take your
[32:27] comments head on to tell me where you
[32:29] think I wrong I'm I really am trying to
[32:31] cater this to dog Daddy followers
[32:33] because I know you guys are upset you
[32:35] like this guy this is someone you've
[32:37] trusted maybe you've implemented the
[32:39] methods maybe you think you've learned
[32:40] something from him but this is the
[32:43] charlatan of our
[32:44] industry right here this is you know um
[32:48] I'm trying to think of a good
[32:49] counterpart why are we showing this
[32:51] because look at this dog's body langage
[32:53] what am I missing oh right yeah it's
[32:55] just a shut down dog a success shot
[32:59] deal and that dog looks so uncomfortable
[33:02] right he's the dog is clearly not
[33:03] learning anything so yeah that's right
[33:06] brie is pointing out that often when you
[33:07] see the success shots the dogs don't
[33:09] appear happy but that they're in a
[33:11] physical position sure they're not
[33:12] lunging and I I understand the false
[33:15] dichotomy that people this is a
[33:16] fallacious form of logic that people are
[33:18] susceptible to that let's take the worst
[33:21] case scenario dog is going to be put
[33:23] down or the Guardians are going to get
[33:24] rid of the dog or whatever and and this
[33:27] is a last Resort so we've got to do this
[33:29] harsh training the problem is that
[33:31] temporary suppression and modifying
[33:33] Behavior longterm are not the same thing
[33:36] he's not helping anybody that doesn't
[33:38] help the dog at all that doesn't
[33:40] communicate to the dog what to do how to
[33:42] feel because these behaviors are
[33:43] emotionally driven do you see
[33:48] um and so it's not accurate to say that
[33:51] someone is saving a dog's life if you're
[33:54] cuz you can also get the same result
[33:56] without causing trouble to the dog and
[33:58] increasing the likelihood of problem
[34:01] behavior in the future which is exactly
[34:03] what the data shows not madeup stuff not
[34:06] an opinion you all can do your own
[34:08] autonomous scientific research on the
[34:10] topic we have we've documented it well
[34:12] throughout videos but don't take my word
[34:14] for it go to somebody else go read the
[34:16] studies yourself go take psychology go
[34:18] get a biology degree um go get a
[34:21] neuroscience degree do the relevant
[34:23] research so that you're scientifically
[34:24] literate and that you're able to
[34:26] understand peerreview dat
[34:28] oh yeah I remember B I don't remember
[34:30] this 10 years old it's from dog training
[34:33] class so forgive the navigation a bit
[34:36] but I want to show B okay let me see
[34:38] here he's almost there his big face was
[34:40] coming up yeah I want to make sure we
[34:42] know what we're showing here right now
[34:43] they're not going to know if I just show
[34:44] you know what I mean oh have a this
[34:46] video is called working with a fearful
[34:48] or nervous dog um and it's a old clip
[34:52] from dog training class of a dog in a
[34:55] situation that is very similar to a dog
[34:57] daddy class this dog's name is Bo and
[35:00] he's upset he he's scared and Zach saw
[35:03] that so Zach left right give him space
[35:06] he walked away I was like did I drag the
[35:08] dog to the middle no I gave the dog a
[35:10] little bit of space that's what I do
[35:12] with dogs who were nervous who have bite
[35:13] histories in my class I give them space
[35:16] to get build comfort with them and I
[35:17] come back and we I mean we had wonderful
[35:19] success with B yeah this was filmed over
[35:22] the course of a 1-hour class I think uh
[35:24] and Zach would come give the dog a
[35:27] little a little bit of attention and
[35:28] then Retreat and give him some space to
[35:31] you know deal with that that's right
[35:32] then after class after the other dogs
[35:34] left they stayed so that the dog could
[35:37] have some quiet time to get to know Zach
[35:39] without the stress of other dogs and
[35:41] people there and that really made a big
[35:43] difference okay you do remember this I
[35:44] didn't remember this yeah you can see
[35:46] he's off leash and this this is a video
[35:48] that uh I think is really great and I
[35:50] just saw somebody say okay you've got
[35:51] one video so I thought aside from the
[35:53] point that it doesn't matter how many
[35:54] videos we have cuz this is about dog
[35:56] training methods not about Zack versus
[35:58] dog Daddy but that's right and a good
[36:01] example if I could also point out that I
[36:04] yeah I don't have to be good I don't
[36:06] have to be competent to be right on this
[36:08] I'm I'm I will except for argument sake
[36:10] for everyone who wants to be like Zack
[36:11] you don't know what you mean you don't
[36:13] know what you're talking about that's
[36:14] okay you can say that and I'll accept it
[36:16] for argument sake I don't have to be
[36:18] good to be correct about this because
[36:20] I'm not relying on my intuition I'm
[36:22] relying on the body of evidence uh
[36:24] before us Force only seems to work if
[36:27] you are big and stronger than the dog
[36:29] yeah I mean sure there is that I've done
[36:32] positive reinforcement with my dog and
[36:33] he's still quite aggressive to other
[36:35] dogs yeah well it does take skill it's
[36:37] not simp positive reinforcement I think
[36:39] people have a very dumb down version of
[36:41] what that means the elements related to
[36:44] positive reinforcement such as
[36:45] desensitizing and counter counter
[36:48] conditioning habituating uh even
[36:51] sensitizing comes into play as well you
[36:53] want to be conscious of overly
[36:54] sensitizing your dog to certain things
[36:56] it does take skill and knowledge to be
[36:57] able to address these issues so if you
[36:59] are an amateur or someone at home it is
[37:02] quite possible that yeah you're going to
[37:03] have a little bit of trouble um and if
[37:05] you use punishment you're not addressing
[37:07] anything you're creating an illusion and
[37:09] very almost certainly creating
[37:11] additional issues unnecessarily and
[37:13] you're being told to do it by so-called
[37:15] professionals and I I don't blame you
[37:17] individuals for doing that you're just
[37:19] trying to get an answer you assume that
[37:21] if someone's got 2 million followers on
[37:23] YouTube and and they say they train dogs
[37:26] you're assuming they must know what
[37:27] they're talking talking about in reality
[37:29] we have exactly that we have someone who
[37:31] does not know what they're talking about
[37:33] and it's demonstrated with every action
[37:35] they take with a dog virtually so now am
[37:38] I saying austo is wrong about every
[37:39] single thing he ever says and does I I
[37:42] he doesn't talk too much it's mostly
[37:43] just yank and crank I'm sure something
[37:46] he says might be correct I mean a broken
[37:48] clock is correct twice a day after all
[37:51] nonetheless nonetheless we have to call
[37:53] out problematic practices where we see
[37:56] it and
[37:58] not this isn't me this is the entire
[37:59] industry right now who is outraged by
[38:02] the fact that this guy is promoting
[38:03] dangerous advice creating a public
[38:06] health and safety risk and if there's
[38:08] any good to come from this our hope is
[38:11] that these these events will be a
[38:13] catalyst for lure it takes someone being
[38:15] downright abusive to dogs in the public
[38:17] eye I believe for us to talk about that
[38:22] because once you see what we're talking
[38:24] about once you see what he the body
[38:26] language in become proficient in Reading
[38:29] dog dog body language and basic Behavior
[38:31] things you can't unsee it and you know
[38:34] uh I mean dog professionals understand
[38:37] like that what's going on he can just
[38:39] show me the after clip and we can tell
[38:41] you very likely how that result which is
[38:45] not a result it's a scared dog is
[38:47] achieved and he's banking on you the
[38:50] public he's banking on you accepting
[38:53] that as good enough because you are not
[38:55] Behavior experts as the public
[38:58] do you know and that's okay we can't all
[39:00] be experts in everything but at the very
[39:02] least someone who claims to be a
[39:03] professional should be giving you
[39:06] realistic advice and we're very
[39:08] passionate about scientific knowledge
[39:09] and scientific education here not only
[39:12] in dog training but across the board we
[39:14] think scientific literacy is something
[39:16] that if we could improve that in our
[39:17] society that things would be so much
[39:23] better um and again here I'm because I
[39:27] I've read a lot of the comments in our
[39:28] last video from dog Daddy supporters um
[39:32] who are unclear on a lot of things
[39:33] that's the main reason that I'm doing
[39:35] this broadcast right now is I want to
[39:37] reach out to you guys you you love dogs
[39:40] some of you might just be Die Hard fans
[39:42] and you don't care what I say and that's
[39:43] also okay I appreciate that you're here
[39:47] um yeah Michael shikashio has a lot of
[39:50] great stuff we're definitely going to
[39:51] bring you more content relating to dogs
[39:53] with bite history clearly you guys need
[39:55] that and want that I have a series of
[39:57] puppy Survival Guide coming out soon
[39:59] which I'm currently working on post-
[40:00] production with uh but yeah we have a
[40:02] lot of ideas to really grab this issue
[40:05] by the horns and help you all understand
[40:08] where you've been misled as a public uh
[40:11] but it's not again it's not just an
[40:13] issue of differences it's an issue of
[40:16] Public Safety because when you don't
[40:17] address these causes and You Yank and
[40:19] crank dogs by the neck like that you
[40:21] increase fear thereby increasing the
[40:23] odds of aggress aggressive behavior in
[40:25] the future for those of you that have
[40:27] have taken a psychology class uh for
[40:30] those of you that have scientific
[40:32] literacy I think you will understand
[40:34] what's going on here uh for those of you
[40:37] who are just not educated at all in
[40:39] behavior that doesn't you don't have an
[40:41] obligation to be educated but I'm doing
[40:44] my best to communicate in good faith to
[40:46] you what the problems are with
[40:50] it
[40:52] um yes are were you keeping up questions
[40:54] not sure which kind of no I have so much
[40:57] different Boll and different stuff for
[40:59] you to choose oh yeah whatever you have
[41:00] you go take over I have shade I don't
[41:01] know if shade's a secret so no shade
[41:03] this is this is the star of our next
[41:05] series that is a Kane corso and that'd
[41:08] be a nice thumbnail right there I like
[41:09] that one that shade we he spent a little
[41:12] over two weeks with us and we're
[41:13] producing that Series right now uh it's
[41:16] going to be a good one on that series I
[41:19] have really gone into some new Concepts
[41:21] I think you guys are going to love it
[41:22] but again I'm not here for
[41:23] self-promotion right here I'm I'm
[41:25] there's a crisis in our industry and I
[41:26] want to be open
[41:27] and communicate with you guys about that
[41:30] has dog Daddy reached out to me I don't
[41:32] believe so and if he did it wouldn't
[41:34] matter I think he had his conduct has
[41:36] been disqualifying from him to be taken
[41:38] seriously ever again in this industry as
[41:40] far as I'm concerned but again I'm I'm
[41:42] only one person but I find his behavior
[41:44] to be deeply offensive and egregious and
[41:47] I mean I I personally believe he belongs
[41:49] in jail I believe he's committed animal
[41:50] abuse but I'm not a legal Authority so
[41:52] that's up to the authorities um but no I
[41:56] it's
[41:57] it's unfortunate you know because it's
[42:00] not that he uses the problematic dog
[42:02] training in and of itself that is the
[42:04] problem it is the refusal to grow right
[42:06] it is the refusal to say you know what I
[42:09] could learn something here not from me
[42:12] but from it but you know from other
[42:15] people science can be cruel I'm not sure
[42:18] what the intention of that statement is
[42:20] thank you Rob I appreciate that glad you
[42:22] agree um tell me what tell me where you
[42:26] think I'm wrong guys for those of you
[42:27] who disagree with what I'm saying I
[42:28] really want to hear why you think I'm
[42:29] wrong so I can address it and explain to
[42:31] you why I think I'm right or or not or
[42:33] maybe you'll say something that will
[42:34] totally convince me and I will have to
[42:36] resend honestly Zach isn't anyone no
[42:39] offense Zach he's a good trainer but uh
[42:42] what he's brilliant at is communicating
[42:44] to the general audience in a world of
[42:46] celebrities uh that are full of BS thank
[42:49] you yeah I'll take that I yeah I'm not
[42:52] one of these people whose
[42:55] inner satisfaction requires on being
[42:58] recognized as great I do view myself
[43:01] somewhat as a science Communicator at
[43:03] least in this narrow field I try to
[43:07] be you should talk to a professional
[43:09] about this oh I think you're talking to
[43:11] someone in the comments yeah we I this
[43:14] is a recent one and I didn't know if you
[43:15] were wanted to show more footage or not
[43:18] um but it's one I thought you might want
[43:20] to show and it reminded me of Delta so I
[43:22] also pulled up Delta right uh if you
[43:23] guys want I'll show you some clips here
[43:25] of Delta this is a rare inst where I I
[43:28] made an error with a dog with a bite
[43:30] history and inadvertently triggered them
[43:32] to snap at me so I
[43:36] instructed um The Guardian to show up
[43:39] with this dog with a muzzle so that cuz
[43:41] I knew the dog had a bite history with
[43:43] people and so I wanted to protect myself
[43:46] and so here you can see that I'm petting
[43:48] the dog I'm engaged in conversation not
[43:50] really thinking right now this is an
[43:51] error this is wrong and I did it I want
[43:54] to I want to own that and so there you
[43:55] can see she snaps she's like get your
[43:57] hand off of me what do I do do I grab
[44:00] the leash and start yanking and cranking
[44:02] to shut the dog down no I step away I
[44:05] deescalate it's of no benefit to me to
[44:08] address an underlying problem if I'm
[44:10] going to further exacerbate it and say
[44:12] yeah you were right to be fear I'm going
[44:13] to kick your butt right now because now
[44:15] we've just validated it um and so
[44:18] throughout this this is how I take an
[44:20] initial consultation when I'm dealing
[44:22] with a dog of a bite history I'm letting
[44:23] mom hold the dog so dog feels
[44:25] comfortable we're starting to see the
[44:27] language of the dog becoming more
[44:29] comfortable right so I'm keeping my
[44:31] distance don't need to touch the dog at
[44:32] all don't worry there's more right you
[44:35] don't challenge aggression this is
[44:36] what's intuitive to people who grow up
[44:38] in punishment culture you fight
[44:39] aggression with aggression and see who
[44:41] wins that's the part of your brain that
[44:44] you're being tricked by if you're
[44:45] believing that dog Daddy has any
[44:47] legitimate scientific value suppressing
[44:50] your emotions doesn't work doesn't work
[44:52] with your dogs either I know that most
[44:54] of you are intelligent emotionally
[44:56] mature enough to realize that but you
[44:57] know this dogs and people are virtually
[45:00] identical emotively so here I am doing
[45:02] some lure training notice dog is still
[45:04] muzzled this is a dog who has bitten
[45:05] people and mom's holding her leash mom's
[45:08] still holding the leash right and so
[45:11] here I am I'm I'm cautiously luring I
[45:13] know I'm relatively protected I'm
[45:15] looking at the body language of the dog
[45:17] look at the frog legs look at the
[45:18] relaxed nature of this dog now critics
[45:21] of mine will say Zack that dog isn't
[45:22] aggressive and I take that as a
[45:24] compliment because you're not seeing
[45:25] further aggression display you see what
[45:27] I'm saying where if you're seeing a dog
[45:30] act aggressively that is trainer error
[45:32] because competent trainers don't trigger
[45:34] aggression uh and if you are seeing a
[45:36] Caesar Milan type a dog Daddy type A
[45:39] Beckman type sitting there and
[45:41] triggering the dogs these are highly
[45:44] unethical approaches that don't address
[45:46] underlying cause and merely serve the
[45:49] Public's desire for a quick fix but I
[45:52] know most of you are intelligent enough
[45:54] to understand that quick fixes are not a
[45:57] thing when we're dealing with living
[45:59] breathing thinking sentient beings like
[46:01] dogs here we even getting some tricks in
[46:03] this dog is taking direction from me
[46:05] this dog snapped at me moments ago tried
[46:07] to bite me and now we've got a dog
[46:09] playing dead and we're building Rapport
[46:11] and am I saying oh problem fixed no I'm
[46:13] not saying this is a quick fix either
[46:15] but what I am saying is that we are
[46:18] addressing the underlying cause this is
[46:20] why you don't see aggressive dogs in my
[46:23] videos this is why it's not that I shy
[46:26] away from dogs with fight histories it's
[46:28] because I deescalate and they don't come
[46:30] off as aggressive can I show a
[46:32] comparison yeah sure so this dog is the
[46:35] dog that reminded me of Delta the dog in
[46:37] the video you just saw and so I pull
[46:41] have this pulled up too this is just
[46:42] from a couple days
[46:44] ago you can see he just drags the dog
[46:47] towards him the dog is clearly afraid
[46:49] I'm trying to
[46:51] mhm now the dog shuts down it's called
[46:54] learned helplessness now he is cutting
[46:56] these down or he's dumbing down his
[46:58] training because he knows we're watching
[47:00] him you know what I mean we are we are
[47:01] present in his classes outside of his
[47:03] classes everything he does We Have Eyes
[47:05] on right now because we believe he's a
[47:07] public safety
[47:09] concern so anyway here's your
[47:11] aftershot um and it's kind of hard to
[47:16] see but I would this is actually a video
[47:17] that was posted by uh someone else with
[47:20] a voiceover explaining the body language
[47:22] of the dog and reasons the dog is
[47:24] uncomfortable and not in a state to be
[47:26] learning please keep in mind what you're
[47:28] seeing right now is the very tame
[47:30] version of what he does we're not
[47:31] claiming you know this is just his most
[47:34] recent video I think yeah well you can't
[47:36] really be his most recent stuff he's
[47:38] under immense public pressure right now
[47:40] because of us in the dog training
[47:41] community so he's I mean he was training
[47:43] with hot dogs that's how desperate he is
[47:45] right now to try and recover from this
[47:47] another dog that also reminds me of
[47:49] Delta
[47:54] can just see that right there I mean
[47:56] that that little thing while to the
[47:58] average person that little pulling of
[48:00] the dog away that is highly unethical
[48:03] just that right there and this is very
[48:05] tame compared to the other stuff he does
[48:07] you shouldn't have to pull a dog like
[48:09] that if you had an ounce of skill you
[48:11] would be able to get that dog to
[48:12] voluntarily come to you yeah so he could
[48:14] see the dog was shut down so he removed
[48:16] the muscle anyway you can see those you
[48:18] like all right but yeah so I'm I hope
[48:22] we're making a little bit of head we're
[48:24] just trying to move the needle here to
[48:25] help people understand where we're
[48:26] coming from this is the last thing I
[48:27] want to do I take no joy in this uh but
[48:30] I'm also hoping to I really am hoping I
[48:34] have this optimistic mindset that if you
[48:36] are a fan of dog Daddy if you have been
[48:39] persuaded by him in the past that you uh
[48:42] might be able to see another side we
[48:44] talk about this a lot there's something
[48:46] called conservatism bias that all of us
[48:48] humans are subjected to uh including
[48:52] myself including Bri including all of
[48:54] you where we are more likely to believe
[48:58] a the first thing we heard than the
[49:00] second thing we heard so if you fall
[49:02] into this as your introduction to dog
[49:04] training you're more likely to give that
[49:05] more weight than what I'm telling you if
[49:08] I'm the second person you have uh heard
[49:11] even even if the second thing is true
[49:13] and the first thing is wrong you're
[49:15] still more likely to believe the first
[49:17] thing unless you're aware of the bias
[49:19] and can critically think and evaluate
[49:20] and then you can realize guess I was
[49:22] wrong about that but notice that in your
[49:24] own life and across not just dog
[49:26] training but I mean I find myself doing
[49:28] it to this day like oh I heard this and
[49:30] then I go down I'm assuming that thing
[49:32] is true and
[49:34] then find out well that wasn't true so
[49:38] now I got to go back and dismantle all
[49:39] that crap you know so Zach does not show
[49:43] real life scenarios oh Zeus No that's
[49:45] not correct um we go out of our way to
[49:48] be ultra realistic in fact when I shoot
[49:50] dog training content these days for
[49:52] example a series I just shot those dogs
[49:54] live with me 24 hours a day we go into
[49:57] public with them we go through
[49:59] socialization uh I treat these dogs as
[50:01] though they are my dogs for the time
[50:03] that I have them and so we go out of our
[50:05] way to show real life scenarios and
[50:06] long-term viewers will back me up on
[50:08] that that is not a a criticism that is
[50:12] legitimate Nance P we understand what
[50:14] you're doing tell me what I'm doing n p
[50:17] uh I'm about to get a puppy and I've
[50:19] been watching your videos um the
[50:22] comments disappear before I can read
[50:24] them but that's okay um everyone has
[50:27] time to watch lives or they pop back in
[50:29] and it's out it's dinner time okay oh
[50:31] yeah someone was asking about the number
[50:33] of viewers I think about I think that's
[50:35] what it what it's in response to okay
[50:39] yeah I mean this is just up for anyone
[50:40] who wants to listen who cares about this
[50:42] topic uh some people don't care and
[50:43] that's okay I just you know I'm a dog
[50:45] trainer I have a responsibility to the
[50:47] public and I'm trying to
[50:51] communicate hi from New Zealand hey New
[50:53] Zealand how's it going I used to love
[50:55] Caesar Milan until I watch the first
[50:57] it's me or the dog and then realize we
[50:58] don't need to shush dogs I know yeah
[51:00] exactly and I mean the authority that TV
[51:03] gives you if you're on TV boy you you
[51:05] must be legit and nothing could be
[51:08] further from the truth in dog
[51:11] training and this is coming from someone
[51:13] who's had two TV shows myself that
[51:16] doesn't make me credible I could still
[51:18] be lying I could still be
[51:20] wrong um I previously used pron collar
[51:23] until I found you Zach that's good to
[51:24] hear Scarlet I appreciate that yeah and
[51:27] like and for those who feel judged
[51:29] because I know I talk uh you know about
[51:31] using pain and discomfort and how we
[51:32] shouldn't do that in training I get why
[51:34] you do it you've been told to you're
[51:36] assuming people like dog trainers have a
[51:38] level of Education where they know where
[51:40] they're coming from they're not required
[51:42] to have an education there's no dog
[51:44] training license at all right now you
[51:47] everyone watching this can say I'm a dog
[51:48] trainer go print up some business cards
[51:50] and start taking money from the public
[51:52] even if you don't know what you're doing
[51:53] and that is not a crime that is not
[51:55] illegal you're perfectly within your
[51:56] rights to do that that's what we see
[51:58] with dog
[52:01] Daddy um and again it's you know we're
[52:04] just talking about him because he's the
[52:06] flavor of the week in compulsion dog
[52:08] training and we are going to we are
[52:09] committed to raising awareness around
[52:11] him we're doing legal peaceful protests
[52:14] everywhere he goes around the world
[52:16] right now he's going in the UK this
[52:18] weekend we're already planning protests
[52:20] do you consider the dog in your video as
[52:23] aggressive as the dogs shown on Caesar
[52:26] Milan shows yeah yeah if you will do
[52:28] just a little bit of research on this
[52:30] you will find this on YouTube um the
[52:33] dogs on Caesar Milan show are very often
[52:37] intentionally triggered in fact there is
[52:40] a clip floating around on YouTube where
[52:43] a production assistant is being
[52:46] interviewed on one of these behind the
[52:47] scenes shows for and he says my name is
[52:50] so and so my job is to set off the dogs
[52:53] for the before shots and so they will
[52:55] trigger these dogs if emotionally to
[52:57] make it just to really make it clear
[52:59] Caesar's working with a serious
[53:01] aggressive dog here right now meanwhile
[53:05] one of the most common side effects for
[53:09] uh treating aggression with aggressive
[53:11] dog training tactics is increased
[53:13] aggression in the future now I don't
[53:14] know if this is the case but you know
[53:16] last year it the allegations regarding
[53:18] Caesar Milan very serious allegations
[53:20] regarding his own dogs being highly
[53:23] aggressive one of them allegedly ruined
[53:25] a gymnast career by attacking this is
[53:28] his personal dog again I I don't know
[53:31] what the circumstances were surrounding
[53:32] it maybe it had to do with his training
[53:33] methods maybe it didn't I don't know uh
[53:36] also another story around that time came
[53:38] out that his personal dog attacked queen
[53:41] or excuse me actually I don't know that
[53:44] that Queen Latifah's dog died in his
[53:47] custody and he attempted to cover it up
[53:49] so goes the allegation to my knowledge
[53:51] he hasn't publicly commented on it other
[53:54] than to say oh that's not true but you
[53:56] know then you have to explain why would
[53:58] a young gymnast make this up what is
[54:01] their motivation to do so I mean it
[54:03] would be wrong to make a false
[54:05] allegation as far as I can tell no one
[54:07] has been uh imprisoned for making false
[54:10] allegations or suffered any consequences
[54:12] so that's kind of a red flag but again
[54:14] that's that's getting into the Weeds on
[54:16] that that's not what I'm trying to do
[54:17] here I'm trying to point out that using
[54:20] aggressive uh methods on dogs can
[54:22] promote aggression and it's a little sus
[54:24] for someone who uses dominance Theory
[54:27] and outdated practices for their own dog
[54:30] to be accused of aggressing and I would
[54:32] like an explanation to that if we could
[54:33] get it but it's not personal it's just
[54:36] about the methods and using anti-science
[54:39] methods in an era where we have so much
[54:42] information on this topic more than the
[54:44] public
[54:45] realizes is unacceptable and we won't go
[54:49] we will not let it go un challenge
[54:50] whether it's Caesar Milan austo or
[54:52] anybody else we will challenge abusive
[54:54] dog training practices where we see them
[54:59] Zack you do such a good job that people
[55:01] mistake you for not working with
[55:02] aggressive dogs I know I know and look I
[55:04] will tell you it is not my specialty I
[55:06] don't go out seeking aggressive dogs I
[55:08] may in the future I'm I'm getting quite
[55:10] the education on a daily basis on this
[55:13] topic and talking to I you know I have
[55:15] the privilege of talking to some of the
[55:17] brightest Minds in my field they all
[55:18] return my emails I am very lucky that is
[55:21] one of the advantages to having millions
[55:23] of followers is that people who are very
[55:25] educated are anxious to get you the
[55:27] right information so that I can
[55:29] disseminate it do you know what I mean
[55:31] um and so while I don't specialize in it
[55:33] I don't shy away from it either assuming
[55:35] that I you know it looks like assuming I
[55:38] feel comfortable doing so and if I don't
[55:40] feel comfortable doing so I can refer it
[55:41] out to a proper
[55:43] behaviorist um but you
[55:46] know I mean I think that's the
[55:48] professional competent thing to
[55:51] do how long have we've been live 55
[55:53] minutes I you could put the evidence in
[55:55] their face and they would still reject
[55:56] it for some people yeah you can put
[55:58] evidence in their face and they would
[56:00] still reject it and but that's because
[56:01] this issue is very multifaceted it isn't
[56:04] just about the scientific data it is
[56:06] about a culture that values punishment
[56:08] it's about a culture that has
[56:10] significant toxic masculinity embedded
[56:12] in it particularly the dog training
[56:13] field which I can speak firsthand to we
[56:15] all know the Macho type of trainer who's
[56:17] too good for books who's too good for
[56:19] education and they're just experiencing
[56:22] going to work in the real world when in
[56:24] reality it takes extensive education or
[56:26] at least uh at least a basic
[56:28] understanding of behavior combined with
[56:30] experience I agree that experience and
[56:32] education are both necessary experience
[56:34] in and of itself means nothing without
[56:36] proper
[56:38] education uh can a dog me more dominant
[56:41] than its
[56:42] peers uh dominance is not a term that I
[56:45] use because it means different things to
[56:47] different people so it's not people like
[56:51] to just again this is the this is
[56:53] society being told by unqualified dog
[56:56] trainers that things can be reduced to
[56:59] something simple like dominance hey your
[57:02] dog's just trying to be dominant let's
[57:03] just fix that that'll resolve everything
[57:06] it's not that a dog is behaving
[57:07] dominantly it's that they have
[57:08] underlying emotional responses to things
[57:11] that need to be addressed dominance is a
[57:13] copout that's what amateurs say if
[57:15] anyone refers to a dog being dominant
[57:17] and we're trying to approach that they
[57:19] uh don't know what they're talking
[57:23] about most people don't address culture
[57:25] but you do thank you yeah I mean it is
[57:28] culture it's multifaceted guys it is it
[57:30] isn't just about the science it's there
[57:32] are toxic elements that find their their
[57:36] dirty tentacles in every industry on the
[57:40] planet and we're not going to take it
[57:43] we're just not going to take it it is
[57:45] done it is over I mean to the best of
[57:47] what well I don't know if it's done or
[57:49] it's over what I do know is I'm not
[57:51] going to be quiet and I know I'm just
[57:54] going to get more organized right now I
[57:56] mean and if anyone wants to assist you
[57:58] can always email me Zack George me.com
[58:00] we're currently in the market for legal
[58:03] professionals we're looking for
[58:04] volunteers right now because our budget
[58:06] isn't there but if if we have any
[58:07] Advocate attorneys out there who want to
[58:09] assist us with this to some degree I
[58:11] understand your time is valuable um PR
[58:14] people we're interested in getting this
[58:16] out to the media uh we're organizing
[58:19] protests in all the cities he goes to so
[58:22] we have we're getting a lot of
[58:24] organization there and one thing I
[58:26] learned is when you go through this
[58:27] effort to build a foundation not only
[58:29] with dogs but when you're organizing uh
[58:32] around Civic causes like this or culture
[58:35] cultural causes like this that that can
[58:39] that can build into something else and
[58:40] it wouldn't surprise me if this is one
[58:42] of those things don't group Caesar and
[58:44] with dog daddy why not why not I mean
[58:47] the the methods are virtually identical
[58:48] I mean maybe Caesar's toned it down over
[58:50] the years but you don't I haven't heard
[58:52] him back off of his General hypothesis
[58:55] they're plenty of there's a lot if if
[58:58] you will just have an open mind and do
[58:59] your research on this it's in non-cgi
[59:03] form of Caesar Milan yanking and
[59:06] cranking dogs I understand that people
[59:08] love him that doesn't mean his methods
[59:10] are scientifically sound doesn't mean
[59:12] he's wrong about everything either okay
[59:14] this isn't about vilifying a human this
[59:17] is about pointing out problematic advice
[59:18] to the public which creates a public
[59:20] health and safety risk and that is why
[59:23] we feel very confident in raising
[59:25] awareness around this
[59:28] issue uh what about par yeah I I don't I
[59:31] haven't even reached out to the Animal
[59:32] League defense fund I don't know
[59:33] anything about them honestly so if
[59:34] anyone could help I mean we do need help
[59:36] we are a two-person team so if anyone
[59:38] wants to help us with issues like this
[59:40] if you are an advocate in this uh thing
[59:43] Instagram is where all of this
[59:45] conversation lives right now I'm
[59:47] periodically coming to YouTube but on
[59:48] Instagram I mean we're getting Victory
[59:50] after Victory day after day it's
[59:52] virtually every day we have another
[59:54] leading organization coming out against
[59:56] against uh dog Daddy's tour and aversive
[59:59] dog training methods like never
[01:00:02] before dare I say it is a
[01:00:05] movement so it's getting big is what I'm
[01:00:07] saying and it's although it's enough for
[01:00:10] it to be about the dog's Weare um it's
[01:00:13] also I think very important to note that
[01:00:16] another reason we're passionate about
[01:00:18] this is that it's actually a public
[01:00:20] health and safety issue um because when
[01:00:23] you suppress dogs
[01:00:26] reactions that they do because of fear
[01:00:28] or whatever instead of addressing their
[01:00:31] underlying emotions then it makes those
[01:00:33] dogs more likely to bite without warning
[01:00:37] in the future it it's it's really
[01:00:41] dangerous to suppress the expression of
[01:00:43] an emotion instead of addressing the
[01:00:45] emotion that's causing that expression
[01:00:47] and so um I think that's that's a really
[01:00:50] important thing to note this is it's
[01:00:52] actually pretty dangerous advice that he
[01:00:54] is giving to people
[01:00:56] um a shut down dog isn't isn't learning
[01:00:59] and is a higher risk in the future and
[01:01:01] you can imagine if you're a dog training
[01:01:04] professional uh or you are someone who
[01:01:07] has been training dogs with this advice
[01:01:09] in mind for perhaps an entire generation
[01:01:12] or more with dogs this is a tough pill
[01:01:14] to swallow it is a hard thing to admit
[01:01:16] that you've been misled or that somehow
[01:01:19] you know the actual data has eluded you
[01:01:21] and I I that's what we're up against
[01:01:23] it's very difficult to admit when we're
[01:01:25] wrong it's hard to admit especially when
[01:01:28] you're wrong about your dog because I
[01:01:31] know everyone we all love our dogs yes
[01:01:34] and it's heartbreaking to realize that
[01:01:37] things you may have done might not have
[01:01:39] been in their best interest when you
[01:01:41] care about them and so there's a lot of
[01:01:43] cognitive dissonance that comes with
[01:01:45] deconstructing things like dog training
[01:01:48] methods um we all go through it I'm sure
[01:01:51] parents go through it you know you
[01:01:52] realize things that you could have done
[01:01:55] better and it kind of hurts to realize
[01:01:57] it but you have to learn from that and
[01:01:58] improve for the future if you're a
[01:02:01] responsible
[01:02:02] Guardian uh I hear you oana am I saying
[01:02:05] your name and Sarah or una uh I didn't
[01:02:08] see but I see the comment yeah and Sarah
[01:02:11] yeah can I address that yes um so
[01:02:13] basically yeah you're concerned that I'm
[01:02:14] directing more traffic to dog Daddy and
[01:02:16] I you know I'm I have no doubt there is
[01:02:18] some of that going on here nonetheless
[01:02:21] you know if someone's going to get
[01:02:22] millions of views either way we're not
[01:02:24] going to let it go unchallenged we need
[01:02:26] to speak out about it even if that means
[01:02:28] driving more traffic to him
[01:02:29] unfortunately because the greater issue
[01:02:32] here I know we're on the right side of
[01:02:33] history with this and being quiet is not
[01:02:37] an option so that leaves me here I can't
[01:02:39] just be quiet many of my professional
[01:02:42] colleagues cannot remain quiet they're
[01:02:44] speaking out Victoria Stillwell is
[01:02:45] speaking out Michael shikashio is
[01:02:46] speaking out Ken Ramirez is speaking out
[01:02:49] organizations like the apdt are speaking
[01:02:52] out Association of professional dog
[01:02:54] trainers the animal and behavior
[01:02:57] training counil Council in the UK has
[01:02:59] spoken out all of that since in the last
[01:03:02] two weeks over this issue the
[01:03:05] rspca has uh reached out to austo
[01:03:08] personally in Britain to try to
[01:03:11] intervene so again for those of you that
[01:03:13] think this is a Zach thing this is not a
[01:03:15] Zach thing who's jealous of his
[01:03:17] competition this is someone who's deeply
[01:03:19] concerned about the advice that is
[01:03:21] disseminated in the public I'll use the
[01:03:24] example I used earlier for people who
[01:03:26] may have viewed us imagine it's the
[01:03:27] 1950s and doctors are endorsing
[01:03:29] cigarettes on TV commercials a
[01:03:31] historical fact that happened we are in
[01:03:35] the 1950s in dog training where we're
[01:03:38] being told that punishing aggression out
[01:03:39] of a dog is good for them that's the
[01:03:42] kind of situation this is It's a public
[01:03:44] health and safety risk this is what the
[01:03:46] data extensively
[01:03:48] says um the rspca will be keeping a
[01:03:51] close eye on dog Daddy when he comes to
[01:03:52] the UK they won't be the only ones I
[01:03:55] hope so we're all we're all going to be
[01:03:56] keeping a close eye on him and I I
[01:03:58] expect him to be on his good behavior I
[01:04:00] mean he would be insane not to be on his
[01:04:02] good behavior given that I mean there's
[01:04:04] like I say we have eyes on him no matter
[01:04:06] what he does professionally we are
[01:04:09] there we have we are we are we have a
[01:04:12] very sophisticated Network Brewing right
[01:04:14] now that is very insens about this type
[01:04:18] of information being leaked to the
[01:04:19] public as actual
[01:04:23] information F of the Fay just left a
[01:04:25] comment that blew my mind as a person
[01:04:28] who doesn't have fish at all you said
[01:04:30] this is true with a lot of animals 20
[01:04:32] plus years ago I believed the pet store
[01:04:34] guy advice that beta fish are happy in
[01:04:36] little bows I have heard that so much
[01:04:40] and anyway uh I feel guilt for that back
[01:04:43] then today I have a 10 gallon tank and I
[01:04:45] did research it makes me want to cry
[01:04:47] yeah I know I mean that's amazing that's
[01:04:50] a really good point yeah it's so true
[01:04:51] it's so important to learn and and grow
[01:04:55] mhm and yeah I mean we are it it isn't
[01:04:58] again austo is not the only one we are
[01:05:01] choosing him to highlight him because he
[01:05:03] is one of the most egregious trainers in
[01:05:05] the public eye right now uh he's not the
[01:05:07] only one probably 20 30% this is an
[01:05:09] opinion I don't have any data to support
[01:05:11] this so I'm being open about that this
[01:05:13] is just my sense that around 20 to 30%
[01:05:15] of dog trainers are training with the
[01:05:17] yank and crank method of just destroying
[01:05:20] dogs wrecking them emotionally in order
[01:05:23] to shut them down to then claim success
[01:05:25] this is a very shallow approach um and
[01:05:29] and I I it just breaks my heart though
[01:05:32] that shouldn't be the reason that you
[01:05:34] should be upset uh I don't want to make
[01:05:37] an appeal to emotion that would be a
[01:05:39] fallacy that isn't the reason the reason
[01:05:41] is it's scientifically unsound it is
[01:05:44] unsound advice and I I urge everyone to
[01:05:49] go find other sources outside of
[01:05:52] me yeah I appreciate that bricks barks
[01:05:56] like that um fun name to say let's see I
[01:06:01] and again I am hoping to see some
[01:06:02] critical comments here I I'm seeing a
[01:06:04] lot of support and I appreciate it but
[01:06:06] really one of my main purposes here was
[01:06:09] just to to address dog Daddy followers
[01:06:11] people who feel like well how dare you
[01:06:12] go after our guy he's saving dogs lives
[01:06:15] he's he's not being mean or abusive to
[01:06:18] these dogs and I'm trying to help you
[01:06:20] understand that what we're saying is
[01:06:21] indeed verifiably true
[01:06:27] and are you you can read faster than me
[01:06:29] yes uh someone said how do you explain
[01:06:31] that Victoria is still well used to show
[01:06:32] dogs on their worst behavior on its me
[01:06:34] or the dog but none of those dogs were
[01:06:36] nearly as aggressive as the dogs on
[01:06:38] Caesar's shows yeah well like I I the
[01:06:41] guy wasn't there whose job it was to set
[01:06:43] the dogs off yeah I don't know I don't
[01:06:45] know the details of the Productions of
[01:06:46] those shows and it's been years and
[01:06:48] years and um and I know Victoria herself
[01:06:51] has very much updated the way she trains
[01:06:52] dogs over the years as have I well sure
[01:06:54] hike with wi go repeat I agree with you
[01:06:57] uh said Victoria does before shots but
[01:06:58] that's different than I'm summarizing
[01:07:00] what you said yeah before shots I agree
[01:07:03] yeah I'm not saying before shots are
[01:07:04] wrong I'm saying if you're intentionally
[01:07:06] stressing out a dog for a before shot
[01:07:08] that that is problematic especially if
[01:07:10] you're if a dog has a bite history
[01:07:12] you're really making things worse and
[01:07:13] you're prioritizing entertainment over
[01:07:16] actually uh addressing underlying issues
[01:07:18] yeah reaching towards a fearful dog
[01:07:20] dragging them towards you not giving
[01:07:22] them an option to escape when they're
[01:07:24] doing distance increasing behaviors yes
[01:07:27] Michael shikashio just made a statement
[01:07:29] yesterday a great video where he shows
[01:07:30] you just how he works with dogs with
[01:07:32] bite histories that's right that is on
[01:07:34] that we have that on YouTube or we have
[01:07:36] that on Instagram again I will direct
[01:07:38] you to my Instagram if you're interested
[01:07:40] in this you want more critical comments
[01:07:42] gotta hold my own Community accountable
[01:07:45] dominance does exist what is that
[01:07:47] dominance does exist and it's well
[01:07:49] proven the issues with using it in dog
[01:07:51] training does not invalidate it as an
[01:07:53] ecological Theory
[01:07:57] the reason okay fine but what I'm saying
[01:08:01] is that dominance means different things
[01:08:03] to different people and even if there is
[01:08:06] an ethological definition of dominance
[01:08:08] first of all I don't think there's an
[01:08:09] agreed upon definition but if there was
[01:08:11] that has little to do when it comes to
[01:08:13] behavior modification when people are
[01:08:16] teaching dogs because we here just fight
[01:08:19] the dominance out of them do you know
[01:08:20] what I mean um by jerking them around by
[01:08:23] the neck show them your dominant is what
[01:08:25] the idea is this is what people take it
[01:08:27] to mean in practicality right I'm going
[01:08:30] to show that I'm more dominant than
[01:08:32] you you know this is the toxic
[01:08:35] masculinity I'm referring to that's who
[01:08:37] that appeals to people who are
[01:08:39] interested in a battle rather than
[01:08:42] actually nurturing and teaching an
[01:08:44] animal with modern behavior methods I
[01:08:46] don't expect people at home to know how
[01:08:48] to do these things easily there is a
[01:08:50] learning curve but it's not the hardest
[01:08:51] thing in the world there are many more
[01:08:53] harder things but someone who's truly
[01:08:55] interested interested in it I think
[01:08:57] we'll understand what we're getting at
[01:09:01] here Zach does not show very aggressive
[01:09:03] dog aggressive dogs with the triggers I
[01:09:05] I think you're just joining us Zeus I
[01:09:07] addressed that early if you're looking
[01:09:08] for aggressive behavior in a dog
[01:09:10] training video you're looking for
[01:09:11] evidence of poor dog training uh
[01:09:14] professionals know how to not trigger
[01:09:15] dogs I've shown two examples in this
[01:09:17] very video where I've worked with dogs
[01:09:19] with bite histories and how I approach
[01:09:21] them I deescalate so they don't feel the
[01:09:22] need to bite me that's what I try to do
[01:09:25] and cuz no dog is aggressive 24 hours a
[01:09:28] day these social media posts and will
[01:09:31] paint these dogs as just monsters with
[01:09:33] 24-hour energy that are going to snap
[01:09:36] constantly dogs sleep eight hours a day
[01:09:39] at least probably maybe more um you know
[01:09:42] dogs are comfortable with their
[01:09:44] Guardians most of the time even if they
[01:09:47] do display aggressive behavior in
[01:09:48] certain contexts those are the things we
[01:09:51] want we want to work on modifying those
[01:09:54] behaviors in those typ environments
[01:09:56] where the dog is already comfortable so
[01:09:58] that we can build trust because once we
[01:10:00] built trust now we can get in their head
[01:10:02] and now only now can we address the
[01:10:05] underlying issue that is the only way so
[01:10:08] not it's not only that positive
[01:10:10] reinforcement and other and modern
[01:10:11] methods associated with positive
[01:10:13] reinforcement are effective with
[01:10:15] aggression they actually shine with
[01:10:17] aggression this is one of their highest
[01:10:19] and best uses in behavior modification
[01:10:23] so as a public again if you don't
[01:10:25] believe me I would tell you you are
[01:10:27] being gaslit by people telling you
[01:10:29] otherwise the they may believe what
[01:10:31] they're saying but they are not correct
[01:10:34] if we accept the Decades of research and
[01:10:36] the behavior science Community spanning
[01:10:38] fields of psychology biology ethology
[01:10:40] and
[01:10:41] Neuroscience because you don't just have
[01:10:43] to look at dog training studies you can
[01:10:45] look at the broader Fields because all
[01:10:47] animals learn with the same laws of
[01:10:50] learning there's not a different set of
[01:10:51] laws for learning for dogs than there
[01:10:53] are for people did you know that a lot
[01:10:54] of people don't know
[01:10:57] that um Zach beanis approximately how
[01:11:00] many episodes what trying Miss hang I'll
[01:11:04] try to get it's okay I mean if you can
[01:11:05] find it fine I was looking at a
[01:11:07] different comment yeah I see a lot of
[01:11:09] comments are coming in right now yeah I
[01:11:11] me how many episodes of the dog whisper
[01:11:13] have you watched that was the question I
[01:11:15] haven't watched that many of them I've
[01:11:17] seen a few I've seen enough Clips online
[01:11:19] to know that that um pseudo I know
[01:11:23] pseudo science when I see it
[01:11:26] hopefully he's improved over the years
[01:11:27] you know so my battle isn't with an
[01:11:29] individual my battle is with
[01:11:35] misinformation do you want a critical I
[01:11:37] I really would prefer exclusively
[01:11:39] critical coms well this uh it just
[01:11:41] caught my attention because I'm not I
[01:11:42] don't want to shy away from it I'm not
[01:11:44] someone I'm not hiding over here I'm not
[01:11:45] shying away from anything okay uh no
[01:11:48] hate but here's what I need to get off
[01:11:49] my chest says Shay uh I don't like that
[01:11:52] you're always making it out to be like
[01:11:54] oh just tie a roope to your pants and
[01:11:55] shove a bunch of treats in their face
[01:11:57] yeah yeah and if I've done that my bad I
[01:12:00] don't that isn't my goal to to just
[01:12:02] shove a bunch of treats in their face
[01:12:04] what you often are seeing are are
[01:12:06] something called an accelerated rate of
[01:12:08] reinforcement in some situations where
[01:12:10] you're pulsing quickly yes yes yes
[01:12:13] delivering the treats because you're
[01:12:15] trying to get the dog to understand okay
[01:12:17] wait what I'm doing right now is really
[01:12:19] working it's kind of like saying hot hot
[01:12:21] hot hot when you're playing the hot or
[01:12:22] cold game right you're right there
[01:12:24] you're right there now of course over
[01:12:26] time we do that we can um deemphasize
[01:12:29] that but sure yeah and I'll I'll try and
[01:12:32] communicate better about why I do what I
[01:12:33] do and also be open to criticism and
[01:12:36] where I can do it better I mean that's
[01:12:37] that's I like to think that's one of my
[01:12:39] strengths I hope it is because no one
[01:12:41] wants to be right for the sake of being
[01:12:44] right I want to I'm concerned with
[01:12:46] what's verifiably true what
[01:12:48] scientifically true not what feels right
[01:12:51] are you sorry are you saying using
[01:12:53] treats is the only way to train or
[01:12:55] rehabilitate a dog no not at all we have
[01:12:57] to address underlying emotional causes
[01:12:59] so treats we use treats often time to
[01:13:01] build trust with a dog to make them feel
[01:13:02] comfortable so with a dog who's nervous
[01:13:05] sometimes if you give them a piece of
[01:13:06] real meat they become less nervous they
[01:13:08] become more trusting of you as I said
[01:13:10] earlier it's the universal sign of peace
[01:13:13] with with many dogs when you offer them
[01:13:15] food so the treats often are just to
[01:13:18] build that initial trust so you can get
[01:13:19] in their head to address other issues to
[01:13:22] show them that look I'm not some jerk
[01:13:23] who's just going to jerk you around and
[01:13:24] valid Val your fear of men or strangers
[01:13:27] or whatever the case may be so I it's a
[01:13:30] straw man argument that a lot of people
[01:13:32] will throw I'm not saying this commentor
[01:13:33] is doing that saying oh Zach says you
[01:13:35] should just throw treats at an
[01:13:36] aggressive dog that's you know there
[01:13:39] that isn't that's a that's not what
[01:13:41] we're saying we're saying you you build
[01:13:43] trust with a dog sometimes treats can
[01:13:45] help you do that and then once you do
[01:13:47] that you're in a better position to
[01:13:48] counter condition to desensitize to help
[01:13:51] a dog become habituated to certain
[01:13:53] circumstances
[01:13:55] um you're in a better position
[01:13:58] to if you can get them playing with you
[01:14:00] all the better I mean play is my
[01:14:02] favorite thing to do with dogs and the
[01:14:04] brain chemicals the positive brain
[01:14:06] chemicals that come out in both humans
[01:14:08] and dogs when they play can be very
[01:14:10] valuable in addressing a lot of issues
[01:14:12] too so just getting the dog in a you're
[01:14:15] trying to reverse an emotional response
[01:14:17] see behaviors call this conditioned
[01:14:20] emotional responses CS for short and
[01:14:23] dogs who have aggression issues very
[01:14:25] often are conditioned emotionally to
[01:14:27] behave aggressively maybe because they
[01:14:29] think if I don't I'm going to get hit or
[01:14:31] I'm going to get yanked around or
[01:14:33] whatever that's exactly how a lot of
[01:14:36] these methods manifest as increased
[01:14:38] aggression in the
[01:14:42] future Christopher said police are
[01:14:44] trained to deescalate but sometimes they
[01:14:46] need to escalate or the criminal and
[01:14:49] their bad behavior gets away but I think
[01:14:51] that's Emergency Management that right
[01:14:52] very yeah you're one step ahead of me
[01:14:54] exactly so yeah in the ca now look so
[01:14:56] I'm not saying that you can never be
[01:14:58] aversive to a dog in fact sometimes you
[01:15:00] even need to administer pain to a dog
[01:15:02] let me give you an example if a dog if
[01:15:05] you're trying to break up a dog fight or
[01:15:06] a dog is actively aggressing towards you
[01:15:08] you do whatever you have to do to get
[01:15:11] that to stop because it's an emergency
[01:15:13] situation but when professionals like
[01:15:15] dog Daddy are intentionally or Caesar
[01:15:18] Milan are intentionally triggering
[01:15:20] emergency situations to then claim
[01:15:23] aggression that is what's problematic
[01:15:25] you don't intentionally trigger
[01:15:27] aggression to then shut it down because
[01:15:30] I hope we're I know I'm sounding like a
[01:15:32] broken record here because we're not
[01:15:33] addressing the underlying cause so yes
[01:15:35] in emergency situations you do whatever
[01:15:37] you have to do the difference is when
[01:15:40] you're coming up with a training plan or
[01:15:43] a behavior modification plan where
[01:15:44] you're trying to modify aggressive
[01:15:46] behavior for example or fears or phobias
[01:15:48] you don't bake into your written plan
[01:15:51] let's let's pretend you have a written
[01:15:52] plan this is what I'm going to do you
[01:15:54] don't say okay but I'm going to
[01:15:56] administer pain intentionally in these
[01:15:58] situations as part of my plan do you see
[01:16:01] what I mean yeah that is what makes a
[01:16:03] force-free trainer it's not that we're
[01:16:04] force-free all the time it's that we
[01:16:07] don't bake in pain and discomfort into
[01:16:10] our training recipe because we
[01:16:12] understand that never addresses an
[01:16:14] underlying cause it just never does it's
[01:16:16] not appropriate because it doesn't it's
[01:16:19] not good enough to only be focused on
[01:16:21] physical positions of a dog you need to
[01:16:23] be measuring their emotional State at
[01:16:25] every process of the training or
[01:16:29] modification of behavior process or at
[01:16:31] every state do you see what I
[01:16:34] mean
[01:16:38] so I I'm I see a lot of pro seesar
[01:16:41] people here I know I mean you know he's
[01:16:43] brainwashed a generation of people it's
[01:16:45] unfortunate because you know you can't
[01:16:47] find a Veterinary behaviorist who's
[01:16:49] going to tell you what Caesar is
[01:16:50] advising at least you know if he's
[01:16:52] advising physical
[01:16:53] punishments they outclass him in our
[01:16:56] field regardless of his
[01:16:58] celebrity and they're going to say
[01:16:59] that's wrong and they have said it's
[01:17:01] wrong it's not Zach criticizing Caesar
[01:17:03] it is the behavior science Community
[01:17:05] criticizing Caesar it is the scientific
[01:17:08] consensus criticizing
[01:17:10] Caesar I know people think Caesar's
[01:17:12] great but because you're not a behavior
[01:17:14] expert if you were a behavior expert you
[01:17:16] would know um and I don't want to take
[01:17:19] anything away from Caesar when when he
[01:17:20] is giving good advice I'm not saying
[01:17:22] everything he says is bad but
[01:17:24] unfortunately Ely uh the advice he gives
[01:17:26] is highly inconsistent with the
[01:17:29] scientific consensus but you admitted
[01:17:31] that you only watched a few YouTube
[01:17:32] clips so how can you know well you know
[01:17:34] you get over the years you see enough
[01:17:37] Caesar you see enough Clips to know what
[01:17:39] he's about that's why but sure if he's
[01:17:41] changed let me know I mean you know is
[01:17:42] he a force is he Force free now does he
[01:17:44] intentionally administer discomfort or
[01:17:46] restriction around a dog's neck when
[01:17:48] he's training with a slip lead still or
[01:17:49] do he stop doing that cuz that would be
[01:17:51] unethical by modern standards and if he
[01:17:54] doesn't hurt dogs Mario how is it
[01:17:55] working how does it work when he jerks a
[01:17:57] dog if that's what does that do
[01:17:59] emotionally to the dog would be my
[01:18:02] question how does Caesar measure the
[01:18:04] emotional state of the dog throughout
[01:18:05] the training process because when I've
[01:18:07] seen him work with dogs I see heightened
[01:18:09] distress not reduced distress during the
[01:18:11] training process now I see the after
[01:18:13] shots but those are easy to get you can
[01:18:15] get any dog to shut down or catch them
[01:18:17] where they're in a lighten mood or
[01:18:19] something like that that you know I
[01:18:20] don't fall for that because I understand
[01:18:22] dogs better than that oh yeah you can
[01:18:23] watch dog after dog being shut down
[01:18:27] MH dog Daddy channel one after the other
[01:18:30] if you want to yeah it takes no skill to
[01:18:32] shut a dog down that is not skill that
[01:18:34] is just bullying dogs well and it's
[01:18:37] increasing the risk that they will
[01:18:39] different behaviors in the future ex I
[01:18:41] would recommend you go back and watch
[01:18:42] the beginning part of this live after
[01:18:44] we're done if I keep it up um we I've
[01:18:46] shown you how we work with dogs who have
[01:18:48] a bite history it's improper to call
[01:18:51] dogs aggressive dogs I don't like saying
[01:18:53] aggressive dogs here's why because dogs
[01:18:55] are not aggressive by Nature however
[01:18:59] dogs do behave aggressively in some
[01:19:02] situations depending upon context and
[01:19:04] this Nuance matters and it's not a
[01:19:06] Nuance we hear acknowledged by those who
[01:19:10] like to punish aggression out of dogs
[01:19:13] rather than address underlying causes do
[01:19:15] you see someone said based on your
[01:19:17] philosophy police and military also
[01:19:19] abuse their dogs yeah let me let me give
[01:19:21] you I would like to address that so the
[01:19:23] reason we see a lot of these outdated
[01:19:24] practices implemented in military and
[01:19:27] police forces are because systems
[01:19:30] particularly in the hands of government
[01:19:32] don't Advance
[01:19:34] quickly um we're just looking I mean
[01:19:36] they just haven't gotten around to
[01:19:37] changing them yet and this unfortunately
[01:19:39] perpetuates the idea that they're
[01:19:40] somehow official or better many of the
[01:19:43] methods used now now I I do want to
[01:19:45] clarify some militaries and some um
[01:19:49] police departments do use modern dog
[01:19:51] training and do not use these outdated
[01:19:52] methods to be clear but the ones that
[01:19:54] are still using the outdated training
[01:19:56] methods these have their roots from the
[01:19:58] Coler method in the mid part of the 20th
[01:20:01] century which is extremely problematic
[01:20:04] but that's when the system got built and
[01:20:06] it hasn't evolved in many cases that is
[01:20:09] one of the primary reasons again it's
[01:20:11] multifaceted another reason is that we
[01:20:14] you know this that type of training
[01:20:16] appeals to a toxically masculine type
[01:20:18] person very often not always but very
[01:20:21] often that is who is buying into that
[01:20:24] type of training
[01:20:25] because you know for whatever reason th
[01:20:28] those are just a couple of reasons I
[01:20:30] would say that we see that but that
[01:20:32] doesn't mean that they are
[01:20:33] scientifically sound so
[01:20:38] yeah any critical comments I'm here for
[01:20:41] you I want I want the people who who
[01:20:43] think that we're just out here for views
[01:20:45] or we're just trying to make trouble or
[01:20:48] any of that I I'm an open book and every
[01:20:50] step of the way on this I've been an
[01:20:52] open book about this I I want to be sure
[01:20:54] that I communicating with you guys while
[01:20:56] we're doing
[01:20:58] this would a history of physical abuse
[01:21:01] with a dog change their training plan
[01:21:03] someone asked sure yeah yeah because if
[01:21:06] a dog has been abused they're more
[01:21:08] likely to behave aggressively I think
[01:21:09] many of you agree with that it's just
[01:21:11] when a dog trainer Yanks and cranks a
[01:21:13] dog we don't call it abuse because the
[01:21:15] dog trainer is supposed to know what
[01:21:16] they're talking about but as we said
[01:21:17] there's no qualifications to be a dog
[01:21:19] trainer there's no license you need to
[01:21:20] get you just need to go on intuition in
[01:21:22] some cases if you just want to call
[01:21:24] yourself a dog Trader um but what was
[01:21:26] the question yeah would it change sure
[01:21:28] every case is different it's not like if
[01:21:30] a dog is abused you do this okay if the
[01:21:32] dogs abused what's their personality
[01:21:33] like what do they like what's their
[01:21:35] current skill level do they like to play
[01:21:36] are there other dogs in the household
[01:21:37] are they aggressing towards people
[01:21:39] towards dogs towards pets every
[01:21:40] situation is uniquely different and this
[01:21:43] Nuance matters greatly and again this
[01:21:45] isn't something you know is it a medical
[01:21:47] issue has the dog been checked out by a
[01:21:49] vet as well could be a contributing
[01:21:51] factor these are not things we hear
[01:21:52] Caesar talking about uh for the most
[01:21:54] part maybe he does now these aren't
[01:21:56] things we hear a dog Daddy austo DEA
[01:21:58] talking about they don't know what they
[01:22:00] don't know jerking a dog's collar to the
[01:22:03] side to snap their mind off of something
[01:22:06] unwanted uh never hurts a dog it's like
[01:22:08] a nudge yeah well I mean it could be a
[01:22:10] nudge in fact in my upcoming series we
[01:22:13] intentionally teach leash pressure with
[01:22:15] a positively conditioned leash pressure
[01:22:17] you could in theory do that but you said
[01:22:19] popping didn't he jerking jerking
[01:22:20] jerking to like Snap their attention
[01:22:22] yeah you could do that right but let me
[01:22:25] it's a shallow way to approach you could
[01:22:28] just as easily get the same result by
[01:22:30] conditioning the dog to look to you and
[01:22:33] look to you for guidance voluntarily
[01:22:35] without having to Jerk it Out of them
[01:22:37] think about the brain chemicals that if
[01:22:38] the dog is perceiving it as aversive now
[01:22:40] some dogs you can jerk their neck and
[01:22:42] they'll be like hey h what's going on
[01:22:43] are we playing okay if your dog doesn't
[01:22:45] perceive it as aversive it's not
[01:22:46] aversive but you need to be honest about
[01:22:49] that you can't just say to yourself oh
[01:22:50] my dog doesn't perceive that as aversive
[01:22:52] do their ears pin back are they OU sh do
[01:22:55] they do that then that would be aversive
[01:22:57] think about the brain chemicals that go
[01:22:59] on in your dog's brain just work with me
[01:23:01] here and how they feel when that happens
[01:23:05] is that conducive to progress if you
[01:23:08] could keep positive brain chemicals
[01:23:10] going by saying here look at me yes now
[01:23:13] let's go over this way in fact in my
[01:23:15] upcoming series with shade you're going
[01:23:16] to see exactly how we do that and I'll
[01:23:19] give you a spoiler we are able to just
[01:23:21] dump tons of food in front of him off
[01:23:23] leash have them look at me voluntar
[01:23:26] voluntarily and walk away from from
[01:23:28] those distractions now of course that's
[01:23:30] food and we have to build that into
[01:23:32] greater you know tap into that part of
[01:23:34] the brain with more serious distractions
[01:23:36] moving
[01:23:38] forward so but yeah it's all not only is
[01:23:42] it possible it's better for the dog's
[01:23:44] mental health it's better for your
[01:23:46] mental health and it
[01:23:49] is how modern dog trainers should be
[01:23:52] teaching the public now if you as a
[01:23:54] non-dog trainer you're going to do what
[01:23:55] you want as an individual my Lane are
[01:23:58] other dog training Professionals in this
[01:24:00] self-governing institution we have
[01:24:02] called dog training we're self-governing
[01:24:04] it's total Anarchy In my field and I'm
[01:24:06] just stepping up saying hey enough is
[01:24:08] enough we're not going to tolerate abuse
[01:24:09] of dog training practices we're just not
[01:24:11] going to tolerate it we're not going to
[01:24:13] let it go unchallenged I'll say it that
[01:24:15] way and we will challenge abusive dog
[01:24:17] training practices where we see them I'm
[01:24:20] about to get a new puppy I've been
[01:24:21] watching your videos to prepare how many
[01:24:23] treats do you use
[01:24:26] so I will often use part of a dog's meal
[01:24:29] mixed with treats um throughout the day
[01:24:32] I'll take I like to have treats in my
[01:24:34] pocket I like to have a part of their
[01:24:35] kibble in my pocket uh I don't want to
[01:24:38] make them work for their meals let me be
[01:24:39] clear about that but at the same time if
[01:24:41] you want to give them a head start on
[01:24:43] their lunch after they eat breakfast
[01:24:44] there's no harm in
[01:24:46] that um did did I answer the question uh
[01:24:50] I think so yeah well it's going to
[01:24:51] depend on your dog's size and you can
[01:24:54] check with your bed and you know I'm
[01:24:56] really mainly interested in critical
[01:24:58] comments here than I am answering dog
[01:24:59] training questions that's the purpose of
[01:25:01] this line no understand but sure it's a
[01:25:02] good question it's not a bad one um but
[01:25:06] you know I I I'm maybe I'm winning here
[01:25:08] and that's why I'm not getting the
[01:25:09] critical comments I am trying to appeal
[01:25:12] to people who really care about this
[01:25:14] issue and just genuinely think I'm wrong
[01:25:16] but are really concerned with the truth
[01:25:18] not people who have heels dug in
[01:25:21] although if they have heels dug in
[01:25:22] that's okay
[01:25:23] too totally agree about better mental
[01:25:25] health for humans too which positive
[01:25:27] with positive training methods yeah the
[01:25:29] thing that's reinforcing to people when
[01:25:32] they see the shut down dog like we see
[01:25:34] in augusto's video cuz he can just yank
[01:25:36] them and crank them and then within a
[01:25:37] few seconds they shut down they find
[01:25:39] that very persuasive because they think
[01:25:41] something has happened and really it's
[01:25:43] just an illusion the dog is temporarily
[01:25:46] shut down while being further damaged
[01:25:48] and wrecked emotionally that's a hard
[01:25:50] pill to swallow for people who support
[01:25:52] these methods and they will come at me
[01:25:55] with ad homonyms and tell me I'm
[01:25:56] terrible and that I should stay in my
[01:25:59] lane and that you know I don't know
[01:26:02] anything and they come at me when I
[01:26:05] point the reality out that is accepted
[01:26:07] by the behavior science Community
[01:26:10] worldwide no I don't still do dog
[01:26:12] training classes not currently maybe in
[01:26:14] the future I
[01:26:15] will I think I may be confused but with
[01:26:18] purely positive training is there no
[01:26:20] consequence to an undesirable Behavior
[01:26:23] okay so let's take ex the term purely
[01:26:26] positive is offensive to positive dog
[01:26:28] trainers that is a term that those who
[01:26:29] favor using force with dogs use so just
[01:26:32] know that no one believes in purely
[01:26:34] positive there are aversives that all
[01:26:37] dogs will encounter um in their life
[01:26:40] some dogs don't want to be in a house
[01:26:42] that can be aversive some dogs don't
[01:26:43] want to be in a crate overnight that can
[01:26:44] be aversive to them we do our best to
[01:26:46] cater to the dogs emotional state but
[01:26:48] what is the question um I think I may be
[01:26:52] confused but with purely positive is
[01:26:53] there no consequence to an undesirable
[01:26:55] Behavior yeah there's a consequence it
[01:26:57] doesn't need to be painful though so if
[01:27:00] my dog is chewing on a table leg if I
[01:27:03] can redirect them onto a chew toy this
[01:27:05] is fresh in my mind because I just shot
[01:27:06] a puppy series and had to do this a
[01:27:08] number of times and I can redirect them
[01:27:10] that's the consequence yeah the
[01:27:11] consequence is hey chew on this instead
[01:27:14] not you're bad don't ever do this again
[01:27:18] um it's not there can be there can be
[01:27:22] ethical negative outcomes to some
[01:27:25] behaviors and sometimes you don't need a
[01:27:26] negative outcome to an undesired
[01:27:28] Behavior like you think you do if a dog
[01:27:30] is biting on your flesh cuz they're
[01:27:32] teething they don't need to be
[01:27:33] disciplined for that they need something
[01:27:35] to chew on if a dog is jumping on you
[01:27:38] they don't need to be needed in the
[01:27:39] chest to learn how to not jump they need
[01:27:42] to be taught how to sit and stay so this
[01:27:45] idea that we need to think of everything
[01:27:46] in terms of consequence consequence
[01:27:48] there can be Humane consequences that
[01:27:50] are actually proactive rather than uh
[01:27:54] discouraging a dog and that's a great
[01:27:56] question and again let me remind you the
[01:27:58] fact that you have professional dog
[01:28:00] trainers not saying what I just told you
[01:28:02] is a problem it's one thing if you're
[01:28:04] just a member of the public and you're
[01:28:06] going on intuition but when you hear
[01:28:08] so-called professionals telling you not
[01:28:11] telling you what I just did that is a
[01:28:13] major red
[01:28:15] flag a good trainer doesn't have to
[01:28:17] touch his or her dog while training
[01:28:18] isn't that the truth now if you're on a
[01:28:20] walk yes you need to have your dog on a
[01:28:21] leash but modern trainers don't use
[01:28:24] leashes as communication devices by
[01:28:26] jerking modern trainers use leashes as a
[01:28:29] safety device to keep a dog from running
[01:28:31] away while they're in the training
[01:28:33] process or to keep them safe or to abide
[01:28:35] by local leash laws so your dog and N
[01:28:38] just very happy kudos to you if you took
[01:28:41] dog Daddy's challenge I would be sold
[01:28:43] but if you don't I would still be
[01:28:45] incredulous of your abilities to be
[01:28:46] honest no he's not on my level dog daddy
[01:28:49] is not someone that I would platform he
[01:28:50] is not someone that has uh it's not
[01:28:53] about a challenge here because how are
[01:28:55] you going to measure the dog's emotional
[01:28:57] state I have a thought I just I feel
[01:29:01] like that reducing it to the challenge
[01:29:04] the Zach versus dog Daddy thing ISP such
[01:29:07] a distraction just imagine in any
[01:29:10] profession whatever profession you're in
[01:29:12] commenter if
[01:29:14] someone criticized one of your peers
[01:29:17] based on what they're doing in their
[01:29:19] profession and instead of addressing
[01:29:21] those criticisms and why they may or may
[01:29:23] not be correct the person said I
[01:29:25] challenge you to come face me and I'll
[01:29:27] give you
[01:29:28] $50,000 not withstanding that the person
[01:29:30] is uh known to rip people off and not
[01:29:33] probably probably it's not a sincere
[01:29:34] offer it's obviously not a sincere offer
[01:29:36] but I I don't think I think that if you
[01:29:40] are still feeling incredulous that's
[01:29:42] great because critical thinking is
[01:29:43] really important but I think rather than
[01:29:45] letting your opinion be based on this
[01:29:48] challenge I think you should look into
[01:29:51] the actual methods we're criticizing and
[01:29:53] what or not they're right or wrong yeah
[01:29:55] I'm not going to take a distraction
[01:29:56] because really what what you're really
[01:29:58] asking for is I need proof and that's
[01:30:01] great we actually have a better method
[01:30:03] to gather proof than silly uh Antics
[01:30:07] like a superficial challenge it's called
[01:30:09] the scientific method and the body of
[01:30:11] evidence is extensive I assure you it
[01:30:13] goes much deeper than any of us here
[01:30:16] realize I assure you of that but don't
[01:30:19] you need to use the four principles of
[01:30:21] dog training uh I think probably the
[01:30:23] four quadrants in is what we say uh but
[01:30:25] I think you must mean the same thing to
[01:30:27] have a well-rounded dog no and that is
[01:30:29] another common fallacy that so you're
[01:30:32] saying positive punishment negative
[01:30:34] punishment positive reinforcement
[01:30:36] negative reinforcement those are the
[01:30:37] four quadrants a dog trainer of Operate
[01:30:39] conditioning and uh you because you have
[01:30:43] all four doesn't mean you need to use
[01:30:45] them do we need to hit kids do we need
[01:30:47] to do that that would be positive
[01:30:49] punishment for those that don't know
[01:30:50] positive is used in the sense of
[01:30:52] applying something
[01:30:54] so in this case we are applying a force
[01:30:57] right not positive in terms of
[01:30:58] reinforcement so if you're using
[01:31:01] positive punishment you're hitting right
[01:31:04] or jerking using something physical uh
[01:31:08] would would be an example of positive
[01:31:10] punishment do we need to do that to kids
[01:31:11] do we have to use that you know kids and
[01:31:13] dogs learn by the same learning laws so
[01:31:16] no we don't need to use all four in fact
[01:31:18] you just because they exist doesn't mean
[01:31:21] they are required to be used in fact we
[01:31:23] know that when you do use positive
[01:31:24] punishment that it can create issues
[01:31:26] even BF Skinner pointed this out he's
[01:31:28] the one who coined the four quadrants he
[01:31:30] didn't say you needed to use all four he
[01:31:31] said they exist they can alter Behavior
[01:31:34] but we know that there are consequences
[01:31:36] and side effects associated with using
[01:31:38] positive punishment what are the
[01:31:40] learning laws so what I'm referring to
[01:31:42] when I say learning laws I'm talking
[01:31:43] about a branch of science called
[01:31:44] learning theory and learning theory is
[01:31:47] it's essentially psychology right so and
[01:31:49] again I'm not I'm not even claiming to
[01:31:51] be an expert here I just listen to the
[01:31:52] smart people I'm only a dog trainer I'm
[01:31:54] not trying to claim to be anything
[01:31:56] special here but uh learning laws are
[01:31:59] Universal for all animals so the same
[01:32:01] way that your Elementary School teacher
[01:32:03] learned went to college to get their
[01:32:06] degree in Early Education um they
[01:32:09] learned principles in there on how to
[01:32:11] teach children and we're trying to
[01:32:13] borrow from that culture so we can teach
[01:32:15] dogs because dogs and children learn by
[01:32:18] the same rules for example a fundamental
[01:32:21] learning law is a behavior that gets
[01:32:25] reinforced will be repeated that's right
[01:32:29] yeah and and and conversely yes a
[01:32:31] behavior that gets punished is less
[01:32:33] likely to occur but at what cost now now
[01:32:36] we've created a side effect and it's not
[01:32:38] necessary because you can get there
[01:32:39] without using the punishment and if you
[01:32:41] can get there without the punishment and
[01:32:43] without the side effect that should be
[01:32:46] what professionals are advising the
[01:32:48] public to do um getting a professional
[01:32:51] like dog Daddy to validate that you can
[01:32:53] just yank it dog around and make you the
[01:32:56] public feel okay about doing that is a
[01:32:58] serious public health and safety concern
[01:33:01] m i was corrected you're right I didn't
[01:33:04] uh exactly accurately State the dog
[01:33:06] Daddy challenge it's true that he didn't
[01:33:08] say $50,000 to face Sami said $50,000 to
[01:33:12] show him how to train an aggressive dog
[01:33:14] but my answer Remains the Same yeah yeah
[01:33:16] I'm not I'm not that guy I'm not
[01:33:17] interest in teaching him it's not my job
[01:33:20] to teach other professionals how to not
[01:33:22] abuse dogs in the name of TR training
[01:33:24] that is some I mean that you you got
[01:33:26] some serious soul searching to do a
[01:33:28] Gusto so uh saying no to children I
[01:33:31] think so I I missed who said it but I
[01:33:33] caught a comment about but don't you
[01:33:34] need to say no to Children uh and that's
[01:33:36] not the same as using aversive
[01:33:38] punishments to try to change children's
[01:33:40] future Behavior no is can no is a word
[01:33:45] but right now the current epicenter of
[01:33:47] this conversation we're having is really
[01:33:49] I mean really this is really it do you
[01:33:52] think pain is required to modify
[01:33:56] Behavior pain and physical discomfort
[01:33:59] that is what a good half of my industry
[01:34:02] believes right now that you need to use
[01:34:05] pain and physical discomfort to modify
[01:34:08] behavior and that is a dated perspective
[01:34:11] that is not true but you can't just say
[01:34:14] no to a dog if they don't know what it
[01:34:16] means that's right yeah no needs to mean
[01:34:17] something our dogs know what no means
[01:34:19] they do I don't I've gotten away from
[01:34:21] using no I have videos on how I use the
[01:34:23] word no but really I find it to be a
[01:34:25] time was waster the more I learn why
[01:34:26] don't I just tell the dog what I want if
[01:34:28] they're chewing on something I don't say
[01:34:29] no and then provide a consequence to it
[01:34:32] I say hey look at me I've already taught
[01:34:34] him look at me chew on this instead or
[01:34:36] if I have to get up and pick them up I
[01:34:38] can pick them up I don't need to waste
[01:34:39] time punishing them so that's why I
[01:34:42] don't do it and that's why skilled dog
[01:34:44] trainers get away from it I know
[01:34:45] punishment trainers or um uh those who
[01:34:48] favor using discomfort and pain in
[01:34:50] training try to point to that as some
[01:34:53] type of shortcoming but there's a reason
[01:34:56] the most intelligent in our field
[01:34:58] refrain from saying the word no to a dog
[01:35:00] it's counterproductive it doesn't get us
[01:35:01] to where we want to be as quickly now
[01:35:03] you at home as the novice it's fine to
[01:35:07] say no to your dog if you want to strive
[01:35:09] to do differently you can you can get
[01:35:12] there in your own way if you want to say
[01:35:13] no to your dog say no to your dog but to
[01:35:16] inflict pain or discomfort as part of a
[01:35:18] training or behavior modification
[01:35:19] strategy is severely dated
[01:35:25] suppressing emotions instead of
[01:35:27] addressing them is not effective well I
[01:35:29] feel like I need to reiterate that it's
[01:35:31] so important suppressing emotions rather
[01:35:34] than addressing them rather than
[01:35:36] addressing the emotions more uh directly
[01:35:40] is counterproductive yeahh yeah it's not
[01:35:42] that it's just another way it actually
[01:35:44] does not
[01:35:49] work what is confusing is that he
[01:35:51] appears to be kind to the animal after
[01:35:53] controlling the animal and it's
[01:35:55] difficult to convince anyone who sees
[01:35:57] him doing that that he is not caring for
[01:35:59] them right yeah you can care for a dog
[01:36:01] and still abuse them um and again I
[01:36:04] don't believe I don't really take him
[01:36:06] very seriously based on his conduct in
[01:36:07] general that it's genuine but again I'm
[01:36:09] not in his head if we're talking about a
[01:36:11] Gusto DEA that is known as the dog
[01:36:14] Daddy um you know I'm I'm disgusted by
[01:36:18] what I see out of him and so are the
[01:36:20] Professionals in my field balanced and
[01:36:22] force free alike mind
[01:36:25] you I mean if there's one thing austo
[01:36:27] has done he has single-handedly brought
[01:36:29] the dog training Community together MH
[01:36:31] yeah the public deserves a lot better
[01:36:34] right any trainer who is telling you to
[01:36:36] use pain and discomfort as a
[01:36:38] premeditated St in a premeditated way as
[01:36:41] a training or behavior modification
[01:36:43] strategy has is either showing their
[01:36:46] lack of knowledge or their inability to
[01:36:49] grow but that is a severely by 100 years
[01:36:54] outdated
[01:36:55] concept or at least by 50 I'll give you
[01:36:59] the first half of the 20th
[01:37:01] century and so and again you this isn't
[01:37:04] a personal opinion this is the consensus
[01:37:06] in the behavior science Community across
[01:37:08] all species I don't know who quite Kyle
[01:37:09] swab is Robert cabraal you know I've
[01:37:12] made my feelings very clear to him in
[01:37:14] the past I don't endorse him I think
[01:37:15] he's using outdated methods that's right
[01:37:18] it's still hard to wrap my mind mind
[01:37:19] around this you're claiming it's right
[01:37:21] but are unwilling to show it in a
[01:37:22] controlled setting how do you mean what
[01:37:24] have I what have I not it's the
[01:37:25] challenge if if it's proven with the
[01:37:27] scientific method it should be able to
[01:37:28] be replicated I just wanted to say I
[01:37:30] just wanted to say it has been
[01:37:31] replicated many times you can find that
[01:37:34] information all over the Internet and
[01:37:36] your opinion on whether or not this is
[01:37:39] right should not be about whether dog
[01:37:42] Zach is doing this I'm not for argument
[01:37:46] sake you can say that I am I will accept
[01:37:49] for argument sake that I don't know what
[01:37:50] I'm doing whether it is not on me to
[01:37:54] prove to you the scientific consensus my
[01:37:57] knowledge is not greater than that of
[01:37:59] the collective scientific body and this
[01:38:02] is something you don't hear out of
[01:38:04] people like austo they don't say that
[01:38:06] they say oh the scientific uh body of
[01:38:09] knowledge is stupid and I am right and
[01:38:12] if that's not a red flag to you it
[01:38:15] should be but so yeah I think that's a
[01:38:18] great point it's I'm not saying I'm
[01:38:19] better I'm not I will for argument sake
[01:38:21] I will say I'm worse I will say I'm
[01:38:23] Terri
[01:38:24] I don't need to be good to be right on
[01:38:26] this I think maybe you're also you might
[01:38:28] be confused I'm not sure um because if
[01:38:31] you have been following dog Daddy he'll
[01:38:33] say things like only I can do this only
[01:38:36] I can train these dogs and if you
[01:38:38] believe that then it makes sense that
[01:38:40] you would think only Zach can prove this
[01:38:42] wrong that's right but that's not a
[01:38:44] correct mindset you're right it can be
[01:38:45] replicated so go find it because it has
[01:38:48] been uh shouldn't it be what go ahead
[01:38:51] that's a good question shouldn't be
[01:38:53] should be if it's right if it
[01:38:54] scientifically Works was the hypothesis
[01:38:57] proven correct well I mean hypotheses
[01:38:59] you know they get supported they don't
[01:39:01] get proven te keep testing them which
[01:39:03] trainers are doing all the time by
[01:39:05] working with dogs with all of these
[01:39:07] issues without using aversive
[01:39:08] punishments that are risky it's possible
[01:39:11] it's known that this other way that dog
[01:39:13] Daddy is Doing is very risky and
[01:39:15] dangerous why would you do it that's
[01:39:17] that's all you need to know we consider
[01:39:19] it a public health and safety concern
[01:39:20] it's not that it's benign and just
[01:39:22] different it's that it's actually
[01:39:23] causing harm because millions of people
[01:39:25] are seeing this and applying these
[01:39:27] methods and creating public health and
[01:39:29] safety risk those dogs when you train
[01:39:31] them with these methods become an
[01:39:32] increased bite risk uh to members of the
[01:39:35] public to members of the Home and these
[01:39:37] are everyday innocent people assuming
[01:39:41] that this guy has knowledge when you go
[01:39:42] to get a haircut when was the last time
[01:39:43] you asked to see the license of the
[01:39:45] person cutting your hair right you
[01:39:46] assume they have a license cuz in that
[01:39:48] field it is required they have a license
[01:39:50] the public is confused on the matter and
[01:39:52] they are assuming that the public or
[01:39:54] they are assuming that the dog trainer
[01:39:56] is going to give them good advice as
[01:39:57] someone who's trained dogs for nearly 20
[01:39:59] years now I can tell you it is not
[01:40:01] common for people to say how do you
[01:40:03] train dogs when you tell them you're a
[01:40:05] dog trainer they don't ask how do you
[01:40:07] train dogs for example you'll see how
[01:40:09] Gusto occasionally throw up a video
[01:40:11] where he'll be like oh I saw this crazy
[01:40:12] dog in public and I went up to them and
[01:40:14] asked if I could train their dog they're
[01:40:16] like oh I guess if you're a trainer sure
[01:40:17] maybe you can help me out here at which
[01:40:20] time they have no idea that they're you
[01:40:22] know handing their dog over to someone
[01:40:25] who uses abusive dog training practices
[01:40:27] because again no qualifications
[01:40:29] whatsoever are required to be a dog
[01:40:31] trainer which is a major problem and the
[01:40:33] fact that the public is so deeply
[01:40:35] confused on this underscores the need
[01:40:37] for lure in our field yesterday it's
[01:40:40] really tragic my dog where I don't our
[01:40:43] dogs are asleep so nurse is on the bed
[01:40:46] and Veronica's over there I'll show you
[01:40:48] Veronica she's passed out right there
[01:40:51] I'm not going to show you my bedroom cuz
[01:40:53] my bed's not
[01:40:54] made but inertia is on the bed sleeping
[01:40:56] and I'm not going to wake her up for you
[01:40:58] but thank you for asking can all dogs be
[01:41:01] rehabilitated in your opinion no no
[01:41:04] there are mentally ill dogs out there
[01:41:05] there are dogs that are downright who
[01:41:07] are going to have genetics even
[01:41:09] that uh make them not good members of
[01:41:13] society um have I ever recommended youth
[01:41:16] in Asia for a dog no I never have I've
[01:41:18] never met a dog that I thought couldn't
[01:41:20] be um at least managed and trained and
[01:41:24] with you know responsible
[01:41:26] management um but yeah there are
[01:41:28] mentally ill dogs out there who for one
[01:41:30] reason or another are a threat to
[01:41:31] society and no those dogs often cannot I
[01:41:34] know it's an unpopular opinion amongst
[01:41:36] some and I've heard about them I haven't
[01:41:38] even encountered one of these dogs ever
[01:41:40] and all of the thousands of dogs I've
[01:41:41] worked with but they're out there so
[01:41:44] it's not common but
[01:41:47] sure uh well scientifically speaking I I
[01:41:51] like the word scientifically dogs are
[01:41:52] animals who do not act out of spite yeah
[01:41:55] it wouldn't seem that they are
[01:42:01] spiteful I any anyone else think I'm
[01:42:04] wrong about any of
[01:42:06] this Manish is different than rehabilit
[01:42:09] rehabilitated good differentiation thank
[01:42:11] you yeah it's true I mean there are some
[01:42:13] dogs who should never be around dogs
[01:42:15] ever other dogs for example right they
[01:42:17] can still be managed and have a healthy
[01:42:19] life in a one person H in a one dog
[01:42:21] household um so my dog holds a grudge
[01:42:25] for
[01:42:27] sure that made me laugh dogs are
[01:42:30] funny I don't think your dog's holding
[01:42:32] The Grudge I think there's something
[01:42:34] else going on there but sure maybe I
[01:42:36] don't know I haven't met every dog I
[01:42:38] could always be
[01:42:39] surprised what did I miss but oh nothing
[01:42:43] Mike we're just in here talking about um
[01:42:47] dog training methods I'm trying to be
[01:42:48] very transparent to my audience and to
[01:42:51] austo dea's audience known as the dog
[01:42:53] Daddy as to why we are launching
[01:42:56] worldwide protests against his classes
[01:42:58] why we are condemning his methods and
[01:43:00] speaking as one voice as a dog training
[01:43:02] community that abusive dog training
[01:43:05] practices won't go unchallenged and that
[01:43:07] we're going to do that in the biggest
[01:43:08] way we know how to do we feel unheard we
[01:43:11] feel that the public is being misled and
[01:43:14] that he is creating an additional
[01:43:16] unnecessary public health and safety
[01:43:17] risk by disseminating pseudo science and
[01:43:21] bad information to millions of people
[01:43:24] that's all that's it in a nutshell what
[01:43:25] you missed if you look at the research
[01:43:27] that you site more than half of them are
[01:43:30] not with control groups or with a group
[01:43:32] of dogs with aversive training and they
[01:43:34] just train them with positive
[01:43:35] reinforcement and just publish them I
[01:43:37] mean they do pure review them but um I
[01:43:40] Zach may have an answer too but I think
[01:43:43] that that's great but you need to also
[01:43:45] find studies that support what you're
[01:43:47] saying and see how many of them there
[01:43:49] are yeah consensus there's there is a
[01:43:52] lot go ahead
[01:43:53] um okay so number
[01:43:56] one let's have humility all of us here
[01:43:58] and understand that most of us here are
[01:44:00] not scientists okay um when when non-b
[01:44:05] Behavior experts attempt to debunk
[01:44:08] Behavior studies they're number one
[01:44:11] you're unless you're a scientist in this
[01:44:13] field you're not in a position to be a
[01:44:15] peer reviewer it doesn't mean you can't
[01:44:17] have an opinion and have your own things
[01:44:19] but what people don't realize about
[01:44:21] scientific studies is if you thought of
[01:44:23] that question the scientists who are
[01:44:25] peer-reviewing that data whether it be a
[01:44:27] survey study or not has definitely asked
[01:44:30] that question and a hundred more that
[01:44:32] you have not yet thought of uh when
[01:44:35] considering peer-reviewing these studies
[01:44:37] before they get published um in terms
[01:44:41] you're right that it is hard to do a lot
[01:44:43] of dog training studies even from
[01:44:45] ethical standpoints like you you know I
[01:44:47] was recently asked to participate in a
[01:44:49] study with shock cerss being the
[01:44:50] alternative to compare training methods
[01:44:52] I won't par participate in this study
[01:44:54] where dogs are knowingly get shocked but
[01:44:56] here's what you can do you can look at
[01:44:58] greater Fields like psychology and
[01:45:01] ethology and biology and Neuroscience if
[01:45:04] you accept that all animals learn by the
[01:45:06] same learning laws which is the
[01:45:08] scientific consensus currently then you
[01:45:10] don't even need those other studies to
[01:45:12] know that training with pain is
[01:45:14] unnecessary you don't need to inflict
[01:45:16] intentional pain to bring about any new
[01:45:19] Behavior or to modify any existing
[01:45:21] behavior and that is not contra Rial in
[01:45:23] behavior
[01:45:27] science I bet cortisol levels are off
[01:45:29] the charts with painful training MH
[01:45:32] that's right yeah we have stress
[01:45:33] hormones like I mean that's how they
[01:45:34] attempt to measure a lot of the
[01:45:36] emotional state of dogs with brain
[01:45:37] chemicals like cortisol hormones like
[01:45:40] cortisol uh and others and serotonin and
[01:45:44] dopamine and things like that so that's
[01:45:47] one way that we can measure uh
[01:45:49] results but it it really stuns me how
[01:45:52] many so professional dog trainers just
[01:45:54] want to double down and really believe
[01:45:56] nope sorry for some dogs you got to use
[01:45:57] pain guys got to be painful what do you
[01:46:00] why do you think that is why do you guys
[01:46:01] think that so many people believe that
[01:46:03] do you think it's that it's
[01:46:04] scientifically sound or do you think
[01:46:06] there is an element of our culture that
[01:46:08] values punishment over connection and
[01:46:11] authentic
[01:46:12] teaching I think it's cultural and I
[01:46:15] think that's part of the big problem
[01:46:20] here patience levels uh are low and that
[01:46:23] and pain seems like a shortcut says
[01:46:25] Elizabeth it's true because if you do
[01:46:27] use pain you can get something that
[01:46:29] looks like immediate results but
[01:46:31] actually you're just masking the
[01:46:32] underlying emotional uh cause and you
[01:46:35] haven't addressed anything that's why
[01:46:36] it's some people will say for example
[01:46:38] well punishment may be quicker but you
[01:46:40] have side effects and you shouldn't use
[01:46:42] it even though positive reinforcement
[01:46:43] takes longer you should use it I I don't
[01:46:45] agree with that I don't think punishment
[01:46:47] is quicker I think it creates the
[01:46:49] illusion of being quicker but it hasn't
[01:46:51] addressed anything so positive
[01:46:53] reinforcement you're going to see this
[01:46:55] in my upcoming Series this is a major
[01:46:57] takeaway works way faster than
[01:46:59] punishment if you're concerned with
[01:47:00] deepr rooted actual results just like it
[01:47:04] does with children for those of you that
[01:47:06] have children out there who are who've
[01:47:07] gone to
[01:47:08] kindergarten would you have preferred in
[01:47:11] hindsight that your kindergarten teacher
[01:47:13] use shocking mechanisms on your
[01:47:15] children's wrists to correct them do you
[01:47:17] wish they had gotten hit with rulers on
[01:47:19] their hands more do you think that would
[01:47:21] have been more beneficial for your
[01:47:22] children than actually using modern
[01:47:25] behavior science to teach them because
[01:47:27] if you do or if you don't think that
[01:47:30] then you don't think that dogs should be
[01:47:32] trained with pain I assure you I mean if
[01:47:35] if if you don't think kids need to be
[01:47:37] taught with pain then there's no reason
[01:47:39] to think that dogs need to be taught
[01:47:41] with pain not because the humans or dogs
[01:47:44] are the same but because emotively they
[01:47:46] are virtually identical and all animals
[01:47:48] are governed by the same laws of
[01:47:50] learning
[01:47:55] it does work faster when you know what
[01:47:56] you're doing so necessary to watch case
[01:47:58] studies reality dog training series that
[01:48:00] that Zach produces oh you're talking
[01:48:02] about um positive reinforcement working
[01:48:05] faster absolutely I believe that's what
[01:48:07] you're saying yeah and so you the
[01:48:09] original commenter had asked for tips on
[01:48:11] uh patients when training and for myself
[01:48:15] if I feel frustrated usually remembering
[01:48:18] that honestly and not not in like a high
[01:48:20] and mighty way but remembering that
[01:48:22] helps me
[01:48:23] I want to get that question you have
[01:48:24] faster result I have to answer this oh
[01:48:26] come on for you I got comments right
[01:48:27] here don't humans learn with pain yeah
[01:48:30] um so they're saying humans don't learn
[01:48:32] with pain I uh yeah humans can learn
[01:48:35] with pain but not without unnecessary
[01:48:37] side effects so when we learn with pain
[01:48:39] we now have negative brain chemicals
[01:48:41] going on that create a conditioned
[01:48:42] emotional response to pain that can now
[01:48:46] create another issue in that oh I don't
[01:48:47] want to work with you or I'm scared of
[01:48:49] you or uh I can't trust you or I can't
[01:48:53] trust you as much so it's not that pain
[01:48:55] doesn't work in terms of getting a
[01:48:57] result but pain can exacerbate
[01:49:00] underlying emotional causes rather than
[01:49:03] alleviating those and that is the big
[01:49:05] confusion here excellent question thank
[01:49:07] you and I'm so sorry to cut you off you
[01:49:09] did it's okay I interrupted my wife and
[01:49:10] I shouldn't do that that's okay
[01:49:15] mhm humans learn to avoid pain they
[01:49:17] don't learn respect or
[01:49:20] trust humans learn to avoid they don't
[01:49:22] learn okay I don't know what that's
[01:49:23] about yeah they learn to avoid the the
[01:49:26] painful thing right right right yeah and
[01:49:29] that's that's a not the ideal way to
[01:49:31] learn something or to become an
[01:49:33] emotionally fulfilled being has there
[01:49:35] been a dog that you could not teach
[01:49:38] no no now a single training session that
[01:49:41] were struggles before but that's not the
[01:49:43] same as right no i' I've never
[01:49:45] encountered a dog that I couldn't get
[01:49:46] through because laws of learning are as
[01:49:49] defined as laws of gravity as much as I
[01:49:51] can drop this phone and it falls I can
[01:49:54] apply positive reinforcement and know
[01:49:56] I'm going to get a result if I know what
[01:49:57] I'm
[01:49:58] doing the there these are learning laws
[01:50:01] these are not learning
[01:50:02] hypotheses these are principles that
[01:50:05] have undergone extensive peer review and
[01:50:07] have been true every time they've been
[01:50:09] tested so far now you know may come true
[01:50:11] one day up here's one exception we found
[01:50:13] and when that exception comes we'll have
[01:50:15] to look at that but so far in decades of
[01:50:17] research we haven't found exceptions to
[01:50:19] those what gives them credentials
[01:50:21] haven't you ever seen scientists that
[01:50:22] agree with each other who are we to
[01:50:24] trust the consensus so the when the
[01:50:27] extreme majority are all saying the same
[01:50:29] thing that is when you start to
[01:50:31] understand the direction towards the
[01:50:33] truth in science uh yes usually yeah and
[01:50:36] not only that I think you'll be very
[01:50:38] hardpressed to behind to find a behavior
[01:50:40] scientist who supports using I'm not
[01:50:43] saying you won't find one or two out
[01:50:45] there but it'll likely be in the single
[01:50:47] digits
[01:50:49] um of a who thinks that it is necessary
[01:50:52] to use use it the question isn't whether
[01:50:54] or not you can change a behavior a
[01:50:56] little bit with or change a behavior
[01:50:58] with punishment the question is whether
[01:51:00] or not you need to and we would hope the
[01:51:03] common sense individual would say well
[01:51:05] if I don't need to cause pain and
[01:51:07] additional side effects I'd rather not
[01:51:08] do that and to me I can't fathom a
[01:51:12] professional dog trainer that would say
[01:51:14] yeah you can you need to use pain here
[01:51:17] uh yes it creates additional side
[01:51:19] effects yes there is an alternative but
[01:51:21] we're going to do it anyway because the
[01:51:22] trainers who were telling you to use
[01:51:24] pain don't they don't acknowledge that
[01:51:25] there are side effects in fact Beckman
[01:51:27] just recently in a interview talked
[01:51:30] about how he had to massage clients is
[01:51:32] that right into believing uh into going
[01:51:35] along with it that's what these guys are
[01:51:36] good at they're very convincing after
[01:51:38] all I'm the expert and they have to he
[01:51:40] said sometimes pet parents are
[01:51:42] uncomfortable with the training methods
[01:51:45] he's using and that he massages them
[01:51:48] gently right the with the implication
[01:51:50] they're like such snowflakes that they
[01:51:52] need careful handling or whatever AKA
[01:51:54] manipulate them into uh going against
[01:51:56] their common sense of being kind to
[01:51:58] their dog it was pretty chilling
[01:52:00] honestly yeah yeah I mean it's again
[01:52:03] it's a buyer beware industry and you I
[01:52:07] feel terrible for the public because man
[01:52:11] you guys you you can go up to the
[01:52:14] polished most beautiful looking training
[01:52:17] institution got a nice sign good
[01:52:19] advertising they got their logo all over
[01:52:21] their cars these these people people
[01:52:22] must have it together and so often these
[01:52:25] dog training schools are pure Garbage
[01:52:27] Guys they're just out there shocking
[01:52:29] dogs they they are adhering to a public
[01:52:32] pressure to get quick results but
[01:52:34] there's such confusion in the public as
[01:52:36] to what the side effects are to those
[01:52:39] that we're in a disaster in this
[01:52:40] industry right
[01:52:42] now I mean
[01:52:45] that's it's
[01:52:47] depressing but you know so I can't just
[01:52:49] sit here and be quiet about it I can't
[01:52:51] just sit here and focus on me when I see
[01:52:53] such travesties in my industry going on
[01:52:55] and tragedies like this well yeah the
[01:52:58] public is so confused and our our entire
[01:53:01] purpose of our whole life is helping all
[01:53:04] of you have better relationships and
[01:53:06] understanding of your dogs and this is a
[01:53:08] serious misunderstanding right so I hope
[01:53:10] we can help and I really hope it's clear
[01:53:12] I know I've said names throughout this
[01:53:14] my point isn't to just start [ __ ] start
[01:53:16] stuff excuse me and uh say names of
[01:53:20] people to do it it's because these SE
[01:53:22] are people who are influential in my
[01:53:23] field right now these are people who are
[01:53:25] disseminating what I believe to be bad
[01:53:27] information that contribute to an
[01:53:29] increased public health and safety risk
[01:53:31] and that's why I'm speaking out about it
[01:53:33] and I'll continue to do so do we have
[01:53:35] dog training content coming absolutely
[01:53:37] we still are training dogs but man this
[01:53:41] I've never seen it so bad right now in
[01:53:44] the in the era of social media with so
[01:53:48] much bad information being disseminated
[01:53:49] to so many millions of people it breaks
[01:53:52] my heart to see this don't believe me
[01:53:55] because it breaks my heart believe me
[01:53:57] because of the behavior science
[01:53:59] information available to everyone out
[01:54:00] there who truly cares about this topic
[01:54:03] it's up to you to decide unfortunately
[01:54:06] you know you you have to do your due
[01:54:08] diligence you're not guarant you're in
[01:54:10] fact you're more likely to get an
[01:54:12] unethical dog trainer than you are to
[01:54:14] get an ethical one if you just go and
[01:54:17] randomly call someone out of the phone
[01:54:18] book or whatever they do nowadays go on
[01:54:20] Google and just get someone most of
[01:54:23] these training institutions are not
[01:54:25] positive most of them are going to
[01:54:26] inflict pain completely unnecessarily
[01:54:29] and at public health and safety risk do
[01:54:31] they understand they're doing this many
[01:54:32] of them haven't bettered their haven't
[01:54:34] self-educated or gotten the education
[01:54:36] enough to even understand that they're
[01:54:37] doing that and they don't even realize
[01:54:39] they're doing
[01:54:41] that that's a it's a dark situation in
[01:54:45] my industry right now so I hope this has
[01:54:47] helped you understand I made this video
[01:54:49] specifically for dog Daddy followers
[01:54:51] because I wanted to address
[01:54:53] what you guys are feeling um because I
[01:54:57] think your qu there's no such thing as a
[01:54:59] bad question and I think the questions
[01:55:01] are fine but what do you do with that
[01:55:04] information now that you have it do you
[01:55:06] continue to double down and say no
[01:55:07] Zach's an idiot or do you now go to the
[01:55:10] next steps and say well let me see what
[01:55:12] other people are saying about this let
[01:55:13] me find out what Behavior scientists are
[01:55:15] saying about this um you know what is
[01:55:18] the scientific consensus maybe I should
[01:55:20] reach out to a veterinar behaviorist or
[01:55:23] a certified behaviorist who works with
[01:55:25] dogs like this all the time and see what
[01:55:27] their opinion is rather than just you
[01:55:31] know you just got called out for saying
[01:55:32] phone book do they exist anymore no no I
[01:55:37] know it's been I didn't even think about
[01:55:39] that
[01:55:41] yeah um I I I'll give it one last look
[01:55:44] here if there's any more critical
[01:55:45] comments I've been live for 115 minutes
[01:55:48] now so I'll go ahead and leave this
[01:55:49] video up for a minute for people to
[01:55:52] check out uh I'm just you know I'm I'm a
[01:55:54] deeply concerned person in a
[01:55:57] profession who doesn't know what to do
[01:55:59] other than to speak what they know
[01:56:01] that's that's all I know to do I know
[01:56:03] that everyone isn't going to feel the
[01:56:05] same way I'm under no Illusions but I am
[01:56:07] hopeful that those who are truly being
[01:56:09] Les misled who are open-minded to the
[01:56:12] topic will
[01:56:13] understand that it's a it's a tough
[01:56:17] situation out
[01:56:18] there okay I guess I'll end this you
[01:56:21] guys are amazing talk to you later

[00:24] that energy this can be such a great way
[00:27] to pique their interest and get them so
[00:28] excited about learning in life in
[00:30] general these are like puzzle games for
[00:32] your dog it's a dog donut I want to eat
[00:35] this I'm not going to with BarkBox
[00:37] nothing is ordinary everything is
[00:39] exceptional they smell like oatmeal
[00:41] cookies smell those catch it there it is
[00:43] there's dangly bits there's textures
[00:45] there's squeakers because I know how
[00:47] much dogs like that variation and
[00:49] contrast in their toys this is a super
[00:51] tour toy Super tours for those tough
[00:53] dogs look at all the nice grooves you
[00:55] can put peanut butter in here you can
[00:56] freeze it that'll bring a lot of
[00:58] interest toys like this are incredible
[00:59] for for keeping your dog occupied when
[01:01] you're a little bit busy so that they
[01:02] have something to do it's like an iPhone
[01:04] for dogs dishwasher safe if your dog
[01:06] does rip it off you still have a toy
[01:08] that will last for eternity you can get
[01:10] a free Bark Box or a super chewer box
[01:12] when you sign up for a subscription
[01:13] barkbox.com dog training and
[01:15] superchewer.com dog training links Below
[01:18] have you ever heard the saying
[01:19] preparation is where the game is won
[01:21] it's like that when you get a new dog
[01:22] from creating a puppy safe environment
[01:24] to navigating the emotional roller
[01:26] coaster shade is going to be here any
[01:28] moment and we've got to puppy proof this
[01:30] house when you're puppy proofing focus
[01:31] on high risk zones so when I'm puppy
[01:35] proofing I really want to get eye level
[01:37] to the ground all right so we got some
[01:39] things on the table there we're gonna
[01:40] have to get rid of look at all these
[01:42] things this is our dog ND right here so
[01:44] we're gonna go put her over here wow
[01:47] look at all those Sparkles I think
[01:49] Andy's with us little things like the
[01:51] remote control here these need to be put
[01:53] up police binoculars so all these
[01:56] shelves I've got to clear off here
[01:58] looks like the dogs are over here
[01:59] playing having a good time literally get
[02:01] down on your dog's level and check the
[02:03] environment for things that are at your
[02:05] dog's height this can make it a lot
[02:06] easier to notice those things that you
[02:08] need to puppy proof I assure you that
[02:10] the vast majority of puppies are going
[02:12] to try and interact with or chew just
[02:15] about anything that they can reach
[02:16] things like wooden legs are going to be
[02:18] a Temptation for a puppy we've got those
[02:21] everywhere watch out for any hazards
[02:23] like chemicals garbage or other objects
[02:25] that your dog might want to chew or
[02:27] ingest if you've got plants in your
[02:29] house Google them to find out if they're
[02:30] safe or toxic looks like we've got a
[02:33] cord dangling right there that can't be
[02:35] good loose electrical cords are so
[02:37] tempting for many dogs and potentially
[02:39] hazardous so take a look and try and
[02:41] identify these in your house and make
[02:43] sure they're Out Of Reach pet gates can
[02:44] be your best friend to limit access to
[02:47] certain spaces we've got this pet gate
[02:48] right here in order to keep the dogs and
[02:50] the puppy up here in this area where we
[02:52] can easily supervise them and prevent
[02:54] unwanted problems so I have these other
[02:56] rooms here I'm going to keep these door
[02:58] doors closed because I want to limit the
[03:00] puppy's access to only the main living
[03:03] area you can see this is the location
[03:05] where I've decided to set up Shades
[03:06] crate this is where I'm hoping to have
[03:09] him feel comfortable ideally it might be
[03:11] a good idea to place the crate near a
[03:13] non-window wall so that your dog doesn't
[03:15] get too overly stimulated now in this
[03:17] series we're going to be showing you how
[03:19] to get your dog comfortable with a crate
[03:20] even if they don't like it getting a new
[03:22] puppy or a dog is always an emotional
[03:24] Journey you would be right to anticipate
[03:26] the very high highs and the low lows
[03:29] you're definitely going to fall in love
[03:31] with your new puppy and you're going to
[03:32] Marvel at their intelligence and they're
[03:34] incredibly authentic loving nature
[03:36] however there are almost certainly going
[03:39] to be some hurdles like house training
[03:41] for example where a lack of preparation
[03:43] can mean frequent accidents or chewed up
[03:45] items sleep disruptions for you are a
[03:49] very real possibility which can also
[03:51] take an emotional toll on the human all
[03:53] of these factors can lead to stress and
[03:55] strain for all involved if you want to
[03:57] navigate these Peaks and valleys all you
[03:59] need to do is
[04:01] let me know if you figure it out or you
[04:03] could consider the following keep a cool
[04:05] head stay patient and guide your puppy
[04:08] through regressions you're going to be
[04:09] fine and on track and we'll be showing
[04:11] you how to do that throughout the series
[04:12] you're in good hands now consider the
[04:15] importance of having a predictable
[04:16] routine for your dog a consistent
[04:18] routine isn't just for your puppy it's a
[04:21] sanity saver for you as well see the
[04:24] whole thing is that predictability can
[04:26] help alleviate stress for you and your
[04:28] dog now we can't make progress with our
[04:30] dogs when we're in a frustrated mindset
[04:32] so taking a break until you can come
[04:34] back with a cool head is a pro move for
[04:37] a quick stress reliever for a dog you
[04:39] can consider something as minute as
[04:41] giving them a sniff break outside by
[04:43] going outside and letting your dog
[04:44] explore with their nose you're giving
[04:46] them a real opportunity to feel
[04:48] satisfied in doing this species-specific
[04:51] Behavior allocate time for things like
[04:53] free walks that's where we give our dogs
[04:55] leeway to explore their environment just
[04:57] the act of sniffing is mentally
[04:59] enriching for dogs and when you combine
[05:01] that with fresh air and the moderate
[05:04] exercising you're giving them you're
[05:06] both going to come back from that outing
[05:08] refreshed and likely happier these
[05:11] sensory experiences like these free
[05:13] walks can be amazing for dogs and you
[05:15] might find that they work wonders for
[05:16] your mental health as well so here's the
[05:18] thing brie is getting shade he's a
[05:19] couple of hours from here we did a potty
[05:21] break and she's not wasting any time
[05:23] she's taking shade to the vet right now
[05:25] we basically just want to make sure that
[05:26] he's completely healthy for the series
[05:28] and he needs his next round of vaccines
[05:30] so far so good oh my gosh that was my
[05:33] first kiss the amount of pee and poo
[05:36] that this dog has inside of him is like
[05:38] nothing I've ever seen in my life and
[05:39] there's more to this than just a health
[05:41] checkpoint this is a major milestone for
[05:43] him in his overall socialization journey
[05:46] and I promise you we're going to be
[05:47] covering socialization of puppies this
[05:49] age in great detail throughout this
[05:51] series during a wellness check like this
[05:53] the vet is basically giving your dog a
[05:55] head-to-tail inspection looking for any
[05:58] health issues getting your puppy to the
[06:00] vet early is a necessity it's a
[06:02] requirement and plus it gives you a
[06:03] health Baseline for their overall
[06:05] well-being knowing what's normal early
[06:06] on can make it infinitely easy to spot
[06:09] health issues later on down the line and
[06:11] now right from the beginning is the best
[06:13] time to get to know your dog's
[06:15] personality and their General Behavior
[06:16] because Behavior changes can be an early
[06:19] signal of medical issues later on and
[06:21] plus this is giving shade an invaluable
[06:24] experience out of vet's office which is
[06:26] such a critical socialization step for
[06:28] all dogs now we have two existing pets
[06:31] that can produce present a ton of
[06:34] variables when we're introducing a new
[06:35] puppy to our household because shade is
[06:37] moving in with us full time for a few
[06:39] weeks he's moving in with our two other
[06:41] dogs as well now if you've already got
[06:43] existing pets at home there are some
[06:45] additional things to consider in order
[06:47] to ensure success so I'm going to share
[06:49] my action plan with you as to what I'm
[06:50] going to do to prepare our current pets
[06:53] to be ready for shade I found that a
[06:56] solid workout with our resident dogs
[06:58] inertia and Veronica will likely lay the
[07:01] groundwork for a much more relaxed
[07:03] appropriate introduction there's
[07:04] actually a lot of science to this
[07:06] physical exercise fires up those
[07:07] endorphins those are those feel-good
[07:10] hormones that act as natural mood
[07:12] stabilizers and isn't that what we want
[07:15] from all of our dogs stable moods
[07:17] exercise like this also amps up dogs
[07:19] serotonin levels too if you ask me that
[07:22] is another win for keeping everyone's
[07:24] attitude and Vibe much more positive and
[07:26] of course a dog who's recently exercised
[07:28] is much less likely to negatively act
[07:31] out because they've released so much of
[07:33] that pent-up energy I'm on the edge of
[07:35] my seat shade is just about to arrive
[07:37] mom just pulled up oh you are so dense
[07:40] meat shade this Connie Corso is destined
[07:44] for greatness but a lot needs to happen
[07:46] before then this dog could top out at
[07:48] 150 pounds and if shade doesn't know how
[07:50] to respond to that he could pull someone
[07:51] over or Worse we're talking sit stay
[07:54] calm socialization you name it you do
[07:57] this one thing your training results are
[07:59] going to Skyrocket from the fundamentals
[08:01] like potty training to the challenges of
[08:04] a multi-dog household
[08:06] man that's a good bite good man we're
[08:09] delving deep into what it takes to train
[08:11] a giant breed dog like shade to be the
[08:14] best dog he can be stay tuned for an
[08:16] approach that's backed by the latest
[08:17] science and ethics and trust me you

TRANSCRIPTION:

[00:00] it's shaping up to be a pretty active
[00:01] first 24 hours I'm Zach George if you
[00:03] really want to know how to train a dog
[00:05] from day one you've hit the jackpot with
[00:08] this series meet shade a Kane Corso so
[00:10] raw in his training he's essentially a
[00:12] blank canvas over the next few weeks I
[00:15] have the task of teaching him to be the
[00:17] epitome of a well- behaved dog we're
[00:19] going to tackle those common puppy
[00:20] challenges housebreaking not so
[00:22] desirable to me teaching him how to
[00:24] focus and pay attention mitigating
[00:26] problematic behaviors like biting and
[00:27] chewing yes okay that was great
[00:29] mastering leash etiquette socialization
[00:32] and so much more can we be candid for a
[00:34] second real dog training is a roller
[00:36] coaster there are always lots of ups and
[00:38] downs you'll see each triumphant moment
[00:40] each stumble and exactly how we navigate

[00:57] welcome to your ultimate puppy survival
[01:00] guide let's meet shade and his mom
[01:02] Caitlyn hi my name is Caitlyn and this
[01:04] is shade since he's going to be such a
[01:06] big boy I really want to make sure that
[01:08] he has good leash manners and he's not
[01:11] going to pull and I just know that as he
[01:13] gets bigger that strength is just going
[01:15] to grow I am absolutely hoping to
[01:17] improve shad's house training I don't
[01:19] want him to be a problem jumper I want
[01:21] to make sure he comes when he's called I
[01:23] just want to make sure that he's a great
[01:25] companion for as long as he can be with
[01:27] us it's important to pay attention to
[01:29] the emotional state of any dog we work
[01:31] with particularly when we're first
[01:33] meeting them we have to learn about that
[01:35] individual dog as I approached I noticed
[01:38] that shade backed away at first shade
[01:41] was nervous to approach me I want to be
[01:43] really sensitive to how he's perceiving
[01:44] me cuz I can come on kind of strong
[01:46] sometimes with dogs it's important to be
[01:48] sensitive to dogs at this age in
[01:49] particular and we don't want to make too
[01:51] many snap judgments about what that
[01:53] dog's personality is like the
[01:54] international language of food that's
[01:56] one way to build trust oh look at the
[01:58] tail it's little he's going I'd like to
[02:01] see if they're interested in toys or how
[02:03] curious they might be over the next few
[02:05] weeks we're tackling multiple fronts
[02:06] with shade we're going to attempt to
[02:08] build his confidence and socialize him
[02:10] this is huge for young dogs there's a
[02:11] lot to cover but it's all going to be
[02:13] part of a holistic approach to his
[02:16] well-being the bond and the trust number
[02:19] one can't do anything unless you have a
[02:20] good bond with the dog Bri is just about
[02:22] to arrive with shade my plan is to have
[02:25] the dogs outside when shade arrives I
[02:28] think I'm just going to go straight into
[02:29] the introduction with them you just
[02:31] never know how dog tog Dynamics are
[02:33] going to go Brie just called me to tell
[02:35] me he's very emotional and crying and
[02:37] barking a lot it's okay shade and I can
[02:40] totally understand this I mean from his
[02:42] perspective he's just been abducted one
[02:44] of my main priorities here in the first
[02:46] 24 hours is going to be to make this dog
[02:49] feel comfortable and loved and accepted
[02:51] it's shaping up to be a pretty active
[02:53] first 24 hours I think by exercising
[02:56] Veronica and inertia and making sure
[02:57] they feel satisfied before they meet sh
[03:00] that we're going to increase the odds of
[03:01] a delightful first introduction between
[03:04] those two all right nurse has been
[03:05] talked into a game of zumies I'm going
[03:07] to continue to take some time here get
[03:09] the dogs a little more exercised I just
[03:11] want to make sure there's not a lot of
[03:12] pent up energy mom just pulled up I've
[03:15] been sure to pick up you know any
[03:17] resources that might be out like
[03:18] frisbees I don't want any conflict I
[03:20] want the dogs to enjoy each other I
[03:22] think I'll introduce them through the
[03:23] fence first make sure there's no red
[03:25] flags from either one is the puppy going
[03:26] to be really excited and wanting to play
[03:28] or is shade going to be a little bit
[03:29] nervous I'm guessing a little bit
[03:31] nervous which is one of the reasons I
[03:32] want to do one dog at a time are you
[03:35] nervous he looks a little nervous right
[03:37] now yep there's a little bit of pee as
[03:39] predicted right now we have him on a
[03:40] collar but we are going to be fitting
[03:42] him for a harness and you can see how
[03:43] inera is getting small for the puppy why
[03:45] don't you go ahead and pick up Veronica
[03:47] if you don't mind cuz I want to focus
[03:48] mainly on inertia I'm also looking at
[03:50] shade here he's a little standoffish
[03:52] more than anything which this normal for
[03:54] puppies see how a nurse is trying to be
[03:56] super sweet lying down you're doing a
[03:58] great job he's kind of leaning on me
[04:00] here so he wants to get close but he
[04:02] wants a little reassurance and so I
[04:04] really am just trying to avoid
[04:05] overwhelming him straight away that's
[04:07] inertia inertia this is shade I mean
[04:09] just a few extra minutes it can't hurt
[04:12] anything okay come
[04:14] on okay say
[04:18] hi so I'm going to drop the leash let
[04:20] them interact naturally right now I
[04:23] think I can take the leash off now and
[04:24] let them explore naturally it's a secure
[04:26] environment and so I'm just looking for
[04:28] a polite greeting in general we want to
[04:30] make sure that the dogs are playing at
[04:34] similar levels good girl inertia inera
[04:36] is being pretty low key not being all up
[04:38] in his business Anders just doing such a
[04:40] good job of testing him and then backing
[04:43] off for a minute and kind of sniffing
[04:44] around so we got a moose right there do
[04:46] you see the Moose there's a moose I
[04:48] think we'll go to the sidey yard and
[04:50] resume while we as a family deeply
[04:53] appreciate Wildlife it's crucial to
[04:55] approach it with caution moose often
[04:57] deemed Alaska's most dangerous animal
[05:00] can be particularly unpredictable to
[05:02] minimize risks and keep things peaceful
[05:04] we're going to relocate to another
[05:05] section of the yard I mean the principle
[05:07] is pretty simple here deescalation works
[05:09] not just with dogs but with Wildlife
[05:11] like moose too I'm going to put inertia
[05:13] up let's go ahead and have the dogs
[05:15] greet through a fence that way there's
[05:16] somewhat of a safety net for both of
[05:18] them in case one feels overwhelmed so
[05:20] she's a little nervous she's trying to
[05:22] figure out what to make of
[05:27] him a nice shake off a shake off like
[05:30] this in dogs is a signal that serves as
[05:32] a form of emotional regulation and it
[05:35] really is part of an animal's complex
[05:37] system of body language when you see a
[05:39] dog shake off like this it's a lot like
[05:40] watching them hit a reset button on
[05:42] their emotional state often you'll see
[05:44] these Shake offs after a tense or
[05:46] uncertain situation has passed it's
[05:48] almost like a physical manifestation of
[05:50] the dog's desire to shed or dispel
[05:54] residual stress from a scientific
[05:56] standpoint one could argue that the
[05:58] shake off serves as a mechanism to
[06:00] restore emotional homeostasis much like
[06:02] a human might take a deep breath for
[06:04] self-calming purposes Shake offs like
[06:06] this also serve as a communicative body
[06:09] language informing others be it dogs or
[06:11] humans that the dog is Shifting its
[06:13] emotional state understanding the shake
[06:15] off and other canine body language that
[06:17] we'll discuss routinely throughout the
[06:18] series offers invaluable insights into a
[06:21] dog's emotional well-being yeah here he
[06:23] goes she's keeping her distance all fine
[06:27] and so I'm here to advocate for both
[06:29] dogs should anything look weird but so
[06:31] far this all looks pretty healthy
[06:32] initially first impressions are
[06:34] Veronica's nervous but very curious and
[06:37] very interested she's quite respectful
[06:38] of him he's respectful of her he's not
[06:40] coming on too strong looks like pretty
[06:43] healthy puppy behavior in my book so
[06:45] we're having a house built on one hand I
[06:46] could be annoyed by this since I'm
[06:48] trying to produce a series but I
[06:49] actually kind of appreciate it as a dog
[06:51] trainer because construction sounds and
[06:54] noises right off the bat you can see he
[06:56] he's taking notice and he's never seen
[06:58] anything like that trembling yeah he is
[07:00] trembling a little nervous as we witness
[07:02] shade's reaction to this construction
[07:04] equipment it's normal to feel concerned
[07:06] by the trembling and will give him
[07:08] Comfort looking for signs of gradual
[07:10] relaxation and curiosity this approach
[07:12] really aligns with the principles of
[07:15] desensitization essentially aiming to
[07:17] reduce fear through measured and
[07:19] thoughtful exposure we want to be
[07:20] patient dog training understanding when
[07:22] to proceed and when to pull back
[07:24] requires a lot of observation and
[07:26] experience with shade's reaction to that
[07:28] construction noise I've opted to
[07:30] continue the exposure at a comfortable
[07:32] distance really balancing his
[07:33] nervousness one that can lead to
[07:35] significant growth and confidence with
[07:37] shade over time the key here is to
[07:39] monitor closely recognizing Improvement
[07:41] and being ready to adjust if needed we
[07:43] also want to be careful of sensitization
[07:46] with him which is basically where if we
[07:48] expose him to something that's causing
[07:49] him too much stress it can get worse
[07:51] sensitization occurs when a dog stress
[07:53] or fear response intensifies upon
[07:56] repeated exposure to a specific stimulus
[07:58] in this case it would be the
[08:00] construction noise but given that he's
[08:02] allowed to kind of maintain that
[08:03] distance he could go farther away if he
[08:06] was really scared he might go over there
[08:07] or towards the door while it is crucial
[08:10] to expose dogs to various environments
[08:12] for socialization there is a fine line
[08:15] that we have to tread too much stress
[08:17] especially without the opportunity for
[08:20] positive associations can lead to an
[08:22] escalated emotional state each time the
[08:24] dog encounters that same noise in the
[08:26] future so it's not really just a matter
[08:28] of getting your dog used to it without
[08:30] careful management the emotional toll
[08:32] can increase complicating future
[08:35] training and well-being ultimately the
[08:36] idea is to make our training environment
[08:39] as conducive as possible for positive
[08:42] learning experiences I'm kind of staying
[08:44] out here intentionally for a little
[08:45] while just cuz he's starting to do
[08:47] better jumping is one of my biggest
[08:48] concerns with dogs like this I'm going
[08:50] to back up here so he doesn't get
[08:52] reinforced for it I want to see how he
[08:54] reacts when I play Frisbee with inertia
[08:56] when I see even a glimmer of Interest in
[08:59] the toy from a dog those early signs hit
[09:02] at the possibility that we may be able
[09:03] to establish some type of play ritual
[09:06] love that he's curious like fetch or
[09:08] tug-of-war down the line engaging in
[09:10] play can trigger not just serotonin and
[09:12] dopamine but also oxytocin and other
[09:15] endorphins and these neurochemicals are
[09:17] like natural accelerators for positive
[09:20] change so that's an area that I really
[09:22] want to pay special attention to and
[09:24] nourish oh he's got the chase in him
[09:26] okay first P good man I think it's time
[09:30] to introduce him to the inside so my
[09:32] goal now is just to give him an
[09:33] introduction to the main living area
[09:35] where he'll be spending his time with us
[09:37] I hope my puppy proofing was sufficient
[09:39] because my objective now is to let him
[09:41] freely explore this area which is
[09:43] relatively small but you know I'm really
[09:46] still buzzing from that moment that he
[09:48] showed interest in the toy a little
[09:50] while ago to me play isn't just some
[09:52] little optional extra if a dog shows any
[09:55] joy in it I think it's a must that we
[09:57] harness that puppies need a lot of
[09:59] tactile engagement with their
[10:00] environment so I love things that are
[10:02] different textures for them this texture
[10:04] is different than this texture is
[10:06] different than this crinkly texture and
[10:09] the way that I've guaranteed that our
[10:10] dogs and the dogs I'm working with
[10:12] continue to get those experiences are by
[10:14] getting Bark Box what come on I didn't
[10:17] even know that it's a pizza bagel a
[10:19] puzzle toy essentially a rated R movie
[10:22] VHS that is fine art they'll send you a
[10:25] variety of really well-thought out dog
[10:27] toys along with amazing treats and
[10:29] choose every single month you can choose
[10:31] from two categories dogs who are really
[10:33] hard on toys that's super chewer but
[10:35] look how hard BarkBox toys are more
[10:37] plush but still very tough tough dogs
[10:39] also want furry toys super chewers come
[10:42] up with this as your dog continues to
[10:44] enjoy it this will emerge and this is a
[10:46] really practical toy you can put things
[10:48] like peanut butter in here to really
[10:50] make these toys even more enjoyable
[10:52] that's a super chewer tug toy this will
[10:54] be perfect for shade when he's like a
[10:55] few weeks older right now you can choose
[10:58] $50 worth of toys treats and more when
[11:01] you subscribe using my special link I'll
[11:04] have it in the description you know that
[11:06] it's all about play for me sooner you
[11:08] get that going the better structured
[11:09] play offers a gold mine of benefits it's
[11:12] not just a motivator but it's a catalyst
[11:14] for learning allowing us to really tap
[11:16] into those awesome brain chemicals we
[11:17] talked about a moment ago see they don't
[11:19] just appear they flood the system
[11:20] enhancing emotional well-being and their
[11:23] cognitive function which as a dog
[11:25] trainer is really in our best interest
[11:27] I'm looking for any potenti poal signs
[11:29] of resource guarding the toys on his
[11:32] end good man I think we just got our
[11:34] first
[11:36] fch yeah I'm going to have to be
[11:39] conservative with exercising him with
[11:41] him being so young and being a large
[11:42] breed dog Veronica's reaction is going
[11:45] to be a little bit more complex there's
[11:47] a little bit of concern over here with
[11:48] Veronica she's not like hey let's play
[11:50] Let's play in the way that inertia is
[11:52] she's a little more reserved
[11:54] understandably he's much bigger than she
[11:55] is he's 30 lb she's only 13 lb more than
[11:59] than double her size in this first
[12:01] indoor introduction you'll notice
[12:03] Veronica is on the couch Her Eyes Are
[12:05] Fixed On shade let's talk about her
[12:07] emotional state for a moment you can see
[12:09] her stress levels are likely a little
[12:11] bit elevated this is all really new to
[12:13] her this form of observational learning
[12:15] is so invaluable now it's a lowrisk way
[12:18] for her to engage her environment now
[12:20] very different because there is this new
[12:22] strange dog that's entered it you might
[12:24] be tempted to rush this process and put
[12:27] your dog directly on the ground but
[12:29] let's evaluate why that is not ideal
[12:31] here that could Spike those stress
[12:32] hormones like cortisol maybe adrenaline
[12:34] which could hinder her ability to think
[12:36] freely and make reasoned decisions very
[12:39] often observation is by far the best
[12:42] first step every dog has a unique
[12:44] personality and Veronica's apprehension
[12:46] is a reminder that introductions require
[12:49] attentiveness to each dog's Comfort
[12:51] level I don't think her behavior is a
[12:52] roadblock or anything it's an
[12:54] opportunity to explore and address what
[12:56] might be causing her unease this is a
[12:58] big part part of managing a multi-dog
[13:00] household recognizing each dog's needs
[13:02] and emotions and responding with empathy
[13:04] and skill and right now I'm just
[13:07] allowing Veronica to observe where she
[13:10] basically is just kind of filing
[13:11] information we'll see how it gets
[13:13] processed throughout the relationship in
[13:15] terms of socialization with him I do
[13:17] have some concerns I got a video from
[13:20] his mom Caitlyn he currently lives with
[13:22] another dog but there was some
[13:23] concerning behavior that I saw with
[13:25] shade and the other older dog that I
[13:27] want to make sure were on top of so
[13:30] basically you got a little firm with an
[13:31] older dog and even mounted the dog if
[13:34] healthy Corrections by our dogs are
[13:36] needed I'm hoping to see that it really
[13:38] is evident that he could benefit from
[13:40] more social cues from other dogs his
[13:43] behavior though typical for his age
[13:44] could possibly lead to issues down the
[13:46] road if we don't address them I'll be
[13:48] closely monitoring any appropriate
[13:50] Corrections from our older dogs these
[13:52] are natural ways that dogs communicate
[13:54] boundaries to one another but it's far
[13:56] removed from Human imposed aversive
[13:58] techniques I want to get them on a
[14:00] harness ASAP here what's this contrary
[14:02] to popular belief a harness does not
[14:04] teach a dog to pull so let's address
[14:07] that we are going to be using the
[14:08] harness for safe containment not
[14:11] communication I really just want to get
[14:12] him comfortable with this touching him
[14:15] and so far it's not phasing him a bit I
[14:17] want to at least get him comfortable
[14:19] with the harness try something look at
[14:21] that do you see how we're using a treat
[14:23] to guide his head through we're really
[14:25] sidest stepping any potential stress
[14:27] that forcing the harness could pause
[14:29] this makes putting on the harness a
[14:31] friction free experience do you see how
[14:33] we got him to voluntarily put the
[14:35] harness on so I'm just letting him walk
[14:36] around for a second with it on here I'm
[14:38] going to put some treats on the ground
[14:40] there just by putting a good treat and
[14:42] having him put his head through the hole
[14:44] it is this easy to make these small
[14:47] extra efforts in order to have dramatic
[14:49] gains it can be hard to resist rushing
[14:51] through people say positive
[14:53] reinforcement takes longer they're not
[14:55] right and so now with the leash and the
[14:57] harness we can really monitor him and
[15:00] these two can't be forgotten either
[15:01] they're doing a great job now we have a
[15:04] leash and a harness so we can control
[15:07] the environment keep him from
[15:08] overwhelming Veronica getting into
[15:10] trouble and just teach him how to be a
[15:12] great boy all right shade let's go
[15:14] outside sir I know that he's extremely
[15:17] likely to pee and or poop in this house
[15:19] cuz he hasn't identified as his living
[15:21] area it's important to let dogs out
[15:23] every 30 minutes every hour or so
[15:26] especially during the first day or two
[15:27] I'd rather take him out too much and
[15:29] have him not go but man so I'm going to
[15:33] walk him around here so far he hasn't
[15:34] had to go I've been out here a few
[15:35] minutes and this is how it goes you're
[15:37] not entitled to uh success every time
[15:39] you come outside here the important
[15:41] thing is that we're giving him
[15:42] opportunities because his potty
[15:44] accidents even as a puppy are going to
[15:46] be no joke and you can imagine if his
[15:48] house training doesn't get under control
[15:49] what that's going to be like well done
[15:52] Mom is cooking dinner we have Veronica
[15:54] lying down right here then we have shade
[15:56] over here all the way across the the
[15:58] room and this is a good way to give
[16:00] Veronica some exposure so while we
[16:03] prepared dinner they're learning to
[16:04] coexist in this calm and controlled
[16:07] environment this will really ease them
[16:09] into familiarity with one another
[16:10] without overwhelming either dog
[16:12] especially Veronica you can see the art
[16:14] of introducing dogs to each other is
[16:16] nuanced and this scenario really
[16:18] illustrates the importance of being
[16:20] patient observing each dog's Dynamics
[16:23] and understanding their individual needs
[16:24] I think he SSE I can't believe we're
[16:27] only a few hours in and we've done this
[16:29] much already when I tell you we're going
[16:30] to cover everything your new puppy needs
[16:32] to know I'm not exaggerating shade must
[16:35] learn better dog to dog etiquette leash
[16:37] skills are a must for giant breed dogs
[16:40] like this we're going to be diving deep
[16:42] into socialization as well as all of
[16:45] that critical foundational training our
[16:47] journey together has only just begun the
[16:49] transformation promises to be remarkable

Description:
How to train your dog "YES"! Unlock a groundbreaking approach to dog training with the instant transformative power of the word “yes”. This is one of the foundational lessons I introduce first to any dog I'm working with. Teaching your dog the meaning of “yes” not only simplifies communication but also revolutionizes the way they respond to cues. When “yes” becomes meaningful, dogs will strive, with an unparalleled enthusiasm, to earn that affirmation. This results in lightning-quick learning, extraordinary outcomes, and a dog that’s always eager and in an impeccable emotional state during training sessions. Especially for those new to the dog training journey, this technique is a game-changer, turning challenges into opportunities and ensuring that both trainer and trainee enjoy every moment.

[00:00] I'm Zach George if you really want to
[00:02] know how to train a dog from day one
[00:04] you've hit the jackpot with this series
[00:06] subscribe to my channel and click that
[00:07] Thumbs Up Button meet Shay over the next
[00:09] few weeks I have the task of teaching
[00:12] him to be the epitome of a well- behaved
[00:14] dog we're going to tackle those common
[00:16] puppy challenges teaching them how to
[00:17] focus and pay attention welcome to the
[00:19] ultimate puppy Survival Guide in my
[00:22] first real training session we're going
[00:24] to establish the meaning of the word yes
[00:27] setting the foundation for not only his
[00:29] Basics but for Advanced Training in the
[00:30] future too this is going to unlock
[00:32] remarkable possibilities the way we
[00:34] train dogs on this YouTube channel isn't
[00:36] by waiting for a dog to do something we
[00:38] don't want them to do to then say no and
[00:41] scold them I think what's instinctive to
[00:43] most people when they have a dog is to
[00:45] continuously tell them no when their dog
[00:47] is doing something they don't like them
[00:48] to do no judgment here we've all been
[00:50] there for instance some people will
[00:52] resort to saying no when a dog jumps on
[00:54] guests without effectively teaching an
[00:57] alternative Behavior like sitting
[00:59] similarly others might use no as a
[01:01] reflexive response to prevent a dog from
[01:04] picking up a shoe or something like that
[01:06] without providing guidance on what the
[01:07] dog should do instead if you can somehow
[01:10] reverse that in your thinking and start
[01:12] acknowledging when your dog is doing
[01:14] something you like your training results
[01:16] are going to Skyrocket it's essential to
[01:19] reframe our Focus from what we don't
[01:21] want the dog to do to what we'd like
[01:23] them to do instead one of the first
[01:25] things I like to teach a dog is the word
[01:27] yes yes is amazing we're just going to
[01:29] do some oldfashioned pavlovian
[01:31] conditioning here also known as
[01:32] classical conditioning was showcased by
[01:35] the Russian scientist Ivan Pavlov using
[01:37] dogs so he basically found that
[01:39] consistently ringing a bell before
[01:40] feeding dogs essentially caused them to
[01:43] drool or salivate when they heard the
[01:45] Bell even when no food was given after
[01:47] doing this a repeated number of times
[01:48] all we have to do is say yes ring the
[01:51] bell and give him a treat I guess a
[01:53] human version of this might be like when
[01:55] our favorite song plays and we instantly
[01:57] feel great I'm just using part of his me
[01:59] meal so I'm going to say
[02:02] yes then go ahead and give him that
[02:04] treat by teaching him the word yes and
[02:06] making sure that that word has a
[02:08] powerful connection with something that
[02:09] he loves food play access to a really
[02:13] cool place there are certain triggers
[02:14] that can lead to automatic reactions and
[02:17] that really is the magic we're tapping
[02:18] into with the word yes for shade when a
[02:20] dog learns that yes signals an incoming
[02:23] reward it fundamentally changes their
[02:26] approach to behavior this simple yet
[02:28] powerful communication Sparks their
[02:30] Ingenuity it motivates them to actively
[02:33] engage in actions that we find desirable
[02:37] let's get some vocabulary out of the way
[02:38] the term Mark for our purposes will mean
[02:41] when we acknowledge the moment yes that
[02:44] our dog does something we like save the
[02:46] word yes for when your dog is guaranteed
[02:49] to get whatever it is that they find
[02:51] reinforcing in this case a treat yes if
[02:54] you find yourself without treats which
[02:56] you shouldn't for the first 2 years of
[02:57] having a dog have them in your pocket if
[02:59] possible but reality happens if you do
[03:02] try to say something like
[03:04] good
[03:06] yes what did I just do there good means
[03:09] warmer warmer hot every time I say hot
[03:14] right I'm going to give a treat do you
[03:15] get the metaphor the connection here
[03:17] over time your dog will learn enough
[03:19] goods equals a yes dog trainers call
[03:22] that a continuation marker during this
[03:25] initial phase all we're doing is saying
[03:27] yes following it up with a treat it
[03:29] really is that simple this communicates
[03:31] to them when I hear the word yes I can
[03:33] look out for some yes something I like
[03:36] while the word yes can ignite enthusiasm
[03:38] and positive brain activity relying so
[03:40] much on no well that can elicit negative
[03:43] emotions our philosophy cultivate the
[03:45] best emotional state in a dog as it
[03:47] leads to the most profound training
[03:49] outcomes since I know I'm going to be
[03:51] teaching him lie down in the next few
[03:53] hours the fact that he offered it just
[03:55] then I wanted to take advantage of that
[03:58] and say yes even though that's not
[03:59] technically what we're doing right now
[04:01] let's talk about his body language right
[04:03] now what do you think he's saying I
[04:04] think he's saying he might be a bit
[04:06] tired you know puppies like this need to
[04:08] sleep the majority of the day we really
[04:11] want to take advantage of times when
[04:12] they are conscious to give them good
[04:14] experiences whether that be play or some
[04:16] light training like this when shade is
[04:18] really engaged that's when we lean into
[04:20] training when he needs a break we
[04:22] respect that this behavior isn't him
[04:24] rejecting to work with me but a more
[04:26] subtle form of communication I mean
[04:29] shade has chosen to still stay near me
[04:31] even while he's facing away from me
[04:33] which really signals to me a level of
[04:35] trust and comfort but also probably the
[04:38] need for a break too by paying attention
[04:40] to things like that that's how you can
[04:41] measure active participation cuz that's
[04:44] our goal we're not just looking for an
[04:46] animal to comply no matter what with us
[04:48] we want them to be an active participant
[04:50] so that they know how to make decisions
[04:51] when we're not there telling them what
[04:53] to do when you look at training as a
[04:54] two-way conversation I think you'll be
[04:56] much happier with your results and I'm
[04:57] not going to forget about inertia over
[04:59] here either yes since she's doing a good
[05:02] job I feel like I've laid the groundwork
[05:05] for yes we don't want that big brain
[05:07] thinking too hard too quickly you know
[05:09] do you all find yourself using the word
[05:11] yes or no of those two choices more in
[05:14] your training mastering basic skills
[05:17] refining his leash walking skills I mean
[05:19] he's going to be massive continuing to
[05:21] curtail behaviors like unwanted chewing
[05:23] and jumping and nurturing his social
[05:25] interactions with other dogs these are
[05:27] all big priorities of mine click thumbs

[00:00] what is the first thing we should train
[00:02] our dogs that's exactly the question
[00:04] that we will address and I will show you
[00:06] with shade the Kane corso puppy exactly
[00:10] how I approach training and the first
[00:12] thing that I train a dog and what we
[00:14] cover in that short five minute video
[00:16] it's the most recent video on my channel
[00:17] as of right now the posting of this
[00:19] video anyway um it really shows you the
[00:22] distinction the difference between how
[00:25] modern dog trainers approach dog
[00:27] behavior versus you know the outdated
[00:30] types who are still using prong collars
[00:31] and choke chains to communicate with
[00:33] dogs and again I'm not coming down on
[00:35] everyday people who use those tools but
[00:38] you know you know that we have to call
[00:40] out professional trainers who are still
[00:42] using these outdated methods given how
[00:45] much behavior science and applied animal
[00:46] behavior has progressed over the years
[00:48] anyway that video will show you so
[00:51] simply so eloquently and so easily the
[00:54] difference and how to go about training
[00:56] a dog and the first thing you should
[00:57] train them in my opinion

[00:00] real question here have you ever ever
[00:02] caught your dog eyeing those expensive
[00:04] shoes or a piece of furniture before
[00:06] those teeth wreak havoc on your valuable
[00:09] items let me share a secret with you to
[00:11] saving your valuables while also giving
[00:13] your dog the satisfaction of chewing a
[00:15] natural behavior you know how I'm always
[00:17] saying be one step ahead of your dog
[00:19] this is a good example I see him
[00:22] thinking about probably chewing on that
[00:24] wood that makes a lot of sense puppies
[00:26] like to chew on things so I think I am
[00:28] going to go ahead and give them that
[00:28] chew right now let's turbo tendon Che
[00:31] the turbo tendon is a hit and you can
[00:33] see quite literally how hopefully it's
[00:36] saving my furniture and your dog could
[00:39] just as easily be chewing the furniture
[00:41] but by having something that's desirable
[00:43] to chew on nearby when you have a 14we
[00:46] old puppy don't assume they're not going
[00:47] to chew they need to chew have chews of
[00:50] varying degrees of toughness and
[00:52] textures like and follow for more

[00:00] meet shade he's a cone corso puppy and
[00:02] I'm Zach George your dog trainer shade
[00:05] is staying with me for a few weeks where
[00:06] we will lay a training Foundation that
[00:08] will last a lifetime follow this series
[00:10] And subscribe to my channel and I
[00:12] guarantee spectacular results welcome to
[00:15] the ultimate puppy Survival Guide we're
[00:18] finally ready to start getting into
[00:19] training this guy the last time we
[00:21] worked with shade we taught him that the
[00:22] word yes meant that he could look
[00:24] forward to something great so now we're
[00:27] in a position to be like hey I like that
[00:29] I like that and we can follow it up with
[00:31] a reward I'm using part of his meal
[00:32] right now let's put that into practice
[00:34] and start harvesting the benefits my
[00:36] goal in this training session is to
[00:38] teach him three things relatively
[00:40] simultaneously so I hope you can stay
[00:42] with me on this we're going to focus on
[00:44] teaching him how to sit lie down stay
[00:47] and how to be released from a stay
[00:49] generally when I do this I do it with a
[00:51] combination of luring capturing or
[00:54] shaping depending on the dog that I'm
[00:56] working with each dog is unique and
[00:58] different and discovering diverse
[01:00] techniques to engage them in enjoyable
[01:02] ways like shaping luring and capturing
[01:05] consistently deliver outstanding
[01:07] outcomes luring is where we take a treat
[01:10] and we use their nose to steer them yes
[01:14] into a physical position okay fantastic
[01:18] that's his first official release do you
[01:20] remember earlier when I was tossing the
[01:22] treats that was for a reason the reason
[01:25] was I want to be able to bring him into
[01:28] specific positions by tossing a treat in
[01:30] certain directions you see that that's
[01:32] really helpful in training the treat is
[01:34] a magnet to your dog's nose yes okay
[01:39] sure luring offers a very
[01:40] straightforward way to start but
[01:42] capturing that's when our dog showcases
[01:44] specific behaviors on their own without
[01:46] any nudge from us yes capturing he did
[01:50] it naturally I acknowledged it and I
[01:52] said yes not only does this let us
[01:55] reinforce behaviors they initiate
[01:57] without our guidance but it truly
[01:59] empowers them to think independently and
[02:01] naturally make choices that we
[02:03] appreciate plus capturing can often feel
[02:05] more genuine to the dog creating a sense
[02:08] of accomplishment and building their
[02:10] confidence it really Taps into a dog's
[02:11] innate behaviors making the learning
[02:13] process more intuitive for them
[02:15] capturing also reduces Reliance on
[02:17] treats or external rewards and it can
[02:19] foster a really strong bond between a
[02:21] person and their dog as it involves
[02:23] observation and mutual understanding
[02:25] capturing is also really valuable for
[02:27] novel behaviors that might not easily be
[02:30] taught through traditional methods too
[02:31] so we've used luring and capturing so
[02:34] far in this lesson we want him to
[02:35] understand that when he's in a sit or
[02:37] down that he's only to break those
[02:40] positions when we release them
[02:43] okay right there you can say whatever
[02:45] words you want that's up to you yes
[02:49] notice I'm not saying sit I'm not saying
[02:51] down we're just focusing
[02:54] on yes these physical positions that
[02:57] he's doing we'll get to the words in a
[02:59] second second
[03:01] okay yes technically you could just
[03:04] teach your dog in your spare time when
[03:06] you catch them lying down it just
[03:08] requires you to have their currency
[03:10] throughout the house or in your pocket
[03:12] how hard is it to put some treats in
[03:14] your pocket every morning for the first
[03:16] 2 years of your dog's life and when you
[03:17] go on a walk with them you can always
[03:18] get a treat pouch if that makes you feel
[03:20] better that way you always have treats
[03:22] having treats in your pocket might seem
[03:24] like a chore at first but think of it as
[03:26] equipping yourself with a tool for
[03:27] communication just as you would always
[03:30] have your phone or your keys when you're
[03:31] heading out these treats are your direct
[03:34] line to effectively communicating with
[03:35] your dog during these pivotal training
[03:37] years over time as your dog becomes more
[03:39] attuned to your cues and your requests
[03:42] the Reliance on treats will decrease but
[03:44] for now there are small invaluable
[03:46] investment in building a lifetime of
[03:48] good behavior and understanding watch
[03:49] the pause now here pay close attention
[03:52] to the
[03:56] Nuance yes right there there and that is
[04:01] an example of how shaping works I didn't
[04:05] wait for the complete lie down to Mark
[04:07] yes the behavior instead I Mark the
[04:10] moment his foot took that forward step
[04:12] this approach highlights the power of
[04:14] shaping where we reward incremental
[04:17] progress not just the final outcome so
[04:19] we got three different examples of how
[04:22] we can teach lie down luring we're using
[04:24] a treat to guide them into position by
[04:27] using it as a magnet shaping involves
[04:29] rewarding successive approximations of
[04:32] the desired Behavior All right so now
[04:34] how do we tell him to sit yes sit so I'm
[04:38] marking when he does it and I'm saying
[04:41] what it is he's doing yes sit you want
[04:45] to prioritize getting good at your
[04:47] timing if you're new I choose to use my
[04:49] marker word yes first as their butt hits
[04:53] the ground in this case the better you
[04:54] get at letting your dog know the right
[04:57] thing they're doing at the right moment
[04:59] yes do you see how quick that
[05:01] was okay the more successful you're
[05:04] going to be in communicating to them
[05:06] exactly what it is that you
[05:11] want yes down I focus more on hand
[05:14] signals at first dogs are good at using
[05:16] their other senses to take direction
[05:18] from us like their eyes so it's not
[05:20] always about the words you're using hand
[05:22] signals have a host of benefits they
[05:24] give you a lot of options say you're
[05:26] talking on a phone or you're talking
[05:27] with friends you want to be able to have
[05:28] subtle communication with your hands
[05:30] without having to interrupt your
[05:31] conversation one of the benefits to lure
[05:33] training is that it gets you a head
[05:35] start on hand signals observe this I'm
[05:38] utilizing what I call a decoy lore
[05:40] essentially a pretend treat to guide his
[05:43] behavior so for example no
[05:45] treat let's see if we can fake him out
[05:47] yes now once he acts on that visual he's
[05:51] immediately rewarded with an actual
[05:53] treat and okay so by using this decoy to
[05:59] real treat method we're progressively
[06:01] minimizing our dependence on visual LS
[06:04] making training more efficient over time
[06:06] have you also noticed how I'm
[06:07] alternating between releasing him from a
[06:09] sit and releasing him from a lie down
[06:11] from day one just to keep him on his
[06:13] toes
[06:14] yes do you see how he looked like he was
[06:16] going into a down yes but he froze okay
[06:20] right after I said yes he's likely to go
[06:23] into it down let's see what
[06:27] happens yes and this is just from
[06:29] observing him and that's good but by
[06:31] interrupting him and saying yes as he
[06:33] sat he's like whoa I did something right
[06:35] while he doesn't exactly understand sit
[06:37] and down for the long term because we
[06:39] have some practice to do with that he is
[06:42] quickly seeming to understand what the
[06:44] word Yes means and boy if you've got
[06:46] that it's a powerful strategy to have in
[06:49] your corner you could also if you wanted
[06:51] to add Clarity
[06:53] stay okay and I just got my first 2
[06:57] second stay there was an implied stay
[06:59] with would sit and down just then but
[07:01] there's no harm in saying stay giving
[07:04] them a nice clear hand signal yes I'm
[07:07] going to continue to reward here for
[07:11] duration yes cuz at this point he's
[07:14] already gotten in the habit of oh I only
[07:15] move when this guy says okay yes look
[07:18] how comfortable he is right there I like
[07:21] that it's worth giving him 10 Kibbles
[07:24] right now yes over the course of a
[07:27] minute to re enforce this Behavior yes
[07:34] yes yes now watch this I'm going to wait
[07:37] a second here a little bit longer during
[07:39] this interval I'm keeping it random I'm
[07:42] not just a computer I've got to read
[07:44] them here I've got to keep him on his
[07:45] toes a little look at this this is a
[07:48] nice long stay I don't want to push him
[07:49] to failure though he's getting a little
[07:52] impatient so we want to be careful here
[07:55] okay go on there you go good man but
[07:58] what if he starts to anticipate liee
[08:00] down that's really super common at this
[08:02] point in training
[08:06] yes I'm going to cheat a little there by
[08:08] treat placement you might have noticed
[08:11] that I've been rewarding 100% of the
[08:13] time we're not going to do that forever
[08:15] this is kindergarten for our dogs so we
[08:17] want to make it really easy for them
[08:18] they're super smart and so they can
[08:21] learn these principles notice here I'm
[08:22] using a pretend treat as a lore
[08:24] indicating a release from the down
[08:26] position yes I got lucky there he's like
[08:30] wait I didn't see a treat but every time
[08:32] he said that before there was a treat
[08:34] once he responds to that I then reward
[08:36] with a genuine treat this method really
[08:38] helps us transition away from relying on
[08:40] visual LS and makes the reward more
[08:43] direct and impactful to a dog
[08:46] yes okay that was a inter look at that
[08:50] today I've demonstrated three different
[08:52] methods all without using any Force
[08:54] showing that it is a mischaracterization
[08:56] to think that positive reinforcement
[08:57] trainers only have one approach to
[08:59] training these methods not only achieve
[09:01] the desired Behavior but also ensure the
[09:03] emotional well-being of the dog so this
[09:05] range of techniques reflects the
[09:07] richness of modern dog training and the
[09:09] dedication to nurturing a positive and
[09:11] trusting relationship between us and our
[09:13] dogs I'm a huge advocate of blending
[09:16] play with structured sessions it isn't
[09:18] that it's just fun which it is it
[09:21] surrounds the training with a rush of
[09:22] those Feelgood brain chemicals setting
[09:24] the stage for joyful learning which is
[09:27] the best kind of learning and nurse and
[09:29] shade are playing right now for a little
[09:30] bit and this is good dog to dog play can
[09:33] be really beneficial especially for

Rewire your dog’s mind with “YES” to fast-forward your training!

Here’s how I train “yes” 

What is your most-used word when you’re working with your dog?

TRANSCRIPTION:

[00:00] it's essential to reframe our Focus from
[00:02] what we don't want the dog to do to what
[00:04] we'd like them to do instead one of the
[00:06] first things I like to teach a dog is
[00:08] the word yes yes is amazing we're just
[00:11] going to do some oldfashioned pavlovian
[00:13] conditioning here also known as
[00:14] classical conditioning was showcased by
[00:16] the Russian scientist Ivan Pavlov using
[00:18] dogs so he basically found that
[00:20] consistently ringing a bell before
[00:22] feeding dogs essentially caused them to
[00:24] drool or salivate when they heard the
[00:26] Bell even when no food was given after
[00:28] doing this a repeated number of times
[00:30] all we have to do is say yes ring the
[00:33] bell and give them a treat I guess a
[00:35] human version of this might be like when
[00:37] our favorite song plays and we instantly
[00:39] feel great I'm just using part of his
[00:41] meal so I'm going to say
[00:43] yes then go ahead and give him that tree

Rewire your dog’s mind with “YES” to fast-forward your training!

Here’s part 3 of how I train “yes” 

What is your most-used word when you’re working with your dog?

TRANSCRIPTION:

[00:00] if you find yourself without treats
[00:01] which you shouldn't for the first two
[00:03] years of having a dog have them in your
[00:04] pocket if possible but reality happens
[00:07] if you do try to say something like
[00:10] good
[00:12] yes what did I just do there good means
[00:15] warmer warmer hot every time I say hot
[00:20] right I'm going to give a treat do you
[00:21] get the metaphor the connection here
[00:23] over time your dog will learn enough
[00:25] goods equals a yes dog trainers call
[00:28] that a continuation mark during this
[00:30] initial phase all we're doing is saying
[00:33] yes following it up with a treat it
[00:35] really is that simple this communicates
[00:36] to them when I hear the word yes I can
[00:39] look out for some yes something I like
[00:41] while the word yes can ignite enthusiasm
[00:44] and positive brain activity relying so
[00:46] much on no well that can elicit negative
[00:48] emotions our philosophy cultivate the
[00:51] best emotional state in a dog as it
[00:53] leads to the most profound training
[00:55] outcomes

Some triggers can lead to automatic reactions from your dog - and you can use that to your advantage! 

Rewire your dog’s mind with “YES” to fast-forward your training!

Here’s Part 2 of how I train “yes” 

What is your most-used word when you’re working with your dog?

TRANSCRIPTION:

[00:00] by teaching him the word yes and making
[00:02] sure that that word has a powerful
[00:04] connection with something that he loves
[00:06] food play access to a really cool place
[00:09] there are certain triggers that can lead
[00:10] to automatic reactions and that really
[00:12] is the magic we're tapping into with the
[00:14] word yes for shade when a dog learns
[00:16] that yes signals an incoming reward it
[00:20] fundamentally changes their approach to
[00:22] behavior this simple yet powerful
[00:24] communication Sparks their Ingenuity it
[00:26] motivates them to actively engage in
[00:29] action that we find desirable let's get
[00:32] some vocabulary out of the way the term
[00:34] Mark for our purposes will mean when we
[00:37] acknowledge the moment yes that our dog
[00:40] does something we like save the word yes
[00:43] for when your dog is guaranteed to get
[00:45] whatever it is that they find
[00:47] reinforcing in this case a treat yes

Description:
I do not train dogs that don’t want to be trained - and neither does any good dog trainer 😜 

By paying attention to your dog’s subtle communication about how engaged they are with a training session, you can make your training so much easier and more effective. 

When you look at training as a two-way conversation, I think you’ll be much happier with your results!

How long do your training sessions last? After I teach the basics, my training sessions are usually around 30 seconds at a time! How about you?

TRANSCRIPTION:

[00:00] I don't train dogs that don't want to be
[00:01] trained and I am a professional dog
[00:03] trainer let's talk about his body
[00:05] language right now what do you think
[00:06] he's saying we really want to take
[00:08] advantage of times when they are
[00:09] conscious to give them good experiences
[00:11] whether that be play or some light
[00:12] training when shade is really engaged
[00:14] that's when we lean into training when
[00:16] he needs a break we respect that shade
[00:18] has chosen to still stay near me which
[00:21] really signals to me a level of trust
[00:23] and comfort but also probably the need
[00:25] for a break too by paying attention to
[00:27] things like that that's how you can
[00:29] measure active participation because
[00:31] that's our goal we're not just looking
[00:32] for an animal to comply no matter what
[00:34] with us we want them to be an active
[00:36] participant so that they know how to
[00:37] make decisions when we're not there
[00:39] telling them what to do when you look at
[00:40] training as a two-way conversation I
[00:42] think you'll be much happier with your
[00:43] results how long do your training
[00:44] sessions last after my own dogs have
[00:46] learned the basics my training sessions
[00:48] are usually 30 seconds at a time how
[00:50] about you tell me in the comments below

Why would you ever want to encourage your dog to bark and jump? 

Barking and jumping are some of the most common issues dog guardians face when they're working on training. But there are actually lots of ways to use these behaviors positively to make your training even easier and more effective! 

What would you do with your dog in a place like this?

What are some ways you like to practice your dog's training in the real world?

TRANSCRIPTION:

[00:00] watch inera combine jumping on Boulders
[00:02] with barking when I ask her to speak
[00:05] what is the point of mixing these two
[00:07] skills right now it's about more than
[00:09] just a trick training isn't just about
[00:11] what pleases us it really is about
[00:12] teaching our dogs to think adapt and
[00:15] respond in diverse settings and
[00:17] scenarios
[00:19] speak yes okay all of us here would be
[00:22] very curious to know what is the most
[00:24] unique thing that your dog can do you
[00:27] can tell me below or even post a picture

Description:
When I challenge abusive dog training techniques, it’s easy for some to dismiss it as mere extremism. Yet, this isn’t a matter of two extremes clashing. 

Consider this: My approach is in lockstep with the guidelines set by top global behavioral organizations. On the flip side, the methods I oppose? They’re not just overlooked by these experts; they’re actively condemned. 

Aversive punishment-based dog training methods NEVER address the actual underlying causes of behaviors, they are known to be harmful, and there are alternatives that are more effective (for *any* dog), without the risks of harm. 

So, ask yourself, where does extremism truly lie? 

This is not a debate or a matter of opinion. It’s scientifically-backed, ethical training VS outdated, injurious practices. 

Beaux is a dog from one of my classes who would have certainly lashed out in fear if he were put in a situation like the dogs who attend “Dog Daddy” workshops find themselves in.

I invite you to see the stark difference for yourself. Who is truly at the extremes?

For those who label me an extremist in dog training circles, I’d like to pose a simple question: Which aspect of these evidence-based practices do you find extreme? 

Let’s delve into the specifics and demystify where our perspectives diverge.

[00:00] Bo is an American Bulldog he recently
[00:01] attended one of my classes and the first
[00:04] few times when I would go up to him he
[00:06] would bark as if to say stay away or he
[00:08] would growl at
[00:10] me okay part of my job in the beginning
[00:13] when meeting a new dog is to determine
[00:15] okay a why are they growling why are
[00:17] they barking at me is it because uh
[00:19] they're aggressive is it because they're
[00:21] unsure or what you know part of part of
[00:23] dog training is trust and you have to
[00:25] build trust with dogs as well a lot of
[00:26] trainers would tell you that this is a
[00:28] dog trying to be dominant trying to
[00:29] claim their space b is simply saying
[00:31] look I'm really not comfortable right
[00:33] now I don't know who you are I don't
[00:34] know what all this is give me some space
[00:36] I'm going to watch from a distance over
[00:37] here let them adapt and let them
[00:39] acclimate to the environment we're going
[00:41] to go to Bo right now last week when I
[00:42] met Bo was the first time I met him he
[00:44] was a little nervous so I'm trying to
[00:45] see if he does a little bit better this
[00:46] week now that he's been here a session
[00:49] at this point my opinion is that b is
[00:51] not likely to be aggressive at all I've
[00:53] been observing him uh I have a pretty
[00:55] good sense of how he's going to react
[00:57] but the reason I'm going up to him
[00:59] cautious ly is to simply try and put him
[01:01] at ease I don't want to do anything that
[01:03] would increase his stress level I'm
[01:05] trying to give him treats here but you
[01:07] can see that he's not very interested in
[01:09] the treats and by the way in my classes
[01:11] we use real turkey meat usually when a
[01:15] dog will not take a treat especially
[01:17] real meat where they otherwise would say
[01:19] in a home environment that often means
[01:21] they're experiencing at least some
[01:23] moderate stress it's very important not
[01:25] to ask a dog to learn new Concepts while
[01:28] in that mindset the primary objective is
[01:31] to Simply get them comfortable with
[01:33] their surroundings and their environment
[01:34] so after a few minutes when I felt like
[01:36] he had gotten settled I came back up to
[01:38] see how he was doing my goal was to
[01:40] Simply get a hand sniff he would still
[01:43] slip back into that mindset of being
[01:44] uncertain and unsure of his environment
[01:47] good that's dog training you celebrate
[01:50] small bits of progress you're not just
[01:51] going to go from A to Z just like that
[01:54] growling often means just a bit of
[01:56] uncertainty and that's kind of what
[01:57] we're dealing with with him and he
[01:59] looked at me looked at you really good
[02:01] confidence there can I try and get a bit
[02:03] closer to him and see I love this here
[02:04] I'm able to get nice and close so that's
[02:06] good look at that he's doing off leash
[02:09] walking few weeks ago him being off
[02:10] leash in this setting was out of the
[02:12] question if you know what motivates them
[02:14] then you can somehow try and use that to
[02:16] incentivize them will you respond to a
[02:18] ball right now I was quite pleased to
[02:21] find out that b had an interest in toys
[02:25] if you can manage to get them playing
[02:26] with you that that really accelerates a
[02:29] bond between a person and a dog ready
[02:32] here we go I'm trying to build trust now
[02:34] with B sure enough he started to
[02:36] brighten up a bit uh even let me scratch
[02:38] under his chin the difference now though
[02:40] is that he's actually playing with the
[02:42] ball with me he's interacting with me
[02:43] there's still some minor growling going
[02:45] on but it's he's not so stressed to the
[02:48] point where he's saying I won't even
[02:49] interact with you and play this game
[02:51] with you I'm trying to play fetch at
[02:53] fairly short range with him I'm trying
[02:54] to get him comfortable interacting with
[02:56] me at a closer range only on his terms
[02:59] would he comfortable with though because
[03:01] that's the only way it can be when
[03:03] you're trying to truly bring about
[03:05] comfort from the inside out with a dog
[03:07] he is very attached to Mom he knows this
[03:09] is the woman that I look to for
[03:11] everything he was basically saying I'm
[03:13] not sure about this whole environment
[03:14] I'm not sure about this guy but I am
[03:16] sure about you this is my final training
[03:19] session with Bo you see his tail wagon
[03:22] he's a lot more enthused a lot more
[03:23] comfortable here and that's what it's
[03:25] about the best way you're going to get
[03:26] your dog comfortable in various
[03:28] environments is working with them in
[03:30] various environments often one of the
[03:32] most challenging things that we cover in
[03:34] my class is how to teach a dog to stay
[03:37] while distracted I wanted to see how he
[03:39] did on the most challenging thing in the
[03:43] class that's what I'm talking about yep
[03:45] boom perfect I'll take that all day
[03:47] that's good I thought play dead would be
[03:49] a good trick for Bo because we were
[03:51] going to encourage him to get on his
[03:53] back voluntarily now this is something
[03:55] he would have never attempted just a few
[03:58] training sessions ago when your dog does
[03:59] something for the first time like that
[04:01] you got to let them know in a huge way
[04:03] how much you love that sometimes we need
[04:05] to be extra patient with our dogs and we
[04:07] have to reach deep in order to give them
[04:09] that reassurance that they need to be
[04:11] comfortable uh with their surroundings
[04:13] and with their life and if we do it
[04:14] right in the beginning then we prevent a
[04:17] lot of potential problems from
[04:18] developing later on I think Bo did an
[04:21] amazing job and it was a real honor
[04:23] having him in my class

[00:00] three ways to teach lie down go luring
[00:02] is where we take a treat and we use
[00:04] their nose to steer them yes into a
[00:08] physical position the treat is a magnet
[00:10] to your dog's nose yes sure luring
[00:13] offers a very straightforward way to
[00:14] start but capturing that's when our dog
[00:16] showcases specific behaviors on their
[00:18] own without any nudge from us yes
[00:21] capturing not only does this let us
[00:23] reinforced behaviors they initiate
[00:25] without our guidance but it truly
[00:27] empowers them to think independently and
[00:30] make choices that we appreciate watch
[00:33] the pause now here pay close attention
[00:35] to the Nuance shaping involves rewarding
[00:37] successive approximations of the desired
[00:40] Behavior yes and that is an example of
[00:43] how shaping works I didn't wait for the
[00:46] complete lie down to Mark yes the
[00:49] behavior instead I Mark the moment his
[00:51] foot took that forward step we reward
[00:54] incremental progress not just the final
[00:56] outcome does your dog know how to lie
[00:58] down

Seriously… it’s not hard! And it can change everything for you and your dog.

Over time, as your dog becomes more experienced and attuned to you, their reliance on treats will decrease. 

But if you’re still working on getting your dog’s training to the place you want it to be, the amount of effort it takes to pop a few treats into your pocket or otherwise make sure you always have them with you… it’s a small, but invaluable investment in building a lifetime of good behavior and understanding with your dog!

Do you use treats, or toys, or other motivators for your dog?

[00:05] very far how hard is it to put some
[00:07] treats in your pocket every morning for
[00:09] the first 2 years of your dog's life and
[00:11] when you go on a walk with them you can
[00:12] always get a treat pouch if that makes
[00:14] you feel better that way you always have
[00:15] treats having treats in your pocket
[00:17] might seem like a chore at first but
[00:19] think of it as equipping yourself with a
[00:21] tool for communication just as you would

[00:27] direct line to effectively communicating

[00:27] while essentially on the edge of a cliff

[00:35] happens when it's least expected come so

Description:
BREAKING NEWS - “Dog Daddy” associate Rich DuBarton has been arrested and charged with multiple counts of animal abuse in Mahwah, New Jersey in February 2024

Rich is the owner of @westbrookpetresort 
@aranwood_kennel 
@europa_k9 
@europak9imports 
@europa_k9_training 
who hosted a “Dog Daddy” training event in November 2023 - you might recall our posts calling for a boycott of his business at that time.

Despite extensive outreach and sharing of evidence against such methods, the "resort" and its owner, Rich DuBarton, remain unapologetic and plan to continue their association with Deoliveira, and as of now, “Dog Daddy” Augusto DeOliveira has claimed to be returning to this facility to work with more of the public’s dogs this April.

After acknowledging and dismissing the clear evidence of the dangers to their community that these methods pose, they have chosen to double down on their support for these methods.

🚩NEW JERSEY: Take a stand against Westbrook Pet Resort for promoting harmful dog training practices 🚩

YOUR VOICE MATTERS! Spread the word, contact local media, and please share this video. Let’s ensure your concerns are heard and the safety of your dogs is prioritized. Harmful training methods like these will not go unchallenged.

This situation underscores a larger issue within the unregulated dog training industry. 

Many members of the public, not being behavior experts, may unknowingly expose their dogs to harmful practices under the guise of training. We believe it’s our responsibility to raise awareness about such methods, especially when they compromise animal welfare and mislead the public.

Our goal is not to vilify, but to inform and protect. We urge viewers to share this video and join us in advocating for safe, humane, and ethical dog training practices. It’s time to hold those who exploit public trust accountable and promote a higher standard of care in the dog training community.

Your voice matters. Boycott Westbrook Pet Resort to send a powerful message that these outdated and harmful tactics have no place in your community.

Here’s how I work with dogs in a setting like this who are exhibiting fearful or aggressive tendencies. REMEMBER: If you’re looking for aggressive behavior as evidence that a dog is “aggressive” in a dog training video, you are looking for evidence of BAD dog training 🫣 Here is one appropriate way to approach this issue: https://youtu.be/FYfpIbO2dNA?si=2pdLQ_VL8mmltwqx

[00:00] today I'm calling for a boycott against
[00:01] Westbrook Pet Resort in Ringwood New
[00:03] Jersey it's critical that businesses who
[00:06] host dog training events or Market Dog
[00:08] Training Services to the public are held
[00:10] accountable particularly when they are
[00:12] endorsing or promoting harmful methods
[00:14] as in this past weekend when Westbrook
[00:17] Pet Resort hosted Augusto deera known as
[00:19] dog daddy at their facility we've seen
[00:21] footage coming out of their facility of
[00:23] completely unprofessional unnecessary
[00:26] rough handling of dogs it appears that
[00:28] someone by the name of rich dubart is in
[00:31] charge and owns Westbrook Pet Resort and
[00:35] unfortunately it's become clear to me
[00:37] that he has personally chosen to double
[00:39] down and support these abusive dog
[00:41] training methods despite widespread
[00:43] criticism from groups like The American
[00:45] College of Veterinary behaviorists the
[00:47] rspca the avma and all of their
[00:50] counterparts worldwide the decision to
[00:52] host austo DEA at his facility and to
[00:55] double down and support these methods is
[00:57] an extreme red flag for a facility that
[01:01] promotes Dog Training Services has Doggy
[01:04] Daycare board and trains and other
[01:06] services that are marketed to Everyday
[01:08] pets I urge the citizens in and around
[01:11] Ringwood New Jersey to take a stand
[01:14] against this problematic establishment
[01:16] by boycotting and raising awareness
[01:18] around these practices you send a clear
[01:21] message that abusive training practices
[01:23] have zero place in modern society let's
[01:25] spread the word to protect dogs in the
[01:27] New Jersey community in addition to this
[01:30] if you have any media contacts in the
[01:32] local New Jersey area tag them in this
[01:34] post reach out to me personally and I'll
[01:35] be happy to give them our side of the
[01:38] story and just a note to some of those
[01:40] who think we're being unreasonable to
[01:41] small businesses I want to remind you
[01:44] that a public facing business is not
[01:46] immune to public scrutiny especially
[01:48] when that business claims to be in a
[01:50] position of trust to members of that
[01:52] Community we are in an unregulated
[01:55] industry and it is up to members of our
[01:57] community to speak up when we see
[01:59] something as strong lastly I'll leave
[02:01] you with this any dog related facility
[02:03] that continues to enable the practices
[02:05] of austo DEA will be held to exactly
[02:08] this standard so austo understand when
[02:11] you go to these establishments you are
[02:13] putting them in a position to be
[02:15] publicly boycotted receive one-star
[02:17] reviews and you are the one who is
[02:19] negatively impacting these employees and
[02:21] these communities

Description:
Tired of Your Dog’s Endless Sniffing?

Before you curb their sniffing, understand this: Sniffing is more than a habit, it’s a window into your dog’s world. 

It’s how they interpret their environment, and being allowed to do it actually enriches their mental and emotional health. 

Of course there are times where we can’t give our dogs unlimited sniff time (would you like more detail on what to do in situations when you just can’t let them sniff? Let me know in the comments!) 

But, on your regular outings with your dog, try to shift your mindset from the ‘annoyance’ of sniffing now that you know about its vital role in your dog’s life. Letting your dog sniff is one of the simplest ways to majorly enrich their daily experience!

Don’t push your dog’s butt down! 🙈 (Do this instead!)

The old school way of teaching your dog to sit is by pushing their butt down, but that doesn’t teach them from the inside out! Let’s explore a method that respects your dog’s intelligence.

How did you train your dog to sit? Would you do it the same way today?

[00:00] honest thoughts I did just finish
[00:03] watching the dog Daddy video on his
[00:04] YouTube channel again I you can check it
[00:07] out see what he's saying it's important
[00:09] that we understand everyone's side of
[00:12] this situation I suppose it might just
[00:15] be one of my favorite videos in a long
[00:17] time I think it's going to serve as a
[00:19] really good public relations piece of
[00:22] content for me because he's basically
[00:24] telling the world this guy supports uh
[00:28] modern methods now of course he tries to
[00:31] reduce our training to just hot dogs we
[00:33] know better than that we understand
[00:36] conditioning we understand uh
[00:38] desensitizing and Environmental
[00:41] Management and things like that and we
[00:44] invite other people to learn about that
[00:46] as well but anyway that that's my honest

Description:
We need to talk about the latest developments with "Dog Daddy" - a person who has recently been at the center of much controversy in the dog training world. As he enters what appears to be a state of panic, I feel it’s important to continue to address his claims and methods head-on.

Side-By-Side Comparison: Zak George VS Dog Daddy 🤬😱🫣 https://youtu.be/FYfpIbO2dNA

Let's break down Dog Daddy’s recent actions, including his attempts to pressure his followers into boycotting our sponsors and his overall reaction to the growing worldwide criticism. This isn’t just about a single trainer’s methods; it’s a broader conversation about the ethical treatment of animals and the importance of humane training practices.

Dog Daddy’s meltdown is a response that's indicative of the pressures facing those who still use outdated and condemned training techniques that rely on suppression and learned helplessness. We’ll explore the significance of this moment not just for Dog Daddy but for the entire dog training community.

🔍 If you’re searching for insights into the Dog Daddy controversy or looking to understand more about ethical dog training practices, you’ve come to the right place.

[00:00] the pressure is getting to austo DEA our
[00:02] campaign is working under the heat of
[00:05] our criticism collectively as a
[00:07] community for his abusive methods
[00:09] towards dogs disguised as dog training
[00:13] he's now exploiting his followers trust
[00:15] and lack of behavior expertise by
[00:17] encouraging them to Target our sponsors
[00:19] a pathetic attempt to misdirect the
[00:21] focus away from the real issue of the
[00:23] harmful treatments of animals in his
[00:26] custody augusto's methods aren't just
[00:28] under Fire for being a little harsh he
[00:30] has been called out by name by top
[00:33] veterinary Behavior organizations
[00:35] worldwide let me give you an example the
[00:37] American College of Veterinary
[00:38] behaviorists called him out for hanging
[00:41] dogs from slip leads abusing prong
[00:43] collar intentionally inciting aggression
[00:46] out of dogs that is probably the most
[00:48] severe criticism I have of him this
[00:50] isn't just a mere different approach
[00:53] it's dangerous to the public and it's
[00:55] unethical and let me just make this
[00:56] clear this is not a case of Zack George
[00:59] versus austo it's about modern behavior
[01:02] science fundamentally conflicting with
[01:04] abusive training practices that have
[01:06] persisted long past their expiration
[01:08] date worldwide there are countless
[01:10] modern trainers who successfully tackle
[01:12] complex behavior issues even aggression
[01:15] all without resorting to these barbaric
[01:17] methods of intimidation and inflicting
[01:19] pain on dogs in the modern world Humane
[01:21] training issues actually address the
[01:24] issues that dogs face rather than just
[01:26] trying to mask them and shut a dog down
[01:29] what many of you who are supporters of
[01:30] algusto are confusing for results is
[01:33] something that we in the behavior
[01:34] Community call learned helplessness this
[01:36] relies on triggering fight ORF flight
[01:38] from the dog causing the dog to shut
[01:40] down but truly at the end of the day the
[01:42] dog doesn't understand why they're being
[01:44] yanked and cranked around on a prong
[01:45] collar Humane training methods actually
[01:47] address the issues that dogs face claims
[01:50] that modern trainers just throw treats
[01:52] at so-called aggressive dogs or that
[01:54] physical punishment like we see austo
[01:56] using is necessary for many dogs are
[01:58] simply not accurate for some it is just
[02:01] wishful thinking to think you can just
[02:03] snap a dog around by its neck scare the
[02:05] crap out of him and pretend like you
[02:07] have actually address deep underlying
[02:09] emotional issues austo DEA is the
[02:11] biggest charlatan in the dog training
[02:13] field and these approaches simply mask
[02:15] issues and create deeper problems the
[02:18] truth is that modern evidence-based
[02:19] training approaches are very versatile
[02:22] and very effective for all types of dogs
[02:25] regardless of their breed that's because
[02:26] they focus on actually addressing and
[02:29] understanding the Behavior rather than
[02:31] just suppressing it for those of you who
[02:32] are skeptical that's okay you want to
[02:34] see evidence and you're entitled to that
[02:36] you could look on my YouTube channel I
[02:38] have hundreds of dogs with all kinds of
[02:40] Behavioral issues and challenges at all
[02:42] different ages and if you don't like my
[02:44] Approach for whatever reason there are
[02:46] hundreds of other trainers worldwide who
[02:48] have content available to explain this
[02:50] to you now since this is such a common
[02:52] question I recently produced a video
[02:53] that gives you a side by-side approach
[02:56] of how we address dogs who may have
[02:58] behavioral issues in a class setting so
[03:00] you yourself can compare modern methods
[03:03] to augusto's outdated approaches there
[03:05] are literally hundreds of other trainers
[03:06] and behaviorist surround the world who
[03:08] specialize in aggressive behavior and
[03:10] successfully address it in Humane ways
[03:12] that don't resort to just slapping a
[03:14] prong collar on a dog and depriving them
[03:16] of oxygen while swinging them around now
[03:18] let's talk about this attempted backlash
[03:19] against our sponsors which is laughable
[03:22] the sponsors I work with are champions
[03:24] of positive change and they offer
[03:26] products that genuinely improve dogs
[03:28] lives targeting them is a clear sign of
[03:31] an individual who is stuck in the past
[03:33] flailing and refusing to accept progress
[03:37] look nobody has a monopoly on dog
[03:39] training methods we're not trying to say
[03:41] that anyone is better than another
[03:43] person what we are saying is there is a
[03:45] clear body of evidence that shows us how
[03:47] to address these issues without being
[03:50] violent towards dogs and in a
[03:52] self-governing profession like dog
[03:53] training it's up to us those of us who
[03:56] have influence in the field to make the
[03:57] public aware of that now let's not sugar
[03:59] Cote this we know austo will exploit
[04:01] animals and be harmful to them and now
[04:03] he's doing the same with human beings by
[04:05] exploiting his audience most of whom and
[04:07] I don't mean this in an offensive way
[04:08] are not experts in dog behavior most of
[04:10] my audience are not experts in dog
[04:12] behavior either both of our audiences
[04:14] trust us they want to help their dogs
[04:16] and many people in the general public as
[04:18] well unfortunately as austo de AA are
[04:21] unaware of the known potential harms
[04:24] that are perpetuated by these outdated
[04:26] methods when we call for a boycott of
[04:29] dog related businesses who platform
[04:32] austo at their facilities I agree it is
[04:35] a serious move it's about holding those
[04:37] accountable who allow such practices to
[04:40] persist in an unregulated industry and
[04:43] since we are unregulated we dog trainers
[04:46] those of us in the trenches and who work
[04:48] with dogs have to speak up about this
[04:50] furthermore it has become routine for
[04:52] algusto when faced with public pressure
[04:55] both now and in the past to play the
[04:58] poor victim rather than ask actually
[05:00] addressing the issues brought up with
[05:02] his methods and of course as we see so
[05:06] often every day in this industry to
[05:08] double down on abusive practices and
[05:11] violence towards animals we're not here
[05:13] to play nice with those who promote
[05:15] dangerous practices towards animals this
[05:18] campaign is about safeguarding our dogs
[05:20] and protecting the public and advocating
[05:22] for training that's not only effective
[05:24] but Humane I think most here will agree
[05:26] that it is time for a seismic shift ing
[05:29] training that is moving away from fear
[05:31] and pain in our field towards respect
[05:35] empathy and understanding we will fight
[05:37] hard for a future where every dog is
[05:39] treated with the care and respect that
[05:41] they deserve while we continue to
[05:43] Spotlight austo and the problems with
[05:45] his approaches we will also continue to
[05:47] hold responsible those who enable these
[05:50] violent practices towards animals he's
[05:52] not acting alone he is a symptom of a
[05:54] flawed system that we are exposing any
[05:56] dog related facility that supports and
[05:59] condone Jones and platforms austo
[06:01] methods is absolutely complicit we will
[06:04] continue undeterred to use our voices
[06:07] and hold enablers of austo De AA
[06:10] accountable it's common for those who
[06:12] have a problem with what we're doing to
[06:13] resort to ad hom and a our personal
[06:15] attacks claiming that positive trainers
[06:17] like myself don't work with real dogs
[06:19] for argument sake let's give you that
[06:20] let's say Zack George doesn't work with
[06:22] real dogs isn't even a good dog trainer
[06:24] but do you know something being a good
[06:26] dog trainer is not a prerequisite for
[06:28] recognizing abusive methods the fact is
[06:31] The Stance we're promoting is echoing
[06:33] the scientific consensus in our field
[06:35] which clearly accepts that abusive
[06:37] practices like this never address
[06:39] underlying causes and are more likely to
[06:41] do more harm than good we're continuing
[06:43] our ongoing efforts to boycott Westbrook
[06:46] Pet Resort in Ringwood New Jersey that's
[06:49] where Al Gusto appeared this past
[06:50] weekend I will remind you this is a dog
[06:52] training facility and when we made sure
[06:55] they were aware of his abusive practices
[06:57] what did they do did they apologize did
[06:59] they say this was an oversight no they
[07:01] doubled down and they said hey austo
[07:03] come back in April it should be a red
[07:05] flag to everyone that he doesn't
[07:06] announce the location of these events
[07:09] until just hours before they happen next
[07:11] up for austo is Tampa Florida and if
[07:13] anyone has information on the location
[07:16] of this Workshop please make us aware of
[07:18] that to those you might still be on the
[07:19] fence about this let me leave you with
[07:20] some questions to ponder considering the
[07:22] strong condemnation by reputable animal
[07:25] welfare and behavior organizations
[07:27] globally about austo Olivera by name
[07:30] does this to you raise concerns about
[07:33] the safety and the ethics of his
[07:35] so-called training approaches if a
[07:37] Training Method increases a dog's Stress
[07:39] and Anxiety do you think that it
[07:40] actually addresses underlying behavioral
[07:42] issues or do you think it just
[07:44] suppresses them how important is it to
[07:46] you for dog training methods to evolve
[07:48] with the latest scientific understanding
[07:49] of animal behavior would you trust a
[07:51] trainer who's been repeatedly criticized
[07:53] by Leading Veterinary Behavior
[07:56] organizations around the world and who
[07:58] continues to use condemn practices in
[08:00] spite of that criticism I know this can
[08:02] be a Hot Topic and an emotional issue
[08:05] for many of us and I just want to say
[08:07] thank you to all of those who
[08:08] relentlessly support what's right in our
[08:11] field

If your dog isn’t walking flawlessly, it’s time for a change!

What do your walks with your dog look like?

Commit to noticing the GOOD things that happen on your walks. And remember to bring something that your dog is *really* into to reward them 🙌

Treats are great, but for those high energy dogs, incorporating play into your walks can change everything! Here’s a video of a recent walk I took with my dog Inertia where we used a Super Chewer tug toy for motivation.

[00:16] game of tug is a perfect response for so
[00:19] many dogs because it's not just about
[00:21] playing with your dog it's about bonding
[00:23] with them and playing promotes bonding
[00:25] between people and dogs better than
[00:27] anything else that I know that is if
[00:29] your dog likes play of course this tug
[00:31] toy that I'm using here is tough as
[00:32] nails and since I play a lot with my
[00:34] dogs I like to have new toys every
[00:36] single month and that makes these walks
[00:38] epic bonding sessions having a monthly

[00:00] why do you think most of us bring dogs
[00:01] into our lives if I had to answer that
[00:03] I'd say it's because we want to share in
[00:05] our joy and our daily Journeys with them
[00:07] and they just make our quality of life
[00:09] better but how do we turn our regular
[00:11] activities that we enjoy doing into
[00:13] great experiences for our dogs too while
[00:16] including our dogs as great I think we
[00:17] can go even Beyond this I found that
[00:19] even with my super boring hobby of
[00:21] looking at rocks these are sexy assult
[00:25] rocks right here that this can still be
[00:27] fun for our dogs too yes it's is ous
[00:31] that's right training them to behave
[00:32] appropriately in nature like this can
[00:34] really help them Thrive what do you and
[00:36] your dog love to do together more than
[00:38] anything else

Watch this full episode here to see even more shelter dogs being trained! https://youtu.be/UB5w4DdH3FI

This video was filmed at ​⁠a “no-kill” shelter in Louisiana. They take in dogs who are scheduled to be euthanized and give them a permanent home until they are able to be adopted. The dogs you see in this video have been at the shelter for years. Here’s how their training went.

TRANSCRIPTION:

[00:00] here at the shelter we're going to go
[00:01] pick out a dog and see what we can do
[00:03] this is always an adventure come on they
[00:05] just want interaction that's really all
[00:07] they want look at this one what's this
[00:08] dog's name my goal is to show you how
[00:12] easy it can be to teach a dog that's
[00:15] never had any training at all or minimal
[00:17] training the first thing to do is to let
[00:19] your dog acclimate to an environment I'm
[00:21] going to try and introduce myself I'm
[00:22] going to offer my hand let them check me
[00:25] out I like to lure them into various
[00:27] positions just to get them comfortable
[00:29] with working look at this yes very good
[00:32] and I'm saying yes to let him know that
[00:34] I like that behavior let's see if we can
[00:36] get him to look at us look at me very
[00:39] good now obviously whenever you're
[00:41] working with a dog that you don't know
[00:42] you don't want to just crowd their space
[00:44] you want to be very smart and cautious
[00:46] about that but he's showing no signs of
[00:49] being uncomfortable by eye contact uh in
[00:51] fact he seems to favor it just because
[00:53] dogs can't talk doesn't mean they can't
[00:56] communicate with us he's a very telling
[00:58] example of that isn't he

My dog snapped at the puppy 😱 Here’s what we did next… Sponsored by Bark! Get a free BarkBox: https://barkbox.com/dogtraining & Super Chewer box: https://superchewer.com/dogtraining

Delve into the essentials of raising a well-behaved and socially adept puppy, a must-watch for any guardian looking to enhance their puppy’s development.

We kick off with a fun fetch session, highlighting the importance of play in building focus and attention in puppies. Understanding the role of play is crucial in developing a well-rounded dog, and we explore how it contributes to a puppy’s overall training.

Next, witness a surprising moment when my older dog offers a quick ‘correction’ to our puppy. We’ll discuss whether this is a normal part of canine communication or something to be concerned about. This real-life scenario provides invaluable insights into dog-to-dog interactions and their impact on social skills.

We also give a brief update on our progress with house training, showcasing the significance of recognizing and responding to a dog’s cues.

Looking ahead, stay tuned for our upcoming episode where we’ll dive into leash training, turning it into a positive experience for your dog. Plus, we’ve got a lot more to cover in this series, including obedience, socialization, resolving chewing issues, and teaching all the basics.

[00:00] today we'll be tackling an unexpected
[00:01] moment a nip from our oldest dog inertia
[00:04] sends a message to shade what does it
[00:06] mean is this normal is it a concern
[00:08] we'll explore their interactions and see
[00:10] how it influences overall training I'll
[00:12] give you a house training update and I'm
[00:13] still working on building a bond with
[00:16] shade let's pick up with that I'm going
[00:18] to try to get some play time with shade
[00:20] especially for puppies I like that it
[00:21] puts them in the right mindset for
[00:23] learning it helps them be well-rounded
[00:25] socialization hey inertia can you take a
[00:27] break but it's also really important for
[00:29] us to schedule one-on-one play time with
[00:32] our dogs while they're in training as
[00:33] well good man I haven't really had any
[00:36] proper playing with him just yet and you
[00:38] can see Veronica got her out of her
[00:40] shell a little bit good look at this my
[00:44] goal right now is just to get a little
[00:45] tug good man really get him into it good
[00:49] I'm going to toss it right there and I'm
[00:51] going to let him win take it look at
[00:52] that I like that he's shaking it around
[00:54] going to let him possess the toy for a
[00:56] little bit chasing it biting it tugging
[00:59] and possessing it this Taps into a dog's
[01:01] natural predatory sequence including
[01:04] tracking and enhances their learning and
[01:06] satisfaction from the game and it
[01:08] sharpens their focus and it boosts their
[01:10] attention which is key for Effective
[01:12] training okay it looks like inera and
[01:14] Veronica are going to play on the couch
[01:15] find we're just having a playfest over
[01:17] here aren't we good and look at that
[01:20] tracking there's all sorts of great
[01:23] things going on right now this is the
[01:24] beginning of teaching him fetch I'm
[01:26] getting him interested I'm throwing it
[01:28] albeit a few inches I'm not going to
[01:30] take it from him just yet because it's
[01:32] very important that he feel like he
[01:34] accomplished something yes did you hear
[01:37] what I said I said yes where's the treat
[01:40] Zach you can also use toys as a currency
[01:43] if that's reinforcing to your dog he
[01:46] seems to really be enjoying the toys
[01:50] sit okay
[01:52] yes see that was a great example of
[01:55] looking for the positive he was jumping
[01:58] most people would be tempted to say no
[02:00] just give it a second let that pass give
[02:02] your dog the opportunity to do the right
[02:03] thing and they often will sit secondary
[02:07] teaching fetch he's getting a novel
[02:08] experience with a new toy new texture
[02:11] yes did you see the thinking eyes That's
[02:14] a classic let me think I know this one
[02:16] expression from a dog so if you see your
[02:18] dog making that expression where they're
[02:20] looking through the files in their brain
[02:22] be patient this play Drive is incredible
[02:26] new experiences keep a dog's mind
[02:28] engaged and eager and in dog training
[02:31] novelty isn't just fun it really does
[02:34] change things up dogs are hardwired to
[02:36] explore so introducing new toys and new
[02:38] treats Taps into their innate curiosity
[02:41] it boosts their learning potential it
[02:43] makes each training session as exciting
[02:45] as this first one I'm having with him
[02:47] right now imagine a monthly boost of
[02:49] novelty really keeping your dog's
[02:51] training both fun and also effective
[02:53] traditionally inertia has been a BarkBox
[02:56] dog lately she's really been into the
[02:58] Super chewer it's Thanksgiving themed so
[03:00] that's a brussel sprout every time we
[03:02] get one of these boxes it is a treasure
[03:04] Trove of newness it's the easiest way I
[03:07] know of to maintain Peak motivation go
[03:09] to barkbox.com doog trining or
[03:12] super.com doog trining and get a free
[03:14] box when you sign up for a subscription
[03:16] when you see dogs playing like this it's
[03:18] more than just goofy play there's a lot
[03:20] going on under the hood as much as
[03:22] playing Fetch with shade bonds us and
[03:24] boosts his Focus dog to dog play is
[03:27] equally vital this is some healthy play
[03:29] time
[03:30] all involved it's here that shade learns
[03:32] invaluable social skills a key aspect of
[03:35] his development now scientifically these
[03:38] interactions are more than just play
[03:40] they're crucial for learning dog
[03:42] communication and healthy socialization
[03:45] ideally you precede your training
[03:47] sessions with play you use play in your
[03:49] training sessions and there's play after
[03:51] your training sessions this type of
[03:53] physical expression is so important
[03:56] think about when your dog gets the
[03:57] Zoomies there's actually a term for that
[03:59] it's called called fraps or frenetic
[04:01] random activity periods you see elements
[04:04] of zoomy action going on here these
[04:06] fraps can be seen as part of a puppy's
[04:08] way of processing new learning
[04:10] experiences it's kind of like they're
[04:11] shaking off the mental dust that
[04:14] accumulates during intense concentration
[04:17] when you recognize and embrace these
[04:18] moments you're not only observing a
[04:20] joyful expression but a vital part of
[04:22] your dog's growth and their development
[04:24] while my attention was divided inertia
[04:26] decided to refine her communication with
[04:29] shade oh you got that tell me what you
[04:30] think I'm going to show you right now
[04:32] okay when nura loves to take a toy and
[04:33] just romp around with it just like this
[04:35] she brings you this toy it's a little
[04:37] crinkly and so you kind of just
[04:38] absent-mindedly grab it and toss it
[04:40] nurse is excited right because she just
[04:42] she brought you the toy and she's like
[04:43] awesome I'm going to play with this I
[04:45] love this thing here I am playing with
[04:47] it and look after he goes away she gives
[04:49] him a little check see she's like Hey
[04:50] Dad am I cool she does her favorite
[04:52] imaginary game harder than ever I feel
[04:55] like she really was just like I am
[04:56] playing my game right now in my view
[04:58] that was just a perfectly measured
[04:59] correction from an older dog to a puppy
[05:01] this is a normal part of K9 interaction
[05:04] that helps establish boundaries this was
[05:06] resolved instantly showcasing the dog's
[05:08] ability to communicate and deescalate
[05:11] efficiently some people would twist that
[05:13] behavior that we just saw and say that's
[05:15] an older dog using force on another dog
[05:18] in order to alter their behavior even in
[05:21] that case inertia didn't even make
[05:22] contact with shade at all if you don't
[05:25] know dogs you might think oh gosh that's
[05:27] scary if you witness that and and
[05:29] sometimes sometimes it can be if it
[05:30] escalates but it didn't and it usually
[05:32] doesn't Veronica's right there and I
[05:34] think we should give like a quick update
[05:36] on how Veronica's adapting she is
[05:38] probably thrown off the most of all of
[05:40] us Veronica is being tolerant but she's
[05:42] not eager to play with shade at all uh
[05:44] she did play with inertia a little bit
[05:46] but shade she's like I'm not there yet
[05:48] and I've been thinking about it like am
[05:50] I going to be disappointed if Veronica
[05:52] this whole time is like nope I don't
[05:53] want to play with shade and even if two
[05:55] dogs don't necessarily love each other
[05:57] that doesn't mean they can't live
[05:58] together that's a whole angle I'm
[05:59] prepared to embrace as well how do we
[06:02] then have the dogs live together if
[06:03] Veronica is more annoyed by shade so far
[06:06] we've given her a little Fortress
[06:08] blocked off by this table with pillows
[06:10] so that shade can't get his head up
[06:13] immediately next to that corner of the
[06:15] couch that's the purpose of the table
[06:16] being right there so she has an extra 2
[06:19] feet or so of distance and so far that's
[06:22] been good enough but I would be prepared
[06:24] to change that if needed we caught this
[06:27] moment on one of our security cameras
[06:28] shade made a high sound and he started
[06:30] to walk towards the gate I interpreted
[06:32] this as a clear signal that he needed to
[06:35] go out recognizing and responding to
[06:37] these signals is crucial that little
[06:39] tiny one coupled by just gesturing in
[06:41] the general direction I think that means
[06:43] he's got to go things are starting to
[06:45] come together we're getting somewhere
[06:46] small victories like this will pave the
[06:48] way to a well-trained dog now get ready
[06:50] for our next episode well we're going to
[06:51] delve into leash training I'm going to
[06:53] show you a unique approach to make your

[00:00] I'm at a shelter that takes in dogs who
[00:01] are scheduled for youth in Asia to give
[00:04] them a second chance do you have a more
[00:05] hyper dog maybe so often dogs like this
[00:07] are misunderstood because all people see
[00:10] is a high energy dog you can see Bill he
[00:12] instantly switched to sniffing around
[00:14] that's a great stress reliever for some
[00:16] dogs dogs like this are the most
[00:17] teachable in the world hyperactive bully
[00:19] breeds like this are labeled aggressive
[00:21] every day of the week by novices when
[00:23] most of them just need an appropriate
[00:25] Outlet let's try to figure out what Bill
[00:27] loves my goal right now with bill is to
[00:29] just see if I can get him playing yes he
[00:32] grabbed that right away notice how they
[00:34] lose interest though the moment a human
[00:36] being stops playing with it they just
[00:37] let go of it they're not interested
[00:39] anymore remember dogs like to engage
[00:41] people they like to work with us the way
[00:42] to introduce a toy is to make it fun and
[00:44] interesting tug of is the foundation of
[00:46] teaching a dog how to play fetch it can
[00:48] be used as a currency because this is
[00:50] fun for him you can hear that that's a
[00:52] play Growl you hear right there do you
[00:53] guys ever use toys or tug ofwar to
[00:56] reward your dog tell me in the comments

[00:05] Archie we want to find out what makes
[00:06] him tick we want to find out what his
[00:07] currency is what is this okay a great
[00:11] way to get your dog interested in a toy
[00:13] is to play keep away with it too let
[00:15] them think they can get it but then keep
[00:16] it from
[00:20] them yeah good job good dog right there
[00:24] he picked it up but I'm not going to
[00:25] insist that he picks it up and bring it
[00:26] to me right off the bat notice how
[00:28] enthusiastic Archie's body languages
[00:30] just because he lives in a shelter and
[00:32] risked euthanasia does not mean that we
[00:35] need to slap a prong collar on him and
[00:37] start swinging him around like so many
[00:39] people are doing right now I'm going to
[00:40] see if I can get him to come to me when
[00:42] I call him after all that's a very
[00:43] important skill that all dogs need to
[00:46] know that is the opposite of Kamar not
[00:49] only did we not need something like a
[00:50] prong collar or other aversive methods
[00:52] with the dogs from this shelter we
[00:54] didn't even need a leash to communicate
[00:56] with them how many of you can
[00:57] communicate with your dog without a

Trainers like Saharai are doing this every single day. 

There is absolutely no excuse to use aversive force with these dogs. 

Modern trainers understand how to address the underlying emotions that are causing a dog’s behavior, instead of just suppressing and shutting them down.

[00:40] she hadn't been out of her kennel in
[00:42] weeks we can only imagine the kind of
[00:44] toll physically and emotionally and
[00:45] psychologically that takes on a high
[00:47] energy High Drive dog so we increase the
[00:49] positive associations they have with

Description:
Is this the lazy way to train a dog? 

Training this way can also help you reduce your dog’s reliance on treats or external rewards!

“Capturing” can contribute to a really strong bond between a person and a dog, because it’s all about observation and mutual understanding ❤️

TRANSCRIPTION:

[00:00] this might just be the easiest way to
[00:02] train any dog because you don't really
[00:04] need to do anything at all capturing
[00:07] that's when our dog showcases specific
[00:09] behaviors on their own without any nudge
[00:11] from us yes capturing he did it
[00:14] naturally I acknowledged it and I said
[00:16] yes not only does this let us reinforce
[00:19] behaviors they initiate without our
[00:21] guidance but it truly empowers them to
[00:23] think independently and naturally make
[00:25] choices that we appreciate plus
[00:28] capturing can often feel more genuine
[00:30] into the dog creating a sense of
[00:31] accomplishment and building their
[00:33] confidence it really Taps into a dog's
[00:35] innate behaviors making the learning
[00:37] process more intuitive for them
[00:39] capturing also reduces Reliance on
[00:41] treats or external rewards and it can
[00:43] foster a really strong bond between a
[00:45] person and their dog as it involves
[00:46] observation and mutual understanding
[00:49] capturing is also really valuable for
[00:51] novel behaviors that might not easily be
[00:53] taught through traditional methods too
[00:55] does your dog know how to sit and lie
[00:56] down if so how long did it take to teach
[00:58] them

[00:00] we've been doing so many off leash walks
[00:02] now we're in a state park leashes are
[00:03] required there are different kinds of
[00:05] walks though off leash exploration walks
[00:07] your dog is going farther ahead in front
[00:10] of you behind you but here in this
[00:11] situation they need to stay within a few
[00:13] feet of you offleash walks can really
[00:15] offer our dogs a lot of freedom but
[00:16] unleash walks on the other hand can
[00:18] bring a balance of control and safety
[00:20] it's not about restriction as much as it
[00:21] is about guidance and protection in new
[00:23] environments unleash walks can be
[00:25] mentally enriching giving your dog more
[00:27] opportunities to use that powerful nose
[00:29] of their and this is a way to engage
[00:31] their minds even more than their legs
[00:33] it's important to regularly practice
[00:34] loose leash walking skills with your dog
[00:36] to make sure that they're prepared and
[00:38] know how to act when you do have to put
[00:39] them on leash it's a responsible choice
[00:41] both for their safety and their
[00:42] well-being you can use unleash walks to
[00:44] reinforce calm Behavior reward your dog
[00:46] for focused attention and following your
[00:49] requests how do you perceive leash laws
[00:51] in public spaces like state parks do you
[00:53] see them as necessary for safety and
[00:55] conservation or as a limitation on your
[00:57] dog's Freedom like and follow for more

[00:00] this is a great chance to test and prove
[00:02] her longdistance out of sight Recall
[00:05] come cow's looking right at us too I
[00:08] don't want to get too close today we
[00:10] will be taking an offleash walk with
[00:12] distractions and no treats oh got
[00:15] Zoomies there is always that after all
[00:18] reinforcement doesn't always have to
[00:20] come in the form of food or plague I'll
[00:23] explain that's a bone the world
[00:25] constantly changes that means with each
[00:27] outing there's brand new scenarios and
[00:30] the setting today is brimming with
[00:32] massive distractions what's the
[00:34] highlight of our challenge loose cows
[00:36] grazing freely with no fenes in sight
[00:39] that means that technically inertia has
[00:42] unrestricted access to livestock did I
[00:45] mention that she was a border colag look
[00:46] for body language in your dog you see
[00:48] how her ears are pinned back listening
[00:49] for request I like the look back there
[00:51] this is a great chance to put our trust
[00:53] and our training to the test the
[00:55] Cornerstone of successful offleash
[00:58] training lies in having a solid
[00:59] Foundation skills like stay and come
[01:03] stay come and heal aren't just tricks
[01:07] they really are essential amidst the
[01:09] Allure of Open Spaces just like this
[01:12] proofing or testing skills like this is
[01:14] something we do throughout our dogs life
[01:16] so here she's starting to get a little
[01:17] far here inertia wait not going to make
[01:20] her come this time cuz I don't want to
[01:22] burn her out on that go on as we step
[01:25] into new settings each with its unique
[01:28] distractions
[01:30] we're offering our dogs a much broader
[01:33] understanding of our expectations every
[01:36] new scent and sight she encounters is
[01:38] reinforcing to her basically if your dog
[01:41] listens to you they get to do these
[01:42] other things they want to do but if a
[01:44] dog weren't as reliable in this
[01:46] situation or was evolving towards
[01:49] reliability but for one reason or
[01:51] another was uncooperative with your
[01:53] request it would simply be back on leash
[01:55] no need to punish all you have to do is
[01:57] manage them and then do a better job of
[01:59] teaching and reinforcing and bonding
[02:01] with your dog so that they're likely to
[02:03] do what you want in the future every dog
[02:05] comes with their genetic predispositions
[02:07] Border Collies for instance are more
[02:09] likely to have a strong interest in
[02:12] livestock well that's convenient isn't
[02:14] it I think it's essential to acknowledge
[02:16] and cater to our dog's Natural Instincts
[02:19] yet it really is truly astonishing to
[02:21] witness how malleable their behavior can
[02:24] be take many border col's strong desire
[02:26] to chase livestock for instance giving
[02:28] her good outlets for those desires you
[02:32] can see how that can be effective if you
[02:34] don't want your dog chasing after cows
[02:36] now I choose to redirect this inherent
[02:39] Behavior into activities that Echo
[02:41] similar Dynamics like chasing running
[02:44] focusing on a goal and engaging in
[02:45] mutual communication with a human being
[02:48] think about it engaging in a lively
[02:50] round of frisbee can mirror the essence
[02:52] of hurting satisfying that innate
[02:54] Instinct without having to engage in it
[02:57] in its original form so essentially by
[02:59] playing frisbee we've really curated a
[03:00] healthy outlet for inertia minimizing
[03:02] her desire to chase these cows see her
[03:04] smelling no doubt the cows inertia
[03:07] exercising restraint wasn't merely
[03:09] suppression of her instincts but a
[03:11] result of understanding and alternative
[03:13] fulfillment through activities that she
[03:15] actually enjoys I always stay really
[03:17] alert of my surroundings when I'm in
[03:19] public inertia come for instance there's
[03:21] a corner coming up ahead I don't know
[03:23] what's around that corner so I decide to
[03:25] ask my dog to come to my side and stay
[03:27] by me that way we can navigate the turns
[03:29] successfully and safely together inertia
[03:31] is caught up with Mom and Veronica who
[03:34] are far ahead of us now in fact they
[03:36] advance to a point where inertia goes
[03:37] completely out of sight this is a great
[03:39] chance to test and prove her
[03:41] longdistance out of sight Recall
[03:44] come let's see if we get an out of sight
[03:47] recall look at that that's lovely you
[03:49] can do walks like this with a 30ft lead
[03:51] just as well or even a retractable leash
[03:53] in a lot of cases you can see the
[03:55] enthusiasm with which inertia is working
[03:58] right now and that's what I really like
[03:59] to see I really want to pay attention to
[04:01] those happy emotions she's demonstrating
[04:04] right now cuz that's where we want to
[04:05] lean into our training efforts when
[04:07] they're in that amazing good mood do you
[04:09] guys prefer to do walks like this on a
[04:11] long lead or off leash alog together or
[04:13] does it depend on the environment let's
[04:16] keep sharing and advancing ideas that
[04:18] prioritize our dog's emotional
[04:19] well-being continuing to bridge that gap
[04:21] between professional trainers and
[04:23] everyday dog Guardians your voice

[00:00] does your dog tend to listen to you on
[00:01] the first or second requests the vast
[00:03] majority of the time or does it usually
[00:05] take more requests than that in modern
[00:06] dog training it's all about the
[00:08] subtleties and the nuances kind of
[00:10] timing is crucial but so is
[00:12] understanding your individual dog you've
[00:14] probably noticed that puzzled look
[00:15] during training if you've ever attempted
[00:17] to teach your dog something new where
[00:19] your dog seems kind of lost or glancing
[00:21] around this often signals that they're
[00:23] mentally sifting through their internal
[00:25] files trying to remember what to do
[00:27] based on past reinforced Behavior so
[00:30] when you see this it's a perfect moment
[00:32] to let your dog think it through That's
[00:34] a classic let me think I know this one
[00:36] expression from a dog so if you see your
[00:38] dog yes making that expression where
[00:40] they're looking through the files in
[00:42] their brain be patient give them the
[00:44] freedom to move slowly during these
[00:46] phases of training did you see the
[00:47] thinking eyes do you relate with this
[00:49] have you noticed this in your own dog

[00:00] do you know how many people use the same
[00:01] leash length for every task that's fine
[00:04] but choosing the right leash length can
[00:06] really transform your walks and your
[00:08] training in general for example when I'm
[00:10] taking a walk I like to use a 10-ft
[00:12] leash for General walking in open areas
[00:15] like this allowing for more room for
[00:17] exploring and maintaining control but in
[00:19] my toolkit I also rotate between a 6t a
[00:22] 10t and a 30 foot leash as well as a
[00:25] retractable leash or no leash in some
[00:27] cases depending on the situation the 6
[00:29] leash is great for crowded or high
[00:31] traffic areas offering more immediate
[00:33] control the 30ft leash is ideal for
[00:35] training in safe enclosed spaces giving
[00:38] dogs Freedom while still under
[00:39] supervision and the retractable leash
[00:41] can be great for potty breaks or super
[00:43] casual walks where more flexibility is
[00:45] acceptable what length leash do you use
[00:47] for daily walks and how do you decide
[00:49] which leash to use in different
[00:51] scenarios like and follow for more

[00:00] often there's a belief that telling our
[00:01] dogs no and using aversives is necessary
[00:05] however in contemporary dog training we
[00:07] steer clear of focusing too much on no
[00:10] or don't do this or don't do that
[00:12] because it tends to be counterproductive
[00:13] let me show you a striking example to
[00:15] illustrate why
[00:18] sit okay
[00:20] yes see that was a great example of
[00:24] looking for the positive he was jumping
[00:26] most people would be tempted to say no
[00:28] just give it a second let that pass our
[00:30] goal is to facilitate learning and
[00:32] progress the fastest way to accomplish
[00:35] that is to keep our dog in an optimistic
[00:37] mindset give your dog the opportunity to
[00:39] do the right thing and they often will
[00:41] remember our dogs are just doing what
[00:43] comes natural to them and it's on us to
[00:45] help them create habits that are a

[00:00] I want to talk about something that
[00:01] happened between shade and inertia that
[00:03] can be kind of scary for a lot of people
[00:06] today I'm going to show you how
[00:07] so-called force can be used non
[00:09] aversively we'll see how shade and the
[00:11] dogs are doing socially and see how
[00:13] things are going otherwise and if you're
[00:15] looking for a science-backed modern way
[00:17] to train your dog you have come to the
[00:19] right place smash that subscribe button
[00:21] give us a thumbs up for more downto
[00:23] Earth ethical dog training experience
[00:25] there's a lot of things I think we need
[00:26] to clear up about lease training did you
[00:28] know that we can use leash pressure with
[00:30] our dogs without being aversive at all
[00:32] leash pressure or physical tension on
[00:35] the leash when we're training our dogs
[00:37] does not have to be used aversively
[00:39] shade is likely to be well over 100 lb
[00:42] when he's fully grown so I want to make
[00:43] sure that he's comfortable with physical
[00:45] assistance if need be it's inevitable
[00:48] that there's going to be tension on our
[00:50] dog's harness and Leash and if Shay
[00:51] doesn't know how to respond to that he
[00:52] could pull someone over or Worse shade
[00:55] also lives with an 18-month-old toddler
[00:57] his parents are super proactive so I
[00:59] know they're going to prevent
[01:00] unsupervised interactions I still want
[01:01] to make sure he's tolerant with being
[01:03] grabbed and pulled on he's wearing a
[01:05] harness I'm going to start by doing that
[01:07] and saying yes why am I saying yes if
[01:09] you've been following you know he's
[01:11] building a strong connection with the
[01:13] word yes and we're looking for any signs
[01:15] that he might be stressed by that other
[01:17] things you would look for are licking of
[01:18] the lips or yawning while behaviors like
[01:20] licking lips and yawning are common in
[01:23] dogs they can sometimes indicate
[01:24] discomfort or stress it's important to
[01:26] view these actions as cues to better
[01:29] understand our dog feelings and emotions
[01:31] noticing these signals isn't about
[01:33] blaming ourselves it's about becoming
[01:34] more attuned to our dog's needs and
[01:36] their feelings and I want to point out
[01:38] that shade is free to walk away at any
[01:40] time that's the ideal scenario if you
[01:43] can set up an environment like that all
[01:44] right so I haven't even put the leash on
[01:46] but let's do that yes I'm really laying
[01:49] it on thick right now to make my
[01:51] point yes so when I'm training a dog
[01:54] like this I like to integrate a dog's
[01:55] regular diet along with topnotch treats
[01:58] puff has always stood out because their
[02:00] treats are extremely high quality very
[02:03] tasty that's important when you're
[02:04] training dogs and of course they're
[02:06] healthy their treats have very limited
[02:08] ingredients very often only one
[02:10] ingredient we have a massive Spectrum to
[02:12] choose from with them they have things
[02:13] like bananas from Whole shrimp
[02:16] blueberries chicken and other diverse
[02:18] currencies that we can keep training
[02:20] effective without having an overreliance
[02:22] on any one treat type you'll find that
[02:24] when you're using different currencies
[02:26] that your dog likes that your training
[02:28] will likely be more effective all right
[02:30] good man all right so we have the leash
[02:32] on you can imagine a variety of
[02:34] situations if he gets distracted by some
[02:35] type of animal while on a walk whether
[02:37] it be a dog or Wildlife you want to be
[02:39] able to physically steer him without him
[02:41] being like whoa what are you doing what
[02:43] this is crazy I'm excited by that you're
[02:45] pulling me I've never felt that before
[02:47] so that's why we do this exercise right
[02:48] there there's tension I said yes he's
[02:50] like wait yes means I get something yes
[02:54] see that very subtle tension I don't
[02:56] want to rely on it I'm just trying to
[02:58] condition him to it I avoid using
[03:00] tension on the leash cuz I don't want to
[03:02] but I want to know that I can if I have
[03:03] to let's see what happens when I use a
[03:05] toy as
[03:07] reinforcement yes boy he comes right
[03:09] along he's like whoa there's a toy this
[03:12] is our first outdoor fetch leash
[03:14] pressure when used in this way is a
[03:16] means of positive Pleasant communication
[03:18] between you and your dog we're not using
[03:20] it to correct undesirable Behavior by
[03:22] associating leash pressure like this
[03:24] with positive associations You're
[03:26] Building trust with your dog this
[03:28] teaches them that this leash isn't a
[03:30] tool of restriction it's a signal of
[03:33] guidance by positively reinforcing leash
[03:35] pressure like this you helping to
[03:37] prevent your dog associating aversion
[03:39] with the leash and that can help lead to
[03:41] a more cooperative and enjoyable
[03:43] experience for both of you if you
[03:45] instead use leash and pressure to punish
[03:48] or to negatively reinforce dogs can
[03:50] become more fearful thereby becoming
[03:52] more aggressive in many instances
[03:54] especially with young puppies it's so
[03:56] normal for them to freeze up when
[03:57] they're in a harness especially if
[03:58] they're not used to a harness and so
[04:00] doing what we're doing here is a great
[04:01] way to build that Association that's
[04:03] Pleasant right from the start this also
[04:06] puts you in a better position to manage
[04:07] over threshold moments in the future
[04:10] since your dog is now acquainted with
[04:12] this drill but the better we communicate
[04:14] with our dogs the less we'll have to
[04:15] rely on techniques like this these are
[04:17] backup management strategies a lot of
[04:19] people think that positive dog trainers
[04:21] are against using any type of physical
[04:23] communication that's not necessarily the
[04:26] case it's what the communication means
[04:27] to our dog I also like to finish
[04:29] training sessions very often with some
[04:31] play that was really nice he possessed
[04:33] it for a while I didn't beg him to come
[04:35] back we haven't even really covered
[04:36] comein called yet I've been kind of
[04:38] informally saying here and giving him a
[04:40] treat he's a clumsy guy so he's still
[04:42] learning how to use his body I want to
[04:44] not throw too many physical challenges
[04:45] on him but teaching him the mechanics of
[04:47] a game like fetch can't go wrong with
[04:49] that this hyper drivey behavior that
[04:52] you're seeing right now is why people
[04:54] think dogs like this need a firm hand
[04:56] sometimes I'm showing you that without
[04:58] touching them you can teach them to let
[05:00] go we're going to make the toy boring
[05:02] it's a fine line between quelling their
[05:05] drive cuz you really want them kind of
[05:07] amped up when you're using a toy in a
[05:09] lot of instances so it's a fine line
[05:10] between quelling their drive and kind of
[05:12] waiting them out till they naturally let
[05:14] go if your dog's Drive were more fragile
[05:17] then you might not do this approach but
[05:18] he's I'm not worried about his drive
[05:20] going away go on get it letting him win
[05:22] just in case he gets a little too far
[05:24] away I have the leash on there just for
[05:26] extra accessibility but I don't really
[05:27] intend to use it do you see how I keep
[05:29] the to nice and low when I'm introducing
[05:31] a toy you will learn 10 times more about
[05:33] your dog when you play with them than
[05:35] doing anything else world's longest
[05:37] fetched he hasn't done one this long yet
[05:39] let's see if he comes back and as we
[05:40] continue to play fetch like this I mean
[05:41] we're not just having fun I'd like to
[05:43] think we're building a bond and learning
[05:45] to communicate this is a shared activity
[05:48] that is mutually reinforcing it really
[05:50] enhances our connection together you can
[05:52] see how that's important for training
[05:54] and these experiences release those
[05:56] Feelgood neurochemicals in both of us
[05:58] and that creates
[06:01] Synergy that enriches our relationship
[06:04] Beyond meure loud now I you know but I'm
[06:06] enthusiastic it's genuine yes I want to
[06:09] talk about something that happened
[06:10] between shade and inertia that can be
[06:13] kind of scary for a lot of
[06:17] people this particular interaction
[06:19] between shade and inertia is a fantastic
[06:23] example of dog-to-dog communication and
[06:26] one of the many dynamics that you might
[06:27] have to deal with in a multi-dog house
[06:29] as shade walked over towards inertia and
[06:32] attempted to walk over her he put
[06:34] considerable weight on her and that
[06:36] caused inertia to say yo what do you
[06:38] think you're doing you can't do this get
[06:40] off of me she really made her Point
[06:42] quite clear and it can sound kind of
[06:43] scary honestly this was actually a very
[06:46] measured correction from an older dog to
[06:48] a younger one it's very healthy for both
[06:50] parties and shade did a really good job
[06:51] of taking the hint as well so he had a
[06:53] healthy reaction we also saw an
[06:55] immediate deescalation right after it
[06:58] happened which is all so what we look
[07:00] for it sounded crazy but no biting
[07:02] occurred and it was just verbal
[07:03] communication and this interaction
[07:05] really shows us a distance increasing
[07:07] Behavior between shade and inertia
[07:10] essentially inertia is saying I want you
[07:12] farther away from me than you currently
[07:14] are right now it's an education in
[07:16] boundaries between dogs older Wells
[07:19] socialized dogs like inertia can play a
[07:22] really important role in teaching Dogs
[07:24] how to interact in the real world and
[07:26] this experience also really kind of
[07:28] unders scores why it's important to
[07:30] observe our individual dogs and how they
[07:32] behave in these specific contexts I'm
[07:35] hoping that we can make some
[07:36] improvements on the relationship between
[07:38] Veronica and shade and see if she can
[07:40] get a little more accepting of him but
[07:42] there's no way to rush this process I
[07:44] just want to set up their environment
[07:47] around them in order to encourage this
[07:50] to move along play is the universal
[07:53] language among dogs and it's such a
[07:55] powerful tool to help them bond with
[07:56] each other and with us My Hope here is
[07:58] that we're going to see a gradual
[08:00] approach to play that allows them to
[08:02] find some common ground with one another
[08:04] today I'm going to let the dogs lead I'm
[08:06] going to let them try to communicate
[08:07] naturally with one another and they'll
[08:09] communicate how they feel but we do need
[08:11] to pay attention we're on day three we
[08:13] haven't been rushing the process we've
[08:15] been giving Veronica time to adjust this
[08:17] is really new for her it's a fine line
[08:20] between giving them a chance to have a
[08:23] breakthrough and overwhelming either dog
[08:26] now until this point shade and Veronica
[08:28] they haven't bonded that much Veronica's
[08:30] been pretty unsettled by his arrival if
[08:32] I'm being honest I mean just yesterday
[08:34] she was pretty scared of him and not
[08:36] comfortable around him but by allowing
[08:38] them to Simply coexist Outdoors here in
[08:40] the backyard in a relaxed setting I'm
[08:43] giving Veronica the chance to grow a bit
[08:45] more comfortable with him now I'm really
[08:47] hopeful that she is going to choose to
[08:50] engage shade and play being that she is
[08:53] a dog that typically likes to play but
[08:55] we need to let her approach this on her
[08:57] terms really pay attention to the dog's
[08:59] Body Language they communicate
[09:00] everything through the way that they
[09:02] move their postures their signals by
[09:04] observing their body language we can
[09:05] better understand their emotions and
[09:07] their needs it's happening watch there
[09:09] it is there it
[09:12] is there it is zooms come on come on
[09:15] good she's trying to engage him that
[09:17] might be what we look back on as being a
[09:20] key moment yeah look see she's now
[09:22] advancing back towards him clearly
[09:24] trying to engage in a game of mutual
[09:26] Zoomies she's not just running from him
[09:28] for is getting much more comfortable
[09:30] we've gone out of our way to make sure
[09:32] that we've created a place where dogs
[09:34] can feel safe and secure to explore and
[09:36] interact with one another when it works
[09:38] and you can get two dogs playing
[09:40] together it can turn strangers into
[09:42] friends and strengthen existing
[09:44] relationships too these first few days
[09:46] have really been focused on getting them
[09:48] acclimated doing some light training
[09:50] blending play with structure but they're
[09:52] so much more to come can you believe
[09:54] we're only on day three with Shade
[09:57] that's it I'm going to continue using
[09:59] these pup for treats throughout the

[00:00] think about when your dog gets the
[00:01] zumies there's actually a term for that
[00:03] it's called fraps or frenetic random
[00:06] activity periods you see elements of
[00:08] zoomy action going on here these fraps
[00:10] can be seen as part of a puppy's way of
[00:12] processing new learning experiences it's
[00:14] kind of like they're shaking off the
[00:16] mental dust that accumulates during
[00:19] intense concentration when you recognize
[00:21] and embrace these moments you're not
[00:22] only observing a joyful expression but a
[00:25] vital part of your dog's growth and
[00:27] their development

[00:00] we caught this moment on one of our
[00:01] security cameras shade made a high-pitch
[00:03] sound and he started to walk towards the
[00:05] gate I interpreted this as a clear
[00:07] signal that he needed to go out
[00:09] recognizing and responding to these
[00:10] signals is crucial that little tiny wine
[00:13] coupled by just gesturing in the general
[00:16] direction I think that means he's got to
[00:17] go things are starting to come together
[00:19] we're getting somewhere small victories
[00:21] like this will pave the way to a

[00:00] and we're looking for any signs that he
[00:01] might be stressed things you would look
[00:03] for are licking of the lips or yawning
[00:05] while behaviors like licking lips and
[00:07] yawning are common in dogs they can
[00:09] sometimes indicate discomfort or stress
[00:11] it's important to view these actions as
[00:13] cues to better understand our dogs
[00:15] feelings and emotions noticing these
[00:17] signals isn't about blaming ourselves
[00:19] it's about becoming more attuned to our

People think that some dogs need a firm hand sometimes. 

But, if you prioritize communication instead of domination, you’ll realize that NO dog needs a “firm hand” in the name of dog training!

Are there any myths that you realized were totally not real once you learned a little bit about training dogs?

TRANSCRIPTION:

[00:00] people think dogs like this need a firm
[00:02] hand sometimes I'm showing you that
[00:03] without touching them you can teach them
[00:05] to let go we're going to make the toy
[00:07] boring it's a fine line between quelling
[00:11] their drive cuz you really want them
[00:12] kind of amped up when you're using a toy
[00:14] in a lot of instances so it's a fine
[00:16] line between quelling their drive and
[00:18] kind of waiting them out till they
[00:19] naturally let go if your dog's Drive
[00:21] were more fragile then you might not do
[00:24] this approach but he's I'm not worried
[00:25] about his drive going away

[00:31] fine but some things we really need to
[00:33] leave alone these mini training sessions
[00:35] are crucial reinforcing the behaviors we

[00:19] it's more than just a physical hurdle
[00:21] it's a mental puzzle that she's learning
[00:23] to solve it's vital that we give our

[00:26] encouragement turns this daunting gate
[00:28] to her at least into AEP steing stone
[00:30] for Veronica's
[00:32] confidence but mastering this little
[00:34] hurdle is just the beginning it's about
[00:36] building a mindset that no obstacle big
[00:38] or small is insurmountable today it's

[00:00] I think a breakthrough is happening
[00:01] let's see what's going on it's one of
[00:02] the first rear end sniffs she's gotten
[00:04] shade ever eager to bond doesn't fully
[00:07] grasp that his larger size can be
[00:09] intimidating for Veronica she insists on
[00:11] interacting on her own terms urging
[00:14] shade to tone down his enthusiasm so
[00:16] she's getting braver about issuing those
[00:18] measured Corrections Veronica's barking
[00:20] is far from just noise it's her mature
[00:22] way of setting boundaries notice this
[00:24] moment where Veronica's message gets
[00:27] through yeah there it is okay
[00:30] good girl it's okay good job followed by
[00:33] a shake off a clear sign that he's
[00:35] resetting and releasing any builtup
[00:38] stress it's his way of processing the
[00:40] interaction and calming down remember
[00:42] think of this as a dog reset button
[00:45] helping him and others to move on from
[00:47] the encounter positively I think this is
[00:49] a major advancement in their
[00:51] relationship we wouldn't be wrong to
[00:53] interfere we think they're doing okay

[00:01] today we're going to dive deep into
[00:02] trying to resolve shade's anxiety
[00:05] associated with the crate and we're also
[00:07] navigating the Dynamics of our multi-dog
[00:09] household subscribe to my channel to
[00:11] learn everything about raising and
[00:12] training a new dog click thumbs up too
[00:14] last time we saw Veronica warming up to
[00:16] shade Outdoors but indoors she remains
[00:19] cautious she's on the ground right now
[00:21] which is an improvement while indoors
[00:23] anyway she's been living up there she's
[00:24] getting braver with him I think a
[00:26] breakthrough is happening let's see
[00:27] what's going on this is the first
[00:28] instance where Veronica shows a genuine
[00:31] interest in befriending shade it's
[00:33] crucial for dogs to progress in their
[00:35] social interactions at their own pace
[00:37] and Veronica is doing just that Veronica
[00:41] has consistently used her couch as a
[00:43] safe space creating a boundary between
[00:45] herself and shade those Shake offs are
[00:47] really key when dogs are interacting her
[00:49] shake off here is significant a mental
[00:52] reset this signals her attempt to
[00:54] re-calibrate to shade's presence
[00:56] reciprocal Shake offs are often an
[00:58] indicator of progress the coffee table
[01:00] strategically placed between the love
[01:02] seat and the couch adds an extra layer
[01:04] of security for her it's one of the
[01:05] first rear end sniffs she's gotten shade
[01:08] ever eager to bond doesn't fully grasp
[01:11] that his larger size can be intimidating
[01:13] for Veronica she insists on interacting
[01:15] on her own terms which should be
[01:17] respected urging shade to tone down his
[01:20] enthusiasm so she's getting braver about
[01:22] issuing those measured Corrections
[01:24] interestingly Veronica's barking is far
[01:27] from just noise it's her mature way of
[01:29] setting boundaries indicating her growth
[01:32] as a dog notice this moment where
[01:34] Veronica's message gets
[01:36] through yeah there it is okay good girl
[01:41] it's okay good job followed by a shake
[01:42] off a clear sign that he's resetting and
[01:45] releasing any builtup stress it's his
[01:48] way of processing the interaction and
[01:50] calming down remember think of this as a
[01:52] dog reset button helping him and others
[01:56] to move on from the encounter positively
[01:58] and I mean that's what he's trying to
[01:59] say he's like I don't want to overwhelm
[02:01] you that's really healthy body language
[02:03] I think this is a major advancement in
[02:05] their relationship it's a fine line here
[02:07] like we wouldn't be wrong to interfere
[02:09] but we've seen the exchanges go back and
[02:11] forth and we think they're doing okay
[02:12] and Veronica is learning really how to
[02:14] communicate with a variety of different
[02:15] dogs too still she's very young very
[02:18] healthy behavior in my opinion what do
[02:19] you guys think moving these dogs in for
[02:21] a while really lets us capture the real
[02:24] side of having puppies puppies have a
[02:26] natural urge to chew often on things
[02:28] that they shouldn't as we raise and
[02:30] teach them keeping their mind sharp and
[02:32] focused on the right things is a
[02:35] priority I just caught you you can't
[02:37] just chew on a pillow I get it I tell
[02:39] you what this is really similar to your
[02:42] pillow only it's for You Go Get It Go
[02:45] Get It When shade starts eyeing that
[02:46] couch cushion having a variety of
[02:48] interesting toys on hand really is a
[02:50] Difference Maker it's about redirecting
[02:52] that chewing instinct to something more
[02:54] appropriate whether it's a firm toy for
[02:56] focused chewing or a soft one for gentle
[02:59] play variety is the spice of life for
[03:01] dogs having treats on standby can also
[03:03] create less friction when it comes to
[03:05] asking your dog to do something
[03:07] incompatible with chewing like stay and
[03:09] hang out with me for example when you
[03:11] get a monthly subscription to bark
[03:12] whether it's the traditional Bark Box or
[03:14] the super chewer box you're always
[03:16] equipped with the latest and greatest in
[03:18] dog toy technology get your first box
[03:21] free when you go to barkbox.com doog
[03:23] trining or super.com doog trining links
[03:26] below how many of you non-dog trainers
[03:28] out there if you had a pu and they were
[03:30] chewing your pillow how many of you
[03:31] would say no stop it no and that's no
[03:35] shade to anyone that's what we all kind
[03:36] of have the instinct to do but what I'm
[03:38] hoping to demonstrate here is you know
[03:40] just by replacing the item there's no
[03:42] need to get emotional no need to scold
[03:44] your dog no need to punish them they
[03:47] didn't do anything wrong they're just
[03:48] learning so it's our job to teach them
[03:50] and guide them isn't that right it's
[03:52] clear that I rush things with shade's
[03:53] initial crate training since then I've
[03:55] been really focusing on building his
[03:57] confidence with the crate by making it a
[03:59] more positive space so some of the
[04:02] things I've done to troubleshoot are to
[04:04] scatter his food about while in his
[04:06] crate it's important for shade to be
[04:07] comfortable in a crate it really is a
[04:09] safe haven for him during everyday
[04:11] moments like when we have to take a
[04:12] shower or run errands right now the goal
[04:14] is just to get him comfortable with all
[04:15] fourt inside of
[04:18] [Applause]
[04:20] there I just wanted to see that it
[04:22] closes and his life doesn't end and I'm
[04:24] really focused on letting him enter and
[04:26] exit the crate at his own pace
[04:28] constantly gauging his comfortless level
[04:30] when he's in a playful mood I'll even
[04:32] toss his toy inside the crate the goal
[04:35] is literally to get seconds of him
[04:38] enjoying being in the crate with all
[04:40] four feet the more of those seconds I
[04:42] get the more likely it is we'll succeed
[04:44] we're good what's this what's this
[04:46] and look at that right in there well
[04:51] done and of course I've been putting
[04:53] high value things to chew
[04:55] on go ahead and toss it in there
[05:00] see if he gets settled I'm going to
[05:02] close
[05:04] it all right so he's noticed that it's
[05:06] closed I like that he's hearing the
[05:08] sounds of the crate a lot and he's a
[05:10] little concerned I suspect that bone is
[05:13] high value enough to him to where he
[05:15] might get over it and be like all right
[05:17] and what is the goal when we're trying
[05:18] to get our dog used to a crate period of
[05:21] time inside the crate while in a
[05:24] pleasant or neutral frame of mind and so
[05:26] that's the magic moment I've been
[05:28] waiting for for 4 days now something
[05:30] like that this is a major breakthrough
[05:32] because before he wouldn't even go in
[05:34] there for something high value like that
[05:36] don't we talk about that my books taking
[05:37] a step back when things aren't going
[05:39] smoothly it means that we got to repair
[05:41] the foundation that maybe we move too
[05:42] quick and it's so super common even I
[05:45] have to do it if it makes you feel
[05:47] better every dog is different and there
[05:49] is no one- siiz fits-all when it comes
[05:50] to training dogs looks like positive
[05:52] reinforcement is somehow keeping him in
[05:55] this crate he's literally asking to go
[05:58] in the crate cuz that's where I've been
[05:59] feeding him exclusively you see how that
[06:00] works I'm going to open the crate let's
[06:03] see what happens I'm not even going to
[06:04] tell him to do anything well would you
[06:07] look at that walks right
[06:11] in I'm going to do a combination here of
[06:14] dumping kibble around just like I've
[06:16] been doing this is again with the aim of
[06:19] getting him to
[06:21] experience pleasurable time in the
[06:23] crates where he is not feeling stress
[06:26] and quite the opposite enjoying it
[06:29] there's a lot lot of brain chemicals
[06:30] release when dogs are eating it makes
[06:31] them feel better really capturing those
[06:33] emotional states in strategic places
[06:36] like this can be super beneficial this
[06:38] is a a bone that he's been chewing on
[06:40] it's absolutely disgusting but I put
[06:42] some peanut butter on it to try and get
[06:43] some new life out of it and I'm going to
[06:45] put it in let's see how this
[06:47] goes and so by putting that bone in
[06:50] there with the peanut butter that
[06:51] doesn't go as quickly as say kibble does
[06:54] let me just drive this home we're
[06:56] acquiring seconds and minutes in the the
[06:59] crate while in a great or neutral
[07:02] emotional state that's how we address
[07:05] the underlying cause of anxiety of
[07:07] things like this one of the takeaways
[07:10] I'm really trying to hammer home in this
[07:12] series is the there is no one- siiz
[07:14] fits-all approach in dog training cuz I
[07:15] a th% agree with that however that
[07:18] statement has come to mean something
[07:20] different to many dog trainers they take
[07:22] it to mean well positive reinforcement
[07:24] isn't for every dog sometimes you have
[07:26] to use premeditated punishments as a
[07:28] strategy and what people fail to realize
[07:31] is there are so many different ways to
[07:33] address underlying emotional causes all
[07:35] of which are counteracted and
[07:38] contradicted by using methods that cause
[07:43] distress even though you might get the
[07:45] physical position I could come in here
[07:47] and I could smash the crate until he was
[07:50] quiet I could probably get the same
[07:51] result and get him to shut down in the
[07:53] crate but what have I done to his head I
[07:55] mean just 48 hours ago he was like no no
[07:57] no and now when I open the crate look at
[08:00] this he doesn't even go out I can't even
[08:03] get him to come
[08:05] out you can see how that anxiety appears
[08:08] to be dramatically subsiding at the very
[08:10] least tell me what your take on using
[08:12] crates as a safe space for dogs is have
[08:14] you ever used crate training with your
[08:16] own pets or did you avoid it tell me in
[08:18] the comments below I'm doing rollers
[08:20] with a frisbee cuz it teaches them to
[08:22] get it by the rim see how he's getting
[08:24] more comfortable picking it up that's
[08:25] not natural to a lot of dogs training is
[08:27] about more than just teaching skill it's
[08:29] about fostering emotional stability and
[08:31] clear communication by spending quality
[08:34] time with shade engaging in play and
[08:36] ensuring he's well exercised we're
[08:38] really helping him to become a more
[08:40] balanced dog overall do some light tug
[08:43] cuz he still has his baby teeth so we
[08:44] don't want to get too aggressive but boy
[08:45] he's got a good grip yes sir I love it
[08:49] yes just little patience there in the
[08:51] beginning and what's the consequence for
[08:53] letting go hey you get to go chase a
[08:54] frisbee something he seems to be
[08:57] enjoying right now people will be so
[08:58] quick to tell you that dogs like Kane
[09:00] Corsos oh they're not cut out for this
[09:02] sort of thing I'd like to see you teach
[09:05] that to a cone Corso easy to teach it to
[09:07] a border colleag I'm having a little fun
[09:09] with you guys but stereotypes out there
[09:11] in dog world are just insanely
[09:13] ridiculous and people put too much stock
[09:15] into it you are killing it
[09:18] sir you are just doing great I am so
[09:21] unbelievably impressed ready this
[09:23] approach is really benefiting Veronica
[09:25] as well who's gradually becoming more
[09:27] and more at ease with him she's getting
[09:28] more comfortable see how she's going up
[09:30] to him sniffing him more tails up she's
[09:33] pretty confident he's behaving too he's
[09:35] not being too pushy I want them to feel
[09:38] comfortable they don't need to play
[09:39] though they can I just want their
[09:43] emotional state to be regulated you know
[09:45] she's had to get on him a few times
[09:47] perfectly reasonable ways no biting no
[09:48] Force just some barking communication
[09:51] did you notice a change in Veronica's
[09:53] Behavior towards shade in this episode
[09:55] what specific moments stood out to you
[09:57] it's so great to see how the
[09:59] relationship is evolving into a
[10:00] comfortable and normalized bond there's
[10:02] still so much more to train shade
[10:04] including leash walking and come when
[10:06] called and teaching them how to enjoy
[10:07] things like getting a bath make sure
[10:09] you're subscribed and click thumbs up if
[10:11] you enjoyed this episode follow us on
[10:13] Instagram Tik Tok and Facebook get a
[10:15] bark box or super chewer box and support
[10:17] brands that support modern training

[00:00] do you want me to show you how we went
[00:01] from this crazy walking to this more
[00:03] polite walking in one training session
[00:05] and how we did it without Force we have
[00:07] very significant tension on the leash
[00:10] here as we walk there's a German
[00:11] Shepherd over there there's just all
[00:13] sorts of things in public that you can't
[00:15] possibly prepare for unless you just go
[00:17] in public very often with your dog we're
[00:19] going to go out and do a neighborhood
[00:20] walk with her anytime we change
[00:21] environment on a dog we have to be
[00:23] prepared to really roll with punches
[00:25] dogs pull because they walk naturally
[00:27] quicker than we do I mean look how slow
[00:28] I'm walking you can probably imagine how
[00:31] fast she would walk if she had her
[00:34] say hats and sunglasses are a big one
[00:36] they're likely to be like what is that
[00:38] let me see if we can get her to sit
[00:39] remember that's a way to measure for
[00:41] compliance sit she won't sit right now
[00:44] for a treat that means she's really
[00:46] overwhelmed so I'm going to give her
[00:47] some time here to
[00:50] adjust

[00:00] do you want me to show you how we went
[00:01] from this crazy walking to this more
[00:03] polite walking in one training session
[00:05] and how we did it without Force she
[00:07] keeps going for these little acorns on
[00:09] the ground leave it alone it's all these
[00:11] little things that you have to show your
[00:13] dog when you're training them now she's
[00:14] starting to take turkey that's a good
[00:16] sign when we were working with her a
[00:17] moment ago she was very eager and happy
[00:19] to work for a tug toy still a little
[00:20] uninterested she that there's a spark
[00:23] that's a good sign right there so now
[00:25] she's a little responsive to interacting
[00:26] with me it's off and on that's okay my
[00:29] goal right now is really get her into
[00:30] this toy and thereby getting her more
[00:33] into me she's having a good time right
[00:35] now she's into me and when she's into me
[00:36] that's the time you want to capitalize
[00:38] on even if it's for a moment at a time
[00:40] to do some training so let go sit yes
[00:44] good and with her being a dual currency
[00:46] dog you can switch back and forth
[00:48] between currencies whatever she's into
[00:49] at that moment so let me try turkey
[00:51] again and see how she does sit rather
[00:54] than just going on a long walk where
[00:55] every new inch is brand new territory

[00:00] as inertia and I walk on the edge of a
[00:01] volcano every step with my dog could be
[00:04] the difference between remaining safe or
[00:06] a total disaster this Narrow Path along
[00:09] this cinder cone is a lot steeper and
[00:11] more treacherous than it appears and in
[00:12] such situations a reliable heel isn't
[00:14] just convenient it is a necessity that's
[00:17] why I've trained inertia to heal in
[00:18] precisely these applications it's
[00:21] important that inertia match my Pace
[00:23] even when it's very unnaturally slow for
[00:25] her the best part about this is this
[00:27] heel that you're looking at was taught
[00:29] without the use of prong or choke or
[00:31] electric collars it was done with
[00:32] positive reinforcement and it's not just
[00:34] for dogs like her the methods used to
[00:36] teach this have been successfully
[00:38] applied across multiple dogs breeds and
[00:40] temperaments this method focuses on
[00:42] understanding and communication not fear
[00:44] or Force you routinely demonstrate this
[00:46] type of training on our YouTube channel
[00:48] along with trainers around the world
[00:50] does your dog know how to heal tell me
[00:51] below would you like more information on
[00:53] how to teach your dog to heal tell me in

[00:00] where do you start with a dog that's all
[00:01] over the place like this lelu is an
[00:04] extremely bright dog but as you can see
[00:07] her manners are a little bit lacking
[00:09] lelu has many issues actually obviously
[00:11] we want to get this barking biting and
[00:13] jumping under control right now it's
[00:15] really important that when you have a
[00:17] young dog like lelu she's only 9 months
[00:19] old and she's high energy as you can see
[00:21] that you're very consistent about
[00:23] showing them what you do want them to do
[00:25] see there's The Barking but I'm not
[00:26] going to give her the treat while she's
[00:27] barking so I'm going to insist on just a
[00:29] moment of quiet getting your dog to stop
[00:31] an unwanted behavior is about
[00:32] encouraging and acknowledging the
[00:34] preferred behavior I'm going to try to
[00:36] reward her for silence when she's quiet
[00:38] right there good girl quiet really focus
[00:41] on reinforcing your dog when they are
[00:42] behaving well Le over here she's picking
[00:44] up the carpet let's redirect her good
[00:46] look at
[00:47] me yes I'm going to go ahead and give
[00:49] her a jackpot there cuz even though it's
[00:51] only a Sit she's really amped up right
[00:54] now why do you think some high-profile
[00:55] trainers still use Force when we know
[00:57] it's completely unnecessary

[00:00] if your dog knows how to look at you
[00:01] around minor distractions you can teach
[00:04] them to stop pulling on leash this is
[00:07] what you do next since look at me looks
[00:09] so good I want to see if we can now do
[00:11] that while moving around again in an
[00:13] outdoor environment that's super key
[00:15] nice work up here oh there's birds up
[00:19] here look at me she's acknowledging the
[00:21] distractions look at this no tension on
[00:23] the leash so far this is exactly where
[00:25] you want to be in other words you don't
[00:26] want to wait for your dog to start
[00:28] pulling on the leash to then correct
[00:30] them and scold them for pulling it's so
[00:32] much better to motivate them to want to
[00:34] walk nicely rather than using special
[00:36] tools like choke prong or electric
[00:37] collars teaching your dog to think From
[00:39] the Inside Out will always be far more
[00:41] potent biscuit up here yeah good I don't
[00:44] know if you could see that her Pace
[00:46] started to increase a bit but I wanted
[00:48] to prevent her from pulling so I asked
[00:50] her to look at me and she did showing
[00:51] your dog what to do before they're
[00:53] surprised by something is the ideal way
[00:55] to set them up for success

TRANSCRIPTION:

[00:00] one of the biggest myths about huskys is
[00:02] that they're terrible about coming back
[00:03] to you when you call them especially
[00:05] when in a really distracting setting
[00:07] like this we're going to see if we can
[00:08] shatter that myth with Malachi right now
[00:10] I'm just going to get him warmed up with
[00:11] that stay real quick stay I'm going to
[00:14] get low to be more inviting come on yes
[00:17] good job I'm going to give him a big
[00:19] giant reward here to let him know that I
[00:21] love that he came walking towards me
[00:22] that was our first success well I'm
[00:24] going to try doing this really far away
[00:26] lots more distractions right now and
[00:28] we're going to see how he does come on
[00:29] Malik come on yes come on Malachi come
[00:32] on boy come on you can do it he still
[00:34] came to me and I really appreciate that
[00:36] but he was kind of just walking in a
[00:37] real slow lazy way ideally I prefer a
[00:40] dog just bolting to me if that's their
[00:42] personality come on Malachi yeah now
[00:44] that's what I like to see a lot more pey
[00:46] a lot more vigorous there I love that
[00:48] I'm going to reward with the toy one of
[00:49] my favorite ways to teach a dog to come
[00:51] to me is by being really playful and
[00:52] running away from them the power of play
[00:54] is pretty amazing when it comes to
[00:56] teaching a dog like Malachi look how
[00:58] engaged look how happy he is right now

[00:00] huskies are notorious for being
[00:02] difficult to train stubborn strong
[00:04] willed and independent stereotypes like
[00:06] this are not based on Modern dog
[00:08] behavior research the fact is all dogs
[00:11] learn in basically the same way if the
[00:13] outcome to a behavior is viewed as
[00:16] favorable to a dog then that dog is more
[00:18] likely to repeat that behavior in the
[00:20] future remember at their core dogs were
[00:23] specifically bred to take direction from
[00:25] us people and that's what we have to tap
[00:28] into when teaching them

Does your dog STILL jump on everyone??? Watch PART 2: https://youtube.com/shorts/RzXdI17Zd54

TRANSCRIPTION:

[00:00] there's a few things we need to consider
[00:01] before teaching a dog like Zeus not to
[00:03] jump no Zeus we have a video to shoot
[00:06] here first make sure that you're
[00:07] providing regular intense mental
[00:09] stimulation if you've got a dog like
[00:11] Zeus all of this excess energy can make
[00:13] it really challenging for Zeus to listen
[00:14] to me cuz look at him I mean he's super
[00:17] wired right now and that's not because
[00:19] he's a bad dog he's just dying to engage
[00:21] with me and that's a good thing in fact
[00:23] that's something we're going to use to
[00:24] our advantage in today's lesson I hope
[00:27] we have to find ways to make sure that
[00:28] our dog is satisfied mentally and
[00:30] physically fetch early in the day and
[00:32] just before training will likely do the
[00:34] trick if you've got a high energy dog
[00:35] now if you're struggling with teaching
[00:36] your dog how not to jump your issue
[00:38] isn't that your dog no don't don't bite
[00:40] my ankles dude your issue isn't that you
[00:43] have a jumping dog the issue is that you
[00:45] haven't taught your dog how to sit and
[00:47] stay when they're excited if you want to
[00:49] see how I taught Zeus to sit still and
[00:51] not jump even when he's really excited
[00:54] tell me below yes

[00:00] I'm gonna actually spray him with the
[00:01] water uhoh that will often save a
[00:03] lifetime of unnecessary struggle at bath
[00:06] time is it actually possible to teach
[00:09] dogs to love getting a bath have you
[00:11] ever struggled with giving your dog a
[00:12] bath if you want to learn everything
[00:13] about teaching dogs you should subscribe
[00:15] to this Channel right now and click
[00:17] thumbs up too he's had really sufficient
[00:19] exercise today lots of social time some
[00:22] light training he's had his chewing
[00:25] needs met he's had lots of potty breaks
[00:28] today so I'm pretty optimistic that he's
[00:30] primed for a bath I like that he's low
[00:33] energy right now I hope it stays that
[00:34] way having a curated selection of toys
[00:37] treats and shoes that are tailored to
[00:40] your dog's play style whether they're
[00:41] tough on toys or they just enjoy a good
[00:44] shoe or really love those squeaky plush
[00:46] toys can really help contribute to an
[00:48] increased quality of life for them I
[00:50] know our dogs love both super chewer
[00:52] boxes and bark boxes BarkBox toys are
[00:55] often going to be softer a little
[00:56] squeakier whereas super chewer toys are
[00:59] sign significantly tougher for those
[01:01] really strong dogs one thing you can
[01:03] always count on though is that these
[01:06] toys are engineered to be fun for dogs
[01:10] and I can personally verify that when
[01:12] you sign up for a subscription right now
[01:13] bark is going to give you a free Yeti
[01:16] dog bowl and these things are incredible
[01:19] they're such great quality and they're
[01:21] going to look great in your home too
[01:23] guess what we are going to give shade
[01:25] his very first bath today these can go
[01:28] all sorts of ways I don't know what to
[01:29] expect giving dogs a bath surely you
[01:32] understand the Wild Card this one can be
[01:34] let me show you what I did over here
[01:36] normally this is up here things that are
[01:38] topheavy and wavy can be daunting to
[01:41] dogs so I want to introduce it over here
[01:43] and I think I'm going to let it hang
[01:46] anything you can do to preset your bath
[01:48] and make sure everything is where it
[01:50] needs to be your towel your shampoo your
[01:52] washcloth a cup if you're using it to do
[01:54] rinsing we still have some ground work
[01:56] to lay here as we train shade to accept
[01:59] the bath notice the gradual approach now
[02:01] many say they've tried everything with
[02:03] various issues related to dog training
[02:05] yet often it really is about the smaller
[02:07] steps here I'm just simply adjusting the
[02:09] handle introducing the water in brief
[02:12] bits by really trying to tune into how
[02:13] shade might react to the water I'm
[02:15] effectively minimizing the potential
[02:17] stress this approach isn't just about
[02:19] being gentle it's the most efficient way
[02:22] to help a dog grow to enjoy bath
[02:27] time he's noticing it yes I am going to
[02:30] need him conscious for the bath so I am
[02:32] going to go ahead and say yes right
[02:35] there and give him a little piece of his
[02:36] kle I'm actually using a trio of treats
[02:40] today a combination of his food and two
[02:42] different kinds of treats mixed in
[02:44] that's because there's data suggesting
[02:46] that if you actually have different
[02:47] types of rewards reinforcement might be
[02:49] more effective well does anyone have a
[02:51] forklift since the bath is too high for
[02:53] shade I'm going to gently lift him up
[02:55] into place that's for his comfort and
[02:57] his safety I want you to watch how many
[02:59] things we do before we turn on the water
[03:02] yes see how that word yes is really
[03:05] important that we talked about a few
[03:07] days ago you consider he's going to be
[03:08] 110 lb you do not want to be fighting
[03:10] with a dog in a
[03:13] bathtub yes see how he just looked at it
[03:17] if I'm get to voluntarily approach
[03:20] it
[03:22] yes then I feel that makes the ground
[03:25] more strong beneath me as I move forward
[03:30] all right okay I feel good I'm going to
[03:33] pick it up
[03:34] now yes sudden movements are not lost on
[03:38] puppies or dogs you might notice there's
[03:40] some drippy water coming out of it just
[03:42] cuz it's been on before recently rather
[03:44] than just rushing into it if you just
[03:45] give your dog the chance to see what
[03:47] it's about you know touch them lightly
[03:50] with it yes dedicate 30 minutes an hour
[03:53] something like that don't just rush
[03:55] through the process make sure you think
[03:56] it out that will often save a lifetime
[03:58] of unnecessary struggle at cuz see there
[04:01] are times where this will have to come
[04:03] over him and dogs don't like it when
[04:05] things come over their head so that's
[04:07] one of the reasons that dogs get really
[04:09] nervous at bath time bath time can be a
[04:13] very fragile event for a dog
[04:16] now
[04:18] yes let him go about as he wants I don't
[04:20] know if he was trying to get away or if
[04:22] he was just like what is that I want him
[04:24] to actually see I'm going to lure him I
[04:26] want him to see where the water's coming
[04:28] from
[04:31] there's the first trips look at him
[04:32] looking at it you see that you saw him
[04:34] perk up
[04:36] there rather than treat him here I'm
[04:38] going to let him just do some organic
[04:40] exploration satisfy his curiosity he
[04:43] knows what water is so hey this is just
[04:44] more of that but a bonus treat can't
[04:46] hurt you know once he disengages from
[04:48] the shower head you can see how he's a
[04:50] little apprehensive I'm going to go
[04:51] ahead and turn it off right there there
[04:53] he's like well that's interesting but
[04:55] I'm a little sus why is there water
[04:58] coming out of the the wall I demand an
[05:01] explanation I'm just going to sit here
[05:03] and let that run for a few seconds one
[05:05] of my favorite things about bath time
[05:07] it's one of the best times to build
[05:10] genuine deep trust with a dog you want
[05:14] to approach the water so here I have I
[05:15] have a puppy walking towards the water
[05:18] you see that he's free to go over here
[05:20] at any time if he wants here we
[05:24] go right and the stream of the water I'm
[05:28] going to place it right there let's see
[05:30] if he gets it I'm going now that I'm
[05:31] about to crank up the water a little bit
[05:33] I'm going to keep him over here and I'm
[05:35] going to go slow and I'm going to watch
[05:36] him for any signs that he's like oh
[05:38] gosh pull that up good man I see him
[05:42] backing away so I want to
[05:45] be there it comes like yes for good
[05:49] measure I'm going to place the shower
[05:50] head where he's used to seeing water
[05:52] come from this is exactly what you want
[05:55] you want them being curious about it and
[05:57] if you got this far in one training
[05:58] session it would be be a good time to
[06:00] stop but I'm not going to cuz I think we
[06:02] can get more you can hear the sounds
[06:04] change as you go so it's really
[06:06] stimulating in many ways not just the
[06:08] water the sound of the water draining
[06:10] the volume of water is much greater now
[06:13] coming out the idea here is not to wait
[06:16] until you have a problem to then address
[06:17] it the idea is to introduce it to the
[06:19] best of your ability from the first time
[06:21] ever even if you adopt a dog who doesn't
[06:23] like the bath if this is what you do the
[06:25] first time they learn oh even though
[06:28] I've had bad experiences the bath where
[06:30] it needed to be rushed for one reason or
[06:32] another and there are authentic reasons
[06:34] for that this person when they give me a
[06:36] bath is often very kind and
[06:38] understanding and slow and gentle and so
[06:40] you have that real opportunity and even
[06:42] if you and your dog struggle at bath
[06:44] time simply taking a step back and
[06:47] applying this approach is very likely to
[06:49] help but be understanding of your dog's
[06:51] emotions throughout the process I'm
[06:53] about to go for a Magic Moment here I'm
[06:55] going to actually spray him with the
[06:57] water yes I just barely got his shoulder
[07:01] blade there gonna pull away because he's
[07:04] pulling away I'm just getting his feet
[07:05] here good man that was a really
[07:08] impressive one his shoulder blade is
[07:10] soaking wet now you stop
[07:12] there I'm going to go shorter that time
[07:15] as I started to speed up a little bit
[07:17] Shades started to show some apprehension
[07:19] this is completely normal it's okay I'm
[07:21] not going to go at all now cuz he's like
[07:23] I don't know you squirted me the last
[07:24] two times was I moving too fast here go
[07:28] give it another look see what it's about
[07:30] uh-oh hey what's this whenever your
[07:33] dog's stress level increases you
[07:35] deescalate good
[07:38] man there ah well that was the first
[07:41] time yes he attempted to get out there
[07:44] so I'm like all right I'll slow down for
[07:46] you buddy so I stopped what I was doing
[07:47] I took my time I threw a few treats in
[07:49] the tub and worked back up to getting
[07:51] him comfortable with water so proud of
[07:53] you you are this is very brave I'm going
[07:57] to make sure it's okay I'm not not going
[07:59] to let it hurt you you're very safe as I
[08:02] continue to give him the bath finding
[08:04] this Rhythm between dropping a few
[08:06] treats on the ground to keep him
[08:08] interested and going slow and not being
[08:11] too overbearing with him really proved
[08:13] to be the trick I'm not necessarily
[08:16] focused on giving him the most perfect
[08:18] bath ever I'm more focused on getting
[08:20] him a relatively clean while also giving
[08:22] him a good experience does your dog like
[08:25] getting bats do they just simply
[08:27] tolerate it or do they strongly dislike

[00:00] if you're struggling with teaching your
[00:01] dog how not to jump your issue isn't
[00:03] that you have a jumping dog the issue is
[00:04] that you haven't taught your dog how to
[00:06] sit and stay when they're excited that
[00:08] was kind of a disaster Zeus now you can
[00:10] clearly see how teaching a dog like Zeus
[00:11] is different than many of the other dogs
[00:13] I work with he's bigger he's stronger
[00:14] he's more intense his mind is going a
[00:16] million miles an hour that was a good
[00:18] sit stay with dogs like this you have to
[00:20] constantly engage them during a training
[00:22] session and if you're new that's not
[00:23] very natural so you'll have to be extra
[00:25] patient until you acquire the skill
[00:27] having your dogs stay like this when
[00:28] you're completely focused on them that's
[00:30] one thing of course getting them to pull
[00:32] the Sit Stay when things get more
[00:33] exciting well that's a tougher thing to
[00:35] accomplish so if I'm acting ridiculous
[00:37] Zeus obviously gets excited and starts

[00:40] stuff so we're going to work up to

[00:45] distraction you might have noticed there
[00:46] it was subtle but I got his eyes on me
[00:48] too by making a little

[00:00] one of my favorite things about bath
[00:02] time it's one of the best times to build
[00:05] genuine deep trust with a dog you want
[00:08] to approach the water so here I have I
[00:10] have a puppy walking towards the water
[00:12] you see that now that I'm about to crank
[00:14] up the water a little bit I'm going to
[00:16] keep him over here I'm going to go slow
[00:17] and I'm going to watch him for any signs
[00:19] that he's like oh gosh good man even if
[00:21] you and your dog struggle at bath time
[00:23] simply taking a step back and applying
[00:25] this approach is very likely to help for
[00:28] good measure I'm going to place the
[00:29] shower head where he's used to seeing
[00:31] water come from this is exactly what you
[00:33] want you want them being curious about
[00:36] it and if you got this far in one
[00:37] training session it would be a good time
[00:39] to stop but I'm not going to because I
[00:41] think we can get more

[00:00] I'm about to go for a Magic Moment here
[00:02] I'm going to actually spray him with the
[00:03] water does your dog like getting baths
[00:05] do they just simply tolerate it or do
[00:07] they strongly dislike bath time going to
[00:10] pull away cuz he's pulling away I'm just
[00:11] getting his feet here good man that was
[00:14] a really impressive one as I started to
[00:16] speed up a little bit Shades started to
[00:18] show some apprehension this is
[00:20] completely normal it's okay I'm not
[00:22] going to go at all now cuz he's like I
[00:23] don't know you squirted me the last two
[00:25] times was I moving too fast here you
[00:28] good give it another look see what it's
[00:29] about uh-oh whenever your dog's stress
[00:32] level increases you deescalate he
[00:34] attempted to get out there I'll slow
[00:36] down for you buddy so I stopped what I
[00:37] was doing I took my time I threw a few
[00:39] treats in the tub and worked back up to
[00:41] getting him comfortable with water so
[00:43] proud of you this is very brave as I
[00:46] continue to give him the bath finding
[00:48] this Rhythm between dropping a few
[00:50] treats on the ground to keep him
[00:52] interested and going slow and not being
[00:55] too overbearing with him really proved
[00:57] to be the trick

[00:00] teing your puppy how to come to you is
[00:01] critical and you can start right away

[00:09] variety of different settings before
[00:11] your dog truly understands and

[00:16] I've got a little treat here this is a

[00:25] there and since she knows that treat's
[00:27] coming from me she's likely to come back
[00:29] on her own after a couple of attempts to
[00:32] say hey can I have another one and I'm
[00:33] going to give her another one toss the
[00:35] treat there she goes
[00:38] and just going to wait for her to
[00:40] naturally come back to me come very good
[00:43] I'm saying come as she's in the process
[00:45] of walking to me just to let her know
[00:47] what she's doing so that's a really

Her dog lashed out… but watch what she did next 👀 

Charlie is a young rescue dog, and while he was in my class, he was still learning that he didn’t need to react by barking and lunging at dogs when he was feeling unsure. 

We made sure he had plenty of space, including a fence barrier between him and other dogs and people that might make him feel uncomfortable. 

When your dog reacts like this, they’re feeling so frazzled, that it can be very challenging to communicate with them. That is, until you’ve taken the time to build a foundation of trust and understanding with your dog! 

Cameron is doing an incredible job of this with Charlie and it’s a pleasure to see this stage of their training. I always loved watching them in class so I thought you might like to see this example too! Thumbs up for Cameron and Charlie ❤️

How many of you are working with “reactive” dogs?

TRANSCRIPTION:

[00:00] Cameron is a very instinctive trainer
[00:01] with her dog Charlie he is a rescue dog
[00:04] and you know at this point in his
[00:05] training he would still bark out at dogs
[00:07] a lot he was unsocialized and very new
[00:09] he's quite a young dog as well what is
[00:12] so impressive about this example is you
[00:14] can see how frazzled Charlie is as
[00:16] evidenced by his pyo erection that's
[00:18] where the hair stands up on the back of
[00:20] a dog's neck they can be particularly
[00:22] difficult to reason with when they're in
[00:23] the state of mind which is why so many
[00:25] trainers resort to using shot collars
[00:27] prong collars or choke chains to pull
[00:29] their dog away
[00:30] however if your communication is very
[00:32] strong with your dog you can get them
[00:33] out of that State of Mind by reasoning
[00:35] with them communicating with them that's
[00:36] what Cameron does so well here
[00:39] communicating with look at that do you
[00:40] see how she got him back there he
[00:42] started to Bar you would only do this
[00:43] with a dog if you were extremely
[00:44] comfortable with them and you knew them
[00:46] very well that's how you do it beautiful
[00:48] work all of you have it in you to do it
[00:51] just be patient take your time enjoy the
[00:54] process that's what dog training is
[00:56] really about

Does your dog MESS UP your house?? 🙈 

There are a few things you can do to dramatically reduce the time it takes to potty train your dog:

💧 Be really consistent. 
💧 Give them more opportunities to go (in the right place) than they need! 
💧 Don’t put the responsibility on your dog to let you know when they need to go. Take them out regularly, and if they don’t need to go, that’s ok! When they do, celebrate!!

The fastest, easiest way to help your dog develop good habits, is by preventing bad habits from ever getting started!

If your dog has already learned some “bad” house training habits, your steps are the same but you’ll need to be even more consistent and vigilant. Prevent your dog from “rehearsing” the behaviors you don’t want, by proactively setting them up to do the right thing instead. 

You’ve got this 💪

TRANSCRIPTION:

[00:00] house training can be a weeks to months
[00:02] long process so don't underestimate
[00:04] what's required there but if you're
[00:05] really consistent you start immediately
[00:07] you can dramatically reduce the time it
[00:09] would otherwise take if you have a new
[00:11] dog especially a young puppy don't put
[00:13] the responsibility on them to let you
[00:15] know when they have to go for now just
[00:17] give them ample opportunities to relieve
[00:19] themselves in acceptable places that way
[00:21] you can help them develop good habits by
[00:23] preventing bad ones from day one

[00:20] attention to your dog and 50% to the
[00:22] person so your attention is divided
[00:24] isn't it you got to pick your dog in
[00:26] this case guys it is totally okay to say
[00:28] I'm sorry I'm trying to teach my dog not

[00:00] have you ever heard that when your puppy
[00:01] is biting you like this that you should
[00:03] say ouch and walk away from them ouch we
[00:06] can definitely say that now I've always
[00:08] thought that this was a bit of a shallow
[00:10] way to address this because you're
[00:12] addressing the symptom the biting and
[00:14] not the cause your dog's desire to
[00:17] interact with you there are two main
[00:18] reasons that puppies bite like this
[00:20] because they're teething or because
[00:22] they're trying to engage the world This
[00:24] Is How They grab things if your puppy is
[00:26] teething you'll definitely want to make
[00:27] sure they have regular access to Safe
[00:29] Che toys of lots of different textures
[00:32] now it's going to take a few weeks to
[00:33] really resolve puppy biting and dogs can
[00:35] be really nippy until they're about 5
[00:37] months old or even longer if it goes
[00:39] unchecked you must commit to being very
[00:42] patient with this right now you and your
[00:44] dog don't yet have really Crystal Clear
[00:47] communication together and every
[00:49] interaction you have with them needs to
[00:51] be focused on building that
[00:52] communication addressing puppy biting is
[00:55] one of the best opportunities to do that

[00:00] chances are if you've got a puppy biter
[00:01] on your hands you're probably getting
[00:03] pretty good at predicting when they're
[00:05] about to be bitey for example in
[00:07] flurry's case it's all of the time
[00:10] simply hoping for the best and reacting
[00:12] negatively when your puppy bites you is
[00:14] not going to resolve this efficiently
[00:16] fast success comes when you're one step
[00:19] ahead of your dog now I know you can do
[00:21] this you're a person they're a dog most
[00:24] of you are smarter than your dog I hope
[00:27] first let's talk about how you need to
[00:28] get good at using a void to curb puppy
[00:30] biting since I know that flurry is
[00:33] likely to bite me when I go to greet him
[00:35] I want to be one step ahead of him by
[00:37] having a toy that I know he likes
[00:39] already with me he likes that snake so
[00:42] look this is okay to bite my flesh is
[00:45] not so we want to continually divert our
[00:48] dog's attention to the toy the thing
[00:50] that is acceptable to bite over time
[00:52] your dog is going to start to realize
[00:53] all right so there are some things I'm
[00:54] allowed to bite other things I'm not but
[00:56] they're not born knowing this so you
[00:58] have to take the time to teach them

[00:00] have been working on my recall with my
[00:02] year and a half old Britney for at least
[00:04] a year he is perfect inside with no
[00:06] distractions but when we go outside into
[00:08] our large Fen yard he thinks the recall
[00:10] is optional then again this is a case of
[00:13] where you can use that 30 foot lead
[00:15] which we talk about pretty frequently so
[00:18] I actually love double controlled
[00:19] environments a fenced environment with a
[00:21] long lead uh for a variety of reasons
[00:25] but in this case you still need it's too
[00:28] big of a leap from inside into a smish
[00:30] area to a large backyard uh that is a
[00:33] completely different environment so you
[00:36] know i' practice working on that not
[00:38] just in the moment but make sure you
[00:39] have the lead on so that you can gently
[00:41] encourage your dog to come back to you
[00:43] at times if needed and just reinforce
[00:45] compliant Behavior I mean a recall in a
[00:47] distracting environment especially for a
[00:49] really curious animal like a dog is
[00:51] challenging and we're not entitled to it
[00:53] we're not entitled to a perfect recall

[01:16] Things dog training click Thumbs Up And
[01:18] subscribe to my channel to learn how to
[01:19] train your dog everything this is
[01:21] exactly why he needs to learn leave it
[01:23] the leave it look at me combo once your
[01:25] dog gets this you're setting the stage
[01:27] for success and more challenging to
[01:29] distracting situations there are so many
[01:32] ways to train leave it some people will
[01:34] toss a treat on the ground and then pull
[01:36] their dog back for example I don't like
[01:38] to do that because I run the risk of
[01:39] putting the dog in a less than desirable
[01:42] mindset to review every time I say yes
[01:44] he's conditioned that a treat is coming
[01:47] to him I'm reinforcing the down stay
[01:49] that we've been working on that we've
[01:50] already covered right there what
[01:52] happened there that was significant I
[01:53] was holding a treat
[01:56] yes he even voluntarily gave me his eye
[02:00] I'm not waiting for him to start going
[02:01] for the treat to pull it away or to pull
[02:04] him back by a leash do you see what I'm
[02:06] saying this is exclusively positive
[02:08] reinforcement yes this will work with
[02:10] any dog on the planet so leaving it
[02:13] while I hold it yes is one thing I
[02:16] suspect if I were to just drop it right
[02:17] now he might go for it because I've even
[02:19] taught him to do that I want to go in
[02:21] small steps
[02:23] yes did you see how long that treat was
[02:27] on the ground for just a a couple of
[02:31] milliseconds yes we're teaching him you
[02:34] can look at
[02:36] it yes almost there you can see that one
[02:41] I pushed it too far the idea here is to
[02:43] catch him succeeding before his behind
[02:46] comes up and gradually extend the time
[02:48] that we ask him to resist this delicious
[02:51] Temptation the goal is to be able to
[02:53] just drop a treat in front of him with
[02:54] it moving and being exciting when he's
[02:56] busy eating yes that's a good time to go
[02:59] in if if you have a really high strung
[03:01] dog yes that's how quick you're doing it
[03:03] remember if you're using their meal this
[03:05] is no big deal I'm going to move fast
[03:07] here
[03:11] yes
[03:16] yes yes little bit longer that
[03:21] time
[03:25] yes
[03:28] yes
[03:31] yes that was my longest one
[03:33] yet
[03:34] yes I'm going to start to say the term
[03:37] leave it leave it yes let me get some
[03:41] eye contact with him because I want to
[03:43] also get him looking at me and I want to
[03:44] combine those two there's a reason I'm
[03:46] combining them here you'll see what I'm
[03:48] doing in a second yes fine he kind of
[03:51] looked up at me yes I made a little
[03:55] sound teaching the leave it look at me
[03:57] combo it was all about capturing your
[03:59] dogs attention on Q a vital skill for
[04:02] future training and while a direct gaze
[04:04] isn't always necessary to show that
[04:07] they're listening this technique is one
[04:09] of the most effective ways to ensure
[04:10] that your dog is focused on you when
[04:12] accounts I often say here to me look at
[04:14] me here
[04:17] yes did you see that moment of
[04:19] understanding here
[04:22] yes
[04:25] here yes oh what was that that's
[04:29] significant did you see how he was
[04:31] looking at the treat I asked for his
[04:32] attention and he paid attention to me
[04:34] we're on the right
[04:35] track
[04:39] yeah
[04:41] yes so there I did fall back on some
[04:44] minor negative punishment that's where
[04:46] we're subtracting something that the dog
[04:48] wants as a consequence for going for the
[04:51] treat prematurely but I'm trying to
[04:53] minimize it that is the point here I'm
[04:55] not perfect it just shows you that there
[04:57] are lots of opportunities where we can
[04:59] all improve here
[05:02] yes got a good one
[05:05] there good man
[05:10] yes leave
[05:12] it
[05:14] here yes one of the themes of this
[05:18] series is dispelling the myth that
[05:19] positive reinforcement takes longer if
[05:21] you shift your mindset from every time
[05:23] your dog makes a mistake you look at it
[05:26] as you made a mistake it's going to make
[05:28] you a better dog trainer like that
[05:30] responsible dog trainers are supposed to
[05:32] consider the emotional well-being of a
[05:34] dog when they're working with them so
[05:35] we're tasked with looking at their body
[05:37] language right now with him what do we
[05:38] see we see a relaxed dog he's free to go
[05:40] at any time he's not showing any visible
[05:42] signs of stress like lick lipping or
[05:45] yawning or excessive
[05:47] snipping shade's quick grasp of this
[05:50] leave it concept is impressive this
[05:53] shows me that he's a very quick learner
[05:55] now to build on this success I'm going
[05:56] to raise the stakes by scattering treats
[05:59] around him sometimes even tossing out
[06:01] several treats at
[06:04] once leave it
[06:07] yes leave it
[06:10] yes the key is rewarding him and marking
[06:13] it with a yes before he makes a move for
[06:16] them this strategy not only extends his
[06:19] leave it duration but primes him for
[06:21] resisting real world Temptations
[06:23] provided we're consistent in our
[06:25] training okay good man so we'll release
[06:28] him let him enjoy those this is a new
[06:31] thing he's been getting a little bitey
[06:33] with me we're going to talk about puppy
[06:35] biting later in the series shade is
[06:36] unbelievable get your free camera with

Description:
Big changes are coming... Should dog training be regulated? A new statement released by American College of Veterinary Behaviorists advocates for some big changes in the pet training industry.  

Are we prepared to stand at the forefront of animal welfare, or will we cling to the shadows of outdated practices?

Last year, our community took significant strides in raising awareness about the challenges of an unregulated dog training industry, highlighting its drawbacks. As we move into 2024, these efforts are not only continuing but also gaining momentum with further advancements.

The American College of Veterinary Behaviorists, at the forefront of combining veterinary science and behavioral knowledge, is advocating for regulation in the pet training industry. Their expertise bridges the gap between animal health and behavior, making their push for standards a landmark move from one of the most respected bodies in animal welfare.

This is what they are recommending:

1. Education and Certification: Implementing mandatory education requirements and a certification process for all animal training professionals.
2. Commitment to Science-Based Techniques: Ensuring that all training methods are rooted in scientifically validated humane approaches, emphasizing the use of positive reinforcement and ensuring the well-being of the animal.
3. Consumer Protection and Public Safety: Establishing regulations to protect pet owners and the general public from unqualified animal training professionals, thereby enhancing overall public safety.

It’s heartening to see the impact that modern, evidence-based dog training is having. We are witnessing a significant shift away from outdated practices that rely on pain and discomfort—methods that are known to cause adverse side effects. The needle is moving towards more humane, effective training techniques, reflecting our growing understanding of animal behavior and welfare.

While I am fully behind this initiative, I acknowledge the diverse viewpoints within our community, especially from dog trainers who may have concerns about these proposed regulations’ implications. It’s vital that any move towards regulation considers the various economic realities and backgrounds of professionals in our field. Our aim is to inclusively elevate standards, ensuring the highest level of care and professionalism without exclusion or undue burden.

In our community, there are those who may resist and dismiss change, positioning themselves on the wrong side of history as opponents of progress. Yet, there are also those currently employing outdated methods who will see this call to action as a pivotal opportunity to modernize their practices and align with the future of animal welfare. The choice is clear: evolve and embrace progress, or risk being left behind as relics of a bygone era.

This call to action is more than a push for compliance; it’s an invitation to all involved—especially those who may have reservations—to engage in meaningful dialogue. Let’s discuss how we can implement these changes in a way that is inclusive, practical, and positive for all, especially the animals at the heart of our work.

Your insights and experiences are crucial as we move forward. Together, we can continue to advance towards a future where dog training is not just about obedience, but about fostering a safe, respectful, and loving relationship between humans and their animal companions. Let’s keep the conversation going and work together to ensure a better future for our pets.

[00:00] are we prepared to stand at the
[00:01] Forefront of animal training or are we
[00:04] as a community going to cling to the
[00:06] shadows of outdated practices last year
[00:09] our community took significant strides
[00:11] to challenging outdated practices in the
[00:14] dog training field in 20124 we expect
[00:17] this to continue the American College of
[00:19] Veterinary behaviorists who were at the
[00:20] Forefront of combining behavioral
[00:22] knowledge as well as veterinary science
[00:25] are advocating for change in the pet
[00:27] training industry their expertise
[00:29] Bridges the gap between animal health

[00:42] verbatim education and certification
[00:45] implementing mandatory education
[00:47] requirements and a certification process
[00:49] for all animal training professionals so
[00:52] this goes beyond dogs for example this
[00:54] would also include horse training
[00:56] professionals commitment to
[00:57] science-based techniques ensuring that
[01:00] all training methods are rooted in
[01:02] scientifically validated Humane
[01:04] approaches emphasizing the use of
[01:06] positive reinforcement and ensuring the

[01:11] consumer protection and Public Safety
[01:13] establishing regulations to protect pet
[01:15] Guardians and the general public from
[01:18] unqualified animal training
[01:19] professionals thereby enhancing overall
[01:22] Public Safety to me it is heartening to
[01:25] see the effect that modern
[01:27] evidence-based animal training is having
[01:30] we continue to see a significant shift
[01:32] away from outdated practices that rely
[01:35] on pain fear and intimidation methods
[01:38] that are known to cause adverse side
[01:40] effects the needle is clearly moving
[01:42] towards more Humane and effective
[01:44] training techniques and that reflects
[01:47] our growing understanding of animal
[01:49] training and animal welfare in 2024 and
[01:51] look while I am fully behind this
[01:53] initiative I do want to acknowledge the
[01:55] diverse viewpoints within our community
[01:58] and that includes dog trainers who might
[02:00] have concerns about these proposed
[02:02] regulations and their implications it's
[02:05] vital that any move towards regulation
[02:07] consider the economic backgrounds and
[02:10] the multitude of realities of

[02:15] elevate these standards in the most
[02:17] inclusive way possible we must ensure
[02:20] the highest level of care and
[02:21] professionalism in our field without
[02:23] exclusion in our community there are
[02:25] those who may resist and dismiss change
[02:28] positioning themselves on the wrong side
[02:30] of history as opponents to progress and
[02:33] yet there are also those who are
[02:34] currently implementing outdated
[02:36] practices who will see this as a call to
[02:38] action a pivotal opportunity to
[02:40] modernize their practices as well as
[02:43] aligning to the future of Animal Welfare
[02:45] if you are an animal training
[02:46] professional the choice is clear evolve
[02:49] and embrace progress or risk being left
[02:52] behind as a relic of a bygone ERA this
[02:55] position statement by the acvb is more
[02:57] than just a call to action it's an
[02:59] invitation to all involved especially
[03:01] those who may have reservations to
[03:02] engage in this important and meaningful
[03:04] dialogue let's discuss these changes in
[03:06] a way that's inclusive practical and
[03:08] positive for all involved and especially
[03:11] the animals who are at the heart of our
[03:13] work together we can continue to advance
[03:16] towards a reality in animal training
[03:18] where it's not just about obedience but
[03:21] is about creating a safe loving and
[03:22] meaningful relationship between people
[03:25] and their animals so once again I pose
[03:27] the question to all of you watching this
[03:29] are we prepared to advance animal
[03:32] welfare and training practices or are we
[03:34] going to insist on doubling down and
[03:37] staying rooted in the past I'm anxious
[03:39] to hear what everyone thinks about this
[03:40] tell us in the comments below see you

Description:
BREAKING NEWS - “Dog Daddy” associate Rich DuBarton has been arrested and charged with multiple counts of animal abuse in Mahwah, New Jersey. 

Rich is the owner of @westbrookpetresort 
@aranwood_kennel 
@europa_k9 
@europak9imports 
@europa_k9_training 
who hosted a “Dog Daddy” training event in November 2023 - you might recall our posts calling for a boycott of his business at that time.

Despite extensive outreach and sharing of evidence against such methods, the "resort" and its owner, Rich DuBarton, remain unapologetic and plan to continue their association with Deoliveira, and as of now, “Dog Daddy” Augusto DeOliveira has claimed to be returning to this facility to work with more of the public’s dogs this April.

After acknowledging and dismissing the clear evidence of the dangers to their community that these methods pose, they have chosen to double down on their support for these methods.

🚩NEW JERSEY: Take a stand against Westbrook Pet Resort for promoting harmful dog training practices 🚩

YOUR VOICE MATTERS! Spread the word, contact local media, and please share this video. Let’s ensure your concerns are heard and the safety of your dogs is prioritized. Harmful training methods like these will not go unchallenged.

This situation underscores a larger issue within the unregulated dog training industry. 

Many members of the public, not being behavior experts, may unknowingly expose their dogs to harmful practices under the guise of training. We believe it’s our responsibility to raise awareness about such methods, especially when they compromise animal welfare and mislead the public.

Our goal is not to vilify, but to inform and protect. We urge viewers to share this video and join us in advocating for safe, humane, and ethical dog training practices. It’s time to hold those who exploit public trust accountable and promote a higher standard of care in the dog training community.

Your voice matters. Boycott Westbrook Pet Resort to send a powerful message that these outdated and harmful tactics have no place in your community.

Here’s how I work with dogs in a setting like this who are exhibiting fearful or aggressive tendencies. REMEMBER: If you’re looking for aggressive behavior as evidence that a dog is “aggressive” in a dog training video, you are looking for evidence of BAD dog training 🫣 Here is one appropriate way to approach this issue: https://youtu.be/FYfpIbO2dNA?si=2pdLQ_VL8mmltwqx

[00:00] I've just learned of some breaking news
[00:02] in the dog training World related to
[00:04] austo DEA also known as dog Daddy you
[00:08] all might recall a few months ago at
[00:11] Westbrook Pet Resort aaronwood kennels
[00:13] the name is ambiguous is a venue that
[00:17] hosted austo de Oliva and we said at the
[00:21] time that this is a major red flag that
[00:25] a dog training facility would host
[00:27] somebody who's been condemned by every
[00:29] credit dog behavior organization or
[00:31] animal behavior organization on the
[00:33] planet practically we're continuing our
[00:35] ongoing efforts to boycott Westbrook Pet
[00:38] Resort in Ringwood New Jersey that's
[00:40] where Al Gusto appeared this past
[00:42] weekend I will remind you this is a dog
[00:44] training facility we will also continue
[00:46] to hold responsible those who enable
[00:48] these violent practices towards animals
[00:50] when you've been in this business long
[00:52] enough you learn to see the red flags
[00:55] which is why we did not relent and why
[00:57] we continue to advocate for this boycott
[01:00] against this Resort and against austo
[01:02] DEA you might recall that we even
[01:04] reached out to Rich dartan with our
[01:06] concerns for hosting austo just a few
[01:09] months ago and of course he was not
[01:11] having it or not hearing it I have felt
[01:14] so strongly about this boycott against
[01:16] this facility that we started that it is
[01:18] ongoing in fact austo Deale Lera intends
[01:22] last I heard to go back to this very
[01:25] facility in Ringwood New Jersey to
[01:27] conduct a train the trainers seminar
[01:30] well it seems that now he may have some
[01:32] difficulty doing that see the owner of
[01:34] this facility Richard dubart has just
[01:36] been arrested and charged with multiple
[01:39] counts of animal abuse police say they
[01:42] called Richard du Burton to pick up a
[01:45] dog that was handed over to the police
[01:46] department they say dub Barton took the
[01:48] dog back to his business aaronwood
[01:51] kennels it turns out this was the same
[01:54] dog found in a dumpster behind dub
[01:56] Barton's kennel business customers heard
[01:59] the animal whimper in police got a
[02:00] search warrant for the property they
[02:02] removed 37 more dogs then charged du
[02:05] Barton with a series of different animal
[02:07] abuse charges he will be in court March
[02:10] the 8th this dog was discarded by him
[02:13] for one reason or another in a dumpster
[02:15] apparently a customer heard the dog
[02:17] crying in the dumpster they called the
[02:19] police the police saved the dog that was
[02:21] in the dumpster and they also removed 37
[02:24] other dogs from the facility that were
[02:26] in need of medical attention is that
[02:28] right yes and why were they need a
[02:30] medical attention I'm just learning this
[02:32] the dogs have been left in dog runs with
[02:35] feces and urine multiple dogs were seen
[02:38] shivering and unable to stand okay so
[02:40] the dogs apparently were being kept in
[02:42] conditions that were inappropriate and
[02:45] inhumane based on the articles that
[02:46] we're reading and we're still learning a
[02:48] lot more about this and I just want you
[02:50] all to know that we take this very
[02:53] seriously when we raise awareness about
[02:55] businesses who have questionable ethics
[02:58] and associ iate with unethical dog
[03:01] trainers that's how we came to learn of
[03:03] this facility originally is that they
[03:05] were hosting austo DEA this further
[03:08] underscores the need for increased
[03:10] regulation in the dog training field
[03:12] anybody can go get a business license
[03:14] open a facility and start mistreating
[03:16] dogs and call themselves a professional
[03:19] it takes something this extreme to shut
[03:23] down a facility like this I am assuming
[03:25] this facility is shut down I don't know
[03:27] that maybe they're currently ongoing but
[03:29] I would say if you're in Ringwood New
[03:30] Jersey you should really have an eye on
[03:33] this facility anyway that's the news now
[03:34] I'll keep you posted if there's a need
[03:36] to give you guys any other information
[03:38] if anyone else has any information
[03:41] related to this specific story or if
[03:43] your dog was impacted by this facility
[03:46] please weigh in on the comments contact
[03:47] me personally

TRANSCRIPTION:

[00:00] joining us now is dog trainer Zack
[00:01] George host of Zack George's dog
[00:03] training Revolution CNN wants to
[00:06] interview me about Governor chrisy gnome
[00:09] she's the sitting governor in South
[00:12] Dakota and in a book that she has coming
[00:15] out there's an excerpt that's making
[00:17] news where she boasts of having to
[00:22] trigger warning here where she boasts of
[00:26] shooting her pet dog 14-month-old
[00:30] German pointer wired haired pointer and
[00:34] she defends it not only does she talk
[00:36] about this not in a way that is
[00:39] remorseful but in a way that is I had to
[00:43] do it because it had to be done this is
[00:45] how you know I am a leader and CNN
[00:49] wanted me to comment on this joining us
[00:51] now is dog trainer Zach George host of
[00:53] Zach George's dog training Revolution
[00:56] and I have to say Laura before you bring
[00:57] Zach in my dog was partly trained by
[01:01] Zach when he was a puppy he's a hunting
[01:04] dog as well and they're tough they're
[01:08] difficult but they're great dogs they
[01:09] can be trained welcome to the show Zach
[01:12] oh this is a special moment thank you I
[01:14] love this well listen I I appreciate
[01:16] that go ahead Zach go ahead oh yeah glad
[01:22] found yeah I'm glad you found value in
[01:24] the dog training videos I you know I
[01:26] make free videos for everyone out there
[01:28] to learn from on YouTube Just look me up
[01:30] Zach George I love that well listen I
[01:33] wonder from your perspective when you
[01:34] hear that this 14-month-old Wirehaired
[01:37] Pointer beautiful dogs by the way was
[01:39] out of her mind with excitement chasing
[01:41] birds on a hunt attacking chickens I
[01:43] wonder what you made of
[01:45] that this is I this is an astonishing
[01:49] story to say the least uh this the
[01:52] behavior described here is very typical
[01:55] adolescent Behavior out of a dog that's
[01:57] been selectively bred to have end
[02:00] stamina and endurance and it really
[02:02] speaks to the fact that the general
[02:04] public is deeply confused about dog
[02:07] behavior and how to treat them that's
[02:09] something we advocate for a lot on my
[02:11] social media uh to try and help educate
[02:14] the public around modern Humane
[02:16] treatment of dogs and she says that she
[02:20] put the dog around other older dogs uh
[02:23] in a hunting setting to teach her how to
[02:25] behave uh she talks about using an
[02:27] electronic collar but then at the same
[02:29] time she calls the dog untrainable I I
[02:32] mean when you hear that I mean do you
[02:35] get the sense that she really tried her
[02:37] level best to actually train this
[02:40] dog uh I I don't know what her personal
[02:43] best would be but yeah there are uh many
[02:46] more appropriate ways to train dogs than
[02:49] that especially with electric collars
[02:51] and aversive methods like this that rely
[02:53] on pain fear and intimidation those are
[02:57] strongly correlated with increased
[02:59] aggression in dogs now you know many
[03:02] members of the public don't realize that
[03:04] that's one of the big problems that
[03:05] collars like electric collars and prong
[03:07] collars and choke chains are used
[03:09] aggressively to suppress Behavior but
[03:12] one of the things we're trying to raise
[03:13] awareness about is the fact that there
[03:15] are so many side effects and there's
[03:17] nothing that can't be trained uh with
[03:20] positive reinforcement training and and
[03:23] the good thing about positive
[03:24] reinforcement training and responsible
[03:27] management of the dog's environment
[03:29] which is also lacking in this case um
[03:33] this really is what people need to
[03:35] because it doesn't have the side effects
[03:36] this is what more people need to be
[03:38] aware of you know there are probably as
[03:41] as she writes in her book this idea that
[03:44] maybe she finds all this conversation
[03:46] quite naive and thinks the hard choices
[03:48] are made you just don't understand what
[03:50] it's like I think she references Farm
[03:52] Life in particular and the idea of
[03:53] having to make tough decisions on farms
[03:55] in different parts of the country what
[03:57] do you make of that because um I'm sure
[03:59] there are people who are listening and
[04:00] thinking it's a dog which is certainly
[04:03] not my opinion of the matter but what do
[04:05] you say to people who look at this issue
[04:07] and think that we're being
[04:14] naive I think we're losing I think I I
[04:16] think I think I just blew his mind with
[04:17] that question the idea the idea that
[04:19] someone would think it's naive I look
[04:21] enough said that he was saying he has no
[04:22] words for what I've just said you cannot
[04:24] respond to that thought process I guess
[04:26] I understand it's I mean Zach George
[04:28] thank you for joining us sorry that we
[04:30] couldn't finish that interview but we
[04:32] had some technical difficulty at the end
[04:34] but what I wanted to say there was I
[04:37] have to wonder if it is not considered a
[04:41] crime to shoot a dog in South Dakota I
[04:43] don't I don't know there I know in most
[04:46] parts of the country that I'm aware of
[04:47] I'm under the impression it is
[04:49] considered animal cruelty she almost
[04:52] makes it clear that she does it as an in
[04:54] the- moment decision even if we are
[04:57] dealing with a serious case of
[04:59] aggression here that doesn't make sense
[05:01] behavioral euthanasia may be an option
[05:03] for some dogs uh from what I heard here
[05:07] that wasn't necessarily the case there
[05:08] was a failure to control the environment
[05:10] and as I mentioned in the video she was
[05:12] using aversive dog training methods
[05:14] which are clearly correlated with
[05:15] increased aggression you know I'm not
[05:17] saying that's definitely what happened
[05:19] here but it is definitely a known cause
[05:22] of increased aggression in dogs so this
[05:26] to me is shocking it you would expect
[05:29] someone if they we're going to tell this
[05:30] story to to be more reverent about it uh
[05:34] but to
[05:37] celebrate this and to portray this as an
[05:40] act of courage and that's why you should
[05:43] vote for me and keep me in office in
[05:45] South Dakota if I'm a citizen of South
[05:47] Dakota I'm going to insist on an
[05:51] investigation here to understand if this
[05:54] was legal or not I mean we can start
[05:56] there so I think it would really speak
[05:59] volume if the appropriate authorities
[06:01] looked into the matter and investigated
[06:03] it in South Dakota for a start but what
[06:05] do you all think tell me in the comments
[06:08] below

[02:35] Cutting Edge artificial intelligence to
[02:38] detect to learn about your dog it

[00:08] treats a moment ago now he's not we're
[00:10] going to go over how to teach our dogs
[00:12] to come to us whenever we call them
[00:14] regardless of what kind of dog you have
[00:16] generally when you're introducing come
[00:18] when called to your dog you want to do
[00:19] it in a place that they're very familiar
[00:21] with like your house which we've kind of
[00:22] been working on informally but today
[00:24] we've come out to a mediumly busy Park
[00:27] in order to do this no matter what kind
[00:29] of dog you have when you want to work
[00:30] with them in new places like the public
[00:32] you're going to need treats and toys for
[00:34] them that actually grab their attention
[00:38] bark is really Innovative in this area
[00:40] and they come up with some of the
[00:41] wildest craziest designs so your dog
[00:43] never gets bored but for those of you
[00:45] who find unpredictable incredible toys
[00:47] to be a little too much I want to assure
[00:50] you that they have some very normal toys
[00:52] too bark boxes for your everyday normal
[00:54] dog who loves awesome toys and Munchies
[00:57] I mean treats and if your dog really
[00:59] needs their toys to be ultra tough and
[01:01] durable super chewers for you even
[01:04] Bark's most normal toys have the most
[01:06] enticing details for dogs like different
[01:09] textures squeaks lots of interactive
[01:11] features which is great for their mental
[01:13] stimulation having the best toys and the
[01:15] best streats that's going to give you a
[01:17] super head start for training all of you
[01:19] can get a free extra box when you sign
[01:20] up for a bark box or super chewer Box by
[01:23] using my special link barkbox.com doog
[01:26] trining and superchewer.com doog trining
[01:28] links below now where were we that real
[01:32] life leave it needs some work see that I
[01:34] can see right away that's going to be
[01:35] part of my challenge we can't be eating
[01:36] stuff off the ground sir that's what he
[01:38] had in his mouth and there's a bunch of
[01:40] it it's just old gross dead grass that's
[01:42] been cut leave it so you can see how one
[01:45] lesson Builds on the next you don't need
[01:47] to correct your dog you can communicate
[01:48] with them and it's a much richer
[01:50] experience good man there come the eyes
[01:52] automatically up to me I want to
[01:54] reinforce yes must mean something leave
[01:57] it attention up here yes
[02:00] good man and now we're going to move
[02:02] away from the distraction here okay come
[02:06] on good man and there's our first formal
[02:09] come when called do you see how look at
[02:12] me evolved into come when called here a
[02:15] lot of things just happened in that
[02:17] exchange we had to practice leave it
[02:19] which was something you don't associate
[02:21] with come called necessarily then
[02:23] attention that's a separate skill and
[02:25] then running to me the actual come when
[02:28] called how did I get him to run to me
[02:30] did you notice my excited energy I was
[02:32] enthusiastic about requesting his
[02:34] presence over here and when he got to me
[02:36] what did I do if you're really trying to
[02:38] make a point to your dog pay them one of
[02:40] the best ways to guarantee that your dog
[02:43] is extremely likely to come to you when
[02:45] you call them is to avoid missing
[02:47] opportunities in other words don't be
[02:48] lazy about reinforcement if you're
[02:50] serious about training your puppy to
[02:51] listen you should have a few treats on
[02:53] you at all times most people will see
[02:55] really good results with this within
[02:57] days but I strongly recommend reinforce
[02:59] forcing things like come and stay
[03:02] especially with treats with toys with
[03:04] environment whatever it is that your dog
[03:05] likes for the first two years of their
[03:07] life to really burn it in there so they
[03:09] really understand stay means stay and
[03:12] come means come it's a good question if
[03:14] you're wondering if this will make you
[03:15] Reliance on Treats they're going to
[03:18] learn that sometimes you don't have
[03:19] treats and sometimes you do but if they
[03:21] think there's a good chance that you
[03:22] have treats that's likely to be all of
[03:25] the motivation you need to bridge the
[03:26] gap from treats to few or no treat
[03:30] there has to be an interim step where
[03:32] your dog is like I'm probably going to
[03:34] get a treat I might get a treat oh I
[03:37] didn't get treats yesterday but maybe
[03:38] I'll get them now do you know what I'm
[03:40] saying that's kind of the mindset you
[03:42] want them to think and if you cut that
[03:43] Supply off too early you're missing out
[03:45] on so many wonderful reinforcement
[03:47] opportunities for them to generalize
[03:49] this skill in the real world but we know
[03:51] he has more than one currency he likes
[03:53] to play fetch sometimes let's see if we
[03:55] can use that to build on his recall
[03:57] talents just like in the living room
[03:59] right but outside it's tougher we got
[04:01] grass we got smells all kinds of things
[04:04] this is just how I do fetch training
[04:06] It's a combination of getting them into
[04:07] the toy playing some tug throwing it
[04:09] when you're playing fetch you're
[04:10] essentially capturing a
[04:13] recall good man come for many dogs this
[04:17] is your plan a if they like to play this
[04:20] kills so many birds with one stone not
[04:22] only are you exercising you're building
[04:24] a bond you're playing with your dog
[04:25] you're teaching them how to come to you
[04:27] you're giving them a good Outlet I mean
[04:29] you know know done in the right
[04:31] proportions fetch can be very beneficial
[04:33] for your training in my view let
[04:38] go let go is the part he needs SP with
[04:40] remember we Define fetch as chasing a
[04:43] toy in a straight line just like that
[04:47] picking it up immediately returning in a
[04:49] straight line come on let's go yes
[04:53] promptly Letting Go which we need to
[04:55] work on and eagerly awaiting the next
[04:58] throw which we have we got to zoom in on
[05:00] that let go now's not the time cuz he's
[05:02] on a roll right now so I'll just wait
[05:06] him out yes you're not going to train
[05:07] everything at once but boy you can train
[05:09] a lot where does this myth come from
[05:11] that positive reinforcement takes longer
[05:13] it is not true I've had this dog a few
[05:16] days now watch this let
[05:18] go good here can you sit yes okay go
[05:25] it's over there so that was the first
[05:27] instance where I had him earn a throw
[05:31] now we can use that as currency I asked
[05:33] him to sit I said yes and I tossed the
[05:35] toy that he loves good
[05:38] man let's do it one more time I don't
[05:40] want to get in the habit of asking him
[05:41] to do too much for fetch cuz it's more
[05:44] important that we keep that drive up so
[05:45] we can get that energy out on our terms
[05:47] and schedule moving forward yes sit and
[05:52] okay good
[05:54] man and go Shades a puppy we're going to
[05:57] be very conservative with vigorous
[05:58] exercise especially with him being a
[06:00] large breed puppy very good we've been
[06:03] using a lead the whole time here a very
[06:05] generous lead a logical question would
[06:07] be all right when can I lose that lead
[06:08] and just know my dog's going to come to
[06:09] me once your dog is reliable in a
[06:11] variety of places that's the time that
[06:13] you start working on off leash training
[06:15] the way that I do this is practicing in
[06:18] Secure fenced areas that my dog is not
[06:21] familiar with the idea with that is to
[06:24] simulate off leash training he's
[06:26] noticing a dog over here that's got his
[06:28] attention look at at his body language
[06:30] look at the straight tail pointing up
[06:33] yes I love
[06:37] that right now this is great behavior
[06:39] I'm very happy to let him look at this
[06:41] dog while he sits right now that is just
[06:43] fine with me he's not lunging at the dog
[06:46] the dog is in motion this makes it
[06:49] ve going to stop him right there this is
[06:52] management no need to scold a dog yes
[06:56] good man the second his attention broke
[06:58] and I had him on me that's when I can
[07:00] show him what to do all that was needed
[07:02] there was just simply preventing him
[07:03] from advancing so walking this balance
[07:05] between letting your dog explore and
[07:07] understand their world while also
[07:09] holding them to the standard of
[07:10] listening to you when you ask for their
[07:12] attention is the line that we must walk
[07:15] you should be asking yourself all the
[07:17] time is this management or is this
[07:20] training training is when you're
[07:22] actively working with your dog and
[07:24] proactively working on changing their
[07:25] future Behavior but when you're managing
[07:28] them it's important to understand that
[07:30] you're not exactly training them had a
[07:33] pedestrian walking by did you see how I
[07:35] managed in that case no need to yank
[07:36] yank you just manage you're not going to
[07:39] change their future behavior in those
[07:41] moments so if you find yourself relying
[07:42] too much on managing your dog to prevent
[07:45] them from doing things take that as your
[07:47] cue to set aside time for some proactive
[07:49] training sessions to help your dog
[07:52] understand your expectations better
[07:54] stopping the behavior immediately no
[07:56] correction required he started to
[07:58] advance and I prevented him from
[08:00] advancing forward I consider that
[08:02] management uh-oh right there management
[08:05] had to go in his mouth and take it
[08:07] because I wasn't controlling the
[08:08] environment well enough but now what I
[08:10] do is I train see this leave it I was
[08:15] able to stop The Unwanted Behavior
[08:17] immediately while still being Humane and
[08:21] keeping him in a good mood which is
[08:23] Paramount come on I'm going to try and
[08:25] get a few extra feet while he's
[08:26] following me here you see that and I'm
[08:28] relying heavily on making sounds like or
[08:31] even a little whistle yes to get his
[08:35] attention and then encouraging him with
[08:37] my mannerisms to come to me now you can
[08:39] do that in a variety of ways running
[08:41] away from your dog is highly effective
[08:43] for a lot of dogs you can smack the
[08:45] ground you can make a high-pitched voice
[08:47] you could dance good man and just kind
[08:49] of be animated I can get excited these
[08:52] are just some ways to get your dog
[08:54] enjoying the process and coming to you
[08:56] now of course we don't do this forever
[08:57] we refine that over the coming days and
[08:59] weeks in order to get a more proper hey
[09:02] come here yes come now I'm saying come
[09:05] to him when he comes to me right now not
[09:08] before he comes cuz he doesn't know what
[09:10] it means now that we've gotten a couple
[09:11] of successes I want to take a break and
[09:13] let shade explore some more I'd like to
[09:15] just kind of wander around the field
[09:17] because his experiences in this setting
[09:19] are equally as important as teaching him
[09:21] how to come when called so I don't want
[09:23] to just drill him over and over the
[09:25] environment is understandably very
[09:27] distracting for him so if you got to be
[09:29] fair and let him take it all in too it
[09:32] can't be overstated that this sniffing
[09:34] he's doing right now is extremely
[09:35] intense and he's very inexperienced in
[09:38] the world so letting him take those
[09:40] smells in remember dogs have a
[09:42] completely different world that they see
[09:44] with their nose trying to keep the lead
[09:46] very loose so he feels liberated to
[09:48] explore safely on his own terms good M
[09:51] yes he just sniffed this and didn't pick
[09:54] it up does he care about treats right
[09:56] now I don't think so he was taking
[09:57] treats a moment ago now he's not that
[09:59] doesn't mean that we can't train though
[10:02] because he's not interested in treats
[10:03] right now what is he interested in the
[10:05] environment so he did something good by
[10:08] leaving the grass clot alone let's let
[10:10] him continue to explore the environment
[10:12] yes can signal a lot of different things
[10:14] we got a dog right there look at that
[10:16] let me see if I can entice shade to come
[10:20] to me even with that distraction close
[10:22] by good man yeah all right I think he's
[10:25] starting to get it and he even ran past
[10:27] some of those grass clouds that's what
[10:29] what I call progress here he is looking
[10:31] at a dog leaning on me indicates that
[10:34] he's comfortable not seeing reactive
[10:36] Tendencies out of him this is one way
[10:39] with many dogs to reduce the likelihood
[10:41] of reactive Behavior you'll know with my
[10:43] own dog inertia she was quite reactive
[10:45] as a young dog and so we had to work on
[10:47] that it's a spectrum you know some dogs
[10:49] Express themselves differently than
[10:50] other dogs so so far I haven't had a
[10:53] single failure at no point has he said
[10:54] no I'm not going to come to you that is
[10:56] very much by Design if you look at our
[10:58] prior videos you've been witnessing the
[11:00] Rapport that shade and I have been
[11:01] building with one another and he has
[11:04] learned that it is a good idea to listen
[11:06] to me because life is great when he does
[11:08] in the early stages avoid calling your
[11:11] dog unless you think that they're really
[11:13] likely to come to you you want to build
[11:14] the habit of them coming to you by
[11:16] setting them up for as many successful
[11:18] repetitions as you can and rewarding
[11:21] your dog whenever they do the right
[11:22] thing Bri do you have a good shot of him
[11:24] looking around right now checking out
[11:26] the environment and do you see how he's
[11:27] periodically looking at me
[11:29] so what
[11:33] yes he thought about it for a second he
[11:36] was like I don't know that's more
[11:37] interesting over there but I was able to
[11:39] pull him in with my enthusiasm and zero
[11:41] Force if you're not able to find any
[11:43] times when you feel that your dog is
[11:45] likely to come when you call that's a
[11:47] big sign that you're probably in an
[11:49] environment that's too challenging for
[11:52] them at their current skill level so try
[11:54] practicing some more inside of your
[11:55] house first or in other areas where
[11:57] they're less likely to be distra Ed so
[11:59] that they can understand the behavior
[12:01] better yes sir and I love the Trot for
[12:03] him that's fast so I like the urgency
[12:06] with which he has coming to me he's not
[12:08] just like looking around he's not
[12:10] intimidated by anything he seems to be
[12:12] enjoying himself see this leave it
[12:15] everything we've taught him so far is
[12:17] being used for this lesson there's
[12:19] poison mushrooms there this is a real
[12:21] mushroom there's a bunch of them right
[12:23] here leave it I can't let him get that
[12:26] that could be poisonous roll I know
[12:27] leave it this is how you teach your to
[12:30] alone in not just in your living room if
[12:32] you're new to training dogs in your mind
[12:34] you're probably thinking okay how do I
[12:35] train this one thing if you try to focus
[12:37] on only one thing in a training lesson
[12:39] sometimes that's going to be
[12:40] counterproductive so even though the
[12:41] emphasis of my lesson today was come
[12:43] when called we did socialization we did
[12:45] some real life leave it training that's
[12:48] why we do a series like this where we
[12:49] show you how we train the dog absolutely

[00:56] sdog tring links below during these
[00:58] adjustment periods with your dog pay
[01:00] attention to things like their tail and
[01:02] their eyes and where they're looking and
[01:03] what they're staring at and especially
[01:05] that nose cuz they're getting all kinds
[01:07] of information with that nose now you
[01:09] remember in our last lesson we were
[01:10] focused on come when called but we kind
[01:12] of planted the seed for some of this
[01:14] leash training we had a 30ft lead
[01:16] remember that today I've got a 10-ft
[01:17] lead so it's a little bit shorter there
[01:19] are some prerequisites if you're trying
[01:20] to get the most out of your leash
[01:22] training I'm going to ask for his
[01:23] attention now he's lied down so that's
[01:25] good here yes okay
[01:30] we got
[01:31] come sit stay look at me okay good man
[01:38] those are the kind of skills that I like
[01:39] to see I like to see that they can
[01:40] generally look at you when you ask even
[01:42] if it's in exchange for a treat remember
[01:44] he's still quite young so he's still
[01:45] learning so you can see how we're
[01:46] starting to put the pieces together here
[01:48] Isn't that cool these are the building
[01:50] blocks in many respects of successful
[01:52] lease training we're likely to encounter
[01:54] things on the ground let's make sure his
[01:56] leave it is looking good as well yes
[01:58] leave it look at me combo we're in in
[02:00] good shape buddy he's not always
[02:01] interested in the treat right now cuz
[02:03] this is a new place and that's okay but
[02:05] I really want to take cues from him as
[02:08] to what he's feeling like and work
[02:09] within his current mindset to the best
[02:12] of my ability when I stop yes he's got a
[02:15] really good stop automatically I don't
[02:17] want to lose that and he's taking treats
[02:19] again oh
[02:21] yes good man all right now that was
[02:24] significant one thing I'm doing with him
[02:26] is I'm trying to condition him that when
[02:28] he gets tension on a leash when he pulls
[02:30] ahead I'm actually going to say yes to
[02:34] pair that with a treat so he comes back
[02:36] to the treat in other words we're
[02:37] conditioning them that who tension means
[02:39] oh I better get back there and get that
[02:41] amazing treat you're transforming
[02:42] something that's traditionally negative
[02:44] tension on the leash something that is
[02:46] not fun for the dog into something that
[02:49] is fun returning to you getting a treat
[02:52] and continuing on with the walk so we're
[02:54] trying to condition that emotional
[02:56] response to be more optimistic as we
[02:58] continue to walk and do leash training
[03:00] okay and so just going back and forth
[03:03] getting him in the habit of paying
[03:04] attention to me
[03:06] W all right good man let's go this way
[03:12] good
[03:19] here I'm trying to avoid minimal tension
[03:22] what do we do when there's tension we're
[03:24] going to
[03:25] say yes he's a little distracted right
[03:29] now and I don't want him going in
[03:30] people's yard let me see if I can call
[03:32] him hey
[03:34] yes it's great and again yes fine we'll
[03:39] just keep moving the environment can
[03:41] serve as a reward too to your dog
[03:43] continued exploration of the environment
[03:45] can really serve as his reinforcement
[03:48] instead of a treat in this instance
[03:50] since this seems to be of higher value
[03:52] to him in this particular moment when he
[03:54] does turn out to be 100 plus PBS if we
[03:57] do need to physically guide him we want
[03:58] him to be okay with that and enjoy that
[04:00] process in other words we don't want to
[04:02] use it as an aversive we don't want it
[04:04] to feel unpleasant but normal much like
[04:07] you would with a child if you were
[04:08] guiding them throughout lessons like
[04:10] this I'm always looking for those micro
[04:12] behaviors just little indications that
[04:14] he's advancing to the correct goal so
[04:17] even just looking up at me or moving
[04:19] along with me I want to really
[04:20] acknowledge those things give him some
[04:22] encouragement he doesn't have to be
[04:24] perfect to get acknowledgements so by
[04:26] giving your dog those Clues he saying
[04:28] hey I like that they start to
[04:30] comb a lot of these Bic behaviors into
[04:33] more impressive skill like taking Ace
[04:35] walk with you is so helpful because it
[04:37] really simulates the actual multitasking
[04:40] that will be required of your dog as
[04:42] they take walks throughout their life
[04:44] yes there we go that's what I'm looking
[04:46] for that is a magic moment right there
[04:48] so we had Sit Stay release look at me
[04:51] okay follow me he's staying right now
[04:54] yes sir that is what I'm talking about
[04:57] that was a pretty Snappy response
[04:59] sometimes his response isn't that Snappy
[05:01] watch this right here shade so you want
[05:03] to be prepared for some latency yes I
[05:06] gave him a yes as the head turned now
[05:09] over time we can work on making that
[05:10] response time faster all these little
[05:12] things that we take for granted the wind
[05:14] blowing the smells in the air the Little
[05:16] Critters walking around the dogs barking
[05:18] behind fences these are all things that
[05:20] are going to likely catch many dogs
[05:22] attention a big pink garbage can for
[05:25] example so it's important to let them
[05:28] experience the because the more that
[05:30] they do experience and become non
[05:33] impactful in their life the more those
[05:35] things kind of Fade Into the background
[05:37] just like they do with us and we're like
[05:38] okay cool there's a tree not going to
[05:41] obsess over that thing the thing that
[05:42] throws off most new people to training
[05:44] are what we call thresholds where
[05:46] they're just too distracted to pay
[05:48] attention they're not interested in the
[05:49] treats you have the only thing they're
[05:51] interested in is probably something in
[05:53] their environments or it could be
[05:55] because they're super scared so they're
[05:57] over their threshold there's a lot of
[05:59] emotional states that dogs can be in
[06:01] where it makes training very difficult
[06:03] that's why it is so important to be
[06:04] cognizant of their underlying emotional
[06:07] state so that we can create behavior
[06:09] from the inside outward you can see he's
[06:12] kind of on the edge of his threshold a
[06:15] little bit right here to where it's hard
[06:17] to communicate with him in the ways that
[06:18] we've been doing yes there was just that
[06:22] Twitch in my direction at which time I
[06:25] was like oh I got them let's keep the
[06:26] walk moving pain discomfort and fear are
[06:28] common training tools by problematic dog
[06:31] trainers and that is something we want
[06:32] to avoid that's why we're using a
[06:34] harness we really just have that as a
[06:35] safety net it's not a communication tool
[06:38] that throws a lot of people off who are
[06:39] more familiar with traditional dog
[06:41] training where you communicate with them
[06:43] through a collar yes so watch look at
[06:46] this look at that turn yeah man the
[06:49] environment is still new but we're
[06:51] familiarizing it we're going in slow
[06:53] motion rather than say covering just a
[06:56] three mile stretch for introductory
[06:57] lessons I like to keep it on a
[06:59] relatively short track we have
[07:01] pedestrians approaching us this is bound
[07:04] to get his attention he's trying to
[07:05] gather information about these
[07:07] pedestrians remember fine line here
[07:09] between training and being fair to shade
[07:12] by encouraging him to observe his
[07:14] surroundings good man there you go well
[07:17] done see you got to walk that like I
[07:20] could have been like no keep coming keep
[07:21] coming I gave him a little bit of a
[07:23] moment check them
[07:25] out good man no treat necessary there
[07:29] there he's very very into his
[07:32] surroundings right now as being the
[07:33] thing that's reinforcing or interesting
[07:36] to him right now I think all of this is
[07:38] perfectly acceptable First Neighborhood
[07:41] walk leas training
[07:43] acceptable in fact I think he's getting
[07:45] an A plus what do you think train two
[07:47] minutes at a time here in your living
[07:49] room cuz you could do this very leash
[07:51] training in your living room if you
[07:52] wanted to as well at first you've seen
[07:54] me work with a lot of different dogs on
[07:57] leash lessons over the years from
[07:58] puppies who were just like ah pulling
[08:01] really fast or larger stronger dogs or
[08:04] German Shepherd dogs and they're all a
[08:06] little different we have one dog there
[08:08] one over here he's a little thrown but
[08:10] we've got him under threshold still in
[08:12] real time we've been doing this about a
[08:13] half hour he's starting to become more
[08:16] relaxed the street is becoming more
[08:18] familiar the scents are becoming more
[08:21] familiar as well yeah oh I mean he's
[08:23] just doing great I would be yesing him
[08:26] more right now but I can tell he's more
[08:28] interested in his surrounding I don't
[08:29] want to distract him from that by trying
[08:31] to force him to take a treat or anything
[08:34] he's stopping and resuming very natural
[08:36] behavior this is what we mean when we're
[08:38] talking about teaching our dog how to
[08:40] make decisions on their own without
[08:42] being told every move to make or being
[08:44] corrected for every time they pull on
[08:46] the leash oh we got some wind now look
[08:48] at this look at all these leaves whoa oh
[08:50] boy so right there he's pulling towards
[08:51] the leaves I'm going to wait for him to
[08:53] check in with
[08:55] me okay good man I got a little load
[08:59] just to make make him just to be a
[09:00] little bit more inviting to him if
[09:02] you're able to do that that can be that
[09:04] can be helpful you can see here he
[09:06] really likes this stick that's something
[09:07] we need to work on you can't be eating
[09:10] sticks
[09:11] guy leave
[09:14] it yes good
[09:18] man there's a look at this going into
[09:20] the heel here
[09:22] stopping he's a prodigy probably going
[09:25] to give him some play time right now
[09:26] just to give him some opportunity to get
[09:29] the brain chemicals flowing after a
[09:31] training session get him nice and tired
[09:33] for his afternoon nap just going to do
[09:34] some short fetch here make sure we got
[09:36] the fundamentals in this new place
[09:38] practice in places that you want your
[09:40] dog to listen to you in like public
[09:42] parks for example which is where we
[09:45] are good man love him love him yes
[09:50] that's let go his let go has been
[09:55] great good man see it's not just enough
[09:58] to get your dog
[09:59] to perform a physical Behavior it's
[10:01] really important that you're maintaining
[10:03] their inner spirit and their emotions
[10:06] and their zest for life does he promptly
[10:08] let go yes eagerly awaits the next throw
[10:11] I'd say so I couldn't be happier with
[10:13] today's training session I hope this

How do you socialize & get your dog to pay attention no matter what? Here's what I do! Thank you BARK for sponsoring the Dog Training Revolution! Get DOUBLE your first box: https://barkbox.com/zakdouble & https://superchewer.com/zakdouble

Socializing is one of the most important things you can do with a new puppy or dog. And it’s much more than just introducing them to other dogs and people! Here’s how to socialize your dog in a busy environment so they don't get overwhelmed. You can use this process with your new dog or any dog who needs some help learning how to be good in public around people, other dogs, sounds, cars, bikes, planes, trains, wild animals, and anything else you can think of. What is your dog interested in when they go out in public? What distracts them? Will they pay attention to you when you ask no matter what is going on around them?

TRANSCRIPTION:

[00:00] socialization in dog training isn't just
[00:02] about letting your dog meet new people
[00:04] and new dogs it's a really deliberate
[00:06] and thoughtful process that introduces
[00:08] them to different environments sights
[00:10] and sounds proper socialization helps
[00:12] dogs navigate life with confidence and
[00:15] understanding often when I come to a
[00:17] place like this especially with a puppy
[00:18] for the first time I'm just going to let
[00:20] them exist and do species specific
[00:23] activity like sniff the air watch
[00:25] passers by I want him to feel liberated
[00:27] to explore his environment you can see
[00:30] an immediate difference in his demeanor
[00:31] too he's aware that we are not in the
[00:34] place that we once were I'm also trying
[00:36] to get him to love it here and want to
[00:38] be here and not find it to be too
[00:41] threatening or intimidating or scary I
[00:44] wanted to feel normal to him I really
[00:46] think out these socialization sessions
[00:48] that are specific to the dog that I'm
[00:50] working with I make sure to pack a few
[00:52] supplies now there's no need to go
[00:53] overboard but I always try to have an
[00:55] awesome toy or two and of course tried
[00:57] andrue training treats I get new toys
[00:59] and treats every month from BarkBox and
[01:01] super chewer so when you're ready to
[01:02] train you always have what you need
[01:03] BarkBox is for just about every dog and
[01:06] super chewer is for those dogs who need
[01:08] Ultra tough toys sometimes I like to
[01:11] bring one of these super chewer toys
[01:13] with some frozen peanut butter if I know
[01:15] that I'm going to need to give a dog
[01:16] something to do for a while if you want
[01:18] to get double your first box whether
[01:20] your dog is a super chewer or a BarkBox
[01:23] dog sign up at my special link
[01:24] barkbox.com Zack double and
[01:28] super.com Zack double I'll have links
[01:30] below this is a textbook introduction to
[01:33] socialization for a puppy park if I've
[01:36] ever seen one there's a fair amount of
[01:37] dogs low traffic fair amount of people
[01:40] bikes roller blades and we have this
[01:42] great field that gives us a way to
[01:44] create some distance from all of that
[01:46] excitement on the Walking path making
[01:48] sure that you have the option to create
[01:50] distance is key for a really great
[01:53] socialization location this allows for
[01:56] controlled exposure so you don't just
[01:58] flood your dog with a lot of stimuli
[02:00] that can overwhelm them this park also
[02:02] has a good amount of wildlife that's
[02:04] something that we need to prepare him
[02:05] for not just moose and bears but birds
[02:08] and ducks and what other animals do they
[02:10] have up here there's also a lot of
[02:11] different textures and terrains for him
[02:13] to walk on out here even here you have
[02:15] three distinct surfaces you have the
[02:18] paved path a gravel path and grass
[02:21] there's a train in the background did
[02:22] you hear that look at him he notices
[02:25] it
[02:27] Plum yeah good man let him check it out
[02:31] then we let him diffuse and guess what
[02:33] go ahead and sniff those Kibbles out
[02:35] even though the emphasis is
[02:36] socialization you should still use
[02:38] positive reinforcement methods to help
[02:40] you create positive association with all
[02:44] of the things around your dog yeah man
[02:47] but what if your puppy isn't receptive
[02:49] to treats this happens that's okay just
[02:51] trying to condition him to the sounds
[02:53] focus on giving them time to take in the
[02:55] world for now and that'll help them be
[02:57] able to give you their attention more
[02:59] easily in the future I'm really pleased
[03:01] with how well he's adjusting out here
[03:03] the more he can process his environment
[03:05] rather than being told what to do the
[03:07] better so far shade is curious he's
[03:10] cautious but he's comfortable my focus
[03:13] here isn't to get him to walk around or
[03:15] explore before he's ready we want to
[03:17] avoid overwhelming him and just let him
[03:20] observe this world as he likes for now
[03:22] and look there's plenty to see like here
[03:24] comes a dog on The Walking path nearby
[03:26] real curious to see how he reacts when
[03:28] he catches wind of this dog right there
[03:30] there it is good man I'm going to let
[03:33] him look at the dog there is no
[03:34] interrupting him shade seems pretty
[03:36] comfortable here at this distance and
[03:37] one way you can tell is because he's not
[03:39] trying to create any more distance
[03:41] himself either by moving away or even
[03:43] lunging or barking our goal when we're
[03:45] socializing dogs should be to create
[03:47] good experiences at distances where our
[03:50] dogs feel relatively calm and confident
[03:54] right now it's just more prime directive
[03:55] good
[03:57] man hey watch this watch what I'm going
[03:59] to do do when he breaks his Focus
[04:01] naturally I'm going to yes him and see
[04:03] if he wants a treat just for
[04:06] fun watching his nose right now though
[04:08] I'm letting him sniff letting him look
[04:11] the dog is go yes that just happened
[04:14] want yeah and he's taking treats
[04:16] indicating that he's at a an appropriate
[04:19] Comfort level when your dog doesn't want
[04:21] treats that they typically like that's a
[04:23] sign that they might be feeling a little
[04:25] overwhelmed maybe a little bit uneasy
[04:27] and that's okay check that out you don't
[04:30] have to use treats right now if your dog
[04:32] would rather just focus on the world
[04:34] around them treats are optional here I'm
[04:36] choosing to do it because I'm trying to
[04:38] surround calm Behavior with feel-good
[04:41] stuff like treats for him just to get
[04:43] that Association going for good measure
[04:45] he's looking at a dog right now what I'm
[04:47] going to do with shade is let him look
[04:49] at the dog and when he disengages from
[04:51] the dog I'm going to say yes I'm going
[04:52] to give him a treat to let him know hey
[04:53] I like it when you disengage and don't
[04:55] obsess too much with dogs that's the
[04:57] right move and we do this so we can
[04:58] encourage polite behavior in the future
[05:00] yes I'm allowing him to look when he
[05:03] disengages then I can encourage him to
[05:05] come to me right now he's struggling a
[05:06] little yes good man and that leash
[05:10] pressure lesson we did the other day
[05:12] seems to really be coming in handy he
[05:14] doesn't freak out when there's tension
[05:17] on the harness yes good man so this is
[05:20] the idea we're trying to keep our dogs
[05:21] comfortable during the training process
[05:23] not make them do something because I
[05:25] said so oh we even have another dog over
[05:27] here look at that cute dog I'm I'm
[05:29] watching shade right now he's using his
[05:31] nose letting him check out the dog but
[05:33] if he tries to go towards the
[05:35] dog I will good man
[05:39] yes all right did you see how he turned
[05:42] towards me when I said yes I love that
[05:44] do you want it you're a good man I can't
[05:48] really tell has he
[05:50] disengaged okay yeah he's really giving
[05:52] a he's really looking at this dog
[05:54] studying this dog I mean that's an
[05:55] unusual looking dog In
[05:58] fairness good man man they're both
[06:00] actually staring at each other yes there
[06:03] was the disengagement if you're really
[06:05] paying close attention to the emotional
[06:06] state of the dog while you're
[06:08] socializing them while you're training
[06:09] them you're going to get to know your
[06:10] dog really well and that's going to make
[06:14] all of your training easier
[06:16] socialization is really about
[06:18] normalization normalization of the world
[06:20] good
[06:22] man yes see the ears did you see them go
[06:26] back when I said yes paying attention to
[06:29] your dogs ears is a great way to tune in
[06:31] to what they're thinking and feeling
[06:32] when I just said yes you could see his
[06:34] ears go back towards me there he's
[06:36] getting to know what that word means
[06:38] pretty well well done sir you're doing
[06:40] great very good another important thing
[06:43] to pay attention to is their nose right
[06:45] now he's just looking at people that are
[06:47] walking behind the camera sniffing
[06:49] gathering information I'm just really
[06:51] into his nose right now I love watching
[06:53] it work it's almost as good as looking
[06:55] into a dog's eyes when you get to know
[06:57] their nose it's almost like getting to
[06:58] know a dog's eyes which tell you so much
[07:01] have you ever thought of it like that
[07:03] good man yes and you know what if he
[07:06] wants to use that nose I'm also going to
[07:07] give them another healthy Outlet
[07:09] scattering kibble or treats in the grass
[07:11] is another great way to give your dog a
[07:13] natural Outlet if they love to sniff
[07:15] we've been out here for a little while
[07:17] and shade seems like he's pretty
[07:18] adjusted now but let's just see how
[07:20] adjusted he actually is we're going to
[07:22] test some of his training we're going to
[07:23] see how well it sticks out here in this
[07:26] brand new environment that he's never
[07:27] been to I don't have any expectations of
[07:29] shade here and if he isn't responsive I
[07:31] would just let it go and go back to
[07:33] letting him look and sniff around at his
[07:35] own pace you don't want to rush your dog
[07:38] giving them time to take in things now
[07:41] is going to save you lots of time in the
[07:43] future when you think your dog might be
[07:47] ready to give you their attention you
[07:49] can see if they're able to do any of the
[07:50] training you've already worked on at
[07:52] home yes that's what I call trading he
[07:55] went into a Sit okay good man yes we
[07:59] have dogs in the background now let's
[08:01] see yes you know what I'm GNA play some
[08:05] yes game here yes when he looks up to me
[08:08] what are we doing we're creating oh I
[08:09] see a dog yes I get that thing let me
[08:12] pay attention to that guy who gives me
[08:14] that thing that barking dog in the
[08:16] background is not lost on him yes well
[08:20] would you look at that I didn't ask for
[08:22] his attention at all as time goes on we
[08:24] would do less and less treats it become
[08:26] second nature to dogs you need to
[08:27] reinforce periodically of course but
[08:29] those are learning laws that apply to
[08:31] all animals that's true of every life
[08:33] form on Earth we just changed our
[08:34] environment a little bit and you can see
[08:36] how he's like wo this is a different
[08:38] perspective even a minor change in
[08:40] location by human standards can feel
[08:43] like a huge change from a dog's
[08:45] perspective stop and look be
[08:48] understanding as your dog responds to
[08:50] what might seem like minor changes in
[08:53] their surroundings get
[08:55] comfortable there's a lot to take in you
[08:58] want to be very conscious of of the
[08:59] surroundings and how they affect your
[09:01] dog he is acting different even though
[09:04] we're just a few feet away from where we
[09:06] were all right let's move on we're just
[09:09] going to keep going no treat this
[09:12] time look at this he's right into the
[09:14] frisbee out here come on good
[09:17] man
[09:19] yeah yes and what is yes equal here a
[09:23] game of tug some engagement some fun
[09:27] time yes just signifies something that
[09:30] you're really into at that moment is
[09:32] about to happen whatever that thing is
[09:34] could be continued sniffing time some
[09:36] tug or a treat how's that let go working
[09:38] out with him I'm just going to make the
[09:40] Frisbee boring and I hope he just lets
[09:42] go and then I'm going to roll it
[09:49] yes dog walking by has his attention all
[09:52] right yeah good man see how we just
[09:55] abandoned fetch right there in exchange
[09:57] for going back back to hey you look
[10:00] confused let's create distance just so
[10:02] that you know how to do that in this
[10:03] low-key situation so that we have that
[10:05] option in the future I hope you notice
[10:07] the flexibility we have in these types
[10:10] of outings you really have to kind of go
[10:12] with what your dog is feeling and where
[10:14] you can get the most gains in terms of
[10:17] progress whether it be in socialization
[10:19] whether it be listening to you in public
[10:21] whether it be teaching your dog how to
[10:23] play around distractions even though
[10:25] there wasn't a ton of exercise or motion
[10:27] here that was still highly stimulating
[10:29] for him and so those types of
[10:30] stimulations really go into their
[10:32] cognitive piggy bank as he goes to sleep
[10:35] here in a little while he's going to
[10:37] process all of that as he's asleep and

[00:00] how do force-free trainers stop unwanted
[00:02] Behavior how do they get dogs to stop
[00:04] without telling them no if I'm teaching
[00:06] a dog that I do not want them to do
[00:08] something how can I teach them how to
[00:10] stop doing that thing without telling
[00:13] them no or physically intervening first
[00:15] off it's fine to tell your dog no you
[00:18] need to feel liberated to communicate
[00:20] with your dog in a way that is natural
[00:21] to you modern trainers have really found
[00:24] a way that keeps their emotions high and
[00:26] enthusiastic about working with you and
[00:29] that doesn't hold you back back in your
[00:30] training efforts I have examples today
[00:32] that I want to cover these are those
[00:34] real moments that happen in real life
[00:36] outside of planned training sessions and
[00:39] these are situations that I think most
[00:41] people would be tempted to say no and
[00:43] physically stop their dogs and
[00:45] understandably so the goal of training
[00:47] dogs when I work with them is to teach
[00:49] them how to think from the inside out so
[00:52] I'm going to show you exactly what I do
[00:55] instead part of training a dog is having
[00:57] the right tools and right supplies to
[00:59] train them you're going to see me using
[01:00] a few different toys and treats today
[01:03] all of them are from bark when you sign
[01:04] up for a monthly box from bark you'll
[01:06] get a fresh set of training treats and
[01:07] durable one-of-a-kind toys that your dog
[01:10] will love BarkBox toys are for every dog
[01:13] and super chewer toys those are for
[01:15] those dogs that really need those extra
[01:17] tough toys when you sign up using my
[01:19] special links you're going to get an
[01:21] entire additional box for free I'll have
[01:23] those links in the description below now
[01:25] it looks like I better get to my first
[01:26] example because shade is not wasting any
[01:29] time hey Zach look what's happening
[01:31] let's take this first example where
[01:33] shade is doing a very natural thing he's
[01:36] chewing on my shoes of course that's not
[01:39] really in anyone's best interest but it
[01:41] is a natural behavior now I think most
[01:44] people would say no and maybe even scold
[01:46] their dog for chewing something that's
[01:48] valuable after all nobody wants their
[01:50] dog to chew things up that have value it
[01:53] is completely understandable and normal
[01:55] to be frustrated but what I see here is
[01:59] an opportunity to teach a dog 10 seconds
[02:02] at a time to learn something new and to
[02:04] listen to us here are the things I need
[02:06] to accomplish in short order in this
[02:08] situation first I've got to get his
[02:09] attention here then I have to ask him to
[02:12] come to me
[02:14] come after all if he's coming to me he
[02:17] can't be chewing on the shoes at the
[02:19] same time now watch I'm not done I'm not
[02:21] done I'm going to put these Out Of Reach
[02:24] still not done I'm going to give him
[02:26] something to chew on of similar texture
[02:29] I still have to make make sure he's able
[02:30] to meet his needs of chewing on
[02:32] something he's a puppy and he's teething
[02:34] that was like 8 Seconds of training
[02:36] right there it provided an example of
[02:38] leave something alone pay attention to
[02:40] me and let me give you something else to
[02:43] do that is acceptable when we're
[02:44] training dogs the goal is to be ultra
[02:47] efficient and to make real progress with
[02:49] our dogs without having to become
[02:50] reliant on physically interacting with
[02:53] them to do what we want them to do not
[02:54] necessarily because it's inhumane or
[02:56] something but because we want to give
[02:58] them the chance to think through their
[03:00] actions that's where the deepest
[03:02] learning occurs positive reinforcement
[03:04] training does not take longer next let's
[03:06] take this counter surfing moment you
[03:08] smell food up there apparently shade
[03:10] moments ago just became tall enough to
[03:13] reach the counter so what's a practical
[03:15] way to stop this well if you've been
[03:16] doing your basic training with your dog
[03:19] start to trust that communication you
[03:21] got barking you got him jumping on the
[03:22] counter watch how he Aid this without
[03:25] touching him hey okay come again the
[03:28] goal is to teach our dogs to think for
[03:29] From the Inside Out not make them behave
[03:32] from the outside in so I resist the urge
[03:35] to physically get shade down does that
[03:37] mean he will never do that again no here
[03:39] he is 5 seconds later doing the same
[03:41] thing so look look this is the power of
[03:43] force free trading right here hey shade
[03:46] come
[03:47] here there's no treat there's no lore
[03:50] sit what a good man that's great do you
[03:53] see how we can intervene without without
[03:55] forcing at
[03:56] all now he's still excited I'm going to
[03:58] give him a treat in a second but I'm
[04:00] trying to also work in the idea that
[04:03] treats sometimes come and sometimes
[04:05] don't but again we want to reinforce the
[04:07] idea that paying attention to us is one
[04:10] of the most valuable things he can do
[04:12] okay fine what if you've got a cone
[04:13] Corso jumping on you even humping your
[04:16] leg surely then you've got to make them
[04:18] stop by pushing them off of you and
[04:20] possibly correcting them now in this
[04:22] case there's not much wrong with
[04:23] physically aiding your dog down but
[04:25] because I'm able to I'm going to choose
[04:27] not to touch him to show you what I do
[04:29] in instead look at this he's starting
[04:31] you can't do that you could assist them
[04:32] off of you here but I'm trying to make a
[04:34] point I was able to get his attention on
[04:36] me ask him to stop hold a sit and a stay
[04:39] for a second so that I could reinforce
[04:41] the behavior that I do want to see okay
[04:43] I could tell he's going to break cuz we
[04:44] have a neighbor's dog who's barking
[04:46] right now the issue many professionals
[04:48] have with relying on the word no is that
[04:51] it's not very specific so some have this
[04:54] expectation that no means to stop
[04:57] something general and this can leave
[04:59] dogs confused about what you actually
[05:01] want them to do so instead we provide
[05:04] them an alternative Behavior like C or
[05:06] look up at me and sit and stay when
[05:09] they're jumping or counter surfing this
[05:11] approach not only immediately interrupts
[05:14] The Unwanted Behavior but it also gives
[05:16] you the chance to reinforce and seal in
[05:19] the desired action without the lack of
[05:22] clarity and clunkiness when we simply
[05:25] say no and physically make our dog do
[05:28] something make sense keep in mind that
[05:30] once the reinforcement seems to reliably
[05:32] ensure the behavior that you're looking
[05:34] for over time and not that much time
[05:37] provided you're very consistent that's
[05:39] when we can start to really start
[05:40] reducing rewards one request he's still
[05:43] leaving it he's really starting to
[05:45] understand yes and we always need to be
[05:47] careful to periodically reinforce even
[05:49] with some of the most reliable behaviors
[05:51] so that those good habits Don't Drift
[05:53] Away stay now ideally in the future
[05:57] you'll get to know your dog so well and
[05:59] you you'll be one step ahead of them and
[06:01] be able to interfere before they start
[06:03] chewing jumping counter surfing or
[06:05] barking by doing this you'll be able to
[06:07] successfully interrupt even before a lot
[06:10] of these things happen in the first
[06:11] place an ounce of prevention is worth a
[06:14] pound of cure I've saved one of the best
[06:17] examples for last typically most of us
[06:19] would consider it an urgent situation if
[06:22] we had a dog barking and trying to jump
[06:23] through our screen
[06:25] door here watch this look at that good
[06:29] man upon our first request we were
[06:33] immediately able to interrupt shade and
[06:35] ask him to return I didn't have to
[06:37] startle shade I didn't have to put him
[06:39] in a bad mood by scolding him with our
[06:41] voice and instead I have him
[06:43] enthusiastically come running to me sit
[06:45] and pay attention to me and receive his
[06:47] well-earned reward the point of training
[06:50] like this is to deescalate moments of
[06:52] excitement out of your dog Your Instinct
[06:54] might be to say no go over get your dog
[06:57] to stop close the door pull down the
[06:58] blinds what whatever it is and those
[07:00] aren't bad ideas if you can summon the
[07:02] in discipline to draw on your dog's
[07:04] skills put it together you've taught
[07:06] look at me you've taught come you've
[07:08] taught sit and stay once you have those
[07:11] kinds of tools when you assemble all of
[07:14] these things together you're able to
[07:16] communicate resolutions to various
[07:18] behavior problems much more efficiently
[07:20] easily and more pleasurably for your dog
[07:23] it might seem insignificant to consider
[07:25] how your dog responds emotionally to
[07:27] your mood and words but myob job as a
[07:29] dog trainer is to make sure that you
[07:31] have as little friction and as few side
[07:34] effects and issues as possible when
[07:36] you're training your dog it's important
[07:37] to understand that in dog training when
[07:39] we talk about how to teach dogs to stop
[07:41] things without telling them no we're not
[07:44] talking about emergency situations if a
[07:46] dog was pulling into the road or a fight
[07:48] was breaking out you do what you have to
[07:50] do to intervene even if that means
[07:52] physically stopping them but the
[07:54] critical point is that this is an
[07:56] emergency situation this isn't
[07:58] considered training you would not rely
[08:00] on setting up these potentially
[08:02] dangerous situations to get your dog to
[08:05] internalize New Concepts like listening
[08:07] to you on come and stay or whatever but
[08:09] when we're actually taking the effort to
[08:11] communicate with our dogs we have the
[08:13] environment set up appropriately for
[08:15] them I would challenge you to see how
[08:17] far you can go in showing your dog what
[08:20] you want them to do instead of what not
[08:23] to do in as fluid and efficient a manner
[08:26] as possible if you want to know which
[08:27] toys and treats I love in this video I
[08:29] used exclusively bark productss so a
[08:32] monthly Bark Box or super chewer box
[08:34] with a little bit of knowhow can get you
[08:36] a super trained dog click thumbs up

Description:
Uncovering the biggest lie in dog training with Dr. Eduardo Fernandez 🤯 Our friend Eddie is a distinguished researcher and educator in animal behavior and welfare. So, obviously we invited him for this in-depth conversation where we examine the evolution of ethical dog training practices by comparing the traditional LIMA framework with his innovative LIFE model.

⚠️ Read the LIFE paper here: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1558787823001430

LIMA stands for "Least Intrusive, Minimally Aversive". We'll break down what LIMA really is, its origins, and why it has been a cornerstone of force-free training. We'll also discuss its limitations, including why it was created and the original intentions behind it, and particularly its allowance for aversive techniques under certain conditions. 

Dr. Fernandez has introduced the LIFE (Least Inhibitive, Functionally Effective) model, a forward-thinking approach that prioritizes animal welfare by focusing on increasing meaningful choices and addressing behaviors by understanding their function, instead of just suppressing them. LIFE challenges the norms of dog training by moving away from outdated methods and focusing on what truly benefits the dog’s - and the handler's - well-being.

We discuss the ethical implications of using aversive tools like shock collars, the problematic nature of negative reinforcement, and why it’s crucial to shift towards reward-based methods. Dr. Fernandez shares his candid thoughts on why certain training methods should be left behind and how LIFE offers a more humane and effective alternative.

You'll learn how the principles of LIFE can actually be applied in various training scenarios, from working with your own dog at home to managing behaviors in zoo animals like polar bears — without the use of fear or pain.

This episode is essential for anyone interested in dog training, whether you’re a seasoned professional or a dedicated new dog guardian. If you’re curious about the future of ethical training practices and want to learn how to improve your approach, this conversation will provide you with the insights you need. By the end of this video you WILL have a dramatically more profound understanding of how - and why - dog training really works!

[00:26] we are joined by one of the most
[00:29] influential figures in the field of
[00:31] Animal Welfare science Dr Eduardo
[00:34] Fernandez's groundbreaking research has
[00:37] reshaped the way both professionals and
[00:39] Guardians approach teaching and raising
[00:42] their animals in this episode we dive
[00:45] into a broad range of relevant critical
[00:48] topics to our field these topics touch
[00:50] on the very heart of animal training for
[00:53] example we're going to explore the use
[00:54] of aversive methods and their long-term
[00:56] implications some fascinating moments in
[00:58] the history of training and discuss and
[01:01] speculate on some of the significant
[01:03] barriers that still stand in the way of
[01:05] the adoption of Humane dog training
[01:07] methods Dr Fernandez is going to shed
[01:10] light on different Frameworks that are
[01:13] used in the dog training field today
[01:15] like lima which you'll learn more about
[01:18] and we'll explore his published work on
[01:20] the life model we're going to talk about
[01:22] some of the most common questions and
[01:24] common misconceptions in the field of
[01:26] professional dog training including the
[01:27] very popular myth that positive
[01:29] reinforcement related methodologies
[01:32] don't work on all dogs as Dr Fernandez
[01:34] approaches his Milestone of 50 published
[01:37] works it is clear that he is a driving
[01:39] force for positive change in this field
[01:42] Dr Fernandez is currently the senior
[01:44] lecturer in applied animal behavior and
[01:46] Welfare and program director for the
[01:49] animal behavior program at the
[01:51] University of Adelaide School of animal
[01:53] and veterinary sciences so without
[01:55] further Ado please enjoy this
[01:57] enlightening discussion with Dr
[01:59] Fernandez leave your questions and
[02:01] comments as you watch this in-depth
[02:04] discussion Dr Eduardo Fernandez you are
[02:07] a Ware scientist yes is that your title
[02:10] y give us a quick overview of what a
[02:13] welfare scientist is through the lens of
[02:16] you know dog training given that that's
[02:17] what we have an interest on over here
[02:20] when we think about Animal Welfare we're
[02:22] talking about improving the lives of
[02:24] animals um that's really the focus of it
[02:27] and typically that means some
[02:29] quantitative approach to uh trying to
[02:33] measuring to assessing and improving the
[02:35] lives of of animals under our care so
[02:39] that's under any setting whether we're
[02:42] talking about homes shelters zoos uh
[02:46] production animals we can talk about
[02:48] various different settings where the
[02:50] welfare Sciences are applied so most
[02:54] what welfare science when we tie that so
[02:56] that's kind of a general idea of animal
[02:58] welfare and when we tie the science end
[03:00] of that the welfare science I've already
[03:02] alluded to that a little bit we're
[03:04] talking about applying some metrics now
[03:06] so something to assess the current state
[03:10] of that animal's life their welfare and
[03:13] then finding ways to improve that that
[03:18] State uh for the animal typically that's
[03:21] done quantitatively so we measure uh
[03:24] what they're what the animal's
[03:26] doing uh whether that be physiologically
[03:29] or behaviorally um how they're
[03:31] interacting with us can can be part of
[03:34] what contributes to that what we use to
[03:36] measure that and then we find things
[03:39] that we introduce and we compare
[03:41] differences so that's the assessment and
[03:43] the Improvement those are the typically
[03:46] the two components in our community
[03:48] online on Instagram on YouTube we've
[03:49] been having a lot of discussions on the
[03:51] idea of whether or not aversive dog
[03:53] training methods should be used on the
[03:56] public dogs particularly by professional
[04:00] dog trainers um and I'm gonna I want to
[04:03] have you talk about limo which we'll
[04:04] Define in a moment but I just wanted to
[04:06] give a loose example of aversive just so
[04:09] everyone kind of knows what we're
[04:10] talking about it's kind of an unusual
[04:12] word for some people anything unpleasant
[04:14] emotionally or physically that is used
[04:17] to decrease an unwanted behavior and
[04:20] examples might include verbal reprimands
[04:22] pushing an animal into a position like
[04:24] Alpha rolls dominance Downs threatening
[04:27] body language Shaker cans spray bottles
[04:30] citronella collars leash Corrections
[04:32] choke prong and shot collars um is that
[04:35] kind of a for purposes of our discussion
[04:37] about WR or would you say differently we
[04:39] can describe it as something that's
[04:42] unpleasant uh for the individual so
[04:47] human or non-human alike um so I often
[04:50] use the term individual more to more
[04:53] broadly uh rather than saying human or
[04:55] nonhuman I like saying individual
[04:57] because when we're talking about an
[04:59] animal or a person we mean an individual
[05:02] right um so something that's unpleasant
[05:05] for the individual from the individual's
[05:06] perspective or something that an
[05:09] individual may work to escape or avoid
[05:12] uh is often another way that aversives
[05:15] are described the latter part um more uh
[05:19] starts to get at some of the functional
[05:21] component the effect on uh the behavior
[05:25] of the individual and now we're starting
[05:27] to get into some of what would describe
[05:30] a Punisher but aversives are often used
[05:33] with the intent of being potential
[05:36] punishers um or are themselves punishers
[05:40] once we show that effect throughout most
[05:42] of the 20th century you know we see
[05:45] these outdated methods of using
[05:46] heavy-handed methods on dogs and then
[05:49] it's you know been progressively getting
[05:51] arguably I guess a little bit better
[05:54] over the years where trainers are more
[05:56] conscious of aversive dog training
[05:59] methods right um and so I'm going to
[06:02] have you talk about the acronym least
[06:05] intrusive minimally aversive this is
[06:07] kind of been a framework for lack of a
[06:10] better turn that many Trainers haveing
[06:12] for the last couple of decades it's
[06:14] worth mentioning a little bit about the
[06:16] history of training and animal training
[06:19] and and it's also uh a lot of I guess I
[06:22] should mention a lot of the weal I I
[06:24] happen to be a welfare scientist who
[06:25] also spend a lot of time talking about
[06:28] animal training Behavior change
[06:30] procedures I'm a learning theorist on
[06:32] top of everything else I come from a
[06:34] behavior analytic background um so uh
[06:38] and I happen to be an applied animal
[06:39] behaviorist who's also a behavior
[06:41] analyst among other things when we think
[06:44] about where the history of training I
[06:47] won't spend I mean training we have
[06:49] thousands and thousands of years of
[06:51] methods that have been described and uh
[06:55] detailed elsewhere um I won't go too
[06:58] much into that but when we think about
[07:00] reward-based training or or uh rein
[07:03] positive reinforcement Based training
[07:06] some different ways that this has been
[07:07] described it's a relatively new
[07:10] phenomenon in on the stage of of animal
[07:13] training I mean it's also been Loosely
[07:15] described or used in some way but it
[07:18] wasn't formally described until within
[07:21] the last century BF Skinner himself
[07:24] wrote an article called how to teach
[07:26] animals in
[07:27] 1951 where he first describe the concept
[07:31] of shaping and how positive
[07:33] reinforcement is used through
[07:34] differential reinforcement to uh shape
[07:38] Behavior so this is one of the first
[07:40] descript descriptions of how you can use
[07:44] positive
[07:45] reinforcement for Applied animal
[07:48] behavior change purposes so for animal
[07:50] training 1951 is when that was written
[07:53] at the same time some former students
[07:56] that worked with Skinner Keller and
[07:58] Maran breelan wrote an article that was
[08:00] an introduction to a new field that they
[08:02] called applied animal psychology so both
[08:05] those published in 1951 not that long
[08:08] ago and they're describing all the
[08:10] things they did and this stems back from
[08:12] stuff that Skinner and the breelands did
[08:15] working on a a project called project
[08:17] pigeon between 1941 and 1943 Skinner got
[08:22] the idea in 1940 so it was tied into
[08:24] World War II I we just watch Its
[08:27] Behavior a bit it's not doing anything
[08:29] in particular you
[08:31] see but I'm going to try to get it to do
[08:33] something suppose I shape up the
[08:37] behavior of making a complete turn so
[08:41] that's where we really see I mean again
[08:43] less than a century ago some of these
[08:46] ideas came into fruition came into being
[08:49] and the Breeland have this long career I
[08:53] mean they are the the founding founding
[08:58] father and mother of of modern animal
[09:01] training methods which has primarily
[09:03] been reward-based um the modern animal
[09:06] training movement they went on in 1955
[09:10] to start working with uh marine land in
[09:14] Florida and talking about using positive
[09:17] reinforcement these reward-based
[09:19] training techniques uh this is the
[09:22] breelands with doing for dolphin
[09:24] training uh for dolphin shows um and
[09:28] other marine mammals I guess I should
[09:29] mention too and that proliferated uh
[09:32] across to many other settings eventually
[09:36] got to Karen prior who was working in
[09:40] the 60s with train so she learned these
[09:43] methods from people that learned these
[09:45] methods from the breelands and went on
[09:48] to write a book called Don't Shoot the
[09:50] dog in the 1980s she had talked about
[09:53] her dolphin training experiences before
[09:55] that that again is another milestone in
[09:58] this big movie movement forward in
[10:01] talking about reward-based training
[10:04] methods so she talked about the power of
[10:07] positive reinforcement and I still
[10:09] consider don't shoot the dog I mean
[10:11] published what 1984 885 something mid
[10:14] 80s right there I I still consider that
[10:17] to be one of the best books for
[10:23] describing the things you can do with
[10:26] learning with using reward-based
[10:29] methods for all kinds of behavior with
[10:33] all kinds of individuals so people and
[10:36] animals alike that is not a technical
[10:39] book that is something that anybody can
[10:41] pick up and read and for anybody that's
[10:43] watching this that if they want to get a
[10:45] better understanding of General learning
[10:48] and training and behavior management I
[10:51] couldn't recommend a a book more than
[10:54] that book don't shoot the dog still to
[10:57] this decades later so that's I think the
[11:01] that's what we know about this really
[11:03] the modern movement this more formal
[11:06] movement of using reward-based training
[11:09] methods I agree with you on Don't Shoot
[11:11] the dog five stars yeah yeah no it's
[11:14] such a wonderful book as an
[11:15] undergraduate at University of Florida I
[11:18] had wonderful professors that taught me
[11:20] courses people like Tim Hackenberg and
[11:23] Hank Penny Packer who were Behavior
[11:25] analysts at University of Florida and I
[11:27] went on to spend
[11:29] uh a a couple years working as one of uh
[11:33] Hank Penny Packers uh he's a very
[11:36] well-known behavior analyst passed away
[11:38] in the last year um wonderful human my
[11:42] who I consider my undergraduate Mentor I
[11:45] think it was in one of his courses that
[11:47] we he it was part of the reading um that
[11:50] I got to read don't shoot the dog is I
[11:52] was learning about behavioral principles
[11:55] uh from some of these really wonderful
[11:58] Behavior analysts at University of
[12:00] Florida at that time and I went on to be
[12:02] one of Hank's managers for his Precision
[12:05] teaching course where we use these
[12:07] specific learning principles
[12:08] reward-based learning principles to get
[12:11] people to be to learn better to have a
[12:15] to retain more information so even in
[12:18] education how behavioral principles have
[12:20] been applied using these reward-based
[12:22] methods why didn't that change
[12:24] everything we have Innovations in the
[12:26] mid 20th century that really show us
[12:28] look there are methods we can use that
[12:32] don't require us to be unpleasant or
[12:34] painful or induce fear to dogs uh that
[12:37] can allow us to teach much more complex
[12:39] tasks that cater to their emotional
[12:41] state and and consider that at the very
[12:43] least what what happen I mean why are we
[12:46] still using aversive methods decades
[12:49] later yeah and I mean obviously this
[12:52] requires a bit of speculation on my part
[12:55] and and you know I'm I'm a I'm a bit of
[12:57] a quantitative guy so I get a little I
[13:01] get a little more careful about my
[13:03] speculation but I'm I'm certainly happy
[13:05] to share my
[13:06] ideas um so what I should mention the
[13:10] part is that is not speculative is that
[13:13] many of the early Behavior analysts many
[13:16] including uh BF Skinner himself wrote
[13:19] book after book where he said Society is
[13:23] too reliant on the use of aversives on
[13:26] the use of coercion there's another term
[13:28] that used describe that use of aversives
[13:32] and we know what we know now about these
[13:34] reward-based methods about positive
[13:36] reinforcement about shaping Etc uh
[13:39] Skinner even wrote a a fictional book
[13:43] about this this mini Society Walden 2
[13:46] where he talked about here's a society
[13:48] that uses reward-based methods to
[13:50] improve their society rather than just
[13:53] relying on all these aversives and
[13:55] coercion and Etc so Skinner spent a lot
[13:58] of time writing extensively in books
[14:01] like about
[14:03] behaviorism uh Reflections on behavior
[14:05] in society W in two even that fictional
[14:08] take science and human behavior talking
[14:11] about the importance of applying these
[14:14] principles to improve Society so that's
[14:17] the guy who is who started and and is
[14:21] still very much considered the most
[14:24] important behavior
[14:25] analyst ever right so the founding
[14:28] father of behavior Anis anyone who's
[14:30] ever taken class for sure will know
[14:32] Skinner yeah yeah right his take was we
[14:35] should be doing these things in
[14:37] reward-based uh uh ways so why do we see
[14:43] the use of coersion and aversives and
[14:46] and by the way other Behavior analysts
[14:48] went on to write similar books and talk
[14:50] about this Murray Sidman another very
[14:53] well-known behavior analyst laboratory
[14:56] scientist uh who spent more more time
[14:59] than anyone else on the planet that has
[15:01] ever existed and possibly ever will
[15:04] exist studying negative reinforcements
[15:06] specifically and he went on so studying
[15:09] negative reinforcement and rats in the
[15:10] laboratory and using uh Concepts like
[15:13] Sidman avoidance which people still use
[15:16] to this day I mean it's named after him
[15:18] Murray Sidman went on to write a book
[15:20] corion and its Fallout all about the
[15:23] ways that Society uses coercion to his
[15:28] opinion ineffectively to try to change
[15:31] Behavior so uh ryant on punishment and
[15:35] negative reinforcement on aversives and
[15:37] coercion we've mentioned a couple
[15:39] technical terms there punishment and I I
[15:42] alluded to this before when I talked
[15:43] about what aversives are both these
[15:45] terms um Define a a contingency so some
[15:49] effect on Behavior really and uh that
[15:53] that makes it a functionally defined
[15:56] term and Punishment means that there's
[15:59] some aversive some stimulus we don't
[16:02] even need to necessarily call it an
[16:04] aversive but some consequence that is
[16:08] delivered that leads to a reduction in
[16:10] the future occurrence of those are
[16:13] similar behaviors so that's a bit of a I
[16:16] I'm I'm simplifying it a little bit but
[16:18] it's still that's pretty technical term
[16:21] so it means somebody does some behavior
[16:24] let's say my dog barks I yell at the dog
[16:28] and barking occurs Less in the future
[16:31] that would be described as punishment
[16:34] and the thing that I delivered the
[16:36] yelling that consequence would be the
[16:39] Punisher I guess we should say positive
[16:41] reinforcement would be the opposite of
[16:43] punishment in that sense because now
[16:45] we're talking about delivering a
[16:47] consequence and the aneson would be the
[16:50] thing that happens before the behavior
[16:51] so I might say sit and the dog sits and
[16:55] I say good and the dog is more likely to
[16:59] sit after I say sit in the future so now
[17:02] I've just described the three term
[17:04] contingency and that's the anos behavior
[17:08] in consequence or the
[17:10] ABCs of behavior and that and of really
[17:14] operant conditioning so we can get the
[17:17] opposite of those things we now have
[17:19] described positive punishment and
[17:21] positive reinforcement but we can
[17:23] equally describe negative reinforcement
[17:25] and negative punishment and this is what
[17:27] dog trainers sometimes refer to is the
[17:29] quadrants right which is an informal
[17:31] description but still a pretty good
[17:34] description itself to talk about the
[17:35] quadrants the negative means something's
[17:38] the consequence it's something that's
[17:40] being removed and then whether if it's
[17:43] reinforcement something's increasing if
[17:45] it's if it's punishment something's
[17:47] decreasing so in the case of negative
[17:50] reinforcement then we're talking about
[17:52] something being removed as a consequence
[17:56] that leads to an increase in the future
[17:58] urr of that behavior now people often
[18:01] mess this definition up because it is a
[18:03] little tricky it's understandable so
[18:05] people people often describe punishment
[18:08] as negative reinforcement or combine the
[18:11] two or say they see an aversive
[18:13] occurring and they say that's negative
[18:15] reinforcement but negative reinforcement
[18:17] means something's removed and we see an
[18:18] increase in the behavior the other
[18:21] problem that people run into is because
[18:23] they see there's something's increasing
[18:25] or they hear the term reinforcement
[18:27] they'll often presume something good is
[18:29] happening but uh in many cases the way
[18:34] that people are able to apply negative
[18:36] reinforcement is by contriving you
[18:40] delivering some contrived
[18:42] aversive that so they whatever it is
[18:45] this may be a correction um some it
[18:49] could be a shock a choke a pinch a lot
[18:52] of different potential aversives that
[18:54] they don't remove or they don't remove
[18:57] the threat of that
[18:59] aversive until they get the desired
[19:02] behavior and then they remove that
[19:04] threat even the use of something like a
[19:07] choke chain or prong collar for dog
[19:09] training we can talk about delivering a
[19:12] choker or pinch or or or some snap of
[19:16] that collar to punish some Behavior
[19:20] right so they're delivering that
[19:22] consequence and we get a reduction in
[19:25] that behavior but we can also talk about
[19:28] Rel relasing
[19:30] pressure uh from something like uh a
[19:34] collar or um or that includes releasing
[19:39] the threat of some potential choke or
[19:44] pinch or prong collar or shock being
[19:47] delivered so releasing the threat um by
[19:51] terminating those conditioned aversive
[19:54] stimuli and then that's what's used as
[19:57] the negative reinforcer and often people
[19:59] will describe that as negative
[20:01] reinforcement training but the reality
[20:04] is there's all these aversives including
[20:07] the threat of these aversives which are
[20:10] what would function as and I'll describe
[20:12] that here in a second as a conditioned
[20:14] aversive stimulus um so we have all
[20:18] these all these aversive stimuli and
[20:21] conditioned aversive stimuli that are
[20:23] being applied that are punishing a whole
[20:26] host of potential behaviors
[20:29] and then it's only that little bit the
[20:32] correct Behavior if you're doing using
[20:34] those training methods that you allow to
[20:36] occur that lead to that increase in that
[20:39] behavior so T if people are describing
[20:43] these and often gets described as as
[20:46] traditional or balanced training methods
[20:48] some of these things um if people are
[20:51] talking about what they're using in
[20:53] terms of the learning principles they
[20:55] would say well I use a lot of punishment
[20:57] and a little bit of negative
[20:59] reinforcement would be the accurate way
[21:01] to describe not to say oh I use negative
[21:03] reinforcement no no no you're using a
[21:05] lot of contrived aversives to uh and
[21:09] conditioned aversives to punish a lot of
[21:12] behavior and negatively reinforce a very
[21:15] little bit of behavior and then I
[21:16] mentioned conditioned aversive so I
[21:18] guess I should point that out that's
[21:20] really just anything that's paired with
[21:22] the aversive and that's why I often use
[21:24] the term things like threat which is
[21:26] also a term Murray Sidman talks about
[21:29] relevant to negative reinforcement in
[21:31] general and it's often the threat of an
[21:35] aversive and that though those are the
[21:37] things that we learn to avoid I often
[21:39] talk about this in terms of things like
[21:41] bullies at school so a bully doesn't
[21:44] walk up and punch everyone all the time
[21:48] often all they have to do is their
[21:50] presence becomes a conditioned diversive
[21:52] because it's been paired enough with the
[21:54] the punching or any anything else that
[21:57] they're doing or they might even just be
[21:59] able to walk up and go you know show a
[22:01] kid their fist or something like that
[22:04] and be able to control a lot of behavior
[22:07] that way through the use of these
[22:10] aversives um so those are all would all
[22:12] be considered conditioned aversives
[22:14] they've been paired with some unpleasant
[22:17] event yeah scientifically speaking I
[22:20] mean you can change Behavior through a
[22:21] variety of angles here including
[22:23] punishment including uh heavy hand
[22:26] methods what is so wrong with using a
[22:29] leash correction a choke or prong or a
[22:31] shock Coller either as negative
[22:33] reinforcement or uh or as punishment
[22:37] what why is that or should that be
[22:40] avoided and if so why or why not well
[22:42] one part that you were talking about
[22:44] before was why are these methods still
[22:46] so prevailing why do we still see people
[22:49] use them to try to change behavior and
[22:51] again that requires me to speculate a
[22:53] bit and I think it's just I I I think
[22:56] there's there's an intuitive sense that
[22:57] we learn pretty early on I mean when we
[23:01] deliver punishing uh uh consequences
[23:05] when they're effective punishers those
[23:08] actually we're getting rid of aversive
[23:11] events in our presence right so if a
[23:13] dog's barking if a child's crying if
[23:16] there's something that we don't like and
[23:19] we yell or Worse we do something in the
[23:24] presence of that it goes away so we just
[23:28] described what an aversive going away
[23:31] what effect that can have on Behavior as
[23:33] a consequence negative reinforcement so
[23:37] being able to make things go away that
[23:39] you don't want to turn off these
[23:43] potential aversives condition diverses
[23:45] can negatively reinforce our own
[23:47] behavior and our actions of doing those
[23:50] things that's part of why it persists um
[23:54] and there's thousands of years of people
[23:56] using these training methods to change
[24:00] Behavior Uh so and we have these
[24:03] descriptions thousands of years of
[24:05] descriptions of people talking about
[24:07] using these different punishing and
[24:09] negative reinforcing consequences to
[24:11] change behavior in one way or another
[24:14] but it's been in the last 80 70 80 years
[24:18] ago when we started to get these
[24:20] descriptions of using positive
[24:23] reinforcement to change Behavior instead
[24:26] so uh the the science of behavior has
[24:30] brought us something what I think of is
[24:32] better it's certainly more Humane
[24:35] certainly more ethical to be able to
[24:38] change Behavior but our actions haven't
[24:41] really caught up to the science of that
[24:43] quite as as as well um so it's you know
[24:47] we're we're a little we're a little slow
[24:49] to to catch up with that but we're
[24:51] getting better there are some measurable
[24:54] side effects of using aversive methods
[24:56] in many Cas like m trust and uh y fear
[25:01] anxiety things like that and yeah I
[25:04] guess the question I want I want people
[25:06] because I know a lot of people are
[25:07] wondering this they're like look I know
[25:08] if I throw that prong collar on the dog
[25:11] and I'm forceful enough with my
[25:12] correction they will stop pulling yes
[25:14] they may have they may be threatened
[25:17] that I'm going to do another pop and
[25:19] that's why they don't continue to pull
[25:22] but the dog is now walking fine so
[25:25] what's wrong I mean if they both work
[25:27] why would you want use positive re re
[25:28] enforcement over punishment the science
[25:30] is is catching up more and more on this
[25:34] uh it seems like every day just about
[25:36] now we're seeing more Publications come
[25:38] out about the effects uh of the use of
[25:42] aversives to change Behavior if we only
[25:45] focus on the change on in on the change
[25:48] on Behavior then as I like to point out
[25:51] punishment works right by definition
[25:55] punishment works by definition because
[25:57] punishment is
[25:58] defined as an effect if it didn't work
[26:01] we wouldn't call it punishment it's a
[26:03] functional effect it's that thing leads
[26:06] to a decrease in the behavior so if we
[26:08] only focus on the change and that's not
[26:10] to say it's more effective but it's just
[26:13] simply to say that punishment is
[26:15] described in this objective operational
[26:19] functional manner by its effect so it
[26:23] requires that we start to think about
[26:25] some of these other components about and
[26:29] that's where we're we've over the last
[26:30] couple decades we've been seeing more
[26:32] and more research and more and more uh
[26:35] Publications about this what effect does
[26:38] using some of these procedures so what
[26:41] effect is using aversive tools uh some
[26:44] of which we've mentioned already shot
[26:46] collars uh prong collars choke chains
[26:49] what effect do they have on uh the
[26:53] welfare of the animal the the the
[26:55] individual directly and then another
[26:58] critical component there is what effect
[27:01] do they have on our relationship with
[27:06] those individuals so what falls under
[27:09] the broader spectrum of human animal
[27:11] interactions so what's our relationship
[27:14] like with a human animal Bond uh with
[27:17] our with our dog with and we can talk
[27:19] about this under variety of different
[27:22] settings uh there there are welfare
[27:24] scientists like Paul Hemsworth who have
[27:26] talked about this in terms of
[27:28] Stockman in their relationship with
[27:30] cattle uh so looking at human animal
[27:33] interactions um even with production
[27:35] animals we can talk about it in zoos so
[27:38] uh people like Vicky mie and Jeff hosy
[27:41] and in fact they wrote a chapter for a
[27:43] book that I just had published it was
[27:45] edited talking about animal staff bonds
[27:48] so animal the animal staff relationship
[27:50] between Keepers uh and trainers and
[27:54] other staff in zoos and the animals they
[27:57] care for
[27:58] and we can certainly talk about it in
[28:00] terms of companion animals and there's a
[28:02] lot written about that about the
[28:05] relationship between uh a guardian and
[28:09] their pet so uh the relationship between
[28:12] Care staff and uh shelter animals so
[28:16] that's a whole other component so we
[28:18] have three different components to look
[28:20] at it's not just a change in
[28:22] Behavior not just the effect but also
[28:25] the impact on the welfare of the
[28:26] individual so that's a second component
[28:29] and the relationship between that
[28:32] individual and us and those latter two
[28:35] components are as I mentioned over the
[28:37] last couple decades where we're seeing
[28:38] more and more research and for those
[28:41] people that are that like to look at the
[28:43] the Publications they want to see what's
[28:45] out there I always recommend uh Dr zazzy
[28:49] Todd has a wonderful website she has
[28:51] this NeverEnding list and it keeps
[28:54] growing and growing of research that's
[28:57] been published on comparing different uh
[29:00] on on these comparing different methods
[29:02] including some of these
[29:04] traditional uh aversive tools aversive
[29:07] methods to reward-based methods and the
[29:11] effects on the individuals the effects
[29:12] on the relationships there's I I could
[29:15] go on and on in talking giving
[29:16] particular citations but I think it's
[29:18] easier for anyone watching this to just
[29:21] be able to go to to uh Dr zazzy Todd's
[29:24] website and look at that long list
[29:27] there's this growing body of evidence of
[29:29] the detrimental effects uh what what
[29:33] Marie Sidman would have called
[29:36] Fallout uh and so what these methods how
[29:39] they impact the individual their welfare
[29:42] and their relationship with us um and
[29:45] I'll just mention one of the uh papers
[29:49] itself oh Hanley I want to say 2020 we
[29:51] can throw that citation over there but
[29:54] they looked at some of the relationship
[29:57] uh and levels of aggression between Cat
[30:01] Guardians and their pet cats one of the
[30:03] things that they found was that cats
[30:07] this is this is correlational but still
[30:09] very relevant that the people that were
[30:12] more likely to use aversive methods with
[30:14] their cats things like spray bottles
[30:16] were also the ones more likely to have
[30:19] higher levels of aggression in their pet
[30:22] cats and that's obviously going to
[30:24] impact the relationship that an
[30:26] individual has with their cat so they're
[30:28] using more aversives and the cats are
[30:31] delivering more aversives back to their
[30:34] to their Guardians to their owners and
[30:36] so this yeah that really can get in the
[30:38] way so while both punishment and
[30:40] positive reinforcement can uh can change
[30:44] Behavior we don't see the Fallout it at
[30:47] least so far to the levels that we see
[30:49] with punishment in other words positive
[30:51] reinforcement doesn't contain the risks
[30:53] and they both can work so why not go
[30:55] with the one that doesn't have the host
[30:56] of risk and reality is we need more
[31:01] research uh particularly looking at
[31:04] doing some of these comparisons and more
[31:06] research is coming out so I think it's
[31:09] easy to default to uh people saying well
[31:13] yeah but we don't really know yet or
[31:15] yeah yeah yeah but but we need more so
[31:18] as I'm saying right now I'm saying we we
[31:19] need more research but as with any uh uh
[31:24] scientific field as with any body of
[31:26] research that we have
[31:28] uh that exists we use what we know and
[31:31] we're able to make statements about this
[31:33] is what we know right now and there is
[31:36] this growing overwhelming body of
[31:38] evidence that we're seeing lots of
[31:40] Fallout from the use of aversive methods
[31:43] and we're just getting down to more
[31:45] particulars about the questions we're
[31:46] asking but if somebody's saying yeah but
[31:49] I can use this method because we don't
[31:51] know about this this or that we know a
[31:53] lot at this point there's a growing body
[31:55] of evidence that there is particular
[31:58] Fallout that there is particular damage
[32:01] to be more clear of the use of aversive
[32:04] methods in uh particularly these these
[32:08] uh harsh aversive Tools in trying to
[32:11] change behavior in our companion animals
[32:14] but what do you say to the person who
[32:16] says look I think positive reinforcement
[32:18] is great but it's not for all dogs it's
[32:21] great if you have a dog that's
[32:22] predisposed for it but not my dog or not
[32:24] this dog who's attacking other people or
[32:27] pulling me down how how do you handle
[32:29] that are there things your your dog
[32:31] finds Pleasant CU if there are then you
[32:35] can find you have a potential positive
[32:39] reinforcer uh a a reward that you can
[32:42] deliver and that should be able to
[32:46] consecrate behavior in a way that will
[32:48] allow for an increase in that behavior
[32:50] and therefore effective change so this
[32:53] is I I I get I'm I'm empathetic to the
[32:57] fact that
[32:58] why people would think that I don't want
[33:00] to belittle that I I I'm empathetic to
[33:03] the plight of anyone that's struggling
[33:05] with these things and says I'm not
[33:06] finding anything that works I it this
[33:09] isn't effective I get that I get that
[33:12] it's tough I get um there are plenty
[33:16] plenty of situations I've gone into
[33:18] where I mean I I did some ostrich
[33:20] training of all things and if you want
[33:24] to I'm very empathetic to the plight of
[33:26] trying to find something that might work
[33:28] to get something going um so that's a
[33:32] also a a a shout out to some of my ratti
[33:35] people out there that might be listening
[33:37] um so ratites are great um so uh but I I
[33:43] get it uh I I I understand that but to
[33:47] say that positive reinforcement is just
[33:49] not going to be effective with this
[33:51] animal
[33:53] is categorically false that we can find
[33:57] things that are Pleasant for that animal
[34:01] that therefore should be able to work to
[34:04] effectively positively reinforce some
[34:08] response some class of responses some
[34:12] set of behaviors effectively so it's a
[34:15] little bit of this trial and error
[34:18] process itself to figure those things
[34:21] out and I think that's that's really
[34:23] what what it's about so and as we get
[34:25] better at identifying these things then
[34:28] we should uh I I think it's that's going
[34:30] to become a lot more clear I think I
[34:32] know what they mean like sometimes when
[34:34] a dog is over threshold they don't want
[34:35] to take treats sometimes it's about
[34:37] really working with your dog when
[34:38] they're in the appropriate mental state
[34:40] when you're really focused on the
[34:42] holistic raising of that dog I think
[34:44] that kind of sets them up a little bit
[34:46] better to be reinforced by something
[34:48] because they determine what's
[34:49] reinforcing it's not always treats it's
[34:52] not always toy sometimes it's
[34:55] environment yeah yeah yeah and that's a
[34:57] really really important Point too um
[35:00] critically important is that often when
[35:03] people hear this idea of using reward
[35:06] based or positive reinforcement based
[35:09] methods they say well you know I can't
[35:11] just go out there and use treats and
[35:14] it's but we're not talking about just
[35:16] food any
[35:19] consequence that an animal finds
[35:23] Pleasant at some level like we're
[35:25] defining this in terms of the effect the
[35:27] functional effect so all a positive
[35:30] reinforcer is is something that's been
[35:32] delivered as a consequence that leads to
[35:34] an increase in the future occurrence of
[35:37] that behavior right so anything can be a
[35:42] potential positive reinforcer and as we
[35:46] all experience every day there's lots of
[35:48] things throughout our day that's
[35:50] changing our Behavior through positive
[35:53] reinforcement so through all individuals
[35:56] are experienc ing this we're learning
[35:58] all the time we're changing our behavior
[36:00] all the time and hopefully a lot of that
[36:03] is happening through positive
[36:05] reinforcement because otherwise it
[36:07] sounds like it would be a pretty
[36:08] difficult experience it's a matter of
[36:11] starting to figure that out and and part
[36:14] of that comes from having these these
[36:17] accurate these better descriptions and
[36:19] better ways of assessing some of these
[36:21] things one of the things I've done with
[36:24] a a gosh a dozen plus different spe
[36:27] species I think close to two dozen
[36:29] species across a number of different
[36:31] settings actually on on at least three
[36:33] different continents um I've done what's
[36:36] called a preference assessment I've
[36:38] published a couple papers on doing
[36:40] preference assessments so even doing the
[36:42] the science of this but for just
[36:45] practice purposes where we've gone into
[36:47] some setting and said hey here's a
[36:50] simple preference assessment that you
[36:52] can run that will help you decide like
[36:55] okay pick a few different rewards that
[36:57] you might use and now we can present
[37:00] these against each other under a few
[37:03] minutes takes several minutes one little
[37:05] sheet of paper that I print out and I'm
[37:08] like okay just present these two items
[37:10] Circle which one they got do that 12
[37:12] times between these four items and now
[37:15] you have an actual Quantified effect of
[37:18] what they found what they preferred at
[37:21] that moment and there's actually a
[37:23] number of papers in including with
[37:25] animals Nicole Dory and lindsy mkam have
[37:27] have a paper they published 2015 or so
[37:30] where they showed that they asked
[37:32] Keepers what the animal what the animal
[37:36] would prefer and then they tested via
[37:38] preference assessment and they found
[37:40] that preference assessments were more
[37:42] accurate than the keepers so it's a nice
[37:45] little quantitative simple tool that can
[37:47] identify potential positive reinforcers
[37:50] for people that are struggling with
[37:53] finding potential rewards that's a
[37:55] GameChanger right yeah what would be an
[37:58] atome version that someone could do of
[38:00] that like because a lot of it is working
[38:03] with your dog when they're in the right
[38:04] mindset not just throwing them in the
[38:06] deep end and trying to work with or
[38:08] something right so what what's an at
[38:10] home version of that what do you
[38:11] recommend that people do in order to do
[38:13] that I think it's just stopping for a
[38:15] second looking at what's going on right
[38:18] saying okay I'm trying to do this it's
[38:20] not working and then just taking a
[38:23] second and going let me look at what's
[38:25] happening before and after
[38:27] and sometimes that's where having
[38:29] somebody else seeing what you're doing
[38:31] can help or or video recording what
[38:34] you're doing off and then going back and
[38:36] looking that and starting to think and
[38:39] try to break it down in terms of what
[38:41] happened right before what happened what
[38:44] was the behavior I'm interested in what
[38:45] happened right before that what did I
[38:48] what was the consequence and looking at
[38:50] it in terms of that again that ABC that
[38:53] three term contingency thinking about it
[38:55] that way can really help to start
[38:58] changing those things and if you're
[39:00] sitting there going well but I keep I'm
[39:02] I'm using all these different rewards
[39:04] they're not working you might start to
[39:05] see that pattern by taking a step back
[39:07] looking at that and then that's where
[39:11] you might be able to step in and say you
[39:13] know what here's a very simple thing I
[39:16] can do where I can it it looks like the
[39:18] rewards aren't working we're not
[39:21] actually positively reinforcing some
[39:23] Behavior it's not working and maybe it's
[39:26] the rewards so maybe I'll just test a
[39:28] few of these things and try it out and
[39:30] you could do that in a quantitative
[39:32] manner you can do that with a very
[39:34] simple data sheet that I've offered that
[39:36] I've given to plenty of people I've used
[39:38] this in workshops um really easy to use
[39:42] you can do it informally where you test
[39:44] a few different things under a few
[39:46] trials and then say oh wow and the other
[39:49] thing is that these things are always
[39:50] changing I know my tastes don't work
[39:52] that way I can't eat the same thing
[39:55] every day I can't do the same things
[39:58] that I find as pleasurable as as I did
[40:00] the day before even the hour before um
[40:04] they're all they're changing it
[40:05] different times of day different uh
[40:08] Seasons these things are not static
[40:11] right so they're constantly changing
[40:12] it's one of the other reasons why it's
[40:14] good to take a step back rather than
[40:15] just say well I know this is always
[40:17] going to work and it's just this right
[40:20] yeah that does i i that does work under
[40:23] a lot of situations for a lot of
[40:25] individuals
[40:27] but what about when it doesn't so how do
[40:29] you resolve that and that's part of what
[40:31] we're talking about what we're talking
[40:33] about right now is the dog will sit and
[40:36] listen and pay attention just fine in
[40:38] the living room but when I go to a park
[40:41] I now have a new environment i' I with
[40:45] the environment now which makes it very
[40:46] different and so I need to be cognizant
[40:48] of and maybe make things a little bit
[40:50] easier for the dog and not hold them to
[40:52] the same standard as much yeah we'll
[40:55] just let them observe and take in the
[40:57] environment even if they're just all
[40:59] over the place what do you what what are
[41:00] your thoughts on that that's a really
[41:02] important issue and you know that's
[41:04] something that in zoo environments
[41:07] people deal with this all the time
[41:08] because if you think about the majority
[41:10] of the training that you're seeing in
[41:12] these Zoo environments is often for it's
[41:14] husbandry training that's happening so
[41:17] when you're working with something like
[41:18] a sea lion a polar bear uh this uh zoo
[41:22] or aquarium environment it's often
[41:24] you're training them for some type of of
[41:27] everyday care or even Veterinary
[41:29] procedures so you might be training them
[41:32] for something like a blood draw or an
[41:34] eye check or mouth check procedures that
[41:38] themselves can be uh not pleasant for
[41:41] the animal but it's a necessary thing
[41:43] that it's part of this Veterinary
[41:44] procedure that will occur um that has to
[41:47] occur it's for the for the health right
[41:50] I mean who wants to have their blood
[41:51] drawn necessarily and now try asking you
[41:55] know a a 6,000 pound uh warus or
[41:59] elephant something like that so what
[42:02] happens in many of those cases is they
[42:05] overtrain under these conditions so they
[42:08] take very small steps we're going back
[42:10] to the shaping idea we use
[42:13] approximations you work your way through
[42:15] this so you don't just go in and say
[42:17] okay here's a needle jab it into the the
[42:21] hippo and expect everything to be super
[42:25] great it's a it can a long process of
[42:28] training so that they're willing to
[42:31] accept something like even the presence
[42:33] of the needle and some of these animals
[42:35] have this history where people have used
[42:38] uh aversive trading methods they've used
[42:41] grabbing the animal uh uh trying to uh
[42:45] use pressure in some way hold them using
[42:48] fear
[42:49] intimidation uh and so there may be that
[42:51] history that you've already got to deal
[42:53] with there may be some counter
[42:55] conditioning that may have to occur
[42:57] where you're just counter conditioning
[43:00] simply as I like to describe as
[43:02] reconditioning may have to take
[43:04] something like even the the presence of
[43:06] the veterinarian has become a condition
[43:09] diversive because every time they show
[43:11] up in the room something bad happens and
[43:14] we're talking about I this is done with
[43:16] polar bears with Australian sea lions
[43:20] with New Zealand fur fur seals um lots
[43:24] of just all this wonderful stuff that
[43:26] they're they're a able to do that they
[43:28] get voluntary participation of these
[43:31] animals coming up polar bears coming up
[43:34] and being willing to participate in
[43:37] these routine husbandry Veterinary Care
[43:39] procedures they don't get there
[43:41] overnight so they they work on that they
[43:44] work through these approximations over
[43:47] time so using the shaping procedure and
[43:51] they work up to things like here's the
[43:53] presence of the needle here's the I'm G
[43:56] to apply that without the needle
[43:59] actually going in so it might just be
[44:01] the the case of the needle with no
[44:03] actual needle part on it I'm using
[44:06] obviously very technical terms now you
[44:08] can tell I am not the uh person uh I'm
[44:11] not a veterinarian using the needles
[44:14] themselves I'm like the the plastic part
[44:15] and the needle part Ken Ramirez passed
[44:18] VP of training for Shed Aquarium
[44:21] consults though with them runs her prior
[44:23] Academy and their quicker training Expo
[44:26] Ken talks about overtraining you work in
[44:28] these settings that you overtrain them
[44:31] before you apply it under this other
[44:33] setting before it has to actually be
[44:34] implement it so if we start working with
[44:37] an animal and we're saying I'm training
[44:39] them to do this I'm looking at this
[44:41] Behavior change procedure under this
[44:44] condition and now I'm going to take them
[44:45] to a par where there's a whole bunch of
[44:47] distractions and all this stuff well we
[44:50] want to make sure that behavior is
[44:51] really well trained under this condition
[44:54] first so those are all some of the ways
[44:58] that we promote the success of these
[45:00] reward-based training methods that we
[45:02] can very easily see a breakdown if we're
[45:06] if if we don't take a step back and we
[45:08] think how are we doing this consistently
[45:11] systematically in a way that will
[45:14] prepare the animal and the individual
[45:17] then otherwise we might see the
[45:18] breakdown in those in those
[45:20] procedures um and and start to attribute
[45:23] that for other reasons oh see my rewards
[45:27] just don't work oh it's not working I
[45:30] can't do that with that but we already
[45:32] we know that it does work under those
[45:34] conditions and we've seen it there's
[45:36] plenty of examples there's plenty of
[45:38] published papers that show that it can
[45:40] work so now it's a matter of figuring
[45:42] out how it works for you so my
[45:45] understanding is the entire animal
[45:47] behavior science more or less Community
[45:50] has moved beyond the use verses we don't
[45:52] see them in zoos and Aquariums am I safe
[45:54] to say that yes I mean it
[45:57] accredited uh Zoo facilities for most
[46:00] zoos around the world there has been
[46:02] this
[46:02] consensus of moving toward and using as
[46:07] much reward-based training as possible
[46:10] so using as much positive reinforcement
[46:13] to change behavior and to get voluntary
[46:16] participation from the animals as much
[46:19] as possible so yeah yeah so I that's my
[46:22] little caveat that I threw on that
[46:23] though sure that makes sense and yeah I
[46:25] mean really and again just as a reminder
[46:27] I think when I'm using the word aversive
[46:28] I tend to mean a a negative pre-planned
[46:31] approach that's designed to change
[46:33] future behavior and so I hear what
[46:36] you're saying the fact that an animal is
[46:38] in an enclosure could arguably be
[46:40] considered aversive but I know you talk
[46:42] a lot about environmental enrichment too
[46:44] which is a whole maybe we can get to at
[46:46] some point in zoos and
[46:49] Aquariums these uh animals and by the
[46:52] way we're talking about these same
[46:53] methods applied in places one of the one
[46:55] of the uh we have here in South
[46:59] Australia um we have Adelaide Zoo and we
[47:02] have monardo Wildlife Park and when
[47:04] we're starting to develop some of our
[47:06] our future research studies is with the
[47:08] wildlife part these same methods are
[47:11] being applied where they're using these
[47:13] reward-based methods with these animals
[47:16] that are uh in these open environments
[47:20] they're still it would still count as an
[47:22] enclosure right but these are it's a
[47:25] wildlife part these are large um outdoor
[47:28] environments and the animals are called
[47:31] in uh asked to move to shift on command
[47:36] in many cases so same kind of thing that
[47:38] you see at San Diego Wildlife Park um
[47:41] also in Victoria near Melbourne out here
[47:44] in Australia uh so weab be uh wildlife
[47:48] park there so um we have many instances
[47:52] of this and these same methods are
[47:54] working with these animals that they're
[47:57] we're having them come so actually
[48:01] respond to the cues that we give so they
[48:05] come on command and we also will have
[48:09] them shift so move from these different
[48:12] areas on command and all done using
[48:14] reward-based
[48:15] methods um and I should I guess it's
[48:18] worth also pointing out for those that
[48:20] may not have been to uh a zoo that
[48:23] recently the modern Zoo has focused on
[48:26] building these large naturalistic
[48:28] exhibits so for any accredited facility
[48:31] that's typically what you see is Big
[48:33] areas and you call them in to work on
[48:36] these behaviors so it's not like we're
[48:38] talking about this animal has nowhere to
[48:40] go so they have to come over and the
[48:42] necessarily be involved in that
[48:44] procedure we're talking about being able
[48:47] to use these same methods under all
[48:49] those kind of conditions so I think that
[48:51] that's important yeah that's a really
[48:53] good point too because you're right I
[48:54] mean we we are seeing the wides adoption
[48:57] of these modern methods uh you know even
[49:00] with the environment itself at zoos and
[49:02] Aquariums and things like that where
[49:03] they're making more and more of an
[49:05] effort to cater to the animal's welfare
[49:07] because that creates a better experience
[49:09] for the animal and in our case with dogs
[49:11] a better experience I would say anyway
[49:13] for both the dog and the person so it's
[49:16] no longer the case necessarily that the
[49:19] animal has no choice but to interact
[49:21] with the human so they have options and
[49:24] their environment is considered yeah and
[49:26] choice is itself a relevant component of
[49:29] what we're trying to look at we so one
[49:32] of my uh she's an HDR student so doing
[49:36] her PhD with me who's about to start
[49:39] doing her PhD Kelly rust who is a a sea
[49:43] line past sea line trainer trainer in
[49:45] Mexico and here in Australia um we just
[49:48] published a paper along with Isabella
[49:50] CLE it's a scoping review of choice
[49:53] procedures used to improve welfare um
[49:56] and was surprising how few Studies have
[49:59] actually done a comparison looking
[50:01] specifically at choice but for those
[50:03] studies that do exist we see how
[50:05] important it is for the animal to be
[50:07] able to have that choice to uh to make
[50:11] some Choice be able to participate in
[50:13] some event how much that leads to a an
[50:17] improvement in their welfare across a
[50:19] variety of species so absolutely the
[50:22] ability of animals to be able to
[50:24] participate and that's one of the key
[50:26] identif in distinctions itself between
[50:29] reward-based methods and these the use
[50:31] of aversive tools or aversive methods
[50:34] itself is that under the reward-based
[50:37] you the use of these reward-based
[50:40] methods we're giving the animal the
[50:42] ability what some people might say is
[50:44] their the the their ability to
[50:47] voluntarily
[50:48] participate uh I tend to use
[50:51] descriptions like that we give them the
[50:54] we we're we're providing a choice
[50:57] um to engage in one Behavior versus the
[51:00] other and that's that's pretty important
[51:04] we're not that choice isn't that choice
[51:06] is removed from once you start using
[51:09] coercion once you start using aversives
[51:12] so it's I'm going to present the
[51:15] aversive and what is your choice you you
[51:20] to move away from the aversive you're
[51:22] not given that option other than to do
[51:25] something to turn this off
[51:27] right and we established earlier that
[51:28] can have negative side effects that are
[51:30] not in anyone's best interest
[51:32] um time there are alternatives available
[51:35] it sounds like so all all this to say
[51:38] that the animal behavior science
[51:42] Community has really dramatically moved
[51:45] Beyond a lot of these methods in many
[51:47] respects but when I look at the dog
[51:49] training profession we are very much as
[51:52] an industry it seems like a lot of dog
[51:54] trainers are still attached to
[51:57] I guess what I would call an outdated
[51:58] standard I'll let you use your
[52:00] commentary of using the least intrusive
[52:03] minimally aversive meaning I don't want
[52:05] to use aversives but if I have to and
[52:08] nothing else works I will I I get it I
[52:11] mean I think we've we've talked about
[52:13] reasons why people would be relying on
[52:15] aversive by doing something like yelling
[52:17] or engaging in some aversive towards
[52:20] another individual you often turn off
[52:23] that aversive right so it can be
[52:25] negatively reinforced in for you I'm
[52:27] empathetic to the plate of just wanting
[52:30] something to go away wanting to focus on
[52:33] I just want to stop that I just want to
[52:34] get rid of that I get that I I get that
[52:37] at every level not just for the the
[52:39] owner the guardian but also for the
[52:42] trainer so it's understandable we will
[52:45] continue to see that right because it
[52:47] can especially in the short term
[52:50] temporarily stop certain things what
[52:53] effect it has in the long term well we
[52:56] don't was no um but from a at least in
[52:59] the short term we can get a a reprieve
[53:02] from something I I was surprised as I
[53:05] looked I've looked into this issue a lot
[53:07] more in the last few years to find that
[53:10] This Acronym of least intrusive
[53:12] minimally aversive is largely a standard
[53:15] by many dog trainers but it doesn't
[53:17] exist or does it exist anywhere else in
[53:19] the behavior science Community outside
[53:21] of this profession I've not been
[53:23] successful in finding it but maybe you
[53:25] have yeah
[53:27] yeah not really I mean it is so it was
[53:30] Stephen Lindsay who uh he had talked
[53:34] about a little bit prior to 2005 but
[53:37] it's really his handbook and dog
[53:39] training methods that that 2005 text
[53:42] where he described the concept of Lima
[53:46] so least intrusive minimally aversive in
[53:50] my article uh talking about Lima and my
[53:54] alternative proposed model model for
[53:57] describing these ethical animal training
[53:59] procedures or Force free procedures
[54:03] reward-based procedures I talk a bit
[54:05] about that and some of what Lindsay used
[54:07] to describe that that's why we see it in
[54:10] dog training right so we see that um
[54:13] it's something that was that that's been
[54:15] described as such in the dog training
[54:17] Community Steph Lindsay started that but
[54:20] at the same time Lima's only just now I
[54:24] mean just last year got old enough to
[54:26] vote
[54:27] right so it was created in
[54:29] 2005 um so uh it's a still a fairly new
[54:34] idea uh less you know couple decades old
[54:38] what's interesting about Lima um is that
[54:41] we do see this this fairly uh big
[54:44] separation in the dog training Community
[54:46] between people that tend to use a lot of
[54:49] aversives and people that tend to not
[54:53] people that try to uh not use aversives
[54:56] where possible uh and actively
[54:58] discourage the use of aversive tools
[55:00] like shot collars and prong collars and
[55:03] choke jeanss so Lima's been used by
[55:05] force free trainers to say oh it means
[55:07] Force
[55:08] free um and it's one of the reasons why
[55:11] I detailed the history of it itself and
[55:14] went right back to the source and
[55:16] provided quotes that Lindsay gave of
[55:19] Lima because the traditional or balanced
[55:22] trainers and you can find plenty of
[55:24] videos and plenty of writings out out
[55:26] there online where they're saying here's
[55:28] what Lindsay meant and they're using
[55:30] Lima to describe a justification of the
[55:33] use of aversives so what did Lindsay
[55:35] have to say about it well Lindsay was
[55:38] pretty
[55:39] clear uh in support of the use of some
[55:42] of these aversive tools and in saying
[55:45] and in fact the description of Lima was
[55:49] the first description of it on page 29
[55:52] of of his 2005 text on the next page
[55:56] over are pictures of prong collar and
[55:59] other aversive tools so he was using
[56:02] this as a way to advocate for the use of
[56:05] these aversive tools and Lindsay to this
[56:09] day it actively advocates for the use of
[56:12] and presents at conferences for uh
[56:16] traditional or balanced trainers and
[56:18] talks about the use of
[56:20] aversives uh as as justifiable tools to
[56:25] be used for dog purposes so going back
[56:28] to Lindsay's writings and and and seeing
[56:32] what Lindsay says today it's pretty
[56:33] clear he was a supporter of these type
[56:36] of methods which is one of the things I
[56:38] find problematic about Lima there's
[56:40] other things to be found to be
[56:42] problematic about Lima including the
[56:44] fact that the entire focus is just on
[56:47] what you don't want to see animals doing
[56:51] primarily dogs and I think in general
[56:55] that's been part of where we see some
[56:57] again getting into my speculating part
[57:00] where we see some of this problem and
[57:01] the the the history and why we still see
[57:04] this this considerable use of aversive
[57:07] methods is that people pick them up
[57:10] they're they're they're proliferated and
[57:12] they're easy to promote and and people
[57:15] aren't going and seeing what the science
[57:17] has to say necessarily about this I mean
[57:20] how many people are are going to read
[57:23] one of my published papers or somebody
[57:25] else's published papers and they're not
[57:28] being told about what we're finding out
[57:32] about these methods and then we have
[57:34] models that are being promoted like lima
[57:37] that continue to allow for at least at
[57:41] some level the justification of these
[57:44] tools so I think that that's a bit
[57:46] problematic um and part of the way that
[57:49] we progress for we continue to progress
[57:52] forward is by changing what we're doing
[57:55] how we describe what we're doing so that
[57:58] was really a big part of my intent in
[58:00] describing a this alternative model to
[58:03] Lima was giving people an option to say
[58:06] you know this is I I actually am saying
[58:10] let's focus on reward-based methods
[58:13] let's focus on things that we want to
[58:16] see the animal doing and talk about what
[58:19] is functional and effective for the
[58:23] animal so functionally effective and
[58:25] hence the alternative which also made a
[58:28] nice little acronym which was least
[58:30] inhibitive functionally effective or the
[58:32] life model so just to summarize for
[58:34] those who might not um be really
[58:37] familiar with it like you are so Lima is
[58:40] basically comes on the scene early 2000s
[58:43] and it's you describ would use these
[58:46] positive punishment methods a lot and
[58:48] and aversive methods on dogs and so over
[58:51] time Lima comes to mean something
[58:53] different as positive reinfor M methods
[58:56] and related methodologies continue to uh
[59:00] impact the industry right it comes to
[59:02] mean uh instead of like going from a
[59:05] choke chain to a prong collar to a shot
[59:07] collar you know you now are going to
[59:10] really try to avoid aversives however
[59:13] you still have to keep on the table the
[59:16] idea that maybe you might need to use an
[59:18] aversive on these dogs sometimes now
[59:21] yeah you know and that and that is now
[59:23] falling out of favor from my perspective
[59:25] based on what I can say that aversives
[59:27] are almost like saying that well maybe
[59:30] smoking a cigarette will cure lung
[59:32] cancer we can't say it won't but you
[59:35] know it's it's not exactly addresses the
[59:38] underlying cause the issue with Lima for
[59:40] me as a dog trainer and just looking
[59:42] around and seeing how fellow
[59:43] professionals and the public is impacted
[59:46] by this it seems to unnecessarily
[59:49] confuse professionals and the public
[59:52] because you'll hear many many people say
[59:55] and experts in the field say I don't
[59:57] think we'll need to use an aversive but
[59:58] I need to be scientific here and I still
[01:00:00] need to keep it on the table um and you
[01:00:03] know if we look at the 2021 absab
[01:00:05] statement at least according to the
[01:00:07] veterinary Society of animal behavior
[01:00:09] and the acbb to my knowledge know Avers
[01:00:12] should not be used in animal training
[01:00:13] because they don't address the cause
[01:00:15] you're really catching some of the
[01:00:16] problems with Lima itself I mean that's
[01:00:18] part of what I address is some of the as
[01:00:20] I mentioned you talk to different
[01:00:23] trainers from different camps and
[01:00:25] they're going to tell you that LMA means
[01:00:26] very different things and that is a big
[01:00:30] part of the the second point that I
[01:00:32] talked about in my paper about Lima is
[01:00:34] that there's it's not just ambiguity in
[01:00:36] some of the terminology used but in the
[01:00:39] concept itself and so it's not clear
[01:00:43] necessarily what it means to say well
[01:00:45] I'm just going to be least intrusive
[01:00:47] minimally aversive with what I do as you
[01:00:49] pointed out it at least means these
[01:00:52] options are still on the table but then
[01:00:54] the question becomes
[01:00:56] okay but when is that option being used
[01:01:00] that when you hear people say you know
[01:01:02] wow it's the last Stitch effort okay but
[01:01:04] when do you reach that last point so all
[01:01:06] we can say is it's necessarily still on
[01:01:08] the table and then also it's ambiguous
[01:01:11] enough that some people have said no no
[01:01:13] no it's not on the table at all lima
[01:01:15] lima means Force free it means it's not
[01:01:17] on but that's that's not how it's being
[01:01:20] described nor is it uh what was very
[01:01:24] clearly Lindsay's intent so I think that
[01:01:27] that as a model as a way to describe a
[01:01:30] force free approach that can be a bit
[01:01:33] problematic you published a paper last
[01:01:36] year right it
[01:01:38] was oh beginning of this year beginning
[01:01:41] of this year it was just this year the
[01:01:43] first
[01:01:44] presentation that I gave that was
[01:01:46] related to this paper was just over a
[01:01:49] year ago was June of
[01:01:52] 2023 where I presented the life model
[01:01:56] and then the paper was published in the
[01:01:57] Journal of vetinary behavior in January
[01:02:00] of this year it's made huge waves in the
[01:02:03] positive reinforcement Community
[01:02:05] especially as you know shedding a lot of
[01:02:07] insight because you raised these points
[01:02:08] about Lima the issues that there were
[01:02:11] there can we come up with something to
[01:02:12] better articulate the model is really I
[01:02:15] mean the appro and and you can use any
[01:02:17] of this interchangeably the model
[01:02:19] approach the framework this was okay
[01:02:21] here are here are some um critiques I
[01:02:24] have of Lima what this is uh at the same
[01:02:27] time acknowledging that Lima has served
[01:02:30] an important purpose uh within the force
[01:02:33] free training Community itself and
[01:02:34] getting us to having something easy to
[01:02:37] describe getting us uh to this point but
[01:02:41] that it's worth acknowledging these
[01:02:43] criticisms and those three big
[01:02:45] criticisms itself were some of the
[01:02:48] terminology used um intrusive is not a
[01:02:52] very behaviorally friendly term most
[01:02:54] behaviorists have tended to use other
[01:02:56] terminology like restriction or
[01:02:59] inhibition to talk about things to avoid
[01:03:02] in that way because it's very clear what
[01:03:03] effect that has on Behavior but that's a
[01:03:06] that's a one of the small points um it's
[01:03:09] just happens to be why I replaced part
[01:03:10] of the acronym Lima also doesn't really
[01:03:12] tell us what we want an individual to do
[01:03:16] and that's a really important point is
[01:03:18] let's focus on the things that we do
[01:03:20] want to see happen so if you go
[01:03:23] into uh uh a home setting if you're
[01:03:27] working with an individual and they say
[01:03:29] I you know I I don't want to my dog
[01:03:32] barks too much he jumps on the couch he
[01:03:35] does all these the long list of all the
[01:03:37] things that they have problems with a
[01:03:40] very uh nice way to redirect is simply
[01:03:44] to say okay what what would you like
[01:03:46] them to do
[01:03:47] instead and Lima gave us nothing in NE
[01:03:53] uh directly in terms of that so I wanted
[01:03:55] to be clear that that was part of the
[01:03:58] model itself um and especially in just
[01:04:02] as you pointed out in
[01:04:04] identifying the cause of some behaviors
[01:04:08] identifying the function uh to better be
[01:04:11] able to intervene effectively on it
[01:04:14] because and that's part of that last
[01:04:17] component that I said is the
[01:04:18] functionally effective part it's not
[01:04:21] enough to just simply say okay well I'm
[01:04:24] successful and then therefore this is a
[01:04:27] good method right if that's our standard
[01:04:30] of a good method well there's lots of
[01:04:32] things we can do to
[01:04:34] succeed but rather we have to tie the
[01:04:38] the component of understanding why
[01:04:41] something occurred the function of some
[01:04:42] behavior and then being more likely to
[01:04:45] effectively replace it and find
[01:04:48] something to reward so that was really
[01:04:51] that last part is the the big part what
[01:04:53] I call that functionally effective
[01:04:56] component um and that's the main point
[01:04:58] of the model is doing things like
[01:05:01] offering
[01:05:02] choices um focusing on Behavior we do
[01:05:07] want to see and making sure we
[01:05:10] understand the function of some behavior
[01:05:12] when we do want to change it in some way
[01:05:15] particularly if we want to try to get
[01:05:18] rid of or reduce some Behavior without
[01:05:21] the use of punishment how can we
[01:05:23] effectively do that we find other things
[01:05:26] to increase so we differentially
[01:05:28] reinforc something else so we found an
[01:05:31] alternative or incompatible Behavior to
[01:05:35] reward worked with a bunch of
[01:05:37] individuals that really helped uh with
[01:05:40] its creation so Lauren Novak uh Mara VZ
[01:05:45] a number of different individuals from
[01:05:47] the shelter play group Alliance really
[01:05:49] helped contribute some of the early
[01:05:50] feedback before the paper was even
[01:05:53] submitted and then Lily Chen offered her
[01:05:56] services to help create some of the
[01:05:59] graphics so we have these wonderful
[01:06:01] really pretty Graphics that because Lily
[01:06:03] is an amazing artist who's done lots of
[01:06:05] wonderful stuff in drawing pictures of
[01:06:07] animals she's she's also drawn pictures
[01:06:09] of penguins for me so that just uh made
[01:06:13] her forever my friend and she
[01:06:15] contributed some of the artwork to uh
[01:06:18] the paper so we have really nice
[01:06:19] graphics and some simple descriptions in
[01:06:21] it itself um that you can see that talk
[01:06:25] about about how to apply the model a big
[01:06:28] part of what I'm advocating for with
[01:06:30] this model is a connection to the
[01:06:33] science and that connection to the
[01:06:36] science for this ethical animal training
[01:06:38] model necessarily means not just the
[01:06:42] behavioral sciences not just how
[01:06:44] Behavior changes but those two other
[01:06:47] components the the welfare Sciences so
[01:06:51] what it means for that individual's life
[01:06:54] their quality of life and then our
[01:06:58] relationship with that with those
[01:07:01] individuals so the human animal Bond
[01:07:03] human animal interactions I only briefly
[01:07:07] alluded to that last part the third part
[01:07:10] the human animal interactions in the
[01:07:12] paper and it's something that I hope to
[01:07:14] write a bit more about about how much
[01:07:17] we're paying attention to uh what we
[01:07:20] what we've learned from Human Animal
[01:07:23] interaction research about about
[01:07:26] training methods and behavior change
[01:07:28] procedures and how those affect our
[01:07:30] relationship with the animal so with an
[01:07:34] individual um but that's a critical
[01:07:36] feature to attend to so the model is I I
[01:07:41] I hope as science friendly as as at
[01:07:43] least I tried to make it as science
[01:07:45] friendly as possible I love the emphasis
[01:07:49] on letting dogs do natural behavior
[01:07:53] where we can I mean as much as we
[01:07:56] reasonably can barking is natural I've
[01:07:58] talked a bit now about function and the
[01:08:01] importance of of function that really
[01:08:04] when we say function we mean cause right
[01:08:06] why did that behavior occur and when we
[01:08:08] talk about a functional relation or
[01:08:11] functional relationship functional
[01:08:13] contingency for instance reinforcement
[01:08:16] that just means that this
[01:08:19] consequence led to this change in
[01:08:21] Behavior so that's how reinforcements
[01:08:24] defined functionally
[01:08:26] so it's a cause that's a causal
[01:08:28] relationship and then we can talk about
[01:08:30] being effective so we've got function
[01:08:33] we've got the effective part and uh
[01:08:36] Effectiveness itself if if that's all
[01:08:39] we're using as our metric for success is
[01:08:42] we just say hey I got this to
[01:08:44] occur that can be a bit problematic
[01:08:47] because we can sit there and say you
[01:08:50] know well I got The Barking to stop so
[01:08:53] well how'd you get the Barking to stop
[01:08:55] you know well I just kept yelling at the
[01:08:57] dog till they stopped barking right or I
[01:09:00] kept doing this X Y or Z that we can
[01:09:03] talk about lots of things especially
[01:09:06] many of the the aversive uh consequences
[01:09:10] that can be delivered many of the
[01:09:11] punishing procedures that are often used
[01:09:14] that they can uh still be effective but
[01:09:18] now when we start tying those two
[01:09:20] concepts together and in the paper I
[01:09:23] talk a little bit I Define both of these
[01:09:25] separately and then together that now
[01:09:27] we're talking about being functionally
[01:09:29] effective that we're identifying the
[01:09:32] reason why something occurs and using
[01:09:35] that understanding our knowledge of the
[01:09:37] function of some Behavior to adequately
[01:09:41] apply some Behavior change procedure
[01:09:44] that will be reward-based to change that
[01:09:46] in some way and that's what the
[01:09:48] behavioral sciences have done for half a
[01:09:52] century plus that they've looked for
[01:09:55] identifying the function of some
[01:09:57] behavior and using that to guide
[01:10:00] reinforcement based procedures to change
[01:10:04] those behaviors that's part of why
[01:10:06] people like Skinner have written so many
[01:10:08] books about the importance of function
[01:10:10] and the importance of reinforcement that
[01:10:13] he tied those two together so I'd like
[01:10:15] to say that um the the concept of
[01:10:19] functionally effective was something
[01:10:20] that I just came up with but the reality
[01:10:24] is that no it's it's very much something
[01:10:27] that uh um has existed for a very long
[01:10:30] time in the behavioral sciences um and I
[01:10:33] just framed it this way that I hope
[01:10:35] makes it um a bit more uh easy to
[01:10:40] understand and apply for uh animal
[01:10:42] trainers so if we're going back to the
[01:10:44] common issue of barking maybe a dog is
[01:10:46] barking because they're bored they don't
[01:10:48] have the energy release and they're just
[01:10:51] trying to get it out or something maybe
[01:10:52] exercising them in the morning to uh
[01:10:56] really address that cause uh would serve
[01:10:59] to functional is that what you're saying
[01:11:01] how would you state that I want to make
[01:11:03] sure so if we're if we're looking at
[01:11:06] something and barking is always one of
[01:11:08] those those tricky issues because as you
[01:11:10] pointed out you know dogs bark and we do
[01:11:13] have to acknowledge that there's there's
[01:11:15] there is also a functionality to the
[01:11:18] behavior itself so I'm using uh function
[01:11:22] also from the biological standpoint
[01:11:24] because we use function at both the
[01:11:26] level of behavior and biology but
[01:11:29] understanding um that there is a
[01:11:31] functionality to the behavior itself
[01:11:33] that's important and so if that's our
[01:11:36] only uh purpose is to to get rid of the
[01:11:38] behavior maybe that's not functional for
[01:11:40] the dog but we can say Okay are there
[01:11:44] ways that we can uh find other things to
[01:11:48] increase and that will itself lead to
[01:11:52] less of a reason for The Barking to
[01:11:54] occur so for instance or there reasons
[01:11:57] why the Barking is occurring that are a
[01:11:59] result of some of the things that we've
[01:12:01] already done so oh are we inadvertently
[01:12:05] rewarding the dog for barking and if so
[01:12:09] can we place those rewards somewhere so
[01:12:11] once we start to understand once we take
[01:12:14] a step back we look at here's why the
[01:12:17] behavior is
[01:12:18] occurring and therefore if it is
[01:12:21] something for instance like we are
[01:12:23] rewarding uh inad ently rewarding
[01:12:27] barking for occurring
[01:12:30] then we have a potential change Behavior
[01:12:34] change procedure we can Implement now
[01:12:36] which is okay so instead give attention
[01:12:40] for doing this so give the give the dog
[01:12:43] attention for this instead of barking
[01:12:45] and find ways that we can increase
[01:12:48] attention for other things and in the
[01:12:51] process of that probably also giving the
[01:12:54] dog itself more attention we're talking
[01:12:57] about an animal uh an individual that
[01:13:00] may work for getting uh attention under
[01:13:04] any condition uh because they may be
[01:13:07] lacking some of that attention that they
[01:13:09] want your attention in some way and even
[01:13:12] yelling at them might be a form of
[01:13:14] attention so again all of that is part
[01:13:17] of understanding the function of the
[01:13:18] behavior and using that to help guide
[01:13:22] how then we change Behavior and identify
[01:13:26] our success our Effectiveness so that's
[01:13:30] the concept of functionally effective
[01:13:33] could you give me another example I mean
[01:13:36] how the life model would um be
[01:13:40] implemented or the framework or whatever
[01:13:41] you want to call it in say a leash
[01:13:44] reactivity situation maybe a dog is you
[01:13:48] know I and I understand underlying cause
[01:13:50] that that's very Case by case for the
[01:13:53] individual dog you have anything to say
[01:13:55] because I know that's and then that's a
[01:13:56] tough question because reactivity can be
[01:13:58] tough for a lot of people you know yeah
[01:14:00] sure sure sure and and there you're
[01:14:02] getting at something that's really
[01:14:04] important because you pointed out the
[01:14:06] individual component there which these
[01:14:08] are things that are defined by the
[01:14:10] individual and their behavior which I
[01:14:12] think is often a way that that people um
[01:14:15] it may have some difficulty with science
[01:14:17] in application too as they often think
[01:14:19] of science as this thing that's like I
[01:14:21] looked at you know a hundred dogs and
[01:14:24] then I produced an average of those
[01:14:26] hundred dogs but I'm talking about and
[01:14:29] this is the case for much of welfare
[01:14:31] science it's focused on the individual a
[01:14:33] lot of my research ends up being
[01:14:36] something that looks at an individual a
[01:14:38] lot of times for a long period of time
[01:14:42] and so I'm still collecting lots of data
[01:14:44] but the data is on an individual and
[01:14:46] that is that's relevant that's important
[01:14:49] uh particularly for applied science for
[01:14:52] welfare science if you tell me um um
[01:14:55] okay well this dog's being reactive I'm
[01:14:57] going to say okay well what do that what
[01:14:59] does that look like so let's Identify
[01:15:01] some of the behaviors involved there
[01:15:04] let's operationally define this or let's
[01:15:06] just specify the behaviors so well I'm
[01:15:09] talking about my dog is lunging he's
[01:15:12] barking um in the presence of this other
[01:15:15] dog or in the presence of uh this other
[01:15:18] person or something I'm going to say
[01:15:20] okay so now we have some identifiable
[01:15:22] things that we can look at we have the
[01:15:24] individual that we're looking at it with
[01:15:26] so let's start looking at if we can
[01:15:29] identify when it occurs what's what are
[01:15:33] the things that happen before and after
[01:15:36] and it may be again we could take at
[01:15:39] least one example where it could be
[01:15:41] inadvertent attention that's given for
[01:15:43] reacting or it may be that they get to
[01:15:46] they get to get away from an individual
[01:15:48] so if the dog lunges it pulls jumps at
[01:15:52] so let's go with the latter case because
[01:15:53] I think that that's of and something
[01:15:55] that we see where the dog may pull or or
[01:15:59] uh uh jump at a dog and and what happens
[01:16:02] is the person maybe picks the dogs up or
[01:16:05] drags the dog away but either way they
[01:16:07] get the dog away from that situation as
[01:16:10] quickly as they can so now we're
[01:16:11] starting to understand this potential
[01:16:14] Escape function of the behavior in that
[01:16:17] case maybe we might want to try to use
[01:16:20] counter conditioning even uh take a type
[01:16:23] of counter conditioning systematic
[01:16:25] desensitization that we might gradually
[01:16:28] Expose and help remove some of that um
[01:16:32] so that we're getting less of a reason
[01:16:34] to escape the aversive we might start
[01:16:37] including with that systematic
[01:16:39] desensitization procedure some uh
[01:16:42] positive reinforcement for the behaviors
[01:16:44] we do want to see so some of the we
[01:16:47] could call more generally calm behaviors
[01:16:49] but behaviors where it's not lunging
[01:16:51] some of these things and all of this
[01:16:54] were're using the information that we
[01:16:57] figured out in identifying the function
[01:16:59] of the behavior to help guide how we
[01:17:02] then try to change how how we look to
[01:17:06] intervene on that behavior so it's that
[01:17:09] two part of let's assess and then let's
[01:17:13] improve and that's really the
[01:17:16] combination of being functionally
[01:17:17] effective I think it it
[01:17:20] sounds complicated because it's it's
[01:17:23] certainly it's there is complex to that
[01:17:26] but when we start in those small steps
[01:17:29] and the first step is just saying can we
[01:17:32] figure out why this is occurring can we
[01:17:34] look at what happened before and after
[01:17:36] and are there ways that we can do that
[01:17:39] that might involve data and then also
[01:17:43] keeping in mind ultimately that we're
[01:17:47] thinking about what effect all the
[01:17:49] things that we're doing have on the
[01:17:51] individual and our relationship with the
[01:17:54] individual so that second and third
[01:17:56] component again the welfare and human
[01:18:00] animal interaction part of that and what
[01:18:04] does the science tell us about that well
[01:18:07] said that's and that really is what this
[01:18:10] comes down to it's not just about
[01:18:12] observable Behavior it's about the
[01:18:14] welfare of the dog because if you
[01:18:17] neglect the welfare of a dog in exchange
[01:18:19] for suppressing a behavior that may
[01:18:23] likely lead to other issues that people
[01:18:24] don't even put together you know dog on
[01:18:27] dog aggression within the house if
[01:18:29] you're continually you know if you have
[01:18:30] multiple dogs that could be a
[01:18:32] contributing factor perhaps right yeah
[01:18:35] yeah yeah yeah certainly and once we
[01:18:37] start thinking about the welfare
[01:18:39] component it means we necessarily when
[01:18:42] we're thinking about the individual
[01:18:44] we've got to think about what's what's
[01:18:46] you know quote unquote normal or natural
[01:18:51] for that animal as well so that's
[01:18:53] another critical part that we start
[01:18:56] thinking I mean well the welfare
[01:18:57] Sciences aren't just about the effects
[01:19:00] of learning but often there's there's
[01:19:02] considerable amount of consideration for
[01:19:05] the species itself and what's natural
[01:19:08] for that that behavior so it's this
[01:19:11] lovely combination of some of the
[01:19:14] evolutionary and learning histories of
[01:19:17] any individual that you take into
[01:19:18] consideration and that's worth thinking
[01:19:20] about things like barking come into play
[01:19:23] because you know are you you going to
[01:19:25] work with an Alaskan Husky and say let's
[01:19:27] get rid of all
[01:19:29] vocalizations I would hope not um what's
[01:19:33] part of their their individual natural
[01:19:37] behavior so that's something worth
[01:19:40] keeping in mind and and thinking about
[01:19:42] the individual and what's what's
[01:19:45] relevant for the welfare of that
[01:19:47] individual as well the acknowledgement
[01:19:50] and emphasis on the welfare of the
[01:19:52] animal it's not just because it's nice
[01:19:54] though it is it's not just because it's
[01:19:56] considerate of the animal though it is
[01:19:58] but it actually delivers from what
[01:20:00] you're saying a more desirable better
[01:20:03] well-rounded result for the the guardian
[01:20:06] of the dog am I am I stating that as you
[01:20:09] would yeah no no no yeah that's really
[01:20:11] well stated so everyone ultimately
[01:20:14] that's trying to change behavior in some
[01:20:16] way that's working with these
[01:20:17] individuals they're typ they're
[01:20:19] typically thinking about the welfare of
[01:20:21] the individual most people are thinking
[01:20:24] I want to make my dogs happy I want to
[01:20:27] make these individuals happy and I think
[01:20:30] when we start talking about what impact
[01:20:33] the different training procedures that
[01:20:35] we use the different Behavior change
[01:20:37] procedures the different behavior
[01:20:39] management procedures we use what impact
[01:20:41] that has on the welfare of the animal
[01:20:44] itself on the
[01:20:46] individual that's an important part that
[01:20:49] may not always be as obvious to someone
[01:20:52] so they may just assume I have to do
[01:20:56] this MH but so I have to and that's
[01:21:01] often the way that we hear people
[01:21:02] describe the the aversive training
[01:21:05] methods the use of aversive tools is
[01:21:08] it's something that you have to
[01:21:10] do right so that often is yeah yeah but
[01:21:15] hopefully if we can you know get some of
[01:21:17] this science in this unregulated field
[01:21:19] of dog training then we could
[01:21:22] potentially um you know resolve a lot
[01:21:24] these issues that's one of the things we
[01:21:25] advocate for Bri and I is so the public
[01:21:28] is more protected on this and you know
[01:21:31] not giving them dollars to dog trainers
[01:21:33] who are omitting various aspects of
[01:21:35] welfare like you're talking right A lot
[01:21:38] of times we hear people say that the
[01:21:39] Lima model puts the person first or the
[01:21:42] Handler first and so the argument goes
[01:21:45] something like there are times where you
[01:21:49] basically have to choose like sure it
[01:21:51] would be great to always think of the
[01:21:52] welfare of the dog but sometimes you
[01:21:55] have to consider the Handler for for a
[01:21:57] variety of reasons you know whether it's
[01:21:59] like Handler or a person in a difficult
[01:22:02] situation where they can't necessarily
[01:22:04] accommodate their dog in a big city with
[01:22:06] a reactive dog Etc and right that's
[01:22:09] something that we think about a whole
[01:22:11] lot because based on the evidence we've
[01:22:15] seen it seems like that doesn't really
[01:22:17] put the person first it seems like
[01:22:19] putting the animals welfare first
[01:22:21] actually puts the person first when
[01:22:23] people say well I have to consider the
[01:22:24] welfare of the Handler first and they do
[01:22:27] something it's often as an excuse I
[01:22:29] think in many cases to uh then say and
[01:22:33] then therefore I did this I did this
[01:22:35] awful thing or did this thing that um I
[01:22:38] wouldn't normally do but the reality is
[01:22:41] wait a second but are you where are you
[01:22:43] choosing to do that thing and is it
[01:22:46] really as you pointed out does that
[01:22:49] really um
[01:22:51] is if would not choosing that thing be
[01:22:54] better for the welfare of the animal for
[01:22:56] the individual and the trainer right so
[01:23:00] the dog and the guardian and I think
[01:23:02] once we start framing things in terms of
[01:23:04] the
[01:23:05] welfare of the dog the welfare of the
[01:23:08] individual that becomes a bit more clear
[01:23:11] so true I mean that is the missing link
[01:23:13] in my in my view and your view it sounds
[01:23:16] like that if you put welfare
[01:23:18] first then you know that you're going to
[01:23:20] have a lot less issues and you know
[01:23:23] exercising the dog making sure that
[01:23:24] diets right making sure everything in
[01:23:26] their life is as optimal as you can
[01:23:28] create for them yeah it kind of does put
[01:23:30] the person first to do that yeah it
[01:23:32] helps eliminate some of those arguments
[01:23:34] where somebody wants to say something
[01:23:36] like you know well but you have to do
[01:23:39] this you have to do that go wait why do
[01:23:42] I have to well because otherwise the
[01:23:46] animal won't you know X Y or Z won't
[01:23:50] respect you we'll do what it wants we'll
[01:23:52] do that and he's ultimately when you
[01:23:55] stop and you say okay well but where's
[01:23:58] your evidence for that right is this an
[01:24:00] an is
[01:24:02] this this so I get that this is your
[01:24:05] opinion about that but where's your
[01:24:07] evidence for that because let's go to
[01:24:11] what we do know and when you look at
[01:24:14] what we do know it often shows the
[01:24:16] opposite so doing those things is more
[01:24:19] detrimental particularly when we look at
[01:24:21] the welfare effects on the animal we see
[01:24:24] things and just like um again I you
[01:24:28] you'll have to throw that particular
[01:24:29] reference which I believe is oh Handley
[01:24:32] um I said 2020 where they they looked at
[01:24:36] uh cats and their uh so Cat Guardians
[01:24:39] cat owners and their and aggression um
[01:24:43] but that one is a great example where
[01:24:45] they were able to show that the people
[01:24:47] that were using the more aversive
[01:24:50] methods so using spray bottles were the
[01:24:53] ones producing most aggression yet I'm
[01:24:56] sure somebody told them this is the only
[01:24:59] way your cat's going to respect you is
[01:25:01] if you spray it when it does that or
[01:25:03] something like that yet they're
[01:25:05] producing the most aggression and
[01:25:07] there's lots and lots of evidence of
[01:25:09] this of the fact that using aversive
[01:25:12] there's this idea of aggression breeding
[01:25:14] aggression and that's been shown time
[01:25:16] and time again in the laboratory in the
[01:25:20] field so in applied settings across a
[01:25:23] variety of spr the species
[01:25:26] that we see that happen quite often real
[01:25:30] well said I think this is a good
[01:25:32] stopping point I still have another like
[01:25:33] seven or eight questions but I I'd
[01:25:36] rather save this for another time and I
[01:25:38] appreciate that I know you're certainly
[01:25:39] willing to that's true I like these
[01:25:42] questions though so can we let's
[01:25:43] actually do a round two if we
[01:25:45] can gotta keep the audience wanting more
[01:25:48] right Dr Eduardo Fernandez Eddie honor
[01:25:50] of a lifetime to have you here and I
[01:25:52] know that your words are going to Prov
[01:25:54] so much value I want to do everything I
[01:25:56] can to amplify messages and and Lessons
[01:26:00] Learned From people like you who
[01:26:01] dedicate their lives to this so thank
[01:26:03] you so much for everything the pleasure
[01:26:05] is all mine this is fantastic and I look
[01:26:08] forward to part two ah absolutely me too

TRANSCRIPTION:

[00:00] this is an unbelievably fast way to
[00:02] train your dog to listen around
[00:03] distractions that takes just minutes but
[00:06] it can transform yours and their whole
[00:09] world and this is something that most of
[00:11] you can teach your dog today now for
[00:14] this lesson you're going to need a few
[00:15] things like treats that your dog
[00:17] absolutely loves because they'll need to
[00:19] both resist and enjoy these treats and
[00:22] make sure you have one or two of their
[00:23] favorite toys we get all of our toys
[00:25] from bark these days every month Bark
[00:27] Box and super chewer deliver awesome
[00:29] toys and treats right to your door now
[00:31] bark boox is great for most dogs with
[00:33] fun crinkly squeaky toys and tasty
[00:36] treats that they'll love if your dog has
[00:38] some serious jaw power super chewer has
[00:40] those tougher toys that are really built
[00:43] to last I love getting these boxes it
[00:45] keeps us stocked up on treats and always
[00:47] ready to get out there and train or just
[00:50] have fun and play together you can get a
[00:52] free extra box when you go to
[00:54] barkbox.com sdog trining or super.com
[00:57] sdog trining we're going to break down
[00:59] state and three key Dimensions that are
[01:01] going to be super easy to understand
[01:03] we're going to teach our dogs how to
[01:04] stay for a period of time we kind of
[01:07] have already touched on that then we're
[01:09] going to go over stay when we move and
[01:11] walk away from them and finally we're
[01:13] going to go over stay when our dogs are
[01:17] distracted stay is good not only because
[01:19] it can help teach your dog not to run
[01:21] out of the front door it can help you
[01:22] teach them to do things like not jump
[01:25] stop barking it really is a crucial
[01:27] skill that we Implement and lots of
[01:30] different aspects of our training the
[01:31] first step to teaching stay begins in a
[01:34] relatively boring environment that's
[01:36] free from distractions most dogs are
[01:38] adapted in the home environment where
[01:39] they're not as easily distracted make it
[01:42] easy for your dog I like this every time
[01:44] I train a dog I want to ask myself okay
[01:46] what are they feeling like do they look
[01:47] stressed are they uncomfortable do they
[01:49] look pretty chill willing to engage I'm
[01:51] seeing a happy tail back there I'm
[01:53] seeing that tilted head that's saying
[01:55] when am I going to get my next street
[01:57] I'm ready to learn I love training so
[01:58] much basically we're trying to teach him
[02:00] to sit and stay until we release him
[02:06] yes
[02:09] yes yes do you see what we're doing I'm
[02:12] rewarding like every second at first
[02:14] that's how we taught it but
[02:17] now yes that was many seconds and he's
[02:21] learning that boy holding this position
[02:23] is working and he's learned for a period
[02:25] of time that he can do that right but
[02:28] look how close I am to to him right now
[02:30] the first aspect is duration that's this
[02:33] the next step is distance because I'm
[02:35] real close to him right now fine this is
[02:38] common for dogs to go into a down I'm
[02:40] okay with that even though I didn't
[02:41] release him from the sit he went into a
[02:44] down cuz I was busy blabbering that's
[02:46] fine he's still in a stay position now
[02:48] watch
[02:49] this
[02:55] yes I'm going to ask for his attention
[02:58] here eye contact walk walking away yes
[03:02] that wasn't just stay that was look at
[03:05] me that is lie down and that is stay
[03:09] there are multiple behaviors that are
[03:10] building on top of each other this is
[03:12] why it's critical when you're thinking
[03:13] about dog training not to think about
[03:15] how do I teach X Y or Z but how do I
[03:17] train a variety of skills that I can put
[03:20] together in pieces to get the behaviors
[03:22] that I want notice how I'm mixing it up
[03:24] I'm not releasing him every single time
[03:27] I come back this keeps him guessing and
[03:29] focused which which is really key to
[03:30] building a solid reliable stay by
[03:32] varying when I release him he learns to
[03:35] stay patient and wait for the request no
[03:38] matter how tempting it is to break the
[03:40] position walking back coming back to him
[03:43] I mean that is a solid looking stay if
[03:46] I've ever seen
[03:47] one
[03:49] yes now I know some of you are thinking
[03:52] maybe he's just lazy watch
[03:55] this shade okay come so you can see he's
[04:00] starting to become more fluent in
[04:03] language
[04:05] here good
[04:08] Sit
[04:10] Stay
[04:13] yes watch
[04:18] this
[04:20] yes one was verbal one was a hand signal
[04:24] that's all I'm doing focus on one at a
[04:26] time that might make things easier for
[04:27] all parties sit yes we're getting sit on
[04:31] the first request virtually 100% of the
[04:35] time walking away duration distance
[04:39] combining them for a second did you see
[04:40] how he almost broke there but thought
[04:41] better of it
[04:44] yes yes
[04:47] oh yes good man all right that was
[04:50] interesting he did break there that's
[04:51] one of the first times he got a little
[04:52] confused but again he was like oh wait I
[04:55] think I'm supposed to sit when he was
[04:56] gently reminded so I want to take a step
[04:58] back and make sure I don't get two
[05:00] failures in a row I'm
[05:03] superstitious good look at
[05:07] this
[05:13] good yes what did we do there let me
[05:17] release him so I can make a point okay
[05:19] good man
[05:21] yes so that was a good example of how
[05:24] we're using many of the skills that
[05:26] we've learned throughout this series
[05:27] good what's also known as a continuation
[05:30] marker it's the equivalent of saying
[05:32] warm warm hot right but when we say hot
[05:36] or yes that's when he gets the treat
[05:39] that's how we start to get away from
[05:40] constantly treating once we've started
[05:42] to build that fluency over the last many
[05:44] days yes I hope we're doing a lot to
[05:47] dispel this idea that positive
[05:49] reinforcement takes longer he hasn't
[05:51] even been with me two weeks I have an
[05:53] intensive Cooperative Kane Corso here
[05:55] who's very engaged and well adjusted so
[05:59] far I couldn't be happier but we're not
[06:00] done we have to now do the big one how
[06:03] do we teach our dogs to stay when they
[06:05] want to go I'll show you how I train it
[06:07] and then if you like it maybe you can
[06:10] try it yourself we can start with
[06:11] something he already knows which is
[06:13] leave it that's kind of a stay with
[06:15] distractions even though with a leave it
[06:16] we're teaching them to leave something
[06:18] alone and look at us it's got movement
[06:20] it's a nice healthy leave it with
[06:22] distractions we're teaching them to stop
[06:24] paying attention to that thing and look
[06:25] at us and remember even though he's in a
[06:27] down right now there is the expectation
[06:30] that he hold that down until we say okay
[06:33] or free or whatever release word you'd
[06:35] like to use and this is something that
[06:37] most of you can teach your dog today it
[06:39] takes minutes to train what we're doing
[06:41] and then you practice 10 seconds at a
[06:43] time and then they got it I'm going to
[06:44] do multiple treats leave
[06:46] it here okay good man yes let's see if
[06:52] we can make this skill more impressive
[06:54] though I'm going to grab a toy I'm going
[06:57] to be pretty careful about
[07:02] it oh okay so you can see this is a
[07:05] distraction okay I'll give him
[07:07] permission you just to prove that he
[07:09] likes the toy go get it you know he's
[07:12] got a really good play drive he loves to
[07:15] play good the key here is using a toy as
[07:18] a distraction and a reward and you can
[07:21] always use two different toys if that
[07:23] works better for you okay good man and I
[07:26] can even use the toy as the outcome here
[07:29] here so you can reinforce your dog in a
[07:32] variety of ways good that fetch is
[07:34] looking great nice tug we've already
[07:36] gotten a good start he's pretty amped
[07:40] up here
[07:42] sit good let's start really small
[07:48] stay
[07:50] yes I'll go with a treat for a second
[07:53] just to mix it
[07:57] up yes going to reward several times in
[08:01] a row here to let him know I'm
[08:02] appreciating this new skill he's
[08:04] exhibiting
[08:08] stay yes okay so we're saying hey you
[08:11] can go for the toy we're not trying to
[08:13] kill your interest in the toy I like
[08:15] that you're into the toy but there are
[08:17] rules in how we engage the toy from time
[08:19] to time can I stop and tell you what a
[08:21] good man you are and how much I love you
[08:23] he's doing so great it's really
[08:25] important to give your dog that
[08:26] authentic genuine praise and let him
[08:28] know how much you appreciate them and
[08:29] mean it it's not just about a pat watch
[08:32] his eyes guys
[08:34] stay
[08:38] yes stay yes it's just a game that's all
[08:42] dog training
[08:43] is
[08:48] yes here okay good man so far I've been
[08:52] setting it down stay doing this right
[08:57] but those are slow motion dist
[08:59] attractions those are different than a
[09:01] deer or a moose or something running
[09:03] across them
[09:05] yes let's make we're going to slowly
[09:08] make it more and more
[09:10] animated yes the squeaker sound
[09:15] there stay can be so hard for dogs
[09:18] because by Nature they's such curious
[09:20] beings who want to engage with their
[09:22] environment and understand things be
[09:24] mindful about when asking your dog to
[09:27] stay it is an essential skill but are
[09:29] times when we should let our dogss
[09:31] actually investigate and check things
[09:33] out when it's
[09:37] appropriate let me let him look at it
[09:38] for a second too I just don't want to
[09:40] necessarily interrupt him let's see what
[09:43] happens
[09:45] yes good man all right this is a pretty
[09:48] good first stay with distractions
[09:50] training lesson it's raining toys it's
[09:52] raining treats everywhere and he is
[09:55] holding that stay that's pretty
[09:56] impressive and remember if you start to
[09:58] see your dog
[10:05] Topline easy rush and before he fails
[10:10] okay good man and all done we've laid
[10:14] the foundation we'll let that process in
[10:16] his brain over the next couple of days
[10:19] you can have the treats if you can find
[10:20] them give him some sniffing enrichment
[10:23] let him smell the carpet find all those
[10:26] treats that I can't see and over time as
[10:28] you start to teach him stay when you're
[10:30] at the park and a bird goes by in the
[10:33] distance and you're able to get the here
[10:35] stay you'll start to generalize this

[00:58] highdrive dog like Wallace who is an
[01:00] adolescent it is possible to transform
[01:03] that Boundless Energy into something
[01:06] very special today I'm going to show you
[01:08] how I know a lot of you are really into
[01:10] shade the cone Corso some of the best
[01:12] content with shade is yet to be released
[01:14] whether you have a puppy right now
[01:16] whether you have a high drive older dog
[01:18] we have you covered from all angles on
[01:20] this channel you're going to want to
[01:21] watch this video to see our latest
[01:23] project BarkBox is one of our main
[01:25] sponsors their toys their treats their
[01:26] chews they're incredible for everyday
[01:28] dogs but can we please please talk about
[01:30] super chewer for a moment cuz I got a
[01:32] super chewer dog on my hands here
[01:34] Wallace has those brand new adult teeth
[01:37] that are chomping away you can hear his
[01:40] teeth like scissors just slicing through
[01:43] having those toys that are holding up
[01:45] where I can throw them reward frequently
[01:48] or put treats inside of them to keep him
[01:49] guessing and keep him mentally
[01:51] stimulated that helps me out both during
[01:53] my training sessions and in between my
[01:55] training sessions and keeps him happy
[01:57] the whole time that's what it's about
[01:59] the other thing I love about getting
[02:00] these boxes is I've got packs of treats
[02:02] every single month delivered to my door
[02:04] so I don't have to worry about running
[02:06] out you know where I put those treats
[02:07] right by my bathroom sink so that I can
[02:09] grab a handful of them put them in my
[02:11] pocket first thing in the morning is I'm
[02:12] getting ready for the day that's put me
[02:14] in a position with Wallace to be able to
[02:17] just keep making progress without
[02:19] hitting plateaus and that's amazing and
[02:21] the good thing about the treats is
[02:23] they're different textures to appeal to
[02:25] our dogs when they're in different moods
[02:27] that's what good dog trainers know how
[02:28] to do take their dogs current mood into
[02:31] account when they're working with them
[02:32] now if you want to get a super chewer
[02:33] box or a bark box they're going to give
[02:35] you a free one go to barkbox.com dog

[02:40] get a free extra box when you sign up
[02:42] I'll have links below the period of
[02:44] adolescence in dogs is really a
[02:46] fascinating time like human teenagers
[02:48] dogs experience hormonal changes bunch
[02:51] of cognitive development a newfound
[02:53] sense of Independence and capability
[02:56] exploring the world with fresh eyes now
[02:58] that they can move more more efficiently
[03:00] and they know more stuff they're
[03:02] starting to adapt to our ways and
[03:05] although it's not spiteful as our dog is
[03:07] learning more about the world it canest
[03:09] our patience sometimes you're not alone
[03:11] if you're feeling frustrated this Silver
[03:14] Lining is if we can take advantage of
[03:16] all of that new development and
[03:18] curiosity and intelligence it's such a
[03:20] golden opportunity to deepen that
[03:22] connection with your dog and Achieve
[03:24] things that you probably never thought
[03:26] you could with them I'm going to give
[03:27] you several tips right now that are
[03:29] going to make a huge huge difference
[03:30] with your dog first of all instead of
[03:32] trying to suppress all of that energy
[03:35] our goal is going to be to harness it in
[03:38] positive ways and give it productive
[03:40] Outlets highdrive dogs like Wallace they
[03:43] Thrive when they're really given
[03:44] meaningful tasks that engage their minds
[03:47] and their bodies if your dog likes to
[03:49] sniff try throwing treats in the yard
[03:51] and giving them several minutes to go
[03:53] sniff them out that's a way for them to
[03:55] use their brain and also satisfy that
[03:58] urge to sniff and explore and this is
[04:00] done in a way that's natural to them and
[04:02] acceptable to you teaching your dog new
[04:04] and more complex tricks they're a really
[04:07] great way for your dog to feel like I'm
[04:08] getting this interaction with a person
[04:11] and after all I have been selected to
[04:14] interact with people for thousands of
[04:17] years it's one of my strong suits that's
[04:20] supposed to be the dog talking for
[04:22] example you might want to teach your dog
[04:23] how to go retrieve a still item in the
[04:25] distance as opposed to just training a
[04:28] fetch next make sure you have command
[04:30] and control of your dog surroundings
[04:32] your house doesn't need to be Fort Knox
[04:34] to be safe at least not for most dogs
[04:36] the purpose of managing our dog
[04:38] surroundings is to make sure that we
[04:40] prevent undesired things from happening
[04:42] like chewing shoes or escaping but part
[04:45] of managing their environment and
[04:47] keeping them content is providing
[04:49] various items that are likely to satisfy
[04:52] their curiosity and their need for that
[04:54] mental stimulation introduce toys that
[04:57] you can stuff treats inside of so they
[04:59] have to work a little bit harder to get
[05:01] them this engages that brain helps them
[05:03] learn problem solving it's kind of like
[05:05] math for dogs I like to have an activity
[05:08] Zone where the dogs are encouraged to
[05:10] explore new items to play with one
[05:11] another in our house that happens to be
[05:14] this carpet right here dogs like us
[05:17] appreciate variety novel experiences and
[05:21] enriching environments this really helps
[05:23] us to honor dogs for who they are and
[05:26] keep them at their optimal emotional
[05:27] state which makes training easy be
[05:31] prepared because opportunities are
[05:33] everywhere these high energy adolescent
[05:36] dogs are always learning of course
[05:38] you're going to want to keep treats
[05:39] handy in the way that we've discussed
[05:40] but I want you to think Beyond just that
[05:42] too you can use real world rewards that
[05:45] are meaningful to your specific dog and
[05:48] you can turn everyday moments into micr
[05:51] training sessions this is actually where
[05:54] your most powerful training will happen
[05:57] these micr training sessions can last
[05:59] anywhere between 2 and 3 seconds and
[06:01] maybe 30 seconds for example when you
[06:03] ask your dog to stay at the front door
[06:05] for 5 or 10 seconds at a time before
[06:07] releasing them or you see that they're
[06:09] about to jump on the counter and you
[06:11] interrupt them by calling them and
[06:12] giving them a reward for complying with
[06:15] that alternative incompatible behavior
[06:17] of coming to you those are the tiny
[06:19] magic moments if your dog sits patiently
[06:21] while you put on their harness and their
[06:23] leash their reward can be that amazing
[06:26] walk where they get to go and sniff the
[06:28] whole neighborhood and check their pil
[06:30] then that's what we do it really starts
[06:32] to help your dog understand that you're
[06:34] in tune with them too and that just
[06:36] helps increase that fluid communication
[06:38] a lot of people are concerned with dog
[06:40] tog socialization at this age and that's
[06:42] a good thing to prioritize I would
[06:44] recommend that instead of going to a
[06:45] place like a dog park that you organize
[06:47] play dates with your dog with dogs who
[06:49] play in a similar way to them when you
[06:52] keep the group smaller and you know the
[06:54] personalities of the dogs this is a lot
[06:57] more likely to ensure a successful
[06:59] outing or experience for your dog this
[07:02] isn't just about burning off excess
[07:04] energy these play dates it's really
[07:05] about teaching them social experiences
[07:08] with other dogs as well as emotional
[07:10] intelligence watching Wallace and
[07:12] inertia play endlessly you really come
[07:15] to see that nuanced communication that's
[07:17] a little bit different with each and
[07:19] every dog you can see the reciprocal
[07:21] body language here the play boughs it's
[07:23] a beautiful reminder that our dogs have
[07:25] their own language their own lives that
[07:28] has so much depth next tip I want to
[07:30] talk about perspective and mindset here
[07:32] when you're training a dog like Wallace
[07:34] or any dog for that matter it's not just
[07:37] about the end goal of a dog achieving
[07:39] some type of physical Behavior it may
[07:41] sound cliche but it is about that
[07:43] Journey that you guys share together
[07:46] there's always going to be setbacks when
[07:48] things don't go exactly as you plan but
[07:51] I want you to understand that this
[07:52] frustration that you'll feel from time
[07:54] to time is normal and you'll recover I
[07:57] really want you to think of this
[07:58] relationship with your dog as a
[08:00] beautiful tapestry that's woven over
[08:03] time each experience your dog has
[08:05] whether it's triumphant or even
[08:07] challenging adds beautiful color and
[08:09] texture to the overall picture I want
[08:12] you to embrace those quirks and learning
[08:14] curves with your dog because I know I
[08:17] know it's going to make your training
[08:18] better I know it's going to make your
[08:19] bond better and I know it's going to
[08:21] make you both happier and if you will
[08:23] approach each day with patience a
[08:26] positive mindset you're not just
[08:28] training your dog any more you're
[08:30] building a lifelong relationship with
[08:32] your dog a partnership that's based on
[08:34] trust and understanding and I'm telling
[08:37] you that that is the strongest
[08:39] Foundation that you can possibly have
[08:41] with a dog we have so much exciting

[08:45] young puppy like shade the cone Corso or

TRANSCRIPTION:

[00:00] am I using the leash and a collar to
[00:02] communicate with him no today I'm going
[00:04] to show you how to teach your dog to
[00:06] heal click Thumbs Up Hit subscribe today
[00:10] I'm using two types of treats from my
[00:12] Bark Box one of these equals all of
[00:14] those also keep in mind if you have a
[00:16] dog who loves to chew or is teething or
[00:19] even destroying things super chewer box
[00:21] is where it's at these are the toughest
[00:24] toys you'll find Wallace is the star of
[00:27] our next series and he's definitely a
[00:29] super chewer dog but maybe your dog's
[00:30] more into plush toys you know the kind
[00:32] that are crinkly and squeak squeak there
[00:35] all of their toys have such varied
[00:38] different textures this has such a good
[00:40] weight to it you could launch this those
[00:42] are the little things that matter to me
[00:45] as someone who loves to interact with
[00:47] dogs here's the deal bark is going to
[00:49] give you a free Bark Box or a free super
[00:52] tour box when you sign up I'm going to
[00:55] have that link below where you can claim
[00:56] your free box and now let's use these
[00:58] treats and see how far we can get and
[01:00] shade's very first heel training session
[01:03] I'm going to really challenge shade
[01:04] today we are training in public so I'm
[01:06] going to allow him to sniff explore the
[01:08] environment to make sure he's nice and
[01:11] adjusted all these distractions the
[01:13] smells the base music and the sedan over
[01:16] here the airplane flying in right
[01:19] now here and look at that do I have
[01:21] attention with all the things going on
[01:24] yes now this is what we call loose leash
[01:26] walking basically this is what you need
[01:28] to be concerned with most of the the
[01:30] time with a vast majority of pets you're
[01:32] walking they're walking politely they
[01:34] might Meander left or right they're just
[01:37] exploring their environment healthfully
[01:39] heal which is where your dog stays right
[01:41] by your side because there are
[01:42] conditions for that sometimes a good
[01:44] heal is necessary for safety and other
[01:46] times it's fine to let your dog sniff
[01:48] and explore for example when you're in a
[01:50] busy area and you need your dog really
[01:51] close or you're approaching another dog
[01:53] and you want your dog on the opposite
[01:55] side to create a barrier it's really
[01:57] helpful for dogs with reactivity issues
[01:59] for example now the next thing we want
[02:01] to do in teaching this is get our dogs
[02:03] attention here yes this is something
[02:05] we've been working on pretty
[02:06] consistently with shade when I say here
[02:09] he's pretty accustomed to looking
[02:10] straight up at my eyes and receiving an
[02:12] amazing treat or a toy one way to help
[02:14] your dog out is to lure them to your
[02:16] side I'm going to lure him to my right
[02:19] side by guiding them with a treat really
[02:21] we're trying to line up their neck with
[02:22] the seam of our pants to stay right by
[02:24] our side all right cool we kind of have
[02:27] them on our right side I'm not trying to
[02:29] get him perfect or you can focus walking
[02:31] away from them and when they catch up to
[02:32] you and line up to that position you can
[02:35] say yes and give them a treat for his
[02:37] first lesson I'm not even focused on
[02:39] saying the word heal it's strictly
[02:41] communication through body language and
[02:43] marking when he's doing the right thing
[02:45] whoa boy all right went off the rails
[02:48] I'm going to back up just to kind of
[02:49] guide him back yes into
[02:52] position I'm only going to reward him
[02:54] when he's on my side here yes I'm going
[02:57] to try and reward in that specific Place
[02:59] see where the tree is there good really
[03:02] just focus on getting that one step of
[03:04] heal rather than 10 seconds of heal for
[03:06] example going to turn wait for him to
[03:09] come into position here I suspect he
[03:13] will yes see that that treat is going
[03:17] yes right there that's where he can
[03:19] expect to get the treat when we're doing
[03:21] this type of training if you start here
[03:22] you'll get that 10 seconds a lot quicker
[03:24] be super liberal about saying yes giving
[03:26] them a small piece of a treat for
[03:29] example one jerky treat will translate
[03:31] easily into 10 or more treats for me as
[03:34] you feel like you're starting to hit
[03:35] your flow with your dog you can start
[03:37] taking several steps am I jerking the
[03:39] leash am I using the leash and a collar
[03:41] to communicate with him no yes here yes
[03:45] I want him thinking about every move he
[03:47] makes this leash is just here to make
[03:49] sure that he doesn't get away from me oh
[03:52] whoa whoa whoa whoa what's going on
[03:57] here yes
[04:00] we've been really teaching him when he
[04:02] gets to the end of that leash to
[04:04] internalize that that equals come back
[04:06] here and get a treat and then let's try
[04:08] and stay a little bit closer to me okay
[04:11] he broke heel there I'm not going to
[04:13] correct him stay with me
[04:16] yes here
[04:20] yes
[04:22] here yes we want our dogs to be able to
[04:25] make Intelligent Decisions autonomously
[04:28] without having to be told every move to
[04:30] make yes even though his nose is going
[04:33] to the ground you give him a second that
[04:36] nose will come right back
[04:38] up watch yes he falls back into heel
[04:42] reminding yourself to keep that upbeat
[04:44] tone and keep things moving can
[04:47] completely restart and re-energize a
[04:49] training session picking up that energy
[04:51] a little bit look at the circles we're
[04:53] getting here on day one of heel training
[04:56] yes
[04:59] can he
[05:00] stop yes and gave me a Sit I'll take it
[05:04] your dog's bound to get distracted when
[05:06] you're teaching this that is okay he's
[05:08] distracted yes typically once dogs have
[05:11] satisfied their curiosity it's pretty
[05:13] easy to gently regain their attention
[05:15] with a treat or just making a
[05:17] sound here sit yes most people would be
[05:21] tempted to say no or pull the dog away
[05:23] and that's okay it's not the end of the
[05:24] world but if you can get their attention
[05:26] on you all the better here
[05:30] good
[05:32] okay leave it yes
[05:37] come real life leave
[05:40] it I didn't say no leave it I just said
[05:43] leave it come and even though you're
[05:46] seeing us do a lot of treating here
[05:48] every repetition can be a different
[05:49] experience especially when factors like
[05:51] location distractions and your dog's
[05:54] emotional state change in essence even
[05:56] if you think you're reinforcing
[05:58] something different each repetition has
[06:01] the potential to reinforce something
[06:03] slightly different in your dog's mind
[06:05] that's why we want to be there to create
[06:06] these amazing associations with the
[06:08] world they live in good
[06:11] man here look at all these turns yes
[06:16] here yes see how we snap back when I
[06:19] said here and as your dog starts to get
[06:21] the hang of this you can start
[06:23] incorporating turns look at the turn yes
[06:26] you see that turn see how he stayed with
[06:28] me on one side I'm really trying to hold
[06:31] his attention with my eyes and not
[06:33] really lure with a treat at this point
[06:35] but that would be fine for you to use a
[06:37] treat if you wanted to if your dog is
[06:39] healing on the right like this making a
[06:40] left turn will be a lot easier to teach
[06:42] because they kind of have to speed up to
[06:44] keep up with you letting them think it
[06:46] out conversely they have to slow down
[06:49] when you're making a right
[06:51] turn good man are we getting dizzy yet
[06:55] good
[07:00] you're doing great
[07:02] sir yes just be extra patient and find
[07:06] your Rhythm vary the speed actually
[07:07] seems to be working for him here you can
[07:10] try varying your speed walking a little
[07:12] faster walking a little slower this
[07:13] really teaches your dog good slowing
[07:16] down to adjust their pace and stay in
[07:18] that heel position no matter how you
[07:19] move as your dog starts to get more
[07:21] consistent even in the first training
[07:23] session like this how many yeses are we
[07:25] giving
[07:26] him right
[07:28] now you can start treating a lot less
[07:31] getting more steps in between the
[07:34] rewards good
[07:35] [Music]
[07:45] man
[07:47] yes I actually love the stand and that
[07:50] he's not going into a sit I want to
[07:52] instill that yes
[07:56] yes okay good man throughout this lesson
[07:59] you're seeing how we're combining
[08:00] various elements of his training so far
[08:03] we're combining look at me stay walk
[08:05] with me like we did on our leash walking
[08:07] lesson we're using elements of come when
[08:10] called This is days of training this is
[08:12] not months of training our main lesson
[08:14] out here has to do with training heel a
[08:17] new skill and working on some of the
[08:19] other stuff we've been doing the other
[08:22] perhaps more important objective is to
[08:24] allow him to experience the world too we

TITRE: Apprendre le rappel à son chien : 3 jeux pour apprendre en s’amusant !
CATÉGORIE: Non catégorisé
CONTENU:
Apprendre le rappel à son chien, autrement dit lui apprendre à revenir quand vous l’appelez est l’un des ordres les plus importants qu’il doit absolument maîtriser.Vous ne souhaitez peut-être pas faire de votre chien le prochain champion du monde de dressage, mais le rappel peut lui sauver la vie. En cas de danger vous devez pouvoir faire revenir votre chien en un clin d’oeil !Alors voici 3 jeux pour apprendre le rappel à son chien. Pratiquez-les régulièrement et votre chien maîtrisera le rappel très bientôt. BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Longe pour chien, idéal pour apprendre le rappel à son chien ! Seulement 12€ ! 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! Le rappel : facile à apprendre mais dur à maîtriserOn pourrait croire qu’apprendre le rappel à son chien est facile, et ça n’est pas complètement faux. Mais il y a une grosse différence entre apprendre le rappel à son chien et maîtriser le rappel.Lorsque vous êtes chez vous, que votre chien est tranquillement assis dans son panier, il viendra naturellement vers vous si vous l’appelez.Alors pourquoi apprendre le rappel à son chien puisqu’il le maîtrise déjà ?En réalité votre chien ne le maîtrise pas. Il suffit d’ajouter quelques distractions et il aura beaucoup plus de mal à revenir vers vous quand vous l’appelez.Si par exemple, votre chien est en train de jouer avec d’autres chiens et que vous l’appelez, il aura le choix entre jouer avec ses nouveaux amis ou vous rejoindre et donc mettre fin à la fête.Même si votre chien vous adore, il vit au moment présent et c’est très dur pour lui de s’arrêter.Il faut donc apprendre à votre chien que revenir vers vous sera toujours plus intéressant, plus amusant, plus agréable que ce qu’il est en train de faire. C’est le meilleur moyen d’apprendre le rappel à votre chien et surtout qu’il le maîtrise.Vous vous dîtes surement qu’il est difficile de rivaliser avec toutes les distractions qui croiseront la route de votre chien et vous avez raison, c’est toute la difficulté !C’est pour cette raison qu’on recommande très souvent de commencer l’apprentissage du rappel dès le début (comme pour la propreté du chiot) et continuer tout au long de la vie de votre chien à renforcer cet ordre avec des exercices.Les bases pour apprendre le rappel à son chien La première chose à faire est de choisir le mot que vous utiliserez pour le rappel. Vous ne pouvez pas crier le nom de votre chien et espérer qu’il revienne vers vous, il vous faut un mot clef qu’il associera au rappel.Libre à vous d’être original, ça ne dérangera pas votre chien. Si vous êtes plutôt classique vous avez le choix : ici, vient ici, aux pieds, come (pour les anglophones)…Une fois que vous avez choisi votre mot, il faut que votre chien l’associe à du positif. Le plus simple est d’utiliser des petites friandises. Choisissez vraiment des friandises dont votre chien raffole.Prenez en une vingtaine que vous allez lui donnez en l’espace de 30 secondes. Tout ce que vous avez à faire est de dire le mot clef et de donner une friandise.A ce stade, votre chien n’a pas besoin de venir vers vous, il doit être près de vous, en position debout, assis, couché. Du moment qu’il n’a pas de comportement dérangeant (aboyer, grogner, mordre) continuez l’exercice.Répétez deux fois par jour, pendant une semaine et votre chien aura entendu le mot clef et reçu une friandise 280 fois ! Faîtes le une semaine de plus et vous verrez que « ici » deviendra le mot préféré de votre chien.Avant de passer aux exercices, il ne vous reste plus qu’à vérifier que votre chien a bien compris votre mot clef. Cette fois-ci vous allez attendre que votre chien ne soit pas près de vous et ne vous regarde pas.Vous allez prononcer son nom puis votre mot clef. Votre chien doit réagir très rapidement, il doit tourner la tête vers vous et/ou venir vers vous. Si c’est le cas récompensez-le avec une friandise, des caresses et félicitez-le.Il a compris que votre mot clef vaut de l’or, il est temps de passer à des jeux un peu plus compliqués pour apprendre le rappel à votre chien ! Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! 3 jeux pour apprendre le rappel à son chien Il y a beaucoup de jeux pour apprendre le rappel à son chien et je vais vous en donner 3 qui sont très efficaces.Je parle bien de jeux car ces activités doivent rester agréables et amusantes pour votre chien.N’oubliez pas, si vous voulez que votre chien abandonne tout ce qu’il fait pour vous rejoindre quand vous l’appelez il doit associer le rappel à du positif et uniquement du positif.Avant de commencer voici quelques règles à respecter si votre chien ne revient pas tout de suite quand vous l’appelez :Baissez-vous quand vous le rappelez, ouvrez grand vos bras, mettez-y de la joie !Faîtes des petits sons (claquez vos mains sur vos cuisses, « des sons de baisers », …).Retournez-vous et courez dans le sens opposé (les chiens adorent chasser).Utilisez un jouet qui fait du bruit.Votre chien ne doit pas apprendre à ignorer votre rappel, c’est très important. Partez du principe que votre chien doit réussir chaque rappel.Commencez dans des endroits faciles sans distraction. Puis augmentez la difficulté mais gardez votre chien en laisse (une laisse assez longue évidemment). Ensuite choisissez un endroit calme et clos pour faire ces jeux sans laisse. Finalement vous pourrez tester votre chien en liberté totale !Jouez à cache cacheIl y a de fortes chances que ce soit le jeu préféré de votre chien. Vous connaissez déjà les règles et ce sont les mêmes quand vous jouez avec votre chien.Vous allez vous cacher (commencez par des endroits faciles) puis appelez votre chien. Les chiens adorent ce jeu car il fait appel à leur instinct de chercheur et ils adorent retrouver leur maître.Vous pourrez ensuite passer au niveau supérieur et faire ce jeu à plusieurs. Tout le monde se cache et chacun son tour appelle le chien.Attention, vous ne devez prononcer le mot clef qu’une seule fois ! Et n’oubliez pas de faire la fête à votre chien quand il vous trouve. Pratiquez ce jeu le plus souvent possible tout au long de la vie de votre chien.Jouez au Ping PongVous devez être 2 pour ce jeu, chacun d’un coté, éloigné de quelques mètres au départ.Chacun votre tour vous allez appeler votre chien. Attention, vous ne pouvez l’appeler qu’une seule fois. Si votre chien ne vient pas patientez tranquillement jusqu’à ce qu’il vienne.L’autre personne doit ignorer totalement le chien pour ne pas détourner son attention ou l’encourager à ne pas répondre à votre rappel. Quand votre chien revient félicitez-le, donnez lui quelques friandises. Ensuite c’est à l’autre personne de l’appeler.Vous pouvez également pratiquez seul avec une laisse assez longue. Laissez votre chien à quelques mètres, puis appelez-le. S’il vient récompensez-le et recommencez l’opération.Mais c’est beaucoup plus amusant à plusieurs !Le rappel retenuDemandez à une personne de retenir votre chien. Elle ne doit pas le caresser ou lui parler, elle doit juste le retenir.Placez-vous à quelques mètres et appelez votre chien. Il doit commencer à tirer sur la laisse ou le harnais. Après quelques secondes la personne relâche le chien et il doit normalement courir droit sur vous !Si vous avez appris l’ordre assis à votre chien vous pouvez pratiquer ce jeu seul. Demandez lui de s’asseoir et éloignez-vous de quelques pas (pas trop loin au départ souvenez-vous vous voulez qu’il réussisse).Ensuite appelez-le avec un maximum d’enthousiasme et félicitez le lorsqu’il vous a rejoint.Vous pouvez également corser les choses, comme on le pratique dans les concours de dressage.Il s’agit d’installer des distractions entre vous et votre chien (de la nourriture, des jouets ou toutes sortes d’objets). Si votre chien maîtrise le rappel il viendra vers vous sans jeter un oeil aux distractions.Attention si vous débutez l’apprentissage du rappel je vous recommande de commencer par les bases car cet exercice est très difficile (mais très amusant aussi, surtout quand le chien perd la tête).Vous verrez que même un chien parfaitement dressé a des moments d’absences ;-)Plus de conseils pour le rappelIl faut beaucoup de patience et de pratique pour apprendre le rappel à son chien ! C’est d’ailleurs valable pour tout ce qui touche à l’education canine.L’être humain est trop souvent impatient alors que son chien est pourtant sur la bonne voie, il va passer d’une technique à une autre au lieu de rester constant et simplement faire preuve de patience.C’est pour cette raison qu’il est préférable de choisir une bonne méthode d’éducation et de s’y tenir. Varier les exercices et les jeux est une bonne chose mais vous devez vous adapter au rythme d’apprentissage de votre chien.Aidez le progresser, ne placez pas la barre trop vite et trop haut. A l’inverse, ne le sous estimez pas non plus, votre chien s’ennuiera et cherchera des stimulations ailleurs.Si vous n’avez pas encore choisit de méthode d’education, je vous recommande la méthode Dresser son chien en 15 minutes par jour.Elle inclut tous les ordres de bases comme assis, couché, la marche en laisse ou le rappel mais aussi des ordres un peu plus complexes comme donner la patte ou ramper histoire de pimenter un peu les séances dès que votre chien sera prêt.Enfin, elle couvre également tous les problèmes les plus fréquents comme un chien qui saute sur les invités, aboie ou creuse des trous dans le jardin…Cette méthode est très complète et si vous n’êtes pas encore au point sur l’education de votre chien, je vous recommande de ne pas trop traîner et de vous éduquer le plus rapidement possible… Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour !

TITRE: Comment apprendre l’ordre assis à son chien ?
CATÉGORIE: Non catégorisé
CONTENU:
L’ordre «assis» fait partie de l’éducation de base du chien. L’ordre assis est donc utile dans la vie de tous les jours à la maison ou dans la rue et très important pour dresser son chien.Cela va vous permettre entre autre de le rappeler à l’ordre quand il saute sur les invités, de vous éloigner un moment de lui sans qu’il ne bouge, par exemple de rester sagement dehors quand vous entrez dans une boulangerie… BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! Plusieurs méthodes pour dresser son chien à l’ordre assisDresser son chien à l’ordre assis est assez facile et intuitif. Vous verrez que dès l’âge de 2 mois, votre chien sera très réceptif à l’ordre «assis» et vous avez plusieurs méthodes à votre disposition.Choisissez celle qui fonctionne le mieux pour vous et votre chien. Vous pouvez également utiliser les deux méthodes simultanément. Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! La méthode passive pour dresser son chien à l’ordre assisCette méthode demande beaucoup d’observation et de synchronisation. Chaque fois que vous verrez votre chien s’asseoir, dîtes-lui « assis » et félicitez-le pour le récompenser.Il faut donc bien anticiper le moment où votre chien va s’asseoir pour pouvoir dire «assis» au moment même où il est en train de le faire.Pourquoi ? Pour que votre chien associe le mot «assis» et la récompense à cette position.Le chien a une mauvaise notion du temps. Donc si vous dîtes l’ordre « assis » trop tôt avant qu’il ne le fasse ou trop tard après qu’il se soit assis, le chien ne pourra pas associer la bonne position avec le mot assis.On dit que cette méthode est passive parce qu’on attend que le chien s’assoit naturellement de lui-même pour lui apprendre l’ordre. Cette méthode pour dresser son chien demande énormément de patience.Pour éviter d’observer votre chien toute la journée et de regarder à quel moment il va s’asseoir, il est aussi possible de provoquer la position assise chez votre chien. C’est la méthode active par opposition à la méthode passive.La méthode active pour dresser son chien à l’ordre assis Vous pouvez faire asseoir votre chien de plusieurs manières naturelles, c’est-à–dire sans contraintes physiques (appuyer sur sa croupe en est une pour le chien).Vous avez probablement remarqué que votre chien qui lève la tête de plus en plus en arrière a tendance à s’asseoir de lui-même. C’est une question d’équilibre.Il vous suffit tout simplement de vous munir d’une friandise et de la tendre au-dessus du nez de votre chien qui va lever la tête pour la regarder.Amenez alors la friandise vers la croupe de votre chien. Pour la regarder, votre chien va devoir lever la tête en arrière et donc s’asseoir. Les chiens s’assoient instinctivement quand on leur fait cet exercice et n’ont pas l’idée de se retourner.Il ne vous reste plus qu’à dire « assis » au moment où votre chien s’assoit et à lui donner la friandise.Puis passez à l’étape suivante en supprimant la friandise et en levant votre doigt au-dessus de la tête de votre chien. Quand il s’assoit, dîtes « assis » et félicitez-le.En dernière phase d’apprentissage, dîtes seulement « assis » sans avoir à faire lever la tête de votre chien en arrière. Quand il s’assoit, félicitez-le ! Voilà, vous venez de dresser votre chien à l’ordre « assis ! »Quelques trucs et astuces pour l’ordre assisEvitez d’appuyer sur sa croupe pour le faire asseoir. On n’utilise jamais la force pour dresser son chienLe chien résiste et essaie au contraire de se relever. Même si par la force, vous arrivez à le faire asseoir, votre chien va le ressentir comme une contrainte et ne va donc plus la rechercher naturellement.Si votre chien a tendance à sauter sur la friandise plutôt qu’à lever la tête et à s’asseoir, essayez de faire lever sa tête avec votre main puis touchez l’articulation de sa patte arrière (entre la cuisse et la jambe) pour le faire asseoir.Dernier conseil : faîtes preuve de patience. Apprendre l’ordre assis à son chien est assez rapide et logiquement votre chiot ou votre chien saura très prochainement s’asseoir lorsque vous lui demanderez.Dresser son chien à l’ordre assis est souvent la première étape de l’apprentissage d’un chien (souvent la plus facile) et n’hésitez pas à travailler cette ordre en même temps que d’autres. Vous pouvez par exemple travaillez l’ordre couché dans la foulée.En revanche attention de garder des sessions courtes et fun. L’objectif est que votre chien apprécie ces moments avec vous et de construire votre relation de confiance.Si vous cherchez une méthode complète et simple à mettre en oeuvre, je vous recommande la méthode « Dresser son chien en 15 minutes par jour ». Vous n’aurez plus qu’à vous laisser guider et pratiquer simplement les nombreux jeux / exercices avec votre chien à votre rythme pour qu’il soit bien éduqué et établir une relation forte avec lui.Cliquez ici pour découvrir la méthode « Dresser son chien en 15 Minutes par jour » Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour !

Ils sont ultra absorbants et dotés d’un gel qui va à la fois retenir l’humidité et les odeurs.Pour que votre chiot puisse l’utiliser confortablement certains tapis de propreté sont munis d’adhésif.Ainsi, même si votre chiot est un peu brutal quand il fait ses besoins, le tapis restera en place.Vous pouvez également choisir un kit complet comme celui de la marque Savic dans lequel vous trouverez à la fois une caisse en plastique et des tapis absorbants.La caisse en plastique évitera tout contact entre les excréments de votre chiot et le sol.A première vue, un tapis de propreté est très pratique et vous permettra de limiter la casse le temps que votre chiot devienne propre.Mais sont-ils vraiment une aide pour la propreté du chiot, comme on le voit souvent dans les descriptifs des produits ?Tapis de propreté : bonne ou mauvaise idée ?Certains maîtres choisissent de laisser leur chien faire ses besoins à l’intérieur et dans ces cas là un tapis de propreté est très utile.En revanche si vous souhaitez apprendre à votre chiot à faire ses besoins dehors un tapis de propreté n’est pas obligatoire.Un jeune chiot n’a pas encore le contrôle de sa vessie et l’une des premières étapes pour le rendre propre est de l’aider à développer ses muscles progressivement pour qu’il puisse se retenir.Un tapis de propreté aura l’effet inverse puisque votre chiot pourra faire ses besoins quand il le veut.Autre point négatif : vous allez autoriser votre chiot à faire ses besoins à l’intérieur.Il est très difficile pour un chiot de comprendre qu’il peut faire à l’intérieur mais que vous préférez qu’il fasse à l’extérieur. Utiliser un tapis de propreté va donc créer de la confusion pour votre chiot.Pour ces deux raisons, un tapis de propreté ne va pas aider votre chiot à devenir propre mais au contraire va retarder son apprentissage.Donc si vous pouvez vous en passer, c’est à dire que vous êtes chez vous la plupart du temps et que vous avez la possibilité de sortir votre chiot à chaque fois qu’il en a besoin, n’utilisez surtout pas de tapis de propreté, ils ralentiront le développement de votre chiot.En revanche si vous ne pouvez pas sortir votre chiot à chaque fois qu’il en a besoin (si vous travaillez à temps plein par exemple) un tapis de propreté vous sera très utile. Mais il vous faudra un peu plus de temps pour rendre votre chiot entièrement propre.Autre cas dans lequel un tapis de propreté est obligatoire : votre chiot n’a pas encore fini ses vaccins. Ne prenez pas le risque de sortir votre chiot si c’est le cas, c’est très important puisque votre chiot peut en mourir, utilisez un tapis de propreté provisoirement. Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! Bien utiliser les tapis de propretéInstallez le tapis de propreté dans une pièce carrelée de préférence pour vous faciliter le nettoyage. Même si vous utilisez une caisse en plastique, il y a de fortes chances que votre chiot ne vise pas très bien.Placez votre tapis de propreté loin des gamelles de votre chiot et de sa caisse ou de son couchage.Par instinct votre chiot ne fera jamais ses besoins à l’endroit où il dort et mange et vous devez absolument faire en sorte qu’il conserve cet instinct très utile pour lui apprendre la propreté.N’installez pas de tapis à chaque coin de votre maison ou appartement, votre chiot doit bien comprendre qu’il peut faire ses besoins à un endroit précis.Pour bien faire comprendre à votre chiot qu’il doit faire ses besoins sur le tapis, il vous suffit de l’imprégner de l’odeur de ses excréments avant de l’installer.Pour cela vous pouvez frotter un tapis neuf sur un tapis souillé ou au dernier endroit où votre chiot à fait ses besoins.Nettoyez régulièrement, l’endroit doit rester propre. Si possible ne nettoyez pas devant votre chiot. Si vous souhaitez que votre chiot apprenne à faire ses besoins dehors et que vous utilisez des tapis provisoirement ne le félicitez pas quand il fait ses besoins dessus. Gardez vos félicitations pour le jour où il fera dehors comme un bon chien propre.Une alternative au tapis de propreté De nombreux maîtres se tournent vers les tapis de propreté pour apprendre la propreté à leur chiot. Nous avons vu que dans de nombreux cas, ça n’est pas la meilleure solution.Pour le prix d’un kit de propreté (caisse et tapis) vous pouvez acquérir une méthode d’éducation qui vous aidera pour apprendre la propreté à votre chiot.En plus de la propreté, vous apprendrez également toutes les bonnes techniques pour éduquer votre chiot comme la marche en laisse, le rappel, éviter les mordillements, de sauter sur les invités, les aboiements et bien d’autres choses…Si vous avez du mal à rendre votre chiot propre sachez que cette méthode a déjà aidé de nombreux maîtres et de nombreux chiots !Apprendre la propreté à son chiot n’est pas si compliqué et les accessoires ne vous seront d’aucune utilité. Pour tout ce qui concerne le dressage d’un chien, il vous faut surtout une bonne méthode, de la rigueur et de la patience.En ce qui concerne la rigueur et la patience je ne peux pas faire grand chose pour vous ;-) En revanche pour la bonne méthode vous savez maintenant où la trouver… Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour !

TITRE: Les 7 règles d’or pour éduquer son chien
CATÉGORIE: Non catégorisé
CONTENU:
Il y a beaucoup de choses à apprendre pour éduquer son chien, mais il faut commencer par maîtriser les règles de base. Une fois que vous les aurez assimilées, éduquer votre chien sera beaucoup plus facile pour vous et surtout pour votre chien.Alors voici les 7 règles d’or à connaître pour éduquer son chien… BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! La positive attitude !Pour éduquer son chien, la méthode la plus efficace est de récompenser les bons comportements et d’ignorer/rediriger les mauvais.Je dis souvent qu’éduquer son chien rend meilleur car vous allez développer une capacité à repérer tout ce qu’il fait de bien.Petit à petit cette habitude peut s’élargir à tout votre entourage, vos enfants, vos amis, vos collègues…Et c’est ainsi que vous devenez une personne positive et appréciée de tous. Mais revenons à l’éducation de votre chien…Soyez patientIl faut de la patience pour éduquer son chien, c’est une qualité primordiale.Vous serez souvent surpris de voir à quel point votre chien peut apprendre certaines choses très vite et d’autres un peu plus lentement. Dans tous les cas faites preuve de patience car votre chien fait de son mieux.Ne tombez pas dans le piège des méthodes d’éducations « dures » qui utilisent la force, l’intimidation, la domination, la violence…Elles donnent l’impression d’être efficaces à court terme mais à long terme c’est tout le contraire.Ces méthodes détruisent la relation de confiance entre vous et votre chien et elles créent des troubles souvent plus importants que ceux que vous pensiez avoir réglés.Soyez régulier Pour éduquer son chien, il faut être régulier. Votre chien apprend par répétition. Plus vous répétez, plus il comprendra. Choisissez une méthode d’éducation positive et soyez régulier.Pour éduquer votre chien à s’asseoir, choisissez un mot clef (assis par exemple), un geste de la main et répétez, répétez, répétez.Essayez de garder la même tonalité de voix, plus vous êtes constant et mieux c’est. N’oubliez pas non plus de communiquer avec tous ceux qui participent à l’éducation de votre chien, mettez vous d’accord pour utiliser les mêmes règles.C’est beaucoup plus facile d’éduquer son chien si tout le monde est sur la même longueur d’onde. Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! Mettez-vous dans les pattes de votre chienPour bien éduquer son chien, il faut essayer de se mettre à sa place.Cela demande un peu de connaissance sur la façon dont fonctionne un chien, ses instincts, la façon dont il utilise ses sens… mais croyez-moi les choses seront beaucoup plus faciles pour vous et votre chien.Je me souviens d’un maître qui n’arrivait pas à apprendre la propreté à son chiot. Tous les soirs en rentrant du travail, il était de corvée de serpillère.Sauf que ce monsieur utilisait de la javel pour nettoyer (la javel incite un chiot à uriner). Evidemment, ça ne se devine pas. Cette simple information a changé la vie de ce maître et de son chien pour mon plus grand plaisir !Moralité de l’histoire : pour éduquer son chien, il faut avant tout s’éduquer soi même.Apprendre à écouter pour mieux éduquer son chienJe dis souvent que les chiens parlent à ceux qui savent écouter. Pour éduquer son chien, il vaut mieux savoir écouter.Pour reprendre l’exemple de la propreté, j’explique souvent qu’un chien prévient son maître avant de faire ses besoins.Il a son propre langage à lui, un langage corporel le plus souvent.Là encore, inutile de vous dire que découvrir le langage corporel de son chien est une véritable révélation pour certains maîtres, surtout pour l’apprentissage de la propreté.Apprendre à observer et à écouter votre chien vous aidera énormément pour l’éduquer.Surveillez la santé de son chienUn chien qui n’est pas en forme aura du mal à apprendre quelque chose.Votre chien a besoin d’exercice physique régulier pour être en forme et c’est aussi un très bon moyen de créer du lien avec lui.Attention également à la nourriture que vous lui donnez. Une mauvaise alimentation peut entraîner des troubles de santé mais aussi des troubles du comportement.N’oubliez pas de brosser les dents de votre chien et de l’emmener régulièrement voir le vétérinaire.Il est beaucoup plus facile d’éduquer son chien lorsqu’il est en pleine forme !Eduquer son chien tout au long de sa vieUn chien a besoin d’être stimulé mentalement. Eduquer son chien est l’une des meilleures réponses à ce besoin.Certains maitres arrêtent d’éduquer leur chien une fois qu’il maîtrise quelques ordres de base. C’est une erreur qui engendre des problèmes. Votre chien est heureux d’avoir quelque chose à faire.Demandez lui de s’asseoir, de se coucher, de faire le mort et il sera heureux. Faites lui également découvrir de nouvelles choses, de nouveaux objets, de nouveaux environnements, de nouvelles odeurs…Continuez de l’éduquer, de lui apprendre de nouvelles choses et de renforcer les anciennes. L’éducation de votre chien ne doit pas avoir de fin !Démarrer au plus vite l’éducation de votre chienVous avez énormément de choses à apprendre pour éduquer votre chien. Plus vous démarrez votre apprentissage rapidement, plus l’apprentissage de votre chien sera facile.Croyez-en mon expérience, il est bien plus facile d’apprendre les bonnes choses à son chien dès le départ que de rectifier les mauvaises habitudes qu’il prendra forcément si vous ne savez pas comment l’éduquer.Si vous souhaitez réellement prendre en main l’éducation de votre chien, je vous recommande la formation Dresser son chien en 15 minutes par jour.Elle contient toutes les notions théoriques pour comprendre votre chien mais aussi des tonnes d’exercices / jeux à pratiquer quelques minutes par jour pour non seulement avoir un chien parfaitement éduqué mais en plus renforcer vos liens avec lui. C’est à mon avis le meilleur cadeau que vous pouvez faire à votre chien ! Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour !

CONTENU:
On n’aimerais pouvoir ralentir la croissance de nos chiens pour qu’ils restent de petites boules de poils un peu plus longtemps mais malheureusement c’est impossible. En revanche, il peut être très utile de savoir à quel âge leur croissance se terminent.C’est notamment utile si vous souhaitez gâter votre chien et investir dans un collier ou un panier haut de gamme. Ou par exemple pour choisir la diète de votre chien, la quantité d’exercice dont il a besoin…Alors voici un peu plus d’informations sur la croissance de votre chien… BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! Fin de croissance des petites races de chiens Les petites races de chiens finissent leur croissance assez rapidement. Ils sont également matures sexuellement plus rapidement que les races de grands chiens.En même temps c’est assez logique qu’un chihuahua finisse sa croissance plus rapidement qu’un dogue allemand.En règle général, un chien de petite race finira sa croissance entre 8 et 12 mois.Pendant cette période, votre chien va perdre sa fourrure de chiot et développer sa fourrure d’adulte.Il va aussi atteindre sa taille et son poids d’adulte. Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! Fin de croissance des races de chiens moyennes Les races de chiens de tailles moyennes ont une croissance assez similaires aux petites races. Entre 8 et 12 mois votre chien aura terminé sa croissance.En règle générale, ces chiens grandissent beaucoup la première année et il faut donc être très attentif à leurs besoins pendant cette période (par la suite aussi évidemment mais les besoins de votre chien devraient diminuer).Certaines races auront fini leur croissance en 8 mois et d’autres nécessiteront l’année complète.Pour la taille et le poids adulte, cela dépend vraiment de la race et il vaut mieux vous rapprocher de l’éleveur ou de votre vétérinaire pour connaître la taille adulte de votre futur chien.Fin de croissance des races de grands chiens Les races de grands chiens ont beaucoup plus de travail à fournir pour atteindre leur taille et leur poids adulte.Il est donc normal que leur croissance soit plus longue. En règle générale, ils finiront leur croissance entre 10 et 16 mois.Pendant cette période, ils auront atteint leur taille adulte même si certains chiens continueront légèrement de grandir.Soyez particulièrement attentif aux besoins nutritifs de ces races de chiens.Comme pour nous, la croissance des chiens n’est pas régulière. Certains grandissent plus vite que d’autres. Soyez patient et sachez que l’idéal est de demander à votre vétérinaire lors de la consultation annuelle de votre chien.

TITRE: Arrivée d’un chiot : premier jour et nuit
CATÉGORIE: Non catégorisé
CONTENU:
L’arrivée d’un chiot chez soi est un moment magique.En revanche pour votre chiot les choses sont un peu plus difficiles à gérer. Suivez ces quelques conseils pour faire en sorte que ce moment soit aussi merveilleux pour vous que pour lui.L’arrivée de votre chiot va se dérouler en deux étapes : le premier jour et surtout la première nuit. Chacune d’entre elles demandent un minimum de préparation… BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! Le premier jour de votre chiot à la maison Pour votre chiot ce premier jour est surtout un grand moment de stress, probablement le plus grand stress qu’il ai connut.Votre chiot vient de perdre sa mère, ses frères et sœurs, et sa maison. Même si vous êtes évidemment prêt à lui fournir toute l’affection dont il a besoin, votre chiot aura besoin d’un petit temps d’adaptation (ça n’est pas le moment de commencer à le dresser ;-).Donc laissez le découvrir à son rythme, ne le bousculez pas, et n’oubliez pas de prévenir le reste de la famille (surtout les enfants si vous en avez) qu’il est préférable de le laisser tranquille pour son premier jour.Soyez surtout attentif au sommeil de votre chiot.Un chiot a besoin de repos régulièrement et il est important qu’il puisse se reposer dans un endroit calme sans être dérangé. Mise à part ça, il n’y a pas vraiment d’inquiétude à avoir. Si vous avez sécurisé votre maison avant l’arrivée de votre chiot et que vous avez les accessoires indispensables pour votre chiot il ne vous reste plus qu’à vous asseoir et l’observer évoluer dans son nouvel environnement.Les choses vont se corser quand la nuit va tomber… Votre chien mérite le meilleur départ ! Ne ratez pas notre ebook essentiel⤹ Prénom * Email * La première nuit de votre chiot à la maison Votre chiot avait l’habitude de se coucher avec sa petite famille pour lui tenir chaud et c’est évidemment à ça qu’il va penser à l’heure d’aller se coucher.Il se sentira seul et un peu stressé par ce nouvel environnement.Rassurez-vous si vous appliquez l’une de ces méthodes ça passera très vite et surtout votre chiot dormira rapidement à l’endroit où vous le souhaitez.Première nuit « à la dure »C’est la méthode classique mais parfois difficile à réaliser pour certains d’entre nous.Il suffit d’installer le panier de votre chiot dans la pièce où vous souhaitez qu’il dorme. Laissez un tissu avec votre odeur dans son panier, l’idéal étant un tissu provenant de chez l’éleveur avec l’odeur de sa mère et du reste de sa famille pour qu’il se sente en confiance.Si votre éleveur ne vous a rien fournit sachez qu’il existe des sprays contenant des phéromones d’apaisement que votre vétérinaire pourra vous fournir si vraiment votre chien est trop stressé et qu’il a du mal à s’habituer à sa nouvelle maison. Une goutte dans le panier de votre chiot et celui-ci se sentira apaisé et en sécurité.Avant d’aller se coucher, n’oubliez pas le diner de votre chiot, la ballade pour faire ses besoins et même de jouer avec lui pour le fatiguer un peu.Ensuite emmenez le dans son panier et quittez la pièce. Il est fort probable que votre chiot se mette à pleurer.C’est la partie difficile de cette méthode. Malheureusement si vous céder et retournez voir votre chiot pour le consoler, vous lui aurez appris qu’il suffit de pleurer pour obtenir ce qu’il veut et les choses risques d’être très compliquées par la suite.Donc vous aurez besoin d’être solide et le reste de votre famille aussi (dresser son chien est parfois une épreuve). N’oubliez pas non plus de prévenir vos voisins de l’arrivée de votre chiot et des éventuels bruits la nuit qui ne dureront pas.Première nuit en douceur Cette méthode est moins dure psychologiquement. Il s’agit d’installer le panier de votre chiot dans votre chambre pour la première nuit.Ensuite au fur et à mesure que votre chien s’habitue à son nouvel environnement vous pourrez éloigner son panier.Commencez près de votre lit, puis dans un coin de votre chambre, puis dans le couloir, et ainsi de suite jusqu’à ce qu’il finisse dans la pièce ou vous souhaitez le faire dormir.Avec cette méthode vous éviterez surement les pleurs de votre chiot.En revanche il est parfois difficile d’éloigner le panier de votre chiot même si vous le faîtes de façon progressive. Au final, certains d’entre vous seront donc obligés d’appliquer la première méthode.Faites de beaux rêves avec votre chiot… Votre chien mérite le meilleur départ !

TITRE: Peut-on donner du potiron à un chien ? Oui, mais il y a des subtilités !
CATÉGORIE: Non catégorisé
CONTENU:
La réponse courte est oui : le potiron est non seulement sans danger pour les chiens, mais il est même bénéfique s’il est bien préparé ! Le potiron, en plus d’être riche en nutriments, peut être une excellente source de fibres et de vitamines pour nos compagnons à quatre pattes.Cependant, avant de sauter dans la préparation d’un festin automnal pour votre chien, voyons en détail les avantages, précautions, et meilleures façons de donner du potiron à votre chien. BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! Le potiron, une mine de nutriments pour votre chienLe potiron regorge de nutriments essentiels, comme les vitamines A, C et E, ainsi que des minéraux tels que le potassium et le fer. Ces éléments jouent un rôle important dans la santé oculaire, le renforcement du système immunitaire et le maintien de la peau et du pelage de votre chien.Le potiron est aussi peu calorique, parfait pour les chiens qui doivent surveiller leur poids. Par exemple, j’ai souvent recommandé le potiron pour des chiens en surpoids, comme mon client Max, un labrador retriever gourmand mais en surpoids. En remplaçant une partie de sa ration de croquettes par du potiron, Max a pu retrouver un poids santé tout en étant rassasié.Une étude menée par l’université d’Helsinki montre que les fibres du potiron aident à améliorer la digestion et peuvent être particulièrement bénéfiques pour les chiens ayant des problèmes intestinaux. Les fibres solubles du potiron agissent en régulant la digestion, ce qui peut être utile pour un chien souffrant de constipation légère ou de diarrhée.Comment préparer le potiron pour votre chienCru ou cuit ?Il est préférable de cuire le potiron pour le rendre plus facile à digérer. Évitez de donner le potiron cru, car sa texture fibreuse peut être difficile à mâcher et à digérer pour certains chiens. La cuisson à la vapeur est une bonne méthode, car elle conserve les nutriments tout en ramollissant la chair.Peut-on manger la peau du potiron ?Il vaut mieux éviter ! La peau du potiron, bien que comestible, est plus difficile à digérer pour un chien, en particulier pour les petites races comme les chihuahuas ou les teckels, dont le système digestif est plus délicat.Quelle quantité de potiron pour un chien ?En général, une cuillère à soupe de purée de potiron est suffisante pour un chien de taille moyenne. Pour les chiens plus petits comme le shih tzu ou le bouledogue français, réduisez la portion à une demi-cuillère. Pour les grandes races comme le berger allemand ou le golden retriever, deux cuillères à soupe peuvent convenir.Pour les chiots :Introduisez le potiron de manière progressive et en petites quantités, car leur système digestif est encore en développement.Les chiens seniors :Pour les chiens plus âgés, comme Rex, un vieux cocker spaniel que j’ai accompagné, le potiron a aidé à soulager ses problèmes digestifs liés à l’âge. En intégrant une petite quantité de potiron dans son alimentation, Rex a retrouvé une digestion plus stable et un regain d’énergie.Une recette simple de purée de potiron pour chienSi vous souhaitez régaler votre compagnon, voici une petite recette que j’ai souvent recommandée :Ingrédients : 100 g de potiron cuit (à la vapeur ou bouilli), une pincée de curcuma (antioxydant naturel) et une petite cuillère de yaourt nature (pour des probiotiques qui soutiennent la digestion).Préparation : Écrasez le potiron cuit pour en faire une purée, ajoutez le curcuma et le yaourt. Mélangez bien et servez cette purée comme complément au repas principal.Potiron et particularités de raceIl est intéressant de noter que certaines races semblent bénéficier davantage des bienfaits digestifs du potiron. Les races prédisposées aux sensibilités digestives, comme les bouviers bernois ou les bergers australiens, peuvent voir une amélioration de leur transit avec un peu de potiron dans leur alimentation.Attention cependant aux races comme le bouledogue anglais, qui ont souvent des estomacs plus sensibles : intégrez le potiron en très petites quantités pour éviter tout désagrément.Conclusion : le potiron, un ami pour votre chien ?En somme, peut-on donner du potiron à un chien ? Oui, et c’est même une excellente idée si l’on respecte quelques règles simples ! Que vous ayez un petit bichon frisé ou un grand danois, le potiron, préparé et servi en petites quantités, peut offrir des bienfaits nutritionnels intéressants.Alors pourquoi ne pas essayer cette petite touche automnale dans la gamelle de votre chien ? Vous verrez, il pourrait bien en devenir friand !Si vous avez des anecdotes à partager ou des questions supplémentaires, laissez un commentaire ci-dessous – je serai ravi de vous lire et d’y répondre. Après tout, chaque chien a sa personnalité, et qui mieux que son humain pour connaître ses goûts !

Il est très important de nettoyer les yeux de son chien. Avec la bonne méthode c’est très simple à faire et ça évitera des problèmes de santé à votre chien.Découvrons ensemble pourquoi vous devez nettoyer les yeux de votre chien, à quelle fréquence, le matériel nécessaire et surtout comment faire… BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! Pourquoi nettoyer les yeux d’un chien ?Les yeux d’un chien fonctionnent un peu comme les yeux de l’homme. Ils produisent des larmes pour se protéger, lubrifier et se nettoyer.La production et l’évacuation des larmes sont assurées par l’appareil lacrymal. Les larmes sont produites par des glandes.Elles sont ensuite réparties sur l’œil grâce aux clignements de paupières puis évacuées par les conduits naso-lacrymaux qui traversent le museau de votre chien.Lorsque ce conduit est bouché les larmes ne s’évacuent pas et coulent à l’extérieur de l’œil ce qui entraine la décoloration des poils au coin interne de l’œil.Dans certains cas les conduits naso-lacrymaux peuvent s’infecter et vont nécessiter une visite chez le vétérinaire et parfois une intervention chirurgicale.Il est donc très important de nettoyer les yeux de son chien régulièrement pour que les larmes s’évacuent correctement. C’est à la fois une question d’esthétique mais aussi de santé. De plus ce simple geste peut vous permettre de détecter rapidement l’apparition d’une maladie plus grave. Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! A quelle fréquence nettoyer les yeux d’un chien ?Malheureusement la fréquence de nettoyage des yeux d’un chien n’est pas quelque chose de fixe.Certaines races de chiens (celles au crâne globuleux ou celles au « nez écrasé ») ont des canaux lacrymaux qui se bouchent très facilement et nécessitent un nettoyage fréquent.L’activité de votre chien est également un facteur déterminant. Si vous faîtes de longue balade avec lui en extérieur, les yeux de votre chien sont exposés à de nombreuses impuretés (pollen, poussières…) et nécessite également un nettoyage fréquent.D’une manière générale nettoyez les yeux de votre chien uniquement lorsqu’il y a des sécrétions. Si vous constatez que les impuretés reviennent rapidement ou que les larmes de votre chien s’écoulent à l’extérieur de son œil augmenter le nombre de nettoyage.Comment nettoyer les yeux d’un chien ? Pour nettoyer les yeux de votre chien préférez des lingettes, le sopalin peut contenir des substances nocives et les filaments du coton peuvent irriter les yeux de votre chien.Il existe différents produit adaptés pour nettoyer les yeux de votre chien. Vous trouverez tout ce qu’il vous faut chez votre vétérinaire.Comme expliqué dans la vidéo n’hésitez pas à démarrer très tôt le nettoyage des yeux pour que votre chien s’y habitue. Allez y en douceur, les yeux de votre chien sont des organes sensibles et vous ne voulez surtout pas le traumatiser.Prendre soin des yeux de votre chien est un bon moyen de resserrer les liens entre lui et vous.Suivez toujours le même rituel : présenter et faire sentir le matériel, rester calme, nettoyer en douceur et féliciter par la parole, une caresse et une friandise.Répéter à chaque fois cette méthode facilitera les choses à chaque nouveau nettoyage. Votre chien assimilera le nettoyage de ses yeux à quelque chose de positif.Un chien habitué à se faire nettoyer les yeux sera beaucoup plus facile à soigner en cas de maladie des yeux plus sérieuses.A vous de nettoyer les yeux de votre chien maintenant !

On n’aimerais pouvoir ralentir la croissance de nos chiens pour qu’ils restent de petites boules de poils un peu plus longtemps mais malheureusement c’est impossible. En revanche, il peut être très utile de savoir à quel âge leur croissance se terminent.C’est notamment utile si vous souhaitez gâter votre chien et investir dans un collier ou un panier haut de gamme. Ou par exemple pour choisir la diète de votre chien, la quantité d’exercice dont il a besoin…Alors voici un peu plus d’informations sur la croissance de votre chien… BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! Fin de croissance des petites races de chiens Les petites races de chiens finissent leur croissance assez rapidement. Ils sont également matures sexuellement plus rapidement que les races de grands chiens.En même temps c’est assez logique qu’un chihuahua finisse sa croissance plus rapidement qu’un dogue allemand.En règle général, un chien de petite race finira sa croissance entre 8 et 12 mois.Pendant cette période, votre chien va perdre sa fourrure de chiot et développer sa fourrure d’adulte.Il va aussi atteindre sa taille et son poids d’adulte. Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! Fin de croissance des races de chiens moyennes Les races de chiens de tailles moyennes ont une croissance assez similaires aux petites races. Entre 8 et 12 mois votre chien aura terminé sa croissance.En règle générale, ces chiens grandissent beaucoup la première année et il faut donc être très attentif à leurs besoins pendant cette période (par la suite aussi évidemment mais les besoins de votre chien devraient diminuer).Certaines races auront fini leur croissance en 8 mois et d’autres nécessiteront l’année complète.Pour la taille et le poids adulte, cela dépend vraiment de la race et il vaut mieux vous rapprocher de l’éleveur ou de votre vétérinaire pour connaître la taille adulte de votre futur chien.Fin de croissance des races de grands chiens Les races de grands chiens ont beaucoup plus de travail à fournir pour atteindre leur taille et leur poids adulte.Il est donc normal que leur croissance soit plus longue. En règle générale, ils finiront leur croissance entre 10 et 16 mois.Pendant cette période, ils auront atteint leur taille adulte même si certains chiens continueront légèrement de grandir.Soyez particulièrement attentif aux besoins nutritifs de ces races de chiens.Comme pour nous, la croissance des chiens n’est pas régulière. Certains grandissent plus vite que d’autres. Soyez patient et sachez que l’idéal est de demander à votre vétérinaire lors de la consultation annuelle de votre chien.

Il est communément admis qu’un chien vieilli 7 fois plus vite qu’un homme. Il suffirait donc de multiplier par 7 l’âge de votre chien pour obtenir l’âge correspondant à un humain.En réalité cette méthode n’est pas très précise car de nombreux paramètres entrent en compte dans l’âge du chien et peuvent entrainer de grosses variations.Voici donc un peu plus d’informations sur le sujet et un tableau de correspondance de l’âge du chien par rapport à l’homme qui vous apportera plus de précisions.L’un des facteurs les plus importants dans l’âge du chien est son poids.Nous avons donc réalisé un tableau qui prend en compte cet élément pour avoir une idée un peu plus précise de l’âge du chien.Vous verrez que les résultats sont parfois très différents de ceux obtenus en multipliant l’âge de votre chien par 7.Age de votre chienPoids de votre chien– de 15kg Entre 15 et 40 kg+ de 40 kg6 mois15 ans10 ans8 ans1 an20 ans18 ans14 ans1,5 ans25 ans21 ans18 ans2 ans28 ans27 ans22 ans3 ans32 ans33 ans31 ans4 ans36 ans39 ans40 ans5 ans40 ans45 ans49 ans6 ans44 ans51 ans58 ans7 ans48 ans57 ans67 ans8 ans52 ans63 ans76 ans9 ans56 ans69 ans85 ans10 ans60 ans75 ans96 ans11 ans64 ans80 ans105 ans12 ans68 ans85 ans112 ans13 ans72 ans90 ans120 ans14 ans76 ans96 ans15 ans80 ans102 ans16 ans84 ans110 ans17 ans88 ans18 ans94 ans19 ans100 ans20 ans110 ans Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour !

Comment utiliser le tableau de correspondance d’âge du chien?Tout d’abord, déterminez la catégorie à laquelle appartient votre chien.Pour les chiens de moins de 15 kilos, on trouve entre autres les Yorkshires, Cockers, Teckels, CKC, Westies, Shih Tzus, Bichons, Caniches, Beagles, Fox terriers, Cotons de Tuléar, Cairn Terriers, Whippets, Chichuahuas…Pour les chiens de 15 à 40 kilos, citons notamment les Bergers allemands, Labradors, Setters, Epagneuls, Bergers Belges, Golden Retrievers, Beaucerons, Braques, Boxers, Dobermans, Bassets, Colleys, Briards, Husky…Et, enfin pour les chiens de plus de 40 kilos, il y a en particulier les Dogues, Bouviers bernois, Terre-Neuves, Leonbergs, Saint-Bernards, Montagnes des Pyrénées…A 6 mois, la maturité d’un Golden Retriever (catégorie des chiens entre 15kg et 40kg) correspond à celle d’un enfant de 10 ans et ainsi de suite.Ces chiffres sont une moyenne générale, la maturité et le vieillissement suivent des courbes différentes selon la taille du chien.Par exemple, les gros chiens mûrissent plus lentement mais vieillissent plus vite et leur durée moyenne de vie est généralement inférieure de 25% à celle des plus petits chiens.A 2 ans, un Saint-Bernard est beaucoup plus jeune psychologiquement et physiquement qu’un caniche du même âge. Mais à 6 ans, c’est le contraire, le Saint-Bernard sera plus mâture et plus vieux physiquement qu’un caniche du même âge.Un chien de grandes races ou qui vit à l’extérieur soumis aux aléas du climat ou qui fait beaucoup d’exercices a une durée de vie plus courte qu’un chien de petites races ou un chien d’appartement.Alors, dîtes-moi quel âge a votre chien ? Quand votre chien entrera dans sa période sénescence :10 ans pour un chien de moins de 15kg,9 ans pour un chien entre 15kg et 40kg,7 ans pour un chien de plus de 40kg,il est conseillé de faire un bilan de santé de votre chien par votre vétérinaire.En effet, votre chien ne présenta pas soudainement des signes de sénilité. Mais c’est la période où les symptômes de ralentissement des fonctions de l’organisme sont visibles.Cette période de sénescence peut durer de nombreuses années et il est important de connaître les points à surveiller afin de garder votre chien en pleine forme.Cela peut éviter bien des soucis tant au chien qu’à son maître mais ce sujet fera l’objet d’un prochain article plein de conseils pour aider son chien à bien vieillir…Mieux vaut prévenir que guérir !

TITRE: Dresser son chien à marcher en laisse
CATÉGORIE: Non catégorisé
CONTENU:
Les promenades sont pour les chiens un moment de joie intense ! Mais pour éviter qu’elles ne deviennent infernales pour leurs maîtres, mieux vaut dresser son chien à marcher en laisse sans tirer.Votre chien a tendance à tirer sur sa laisse, à aller de l’avant et à vous devancer, à tirer à droite à gauche pour aller jouer ou à traîner le nez par terre à la recherche de bonnes odeurs ?Voici quelques astuces pour éviter que ce ne soit votre chien qui vous promène en laisse. BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Harnais anti traction idéal pour apprendre à marcher en laisse. Seulement 22€ ! 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! Avant de commencer l’apprentissage de la marche en laissePour attaquer les exercices qui suivent, il est indispensable que votre chien soit déjà parfaitement habitué à porter un collier et une laisse.En effet, votre chien doit avoir un rapport amical et confiant avec sa laisse le plus rapidement possible. Il ne doit pas la ressentir comme une contrainte. La laisse est en quelque sorte le prolongement de la main du maître.Par conséquent, on ne le rappellera jamais assez, il est interdit de taper le chien avec la laisse (même pour rire), de laisser votre chien jouer avec ou de la ronger (lui laisseriez-vous ronger votre bras ?).Autre point important, il vous faut une laisse basique d’un peu plus d’un mètre. Oubliez les enrouleurs pour le moment. Vous devez sentir votre chien au bout de la laisse et il doit également vous sentir.Le bon endroit pour dresser son chien à marcher en laisseEvitez dès la première fois de sortir votre chien dans des rues très passantes ou bruyantes, ceci afin d’éviter de cumuler toutes les difficultés dès le départ.Votre chien doit pouvoir rester un minimum concentré les premières fois pour suivre vos indications. Les passants qui caressent votre chien, les bruits des voitures, le jeu avec les enfants sont autant de distractions pour le chien.Allez-y progressivement, vous pouvez commencer par votre appartement, dans la cour de l’immeuble, dans votre jardin puis passez à une rue calme, puis une rue agitée, puis une rue en heure de pointe, etc.Pour dresser son chien il faut démarrer en douceur et accentuer la difficulté petit à petit.Le bon positionnement du chien pour la marche en laisse Si vous préférez l’avoir sur le côté gauche, tenez la laisse de la main droite afin de libérer votre main gauche pour caresser le chien quand il exécute correctement l’exercice.Inversement, si vous préférez le côté droit, tenez la laisse de main gauche pour libérer votre main droite pour les caresses.Une fois que vous avez choisi un côté, évitez d’en changer sinon votre chien ne saura plus comment se placer par rapport à vous et vous aurez vite fait d’avoir un chien qui passera d’un côté à l’autre quand vous vous promenez !Eduquer son chien demande de la constance, donc soyez rigoureux et expliquez à toute personne qui promènera votre chien en laisse comment elle doit le faire.A vos marques ! Prêts ? Partez !… Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! Lorsque votre chien et vous êtes prêts, commencez à marcher à votre rythme en tenant la laisse de façon détendue pour avoir du mou entre votre main qui tient la laisse et le point d’attache du collier.La laisse détendue vous permettra d’exercer de petites tractions quand vous souhaitez ramener votre chien vers vous. Lorsque votre chien marche près de votre jambe, n’oubliez pas de le félicitez et le caresser pour le récompenser.Si votre chien traîne derrière, ne vous suit pas ou s’est arrêté appelez-le avec entrain pour capter son attention. Félicitez-le dès qu’il revient à votre niveau.En revanche si votre chien tire sur la laisse je vous recommande de lire et de pratiquer les exercices de cet article : Mon chien tire en laisse que faire ?Persistez et attirez son attention…S’il ne revient toujours pas, tapotez sur votre cuisse pour l’amener vers vous et attirez son attention s’il est trop distrait par les bruits de la rue. Traînez-le doucement s’il le faut mais il est inutile de tirer en permanence sur la laisse.S’il tire sur la laisse pour aller renifler à droite à gauche, donnez quelques coups brefs sur la laisse et l’ordre « Au pied ! ».Faîtes de même si votre chien tourne autour de vous, essaie de vous entortiller dans sa laisse, se retourne sans arrêt ou va de l’avant. S’il persiste, changez de direction. Allez à droite quand il veut aller à gauche. Faîtes demi-tour s’il vous devance.Dans tous les cas de figure dès que votre chien s’éloigne et que la laisse se tend, tirez-la d’un coup sec en lui précisant « Non, au pied !»Encouragez, félicitez-le… Dès que votre chien revient à vos pieds, détendez la laisse et caressez votre chien en n’oubliant pas de le féliciter « Au pied, c’est bien ! ». Le plus dur, gardez la laisse détendue…Votre chien doit comprendre qu’il y a une position confortable pour lui, qu’il doit garder un contact physique avec son maître : épaule du chien contre le genou du maître.

TITRE: Que préfère votre chien : vous ou la nourriture ?
CATÉGORIE: Non catégorisé
CONTENU:
Je suis un grand fan de toutes les découvertes scientifiques qui concernent nos amis les chiens. L’une des dernières études a tenté de répondre à une question que beaucoup de personnes se posent : « est-ce qu’un chien préfère les encouragements de son maître ou la nourriture ? ».Utiliser les récompenses pour éduquer son chien reste la meilleure méthode et plus vous choisissez une récompense que votre chien aime, plus son éducation sera rapide. D’où l’importance de cette étude scientifique et vous allez voir que les résultats ne sont pas forcément ceux qu’on attend ! BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! Comment savoir ce que pense un chien ?Au delà de l’étude en elle même, je suis toujours fasciné par les méthodes utilisées pour obtenir les résultats. Pour savoir ce que pensent les chiens, les scientifiques les ont entrainés à rester immobile pendant un IRM.Bien que sans danger pour le chien, c’est un objet bruyant et imposant. Sans compter le fait que garder un chien immobile n’est pas toujours facile. Voici donc une petite vidéo sur les techniques utilisées pour dresser les chiens. Vous allez voir c’est une belle petite leçon d’éducation canine… L’expérience en elle mêmeL’expérience scientifique (publiée dans le journal : Social, Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience) consiste à présenter au choix : un jouet en forme de cheval, un jouet en forme de voiture ou une brosse. Chaque chien a été conditionné avant et sait que :lorsqu’on lui présente le cheval, il sera récompensé par une friandise,lorsqu’il voit la voiture, son maître viendra le féliciter,lorsqu’il voit la brosse, il n’aura droit à rien. Il suffit ensuite d’observer l’activité du cerveau du chien pour savoir ce qu’il préfère.La deuxième étape de l’expérience consiste à faire sortir le chien de l’IRM et à lui proposer 2 chemins : l’un mène vers un bol de nourriture, l’autre vers son maître.Choix, au combien difficile pour un chien ! Résultat : que préfèrent les chiens ?On a tendance à croire que les chiens ne jurent que par la nourriture mais ce n’est pas ce que montre les résultats.Sur les 15 chiens testés, 2 chiens ont préféré la nourriture et 4 ont préféré leur maître.Le reste des chiens ont eu la même réponse pour le jouet en forme de voiture qu’en forme de cheval. Ce qui veut dire qu’ils placent l’interaction avec leur maître au même rang que la nourriture !La deuxième expérience a confirmé la première, à savoir que les chiens préférant la nourriture se sont dirigés vers la nourriture et ceux préférant leur maître se sont dirigés vers leur maître.Ceux sans préférence ont choisi de façon aléatoire.Conclusion pour l’éducation d’un chienNous sommes nombreux à utiliser la nourriture pour éduquer un chien mais cette étude nous rappelle à quel point le lien qu’un maître crée avec son chien est important, tout aussi important que la nourriture.Il n’est pas impossible que d’ici quelques années, de nouvelles méthodes d’éducation soient basées uniquement sur la récompense verbale. Plus besoin de friandises !Comme toujours, les études scientifiques apportent quelques réponses et souvent beaucoup de questions. Par exemple, est-ce que la préférence du chien est lié à la génétique ou à sa socialisation ?Est-ce que le chien préfère réellement la compagnie de son maître à la nourriture ou est-ce qu’il sait qu’il aura toujours plus de nourriture en allant vers son maître ?Il faudra attendre les prochaines études et je vous tiendrai au courant. En attendant, je reste persuadé que mon chien me préfère à du blanc de poulet et je suis sûr que vous aussi ;-) Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour !

TITRE: Mon chien n’est pas propre à 1 an : que faire ?
CATÉGORIE: Non catégorisé
CONTENU:
Imaginez : vous êtes sur le point de partir travailler, et là, vous tombez sur une petite flaque (ou pire !) laissée par votre toutou adoré. Cette situation, je l’ai vécue avec bien des chiens, de l’intrépide Yorkshire Terrier au Saint-Bernard placide.Vous n’êtes pas seul, et ce n’est pas si rare ! Un chien qui n’est pas propre à 1 an peut parfois être frustrant, mais pas de panique, il existe des solutions bienveillantes et efficaces. BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! Pourquoi certains chiens sont-ils plus longs à être propres ?La propreté n’est pas innée chez le chien : c’est un apprentissage qui peut prendre du temps, surtout chez certaines races et tempéraments. Par exemple, les petits chiens comme le Chihuahua ou le Bouledogue français ont une vessie plus petite et, par conséquent, des besoins plus fréquents. À l’inverse, un Labrador ou un Berger australien, plus grands et souvent plus actifs, auront des capacités différentes, mais leur énergie débordante peut aussi compliquer la maîtrise de la propreté.Chaque chien est unique, et ce qu’un chiot apprend en quelques semaines peut prendre des mois pour un autre. Selon une étude de 2022 de l’Université d’Helsinki, la maturité cérébrale et comportementale varie selon les races et influence fortement la propreté (Helsinki University Dog Research Group, 2022). Donc, si votre chien n’est pas propre à 1 an, cela peut simplement être lié à son développement ou à une étape temporaire dans son apprentissage.Les étapes clés pour améliorer la propretéJ’ai rédigé un article complet avec ma méthode détaillée pour éduquer un chiot à la propreté et si vous ne l’avez pas encore lu je vous recommande de le faire et surtout de mettre en place la méthode.Même si votre chien n’est plus un chiot, les principes d’apprentissage restent les mêmes. Voici également quelques conseils supplémentaires un peu plus précis pour un chien qui n’est pas propre au bout d’un an.Comprendre les besoins naturels de votre chienAvant tout, connaître le rythme de votre chien est essentiel. Certains chiens, comme les jeunes Beagles ou les Jack Russell Terriers, sont incroyablement curieux et peuvent se laisser distraire en pleine promenade ! Pour un apprentissage optimal, fixez une routine : après chaque repas, au réveil et avant le coucher. La répétition rassure le chien et l’aide à intégrer les bons comportements. Avec une telle routine, même le Bulldog le plus têtu finit par comprendre où et quand faire ses besoins.Adaptez l’apprentissage à sa race et son tempéramentChaque chien a ses petites particularités. Un Berger allemand très intelligent apprend souvent plus vite, mais peut aussi se montrer obstiné ; là où un Shih Tzu, plus sensible, aura besoin d’encouragements doux et de beaucoup de patience. Soyez attentif à ses signaux : le regard un peu coupable ou l’agitation inhabituelle sont souvent des signes qu’il a besoin de sortir. Petite anecdote : j’ai travaillé avec un Golden Retriever un peu trop passionné par les flaques d’eau… Dès qu’il en voyait une, il oubliait tout, même la propreté ! Il m’a fallu intégrer des jeux de récompenses pour le canaliser : chaque sortie sans accroc était récompensée, et petit à petit, il a su que la propreté aussi méritait une récompense.Soyez constant, mais indulgentLa régression de la propreté est courante, surtout après un déménagement, l’arrivée d’un bébé, ou des changements dans la routine. Si votre chien était propre, puis semble « oublier », ne paniquez pas. Réinstaurez une routine et rassurez-le : des phrases douces et encourageantes comme « c’est bien » font toute la différence. Punir un accident ne fera qu’augmenter son stress, rendant l’apprentissage encore plus long. Un cas marquant pour moi fut celui d’un Labrador senior de refuge. Après des années de vie en extérieur, il découvrait la vie en appartement et avait des difficultés. Grâce à des promenades régulières et des encouragements chaque fois qu’il faisait ses besoins à l’extérieur, il a fini par devenir propre à… 8 ans ! Comme quoi, chaque chien apprend à son rythme.Le rôle crucial de la patience et du renforcement positifDans l’éducation canine, la patience est votre meilleure alliée. La méthode douce et le renforcement positif fonctionnent bien mieux qu’une approche punitive. Si votre chien fait un « oubli », nettoyez sans lui montrer de frustration (d’ailleurs ne nettoyez pas sous ses yeux). Rappelez-vous que, pour lui, il n’y a pas de mauvaise intention, seulement un besoin de guidance.Conseils pratiques pour une nuit plus tranquilleLa propreté la nuit peut être un défi supplémentaire, surtout pour les chiots ou les chiens anxieux. Essayez de limiter l’eau quelques heures avant le coucher, sans toutefois restreindre totalement ses besoins. Un dernier tour dehors juste avant la nuit permet souvent d’éviter des surprises nocturnes.Conclusion : propreté et humour, les meilleurs alliés de votre chienSi votre chien n’est pas propre à 1 an, n’oubliez jamais que l’apprentissage de la propreté peut être long. Chaque étape, chaque petite victoire mérite d’être célébrée, comme un grand accomplissement.Avec patience, bienveillance et une touche d’humour (parce qu’un accident au bon moment peut devenir une anecdote inoubliable), votre chien finira par comprendre ce que vous attendez de lui. Au final, la propreté, c’est un peu comme pour nous : même si on trébuche parfois, on finit toujours par se relever avec un sourire !

CATÉGORIE: Non catégorisé
CONTENU:
Rendre votre chiot propre demande de la patience, de la persévérance et de la rigueur. C’est une épreuve difficile pour de nombreux maîtres et pour leur chiot.Donc, autant utiliser tous les outils qui pourraient vous faciliter la vie ou accélérer l’apprentissage de la propreté de votre chiot !Voici donc la liste des meilleurs outils pour rendre votre chiot propre. La bonne nouvelle, c’est que je suis sûr que vous en avez déjà une bonne partie sous la main ! BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! Caisse / Enclos / BarrièresLimiter l’espace de votre chiot est très utile pour lui apprendre la propreté.C’est également le meilleur moyen d’avoir un chiot en pleine forme. Votre chiot a besoin d’une tanière, d’un coin où il peut se reposer, à l’abri de tout ce qu’il n’aime pas.Un chiot reposé, sera beaucoup plus apte à apprendre de nouvelles choses comme la propreté, le rappel, marcher en laisse…Il fera tout ce qui est en son pouvoir pour ne pas salir son petit coin de paradis. Un enclos Trixie (avec fond imperméabilisé) ou simplement un coin de votre salon bien aménagé sera donc une aide précieuse pour rendre votre chiot propre.Un emploi du tempsUn outil indispensable et totalement gratuit pour l’apprentissage de la propreté : l’emploi du temps de votre chiot.Pour apprendre la propreté à votre chiot, il est préférable d’être le plus routinier possible. Levez-vous à la même heure, sortez votre chiot aux mêmes heures, donnez lui ses repas aux mêmes horaires, ….Plus vous serez routinier, plus votre chiot apprendra rapidement la propreté. Vous pourrez également mieux comprendre et donc anticiper les besoins de votre chiot.Si vous savez quand il a besoin de se soulager, vous pourrez l’emmener au bon endroit au bon moment. Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! Un bon téléphoneVotre téléphone est un précieux assistant pour rendre votre chiot propre.Si vous souhaitez que votre chiot mange et se soulage aux mêmes horaires tous les jours, utilisez l’alarme de votre téléphone ainsi que le minuteur.Nous avons tous des milliers de choses en tête alors autant vous soulager de cette corvée. Ainsi vous serez sûr de ne jamais être en retard pour les repas ou les sorties de votre chiot !C’est le meilleur moyen de ne pas arriver après la bataille et de devoir nettoyer la moquette.Tapis de propreté et/ou litièreUne litière et des tapis de propreté ne sont pas obligatoires pour rendre votre chiot propre. Au contraire, si vous souhaitez que votre chiot fasse ses besoins dehors, inutile de les utiliser.En revanche si vous souhaitez lui apprendre à faire ses besoins à l’intérieur de façon provisoire ou parce que vous êtes absent une bonne partie de la journée et qu’il ne peut pas se retenir indéfiniment, alors ce sont de très bons outils.Ils vous faciliteront le nettoyage et en période d’apprentissage, c’est un gros atout ! N’hésitez pas à jeter un oeil sur notre article complet pour bien utiliser un tapis de propreté.Produits de nettoyage adaptésMauvais nettoyage = nouvel accident. Si votre chiot sent une odeur d’urine, il ne pourra pas s’empêcher de « remettre une couche ». C’est instinctif et il ne peut pas résister !Donc si vous nettoyez mal un accident, votre chiot ne pourra pas s’empêcher de reproduire cet accident encore et encore.N’oubliez pas que l’odorat de votre chiot est mille fois plus développé que celui d’un être humain. Un chiot placé dans un stade de foot peut sentir le parfum d’un spectateur placé dans les tribunes !Donc prenez des produits de nettoyage adaptés qui vont à la fois nettoyer mais aussi tuer toutes les odeurs. C’est d’une importance capitale !Détecteur d’urineIl est parfois difficile de repérer les accidents de votre chiot. Surtout si vous avez utilisé de mauvaises méthodes d’éducation et qu’il commence à se cacher pour faire ses besoins.Heureusement, il existe des lampes qui permettent de détecter les accidents.Le coté série policière peut faire sourire mais croyez-moi, c’est la douche froide pour certains maîtres quand ils se rendent compte de l’état de leur appartement.Le gros avantage, c’est qu’une fois les accidents repérés, il suffit de les nettoyer correctement pour partir sur une base saine. L’apprentissage de la propreté du chiot est ensuite beaucoup plus facile !Sac à excrémentSi votre chiot fait ses excréments dehors, n’oubliez pas de ramasser derrière lui. Un chiot, comme un être humain, préfère faire ses besoins dans un endroit propre.Donc si vous souhaitez que votre chiot fasse toujours au même endroit, vous devez faire en sorte que cet endroit reste propre.Il existe aujourd’hui des petits distributeurs de sacs à excrément que vous pouvez attacher à la laisse de votre chiot. Si vous n’en avez pas, emmenez toujours au moins 2 sacs avec vous. Il arrivera un jour ou votre chiot fera ses besoins en plusieurs fois.Croyez-en mon expérience, vous serez bien embêté si vous n’avez qu’un sac (oui ça m’est arrivé et je vous épargnerai les détails ;-).Une formation pour rendre votre chiot propreEn moyenne et avec les bonnes méthodes, il faut entre une semaine et quinze jours pour qu’un chiot comprenne le principe de la propreté. Il aura encore des accidents occasionnellement mais ils ne ralentiront pas son apprentissage.Pourtant, je vois régulièrement des maîtres passer des mois sur la propreté et c’est peut-être votre cas.Rendre votre chiot propre n’est que la première pierre de l’édifice, vous avez encore énormément de choses à lui apprendre, et des choses vraiment beaucoup plus amusantes ! Alors ne perdez pas votre temps avec ça !Suivez la formation pour dresser son chien en 15 minutes par jour et réglez une bonne fois pour toute les problèmes de propreté de votre chiot. C’est une méthode simple, efficace et douce. Elle vous donnera des premiers résultats en moins de 24H et vous pourrez enfin passer au coté fun de l’éducation de votre chiot… Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour !

Vous connaissez la race de votre futur chien ? Il vous faut encore choisir un chien mâle ou femelle. C’est un choix plus simple puisque vous n’avez que deux possibilités.Malgré tout il y a plusieurs critères pouvant influencer votre choix comme le tempérament, le dressage, le comportement avec les enfants…Voici donc un petit récapitulatif des différences entre un chien mâle ou femelle et quelques petits conseils pour votre décision finale entre un chien ou une chienne. BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! Différence physique entre un chien mâle et femelle C’est évidemment le premier élément qui différencie un chien d’une chienne.Si vous avez choisit un Yorkshire ça n’a pas grande importance, en revanche si vous souhaitez accueillir un chien de race moyenne ou grande, ce critère peut-être déterminant.Un chien mâle sera plus puissant qu’une chienne. Il vous faudra plus d’effort pour le contrôler.N’oubliez pas les éventuelles personnes amenées à côtoyer votre chien : conjoint, enfants, parents, beaux-parents, amis…Différence de tempérament d’un chien mâle ou femelleMon point de vue sur la différence de tempérament entre un chien mâle et une femelle est le suivant : une chienne à tendance à dire : « Aime-moi », un chien à tendance à dire « Je t’aime ».Je lis et j’entends souvent que les femelles sont plus douces et affectueuses mais je ne suis pas d’accord avec cet argument.Une chienne est plus indépendante qu’un chien. Evidemment elle demande de l’attention, souhaite vous faire plaisir, mais à son rythme, c’est elle qui prend l’initiative.Certains maîtres ont l’impression que leur chienne est lunatique, mais c’est faux, simplement c’est elle qui choisit le bon moment.A l’inverse un chien mâle est toujours prêt et toujours à la recherche du contact avec ses maîtres.C’est pour cette raison que les mâles donnent l’impression d’être plus régulier dans leur caractère. Besoin de faire des câlins, envie de jouer, peu importe votre chien sera toujours heureux de passer du temps avec vous et n’en n’aura probablement jamais assez.Pour résumé, les chiens sont capables d’un amour infini qu’ils soient mâles ou femelles, simplement ils l’expriment de façon différente. Votre chien mérite le meilleur départ ! Ne ratez pas notre ebook essentiel⤹ Prénom * Email * Les problèmes hormonaux des chiens et chiennes Les principaux inconvénients des chiens comme des chiennes sont liés à leurs hormones.Les chiens marquent et protègent leur territoire, et ils sont en constante recherche d’activités sexuelles.Par conséquent les mâles ont tendance à lever la patte tous les 2 mètres pendant la promenade, à se frotter contre la jambe de vos invités, à être fugueur et vagabond pour trouver leur belle, à être bagarreur envers leurs congénères…D’un autre coté les femelles sont en chaleur deux fois par an pendant environ 3 semaines.Pendant cette période la femelle a des pertes sanguines et dégage une forte odeur. Elle devient très indépendante et têtue.Durant cette période les promenades deviennent très compliquées car votre chienne va attirer tous les mâles des alentours et déclencher des bagarres. Les femelles peuvent également développer des maladies liées à l’absence de copulation.La bonne nouvelle c’est que tous ces inconvénients peuvent être atténués voir disparaître si vous faîtes castrer ou stériliser votre animal.D’après mon expérience le plus tôt reste le mieux car votre chien n’aura pas le temps de prendre de mauvaises habitudes.Si vous castrez ou stériliser votre compagnon tous ces éléments ne doivent plus être pris en compte pour choisir entre un mâle et une femelle.En revanche si vous souhaitez faire reproduire votre chien, ou avoir une portée de votre chienne vous devrez gérer ces éléments et les prendre en compte dans votre décision de choisir un chien mâle ou femelle.Quel est le plus facile à dresser : un chien ou une chienne ?Est il plus facile de dresser un chien ou une chienne ?Les chiennes ont la réputation de se dresser plus facilement. Cette idée vient du fait que les chiennes sont souvent matures plus rapidement que les chiens.Elles sont également plus attentives et peuvent se concentrer plus longtemps ce qui facilite leur dressage.Les chiens sont un peu plus « fou fou » ce qui rend leur éducation plus lente, mais ce défaut est compensé par leur intérêt pour la nourriture (plus prononcé que celui des femelles).Avec les bonnes friandises, et les bonnes méthodes de dressage vous ferez ce que voulez de votre chien mâle. D’ailleurs si vous cherchez une bonne méthode de dressage, en voici une : Dresser son chien en 15 minutes par jourPour vos enfants : chien mâle ou femelle ? Un chien mâle ou femelle est un avantage pour l’éveil de vos enfants et tous les chiens peuvent être doux et affectueux avec les enfants.Les femelles sont souvent privilégiées en raison de leur instinct maternel.Les mâles peuvent voir vos enfants comme des compagnons de jeux ce qui peut parfois poser problèmes pour les très jeunes enfants ou si vous avez choisi un chien de grande ou moyenne taille.Les études montrent que les jeunes mâles non castrés sont le plus souvent impliqués dans les accidents avec les enfants (attention il ne s’agit pas d’agressions mais bien d’accidents).La décision finale entre un chien mâle ou femelleIl est important de connaître les principales différences entre un chien et une chienne. Mais dans la plupart des cas il est préférable de garder l’esprit ouvert.Les chiens comme les hommes ont des personnalités très différentes et c’est un élément bien plus important que le sexe de votre futur compagnon.L’éducation est également un élément déterminant dans le comportement de votre chien. De nombreux maître attribuent les qualités ou défauts d’un chien à son sexe et c’est de cette manière que des idées reçues se transmettent de génération en génération.Les éventuels défauts d’un chien ne sont que vos erreurs d’éducateur. Vous avez surement déjà votre préférence mais n’écartez pas tous les chiens du sexe opposé car vous pourriez rater le meilleur compagnon de votre vie.Gardez à l’esprit qu’un chien mâle ou femelle reste le meilleur ami de l’homme… Votre chien mérite le meilleur départ !

TITRE: Mon chien tire en laisse : que faire ?
CATÉGORIE: Non catégorisé
CONTENU:
Mon chien tire en laisse, comment faire pour l’en empêcher ? : c’est l’un des problèmes dont on me parle le plus souvent. De nombreux maîtres ont le sentiment qu’ils ne contrôlent pas vraiment la promenade de leur chien. Certains ont carrément l’impression que c’est leurs chiens qui les promènent.Marcher en laisse à vos cotés n’a rien de naturel pour votre chien et il y a beaucoup de raisons qui le poussent à tirer sur sa laisse.Heureusement, votre chien ne demande pas mieux que de vous faire plaisir, il vous suffit de lui apprendre avec les bonnes méthodes et un peu de patience. Alors si votre chien tire en laisse, voici quelques techniques qui devraient vous aider. BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Harnais anti traction idéal pour apprendre à marcher en laisse. Seulement 22€ ! 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! Le secret si votre chien tire en laisseLa première erreur que font beaucoup de maîtres avec leurs chiens est d’essayer de lui apprendre à marcher en laisse sans tirer pendant sa promenade.C’est vrai que ça peut nous paraître logique mais il suffit de se mettre à la place de notre chien pour comprendre que ce n’est pas la meilleure solution.La promenade de votre chien est un moment sacré ! Pour lui, c’est l’un des meilleurs moments de la journée.Il va pouvoir se défouler, découvrir de nouveaux environnements, croiser d’autres chiens, d’autres personnes, de nouvelles odeurs…C’est un peu les vacances pour votre chien et comme vous, il n’a vraiment pas la tête à travailler pendant ses vacances.Donc si votre chien tire en laisse, il est préférable de vous y prendre autrement. La meilleure solution est de créer des moments spéciaux pour apprendre à votre chien à ne pas tirer en laisse.Si vous le pouvez, travaillez en dehors des moments de promenades avec votre chien dans un espace assez calme et si possible qu’il connait déjà, ça peut être le sous-sol de votre maison, votre jardin, un cul-de-sac près de chez vous… et pratiquez les exercices qui vont suivre.Quand votre chien marchera en laisse sans tirer dans un endroit calme, il arrivera beaucoup plus facilement à le faire pendant les promenades.Si vraiment vous n’avez pas d’autres solutions, vous pourrez le faire directement pendant sa promenade mais l’apprentissage sera un peu plus long pour vous et votre chien. Pour le calmer, je vous conseille également de jouer avec lui avant de faire sa promenade, faîtes-le jouer et faîtes-le courir chez vous avant de partir pour qu’il évacue un peu de pression.Petite précision : pour les deux méthodes, vous aurez besoin d’une laisse courte, pas d’enrouleur. Vous aurez également besoin de quelques friandises dont votre chien raffole. C’est parti pour les solutions si votre chien tire en laisse… Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! La méthode du STOP pour un chien qui tire en laisseVous allez mettre le collier et la laisse de votre chien et le faire patienter quelques minutes s’il est vraiment trop excité (profitez-en pour travailler les ordres assis ou couché).Une fois qu’il est un peu plus calme, vous allez commencer la promenade. Le principe est simple, à chaque fois que votre chien commence à tirer sur la laisse, vous allez vous arrêter net !Les chiens réussissent très souvent à emmener leur maître où ils veulent en tirant sur la laisse, ils apprennent ainsi à tirer pour obtenir ce qu’ils veulent, ce qui les encourage à continuer.Donc quand il tire, arrêtez-vous, ne le laissez pas vous traîner et ne le laissez pas accéder à ce qu’il veut.Quand votre chien arrête de tirer et/ou se retourne pour regarder ce que vous faîtes, récompensez-le avec une friandise et des félicitations.Votre chien comprendra rapidement que tirer ne mène à rien alors que ne pas tirer et prêter attention à son maître entraîne une récompense. Votre première promenade risque d’être un peu plus longue que d’habitude et c’est normal. Votre chien apprend par répétition, donc faîtes preuve de patience.Rassurez-vous, en général, les chiens apprennent assez vite si vous faîtes preuve de constance. Dans bien des cas, une fois que le chien a compris que vous avez des friandises, il ne pense plus à tirer et surveille son maître.Utilisez systématiquement les friandises pendant un mois. Ensuite, seulement de temps en temps (une fois sur deux ou trois), puis vous pourrez les supprimer complètement.La méthode du changement de direction si votre chien tire en laisse Cette méthode consiste, comme son nom l’indique, à changer de direction régulièrement. Il vous faut un minimum d’espace pour faire cet exercice.Vous allez marcher quelques pas et dès que votre chien s’apprête à tirer sur la laisse, vous allez changer de direction en appelant votre chien. Tournez votre corps à droite ou à gauche ou faîtes demi-tour en appelant votre chien d’une voix entraînante.En appelant votre chien, il doit voir que votre corps est tourné dans une autre direction et votre voix doit l’attirer. Quand il revient près de vous, félicitez-le et donnez lui une friandise tout en continuant à marcher.Refaites quelques pas dans une direction puis recommencez, n’hésitez pas à varier les rythmes et les directions.Cet exercice est très efficace si votre chien tire en laisse car il va apprendre que vous dirigez la promenade et qu’il doit être attentif à ce que vous faîtes.Au début, votre chien sera un peu perdu. Il peut lui arriver de tirer sur la laisse mais si vous anticipez juste un peu avant, que vous l’appelez avec entrain et que votre corps est dirigé dans une autre direction, il vous suivra.N’oubliez pas de bien récompenser votre chien à chaque fois qu’il a les bons comportements. Plus votre chien se sentira bien à vos cotés pendant la promenade, plus il y restera et vous verrez qu’il sera de moins en moins tenté de tirer sur sa laisse.Derniers conseils pour un chien qui tire en laisseEn quelques semaines, votre chien peut apprendre à ne plus tirer en laisse. Mais attention de ne pas tomber dans l’excès.J’ai vu des maîtres tellement contents et heureux de voir leurs chiens ne plus tirer en laisse qu’ils en oublient l’intérêt premier de la promenade.Même si c’est très beau de voir un chien et son maître marcher en parfaite harmonie, il ne faut pas que ça devienne une exhibition.Votre chien a besoin d’explorer, de sentir des odeurs, de découvrir de nouveaux territoires. C’est aussi et surtout à ça que sert la promenade et c’est aussi le meilleur moyen de créer du lien avec votre chien.Gardez à l’esprit que vous ne souhaitez pas contraindre votre chien à marcher près de vous sans tirer sur sa laisse, votre but est que votre chien préfère marcher près de vous sans tirer sur la laisse. Ce n’est pas la même chose.Soyez patient, si votre chien continue de tirer en laisse, c’est que marcher à vos cotés n’est pas aussi intéressant que ce qui l’attire.Pour ceux qui n’ont pas la force physique pour stopper leurs chiens, sachez qu’il existe des accessoires qui peuvent vous aider sans le faire souffrir (des harnais ou colliers). J’en reparlerai dans un prochain article.Pour finir, vous devez absolument être constant pour que votre chien arrête de tirer en laisse. Donc n’oubliez pas de partager ces conseils avec tous ceux qui promènent votre chien.Je vous souhaite de belles promenades à vous et votre chien… sans tirer sur la laisse bien sûr !

TITRE: Mon chien simule l’acte sexuel
CATÉGORIE: Non catégorisé
CONTENU:
De nombreux maîtres rencontrent ce problème : «mon chien monte et se frotte sur ma jambe et celles de mes invités», «mon chiot simule l’acte sexuel sur son panier», «mon chien chevauche les autres chiens»…Pas toujours évident de savoir comment réagir. Après tout c’est naturel pour un chien, mais ça peut aussi devenir embarrassant pour son maître.Dans cet article nous allons voir pourquoi votre chien simule l’acte sexuel et comment dresser son chien pour éviter ou limiter ce comportement. BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! Pourquoi votre chien simule l’acte sexuel ?Si vous souhaitez changer le comportement de votre chien, il faut avant tout comprendre pourquoi il simule l’acte sexuel. De nombreux comportementalistes et éducateurs canins se sont frottés à la question (promis ce sera le seul jeu de mot de l’article ;-)Les chiots se chevauchent entre eux dès le plus jeune âge. Les chiens comme les chiennes peuvent simuler l’acte sexuel. Castration et stérilisation n’élimine pas le problème. Un chien peut subitement se mettre à chevaucher n’importe quoi : un objet, un autre chien, un humain…Bref les cas sont tellement variés qu’il n’y a pas vraiment de réponses types mais plusieurs cas possibles :Augmentation des stimulationsC’est l’une des raisons qui explique ce comportement : une augmentation du stress ou des émotions. Un ami arrive chez vous, votre appartement s’anime et votre chien ressent cette excitation. Pour faire redescendre la pression, votre chien se frotte sur votre jambe, celle de votre ami, ou son panier.Envie de jouerIl semble également que ce soit un moyen d’attirer l’attention pour jouer ou se faire des «amis». Un chien qui veut jouer avec un autre chien va s’exprimer par sa posture, en aboyant, en donnant un coup de patte et si nécessaire en le chevauchant. Certains comportementalistes pensent également que c’est un moyen de tester leur relation, une sorte de provocation pour dire : «jusqu’à quel point tu es mon ami?».ReproductionC’est également l’une des possibilités. Si une chienne en chaleur se trouve dans les parages, votre chien aura beaucoup de mal à se contrôler. La castration permet de diminuer le problème mais un chien, même castré, peut continuer de chevaucher. La preuve que ça n’est pas qu’un problème d’hormone.Une histoire de dominationC’est la réponse type que vous trouverez un peu partout. «Si votre chien se frotte sur vous c’est qu’il veut vous dominer». Un chien ne cherche pas à dominer son maître, c’est une vieille idéologie totalement fausse et très souvent dangereuse pour vous et votre chien. En revanche un chien peut chevaucher un autre chien pour affirmer son statut. Mais dans ce cas, cet acte fera parti d’un ensemble : agressions, postures, défense de territoire ou de ressources. Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! Comment éviter que votre chien se frotte ? La première chose à faire est de bien observer son chien pour savoir quand agir.Vous devez observer à quelles occasions votre chien se met à chevaucher, et vous devez également reconnaître les signes que votre chien va se mettre à chevaucher son panier, votre jambe ou celle d’un invité.Le but est de pouvoir intervenir au bon moment, c’est à dire juste avant «le drame» et d’utiliser les techniques de redirection.Si vous sentez que votre chien est sur le point de chevaucher, donner lui un autre moyen de libérer son énergie.Si par exemple votre chien s’excite quand un invité arrive, utilisez les ordres de base. Demandez lui de s’asseoir, de se coucher ou d’aller au panier.Demander à votre chien de faire quelque chose permet de canaliser son énergie et de détourner son attention.Si votre chien ne vous écoute pas, il vous faudra renforcer les ordres de base avec les bonnes méthodes…Renforcer les ordres de baseLes ordres de base sont dans de nombreuses situations le meilleur moyen de corriger les problèmes. Si votre chien est bien éduqué, vous n’aurez aucun mal à détourner son attention et éviter les mauvais comportements.Si vous ne savez pas comment faire, je vous recommande la méthode Dresser son chien en 15 minutes par jour.Elle contient de nombreux exercices / jeux à pratiquer quelques minutes par jour avec votre chien pour rectifier les problèmes les plus fréquents comme les chiens qui se frottent, qui tirent en laisse, sautent sur les invités, volent de la nourriture… la liste est longue !Si votre chien cumulent quelques mauvaises habitudes, il est peut-être temps de prendre ou de reprendre en main son éducation…Comment réagir quand votre chien simule l’acte sexuel ?Le temps que vous repreniez l’éducation de votre chien, celui-ci va continuer de se frotter. Il faut donc apprendre à réagir en conséquence.D’abord il faut évidemment le repousser, vous éloigner de lui pour ne pas qu’il recommence, et lui dire fermement Non ou Stop suivant le mot que vous avez choisi pour son éducation.Ensuite ignorez-le quelques minutes. Si vraiment votre chien ne comprend pas isolez-le 2 ou 3 minutes dans une pièce calme.Vous pourrez ensuite le récupérer, son excitation sera redescendue donc inutile de lui faire ressentir que vous êtes en colère.Votre chien n’a pas énormément de moyen d’expression, sa parole à lui c’est son comportement et simuler l’acte sexuel fait partie de son comportement.Si vous travaillez l’éducation de votre chien avec les bonnes méthodes, vous lui apprendrez à s’exprimer différemment et vous pourrez progressivement éviter ce genre de comportement.Comme toujours pour le dressage d’un chien il faut faire preuve de compréhension et de patience. Expliquez à tous ceux qui sont en contact avec votre chien comment réagir quand il se met à chevaucher quelqu’un ou quelque chose et vous verrez que très bientôt votre chien sera exemplaire !

Bien comprendre les besoins nutritionnels de votre chien est très important. La nourriture joue un rôle primordial sur sa santé. Le chien est un omnivore, ce qui veut dire qu’il peut manger n’importe quelle nourriture (je ne tiens pas compte des chaussures ou tout autre objet que votre chien a l’habitude de manger ;-).Pour répondre aux besoins nutritionnels de votre chien il faut que son alimentation soit répartie en 6 groupes alimentaires.C’est la clef d’une alimentation équilibrée et d’un chien en pleine forme !

L’eau représente 60 à 70% du poids d’un chien adulte.Une partie des besoins en eau de votre chien se trouve dans sa nourriture (la nourriture en boite contient environ 78% d’eau et la nourriture sèche environ 10%).Il est donc primordial que votre chien ait accès à de l’eau fraîche (je ne parle pas de température, simplement renouvelez tous les jours la gamelle d’eau de votre chien).Petite précision pour ceux qui sont en train d’apprendre la propreté à leur chiot : vous pouvez surveiller et limiter la quantité d’eau que votre chiot absorbe (donner lui de l’eau à des moments spécifiques comme après la balade par exemple).En cas de forte chaleur ne prenez pas de risques, un chien se déshydrate rapidement (vous pouvez également lui mettre un glaçon à la place de l’eau, il l’absorbera plus lentement).

Elles vont lui fournir les acides aminés nécessaires au bon développement de son corps. Les protéines contiennent 23 acides aminés dont 10 sont essentiels pour la bonne santé de votre chien. Les autres sont également importants mais votre chien peut les fabriquer lui même.Généralement, on considère que les protéines animales sont plus intéressantes pour votre chien que les protéines végétales.Des minéraux pour votre chienLes minéraux n’ont aucune valeur énergétique mais ils font partie des besoins alimentaires de votre chien. Ils doivent être présents dans l’alimentation de votre chien car contrairement à certains acides aminés, les chiens ne peuvent pas les produire.Le fer, le magnésium, le zinc, le calcium vont permettre des réactions métaboliques assurant ainsi le bon fonctionnement de l’organisme de votre chien.Par exemple, sans minéraux dans son alimentation votre chien n’aura pas les os solides. Ils participent également à la bonne santé des dents de votre chien qui est un élément crucial pour lui et sa longévité (n’oubliez pas de brosser les dents de votre chien régulièrement et les vôtres aussi ;-).De la graisse pour votre chien Si votre chien n’a pas une belle peau ou une belle fourrure, surveillez ses besoins en graisse. La graisse a non seulement un rôle énergétique mais elle permet aussi à votre chien d’absorber certains vitamines qui se dissolvent dans la graisse.Autre point important, les chiens aiment les graisses. C’est très bien de répondre à ses besoins alimentaires mais il faut aussi prendre du plaisir dans tout ça ! Attention tout de même aux excès.La nourriture industrielle est généralement adaptée aux besoins de vos chiens mais attention aux petites friandises qui sont souvent un peu plus riches.Surtout si vous utilisez la nourriture pour le éduquer votre chien, n’oubliez pas de diminuer les quantités aux repas.Des vitamines pour votre chienVotre chien a besoin de vitamines, tout comme vous. Ils participent au bon fonctionnement de l’organisme ils sont indispensables aux échanges vitaux.Votre chien ne peut pas les synthétiser lui même, mais rassurez-vous si son alimentation est équilibrée, il aura les vitamines dont il a besoin.Inutile de donner des suppléments de vitamine à votre chien sauf si votre chien a une déficience et que votre vétérinaire vous le demande. Contrairement à ce qu’on pourrait croire, trop de vitamines peut être dangereux.Des glucides pour votre chienLes glucides sont le dernier élément des besoins nutritionnels de votre chien. Ils n’ont pas toujours bonne réputation et pourtant ils sont une aide précieuse pour le corps de votre chien.Ils permettent de conserver les intestins de votre chien en bon état et d’éviter des diarrhées ou constipation. Ils fournissent également de l’énergie aux tissus ce qui permet à votre chien de conserver ses protéines et de les utiliser à bon escient.Comme pour les graisses il faut contrôler et gérer les quantités, mise à part ça les glucides font partie intégrante des besoins nutritionnels de votre chien.

CONTENU:
Un chien qui a mordu remordra forcément, un chien qui remue la queue est heureux… C’est le genre d’idée reçu que l’on entend, que l’on répète et qui finissent par être considérées comme acquises.Mais que sait-on vraiment sur ces idées reçues vieilles comme le monde ? Parfois fausses, parfois vraies et la plupart du temps imprécises… Alors faîtes le test pour savoir si vous connaissez bien votre chien et découvrez toute la vérité !Un chien qui remue la queue est heureux ?Non, un chien remue la queue en cas d’agitation ou d’excitation. Mais cette agitation peut-être positive ou négative. Un chien heureux remue la queue mais un chien agressif la remue tout autant !Plus le chien est petit, plus il est fragile ?Non, il suffit de comparer l’espérance de vie d’un chien de petite taille à un chien de grande taille (Lire notre rubrique Calculez l’âge du chien).Avec bien sûr une bonne hygiène de vie, une activité physique régulière ainsi qu’une alimentation adaptée à ses besoins, un petit chien pourra facilement dépasser l’âge de 15 ans !Un chien qui a mordu… remordra forcément !Pas forcément, le chien menace pour prévenir son entourage que quelque chose l’inquiète, lui fait peur ou mal et qu’il souhaite que cela cesse.Il est capital de savoir pourquoi il a mordu : dans quelles circonstances ? Qu’est-ce qu’il a vécu si négativement ? En réaction à quel événement ?C’est en comprenant ce qu’il a ressenti comme une menace qu’on se protège d’une nouvelle morsure dans les mêmes circonstances. Votre chien mérite le meilleur départ ! Ne ratez pas notre ebook essentiel⤹ Prénom * Email * Seul le chien mâle lève la patte pour uriner ?Non, certaines femelles dominantes lèvent également la patte pour uriner.Le chien qui lèche sa blessure guérit plus vite ?Oui, sauf s’il le fait trop.Le chocolat est-il nocif pour mon chien ?Oui, le chocolat contient de la théobromine qui à forte dose peut déclencher de graves troubles cardiaques, respiratoires et nerveux.Par exemple, l’ingestion de 200 grammes de chocolat noir peut terrasser un chien de taille moyenne.Il faut donc se montrer très vigilant et ne pas hésiter à rappeler aux enfants comme aux invités de ne pas donner du chocolat aux chiens.Sachez également que vous pouvez dresser votre chien pour qu’il ne mange que ce que vous lui donnez ( voir dresser son chien contre l’empoisonnement).Un chien qui mange de l’herbe est malade ?Non, c’est tout à fait normal chez le chien.Un chien n’a pas de problème de dents !Oui et non, le chien n’a généralement pas de caries mais est fortement sujet aux problèmes liées à la formation de tartre.Le chien a une salive beaucoup moins acide que celle de l’homme et le dépôt de tartre peut entraîner mauvaise haleine, inflammation de la gencive provoquant des douleurs qui peuvent décourager le chien de manger.Le chien a besoin d’une alimentation variée ?Non, le chien a besoin d’une alimentation équilibrée mais pas forcément variée.En effet, en changeant fréquemment et brutalement d’aliment, vous risquez de perturber le transit digestif du chien et d’entraîner l’apparition de flatulences, diarrhées ou réactions cutanées.Un chien malade a la truffe tiède ?Non, la température de la truffe du chien ne donne pas son état de santé.Pour connaître sa température, il faut utiliser un thermomètre.Le chien sait vous montrer qu’il est malade ?Non, l’instinct de survie du chien fait qu’il sait très bien cacher son état.S’il vous montre qu’il est malade, c’est qu’il est très mal en point.Une détérioration de la qualité du poil du chien est signe d’une déficience nutritionnelle ?Oui, le pelage est le miroir de la santé du chien. Excès de sébum, poils cassants et ternes, démangeaisons…Tout changement sonne comme une alarme et peut provenir d’une déficience en acides gras essentiels (Lire notre article Mon chien perd ses poils).Savez-vous que le chien utilise jusqu’à 30% de ses apports en protéines pour renouveler son pelage notamment en période de mue ?

TITRE: Signes et symptômes que votre chien souffre
CATÉGORIE: Non catégorisé
CONTENU:
Généralement, il est assez facile de savoir si quelqu’un est malade ou souffre. D’abord parce que cette personne va s’en plaindre mais aussi parce que son corps va le signaler d’une manière ou d’une autre.Pour les chiens c’est un peu plus compliqué. D’abord parce qu’ils ne peuvent pas communiquer clairement avec nous leurs souffrances. Et même s’ils essayent de nous signaler leur douleur, les symptômes ne sont jamais très clairs.Heureusement il y a quelques indices qui peuvent vous permettre de savoir si votre chien souffre bien plus qu’il ne le laisse paraître. BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! Votre chien s’exprime plus que d’habitudeMême si votre chien joue les durs, il y a de fortes chances pour qu’il s’exprime plus que d’habitude lorsqu’il souffre.Malheureusement à moins que ce ne soit directement lié à quelque chose de physique (lorsqu’il pose sa patte arrière droite par exemple) c’est très difficile de savoir exactement ce qui le fait souffrir.Un chien qui souffre va s’exprimer de différentes manières : gémissements, pleurs, jappements, grognements, aboiements, hurlements…Bref si votre chien s’exprime plus que d’habitude, il est possible qu’une partie de son corps le fasse souffrir. Inspectez votre chien au plus vite et emmenez le chez son vétérinaire si vous ne trouvez rien et que les symptômes persistent.Une toilette excessiveQuand un chien est blessé, son instinct le pousse à nettoyer et soigner la plaie en la léchant. S’il s’agit d’une blessure externe comme une coupure, égratignure ou brulure, il est assez facile de le repérer et d’aider votre chien à guérir.En revanche les chiens vont avoir le même comportement si c’est une douleur interne et même en y regardant de prés vous ne verrez rien. A vous de surveiller et si votre chien insiste il faudra consulter votre vétérinaire.Des différences dans son alimentation ou son sommeil Beaucoup de chien vont changer leurs habitudes d’alimentation ou de sommeil s’ils souffrent.Ils vont par exemple dormir plus souvent et plus longtemps pour essayer de guérir ou parce que bouger réveille la douleur.De la même façon leur appétit peut être modifié. En général un chien qui souffre va perdre de l’appétit mais une augmentation soudaine peut aussi être un signe que votre chien n’est pas bien.Même chose pour l’eau, si votre chien souffre vous pouvez constater des changements d’habitude.Un changement significatif et soudain de ces éléments est souvent le signe que votre chien souffre.Une respiration difficileLa respiration de votre chien est également un bon indice pour savoir s’il souffre. Si votre chien a l’air essoufflé alors qu’il ne fait pas plus d’activité que d’habitude il est possible qu’il soit malade.Si sa respiration vous paraît plus rapide ou moins puissante, votre chien est peut-être malade ou a ingéré quelque chose qui gêne sa respiration.Allez consulter au plus vite !Des yeux différentsUn chien qui plisse des yeux de manière plus fréquente qu’à la normale peut être le signe qu’il a mal aux yeux. Observer sa pupille, une pupille plus petite est le signe d’une douleur aux yeux.A l’inverse une pupille plus large est le signe d’une douleur dans une autre partie de son corps. Sachez également qu’un chien qui se lèche les pattes pour se frotter les yeux a sûrement une douleur provenant des yeux.Commencez par lui nettoyer les yeux et si le problème persiste il vaut mieux consulter.Votre chien a du mal à se « poser »Si votre chien souffre il peut ressentir une douleur lorsqu’il s’assoit ou se couche.Si vous constatez que votre chien s’assoit ou se couche dans des positions étranges vous devriez vérifier si votre chien a une blessure (mais je ne parle pas de ces superbes poses que nos chiens prennent quand ils dorment ;-).Si votre chien essaye de s’assoir ou de se coucher et que quelques secondes après il se lève pour bouger et réessaye c’est un signe (généralement accompagné d’un bruit quand il se lève).Changement de style affectif Certains chiens vont se mettre à fuir leur maître lorsqu’ils souffrent, ils vont essayer de se cacher pour être tranquilles et guérir.D’autres peuvent devenir agressifs, se mettre à grogner quand vous approchez et même mordre par peur que vous ne leur fassiez plus mal encore.C’est leur instinct de protection qui reprend le dessus.Enfin certains chiens vont devenir encore plus affectifs que d’habitude et être en recherche permanente de votre affection.Donc si vous constatez un changement de comportement dans l’affection de votre chien, n’y voyez rien de personnel, il se peut tout simplement qu’il souffre de quelque chose.Détecter quand votre chien souffreMême si ces signes ne sont pas toujours très clairs et ne vous indiquent pas clairement d’où vient le problème, un comportement inhabituel de votre chien peut être le signe qu’il souffre de quelque chose.L’une des choses que vous pouvez faire dans un premier temps est de vérifier si votre chien a une blessure externe. Si il n’y a aucun signe, vous pouvez palper votre chien avec douceur mais fermeté comme le ferez votre vétérinaire pour savoir s’il souffre.Une chose est sûre : plus vous observerez votre chien, plus vous serez proche de lui au quotidien et plus il vous sera facile de détecter rapidement si son comportement est inhabituel. Vous pourrez ainsi être plus réactif dès que votre chien montrera des signes de souffrance.Alors arrêtez de surfer et allez voir si votre chien va bien !

Je rencontre régulièrement des maîtres transportant leur chien en voiture sans aucune protection.En cas de choc à 50km/h un petit chien de 10 kg qui n’est pas attaché devient un projectile de 250kg qui va traverser l’habitacle de votre voiture !Il existe maintenant des accessoires qui permettent de voyager en voiture avec son chien en toute sécurité.Ne jouez pas avec la sécurité de votre chien ni avec celle de votre entourage, transportez votre chien en voiture de manière sécurisée… BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! Les différentes méthodes pour transporter un chien en voiture La ceinture de sécurité pour chienLa ceinture de sécurité pour chien est le minimum que vous puissiez faire pour transporter votre chien en voiture.En cas de contrôle de police vous éviterez une amende et il peut également éviter les accidents liés à un chien qui deviendrait incontrôlable en voiture.Vous trouverez ce type de ceinture de sécurité en ligne pour seulement quelques euros.Au niveau sécurité, ne vous faîtes aucune illusion, ce type de ceinture n’a aucun intérêt. Il est évident que l’attache coté collier ne supportera pas la pression en cas d’accident et que votre chien finira dans le pare-brise ou dans le siège conducteur ou passager.Le harnais pour transporter son chien en voitureLe harnais de sécurité pour chien est un produit un peu plus performant.Mais comme pour la ceinture de sécurité je ne leur fais pas confiance.Je trouve dommage que ce type de produit n’affiche pas clairement leur performance en cas de choc (et ce n’est surement pas un hasard).Bref je vous conseille avant d’acheter un harnais de bien observer chaque pièce qui le compose et surtout celles qui sont attachées à la ceinture et celles qui font le lien entre le harnais et la ceinture.Si ça ne ressemble pas à un véritable mousqueton passez votre chemin. Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! La caisse de transport pour transporter son chienLa caisse de transport pour chien reste la meilleure méthode pour transporter son chien en toute sécurité dans votre voiture.Attention il ne faut pas la placer sur le siège passager même si vous l’attachez avec la ceinture de sécurité. En cas de choc la caisse va se briser sous la pression de la ceinture et le chien sera expulsé.En revanche si la taille de votre caisse vous le permet vous pouvez la caler entre la banquette et le siège avant.Sinon la meilleure solution pour transporter votre chien : mettre la caisse de transport dans le coffre, bien calé contre un coté.De cette manière votre chien et vos passagers seront en sécurité.Autre point non négligeable, si les pompiers ou des passants viennent à votre secours après un accident, il est préférable que votre chien soit dans une caisse de transport. Un chien en liberté et en état de choc peut-être un sérieux problème.Encore trop de maîtres son réticent à l’idée d’enfermer leur chien dans une caisse de transport mais sachez que pour un chien c’est un espace rassurant, surtout quand on part en voyage. Il suffit de dresser son chien pour l’habituer à la voiture comme à la caisse de transport.Que dit la loi sur les chiens en voiture ? On me pose souvent la question : est-ce obligatoire d’attacher son chien en voiture ?Le code de la route oblige le conducteur ainsi que les passager d’un véhicule à porter une ceinture de sécurité (article R412-1).Il précise également que les possibilités de mouvement et le champ de vision d’un conducteur ne doivent pas être réduit par des passagers ou objets transportés (article R412-6).Donc si en cas de contrôle votre chien est en liberté dans votre voiture, le principe de précaution prévaut, et vous risquez une amende de 2ème classe car votre chien est un risque potentiel d’entrave à la liberté de vos mouvements ou de votre champ de vision.Même le meilleur éducateur canin peut dresser son chien à prendre la voiture mais il ne peut pas garantir à 100% les réactions de son chien.Les forces de l’ordre peuvent également considérer votre chien comme un passager non attaché, auquel cas vous écoperez en plus d’une amende de 4ème classe.Mais peu importe ce que dit la loi, transporter un chien en voiture n’est pas un acte anodin et il faut prendre un maximum de précautions pour vous, vos passagers et votre chien.Transportez votre chien en voiture en toute sécurité… Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour !

Bien comprendre les besoins nutritionnels de votre chien est très important. La nourriture joue un rôle primordial sur sa santé.

On aimerait que nos chiens restent à nos cotés pour toute la vie.Malheureusement leur espérance de vie est plus courte que la notre et même si la science fait des progrès de jour en jour, en moyenne un chien va vivre entre 10 et 15 ans.Voici quelques conseils à suivre pour aider votre chien à bien vieillir et donc à vivre plus longtemps et surtout en meilleur santé… BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! Un bon vétérinaire pour aider son chien à bien vieillirC’est évidemment la base pour avoir un chien en pleine forme tout au long de sa vie. L’idéal est de rendre visite au moins une fois par an à son vétérinaire pour une visite de routine.N’oubliez pas que vous travaillez en équipe avec votre vétérinaire : c’est à vous de surveiller au quotidien votre chien et de lui faire part d’éventuelles anomalies que vous aurez remarqué (voir article : Choisir son vétérinaire).Une bonne hygiène dentaire pour aider son chien à bien vieillirSaviez vous qu’une mauvaise hygiène dentaire de votre chien peut entrainer de graves problèmes de santé (notamment des problèmes de cœur ou de reins).Certains maîtres se sentent parfois ridicules de laver les dents de leurs chiens mais sachez qu’à chaque brossage vous permettez à votre chien de vieillir en meilleure santé.Ne négligez pas l’hygiène de votre chien, ses dents, ses gencives, ses griffes, ses oreilles, son poil… faire la toilette à son chien c’est partager du temps avec lui et c’est aussi un moyen de détecter d’éventuels problèmes. Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! Une bonne alimentation pour aider son chien à bien vieillirL’alimentation est très importante pour la santé de votre chien. Vous devez absolument la contrôler, aussi bien au niveau qualité que quantité.Choisissez une nourriture adaptée aux besoins de votre chien (qui évoluent en fonction de son âge).Utilisez un verre gradué ou une balance pour gérer les quantités (n’oubliez pas de compter les éventuelles friandises de la journée).Vous devez également peser régulièrement votre chien et vous assurer qu’il est proche de son poids idéal.De l’exercice pour aider son chien à bien vieillirQuel que soit l’âge de votre chien celui-ci doit faire de l’exercice. Evidemment vous devez adapter l’intensité et la durée à l’âge de votre chien.Le but est de l’aider à bien vieillir pas d’en faire un grand sportif. N’oubliez pas de démarrer en douceur pour que les muscles de votre chien s’échauffent et de finir en douceur également pour qu’ils se relaxent.Une heure d’exercice tous les jours est l’idéal pour aider son chien à bien vieillir.Du repos pour aider son chien à bien vieillir De la même façon que votre chien à besoin d’exercice pour bien vieillir, il a besoin également de repos de qualité.Le stress est très mauvais pour la santé, pour vous comme pour votre chien.Votre chien doit pouvoir faire une petite sieste d’au moins une heure par jour sans être déranger pour bien récupérer.Dresser son chien pour l’aider à bien vieillirEn tant que maître vous devez continuer de stimuler intellectuellement votre chien. Je dis souvent qu’éduquer son chien ça n’est pas seulement lui apprendre à rapporter la balle.En continuant son éducation tout au long de sa vie vous aidez votre chien à bien vieillir. Inutile de lui apprendre des nouveaux tours tous les jours mais régulièrement confrontez-le à des nouveautés (objets, odeurs, jeux, endroits,…).Le plus important pour aider son chien à bien vieillirSi vous lisez cet article, c’est que vous avez déjà le plus important des éléments pour aider votre chien à vieillir : l’amour que vous lui portez.Surveillez son hygiène, son alimentation, son sommeil vont aider votre chien à gagner quelques années de vie supplémentaires, mais ce que désire plus que tout votre chien c’est de passer du temps avec vous.Profitez au maximum de votre chien, il ne demande que ça !

Contrairement à ce qu’on pourrait croire, trop de vitamines peut être dangereux.Des glucides pour votre chienLes glucides sont le dernier élément des besoins nutritionnels de votre chien. Ils n’ont pas toujours bonne réputation et pourtant ils sont une aide précieuse pour le corps de votre chien.Ils permettent de conserver les intestins de votre chien en bon état et d’éviter des diarrhées ou constipation. Ils fournissent également de l’énergie aux tissus ce qui permet à votre chien de conserver ses protéines et de les utiliser à bon escient.Comme pour les graisses il faut contrôler et gérer les quantités, mise à part ça les glucides font partie intégrante des besoins nutritionnels de votre chien.

L’idéal est de rendre visite au moins une fois par an à son vétérinaire pour une visite de routine.N’oubliez pas que vous travaillez en équipe avec votre vétérinaire : c’est à vous de surveiller au quotidien votre chien et de lui faire part d’éventuelles anomalies que vous aurez remarqué (voir article : Choisir son vétérinaire).Une bonne hygiène dentaire pour aider son chien à bien vieillirSaviez vous qu’une mauvaise hygiène dentaire de votre chien peut entrainer de graves problèmes de santé (notamment des problèmes de cœur ou de reins).Certains maîtres se sentent parfois ridicules de laver les dents de leurs chiens mais sachez qu’à chaque brossage vous permettez à votre chien de vieillir en meilleure santé.Ne négligez pas l’hygiène de votre chien, ses dents, ses gencives, ses griffes, ses oreilles, son poil… faire la toilette à son chien c’est partager du temps avec lui et c’est aussi un moyen de détecter d’éventuels problèmes. Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! Une bonne alimentation pour aider son chien à bien vieillirL’alimentation est très importante pour la santé de votre chien. Vous devez absolument la contrôler, aussi bien au niveau qualité que quantité.Choisissez une nourriture adaptée aux besoins de votre chien (qui évoluent en fonction de son âge).Utilisez un verre gradué ou une balance pour gérer les quantités (n’oubliez pas de compter les éventuelles friandises de la journée).Vous devez également peser régulièrement votre chien et vous assurer qu’il est proche de son poids idéal.De l’exercice pour aider son chien à bien vieillirQuel que soit l’âge de votre chien celui-ci doit faire de l’exercice. Evidemment vous devez adapter l’intensité et la durée à l’âge de votre chien.Le but est de l’aider à bien vieillir pas d’en faire un grand sportif. N’oubliez pas de démarrer en douceur pour que les muscles de votre chien s’échauffent et de finir en douceur également pour qu’ils se relaxent.Une heure d’exercice tous les jours est l’idéal pour aider son chien à bien vieillir.Du repos pour aider son chien à bien vieillir De la même façon que votre chien à besoin d’exercice pour bien vieillir, il a besoin également de repos de qualité.Le stress est très mauvais pour la santé, pour vous comme pour votre chien.Votre chien doit pouvoir faire une petite sieste d’au moins une heure par jour sans être déranger pour bien récupérer.Dresser son chien pour l’aider à bien vieillirEn tant que maître vous devez continuer de stimuler intellectuellement votre chien. Je dis souvent qu’éduquer son chien ça n’est pas seulement lui apprendre à rapporter la balle.En continuant son éducation tout au long de sa vie vous aidez votre chien à bien vieillir. Inutile de lui apprendre des nouveaux tours tous les jours mais régulièrement confrontez-le à des nouveautés (objets, odeurs, jeux, endroits,…).Le plus important pour aider son chien à bien vieillirSi vous lisez cet article, c’est que vous avez déjà le plus important des éléments pour aider votre chien à vieillir : l’amour que vous lui portez.Surveillez son hygiène, son alimentation, son sommeil vont aider votre chien à gagner quelques années de vie supplémentaires, mais ce que désire plus que tout votre chien c’est de passer du temps avec vous.Profitez au maximum de votre chien, il ne demande que ça !

TITRE: Peut-on donner du potiron à un chien ? Oui, mais il y a des subtilités !
CATÉGORIE: Non catégorisé
CONTENU:
La réponse courte est oui : le potiron est non seulement sans danger pour les chiens, mais il est même bénéfique s’il est bien préparé ! Le potiron, en plus d’être riche en nutriments, peut être une excellente source de fibres et de vitamines pour nos compagnons à quatre pattes.Cependant, avant de sauter dans la préparation d’un festin automnal pour votre chien, voyons en détail les avantages, précautions, et meilleures façons de donner du potiron à votre chien. BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! Le potiron, une mine de nutriments pour votre chienLe potiron regorge de nutriments essentiels, comme les vitamines A, C et E, ainsi que des minéraux tels que le potassium et le fer. Ces éléments jouent un rôle important dans la santé oculaire, le renforcement du système immunitaire et le maintien de la peau et du pelage de votre chien.Le potiron est aussi peu calorique, parfait pour les chiens qui doivent surveiller leur poids. Par exemple, j’ai souvent recommandé le potiron pour des chiens en surpoids, comme mon client Max, un labrador retriever gourmand mais en surpoids. En remplaçant une partie de sa ration de croquettes par du potiron, Max a pu retrouver un poids santé tout en étant rassasié.Une étude menée par l’université d’Helsinki montre que les fibres du potiron aident à améliorer la digestion et peuvent être particulièrement bénéfiques pour les chiens ayant des problèmes intestinaux. Les fibres solubles du potiron agissent en régulant la digestion, ce qui peut être utile pour un chien souffrant de constipation légère ou de diarrhée.Comment préparer le potiron pour votre chienCru ou cuit ?Il est préférable de cuire le potiron pour le rendre plus facile à digérer. Évitez de donner le potiron cru, car sa texture fibreuse peut être difficile à mâcher et à digérer pour certains chiens. La cuisson à la vapeur est une bonne méthode, car elle conserve les nutriments tout en ramollissant la chair.Peut-on manger la peau du potiron ?Il vaut mieux éviter ! La peau du potiron, bien que comestible, est plus difficile à digérer pour un chien, en particulier pour les petites races comme les chihuahuas ou les teckels, dont le système digestif est plus délicat.Quelle quantité de potiron pour un chien ?En général, une cuillère à soupe de purée de potiron est suffisante pour un chien de taille moyenne. Pour les chiens plus petits comme le shih tzu ou le bouledogue français, réduisez la portion à une demi-cuillère. Pour les grandes races comme le berger allemand ou le golden retriever, deux cuillères à soupe peuvent convenir.Pour les chiots :Introduisez le potiron de manière progressive et en petites quantités, car leur système digestif est encore en développement.Les chiens seniors :Pour les chiens plus âgés, comme Rex, un vieux cocker spaniel que j’ai accompagné, le potiron a aidé à soulager ses problèmes digestifs liés à l’âge. En intégrant une petite quantité de potiron dans son alimentation, Rex a retrouvé une digestion plus stable et un regain d’énergie.Une recette simple de purée de potiron pour chienSi vous souhaitez régaler votre compagnon, voici une petite recette que j’ai souvent recommandée :Ingrédients : 100 g de potiron cuit (à la vapeur ou bouilli), une pincée de curcuma (antioxydant naturel) et une petite cuillère de yaourt nature (pour des probiotiques qui soutiennent la digestion).Préparation : Écrasez le potiron cuit pour en faire une purée, ajoutez le curcuma et le yaourt. Mélangez bien et servez cette purée comme complément au repas principal.Potiron et particularités de raceIl est intéressant de noter que certaines races semblent bénéficier davantage des bienfaits digestifs du potiron. Les races prédisposées aux sensibilités digestives, comme les bouviers bernois ou les bergers australiens, peuvent voir une amélioration de leur transit avec un peu de potiron dans leur alimentation.Attention cependant aux races comme le bouledogue anglais, qui ont souvent des estomacs plus sensibles : intégrez le potiron en très petites quantités pour éviter tout désagrément.Conclusion : le potiron, un ami pour votre chien ?En somme, peut-on donner du potiron à un chien ? Oui, et c’est même une excellente idée si l’on respecte quelques règles simples ! Que vous ayez un petit bichon frisé ou un grand danois, le potiron, préparé et servi en petites quantités, peut offrir des bienfaits nutritionnels intéressants.Alors pourquoi ne pas essayer cette petite touche automnale dans la gamelle de votre chien ? Vous verrez, il pourrait bien en devenir friand !Si vous avez des anecdotes à partager ou des questions supplémentaires, laissez un commentaire ci-dessous – je serai ravi de vous lire et d’y répondre. Après tout, chaque chien a sa personnalité, et qui mieux que son humain pour connaître ses goûts !

Vous êtes un amoureux des animaux et vous aimeriez voir votre chien et votre chat vivre en parfaite harmonie ?La cohabitation entre chien et chat peut paraître difficile voir impossible mais il y a quelques techniques à connaître pour faire en sorte que les choses se passent bien.Vous n’êtes pas obligé de vous en remettre au hasard, si vous voulez que votre chien et votre chat cohabitent, vous pouvez les aider en suivant ces conseils… BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! Une cohabitation parfois difficileLes chiens et les chats sont des animaux merveilleux mais très différents.Le chien est un animal sociable tandis que le chat est très indépendant. Quand un chat lève la patte c’est pour menacer tandis que le chien y voit une invitation à jouer.Généralement, quand un chien remue la queue c’est qu’il est content, alors que le chat remue la queue quand il est agacé.Un chat couché sur le flan est détendu alors que le chien y voit un signe de soumission.Bref si la cohabitation entre chien et chat est difficile c’est parce qu’ils ne fonctionnent pas de la même façon.Mais c’est à vous de prendre les choses en main ! Si vous voulez que votre chien et votre chat vivent en paix, vous pourrez les aider de différentes manières.D’abord en préparant le terrain, avant même de ramener votre nouveau chien ou chat à la maison, ensuite en préparant au mieux leur première rencontre pour que ni votre chat, ni votre chien ne soient traumatisés.Enfin pour ceux qui auraient complètement raté ces deux étapes, rassurez-vous il y a toujours des solutions pour rectifier le tir.Mais avant de vous donner toutes ces solutions pour faire cohabiter un chien et un chat, je tiens à préciser une petite chose. Beaucoup de maîtres espèrent voir leurs animaux devenir les meilleurs amis du monde, jouer ensemble, faire des siestes ensemble…Malheureusement, il n’y a pas de méthode de dressage pour ça, ce n’est pas une science exacte. Tout ce que vous pouvez faire c’est éviter que votre chien ne chasse votre chat, qu’il se fasse crever les yeux d’un coup de griffe ou qu’il tue le chat (malheureusement ça arrive plus souvent qu’on ne le croit).Si vous faîtes les choses correctement vous éviterez ce genre de problème et c’est le plus important, c’est ce que j’appelle la cohabitation entre chien et chat. Avec le temps et un peu de chance, il y a de fortes chances pour qu’ils deviennent les meilleurs amis du monde mais ça, c’est du bonus ! Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! Préparer le terrain à la cohabitation entre chien et chatSi vous n’avez pas encore choisi votre nouvel animal, sachez que plus il sera jeune et plus les choses seront faciles. Et plus l’animal que vous avez déjà (chien ou chat) est également jeune plus, les choses seront faciles.Donc si vous pensez adopter un nouvel animal, faîtes-le au plus tôt.Si vous en avez la possibilité, je vous conseille également d’imprégner un jouet ou un tissu avec l’odeur de votre futur chien ou chat et de le ramener chez vous quelques jours avant pour que votre animal actuel s’habitue à son odeur.Ensuite, il va falloir aménager votre maison en conséquence pour faciliter la cohabitation entre chien et chat. Dans un premier temps il vaut mieux séparer les territoires de chacun.Si possible faîtes en sorte qu’il y ait des endroits en hauteur sur le territoire de votre chat pour qu’il puisse se réfugier et se reposer.Séparer également les gamelles et faîtes attention à mettre la litière de votre chat dans un endroit tranquille hors d’accès du chien, qu’il n’est pas à l’esquiver à chaque fois qu’il veut faire ses besoins.Dans l’idéal, je vous recommande une pièce spéciale pour votre chat avec un arbre à chat, ses gamelles, sa litière et une barrière bébé pour empêcher votre chien de rentrer dans cette pièce.Pour finir si vous avez un chien et que vous allez accueillir un chat, je vous recommande de travailler son éducation au plus tôt. Vous aurez besoin des commandes de base : l’ordre assis et le rappel.Si vous avez un chat et que vous allez accueillir un chien, je vous recommanderai bien de travailler son dressage également mais je ne suis pas spécialiste en la matière ;-) en revanche je vous recommande d’avoir sous la main quelques friandises qu’il adore (thon émietté par exemple) vous verrez que vous en aurez besoin pour la suite.Une bonne présentation pour une bonne cohabitation La première impression est très importante pour votre chien et votre chat, il faut y aller en douceur.Les problèmes sont généralement liés aux instincts du chien. Il y a plusieurs solutions, soit votre chien va vouloir jouer avec le chat, soit le considérer comme une proie, soit l’ignorer.Dans les deux premiers cas, le chat va fuir ce qui va renforcer les instincts du chien et l’inciter à continuer. Il faut donc travailler avec votre chien.La première chose à faire avant les présentations est de promener votre chien. Son énergie doit être au plus bas, faîtes-le courir et jouer un bon moment, fatiguez-le.Une fois qu’il aura dépensé son énergie, il sera temps de démarrer les présentations.Gardez votre chien en laisse pour rentrer dans la maison et préparer quelques friandises. Votre chat doit se trouver dans son espace réservé. Emmenez votre chien devant la barrière bébé et laissez-les s’observer.Votre chien doit rester calme, s’il montre des signes d’agressivité ou s’il est un peu trop excité et tire sur la laisse, dîtes non et demandez lui de s’asseoir. Vous devez rediriger son attention sur vous pour le calmer. Le message que doit comprendre votre chien c’est que s’il est calme en présence du chat, il est récompensé.Si votre chat s’enfuit et se réfugie quelque part, c’est qu’il n’est pas encore prêt. Ne forcez surtout pas les choses, n’essayez surtout pas d’attraper le chat et de l’approcher du chien. Vous recommencerez l’opération plus tard.Faîtes également attention à votre énergie. Essayez de rester calme, les animaux ressentent votre stress et vous ne les aiderez pas en étant nerveux. Si vous utilisez une barrière, ils ne risquent rien, donc pas d’inquiétude.Si vous n’avez pas de barrière pour bébé, vous pouvez faire la même chose à deux. Une personne attire le chat avec des friandises et une autre personne s’occupe du chien en laisse pour qu’il reste calme. Là encore le chat doit pouvoir s’enfuir s’il le souhaite.Laissez patiemment les choses se faire, c’est votre chat qui donne le rythme. Si votre chien reste calme, votre chat finira par s’approcher et ils feront connaissance naturellement. Vous pourrez ensuite passer à une pièce plus grande sans barrière mais toujours avec votre chien attaché.Il faudra encore les surveiller quelques semaines. La cohabitation entre chien et chat prend du temps. Les instincts de votre chien peuvent se réveiller à tout moment, surtout si votre chat se met à s’enfuir. Donc pour le moment, ne les laissez pas dans la même pièce sans surveillance. Quand vous êtes là, gardez votre chien en laisse et faîtes en sorte qu’il reste calme en présence du chat.La durée pour qu’un chien et un chat s’apprivoisent peut varier mais je vous conseille de ne pas les laisser seuls sans surveillance pendant un bon mois car il y a parfois des rechutes.Comment rattraper un mauvais départ ?Vous ne vous êtes pas préparé pour l’arrivée d’un nouvel animal et vous avez raté les présentations ? Alors il va falloir tout reprendre à zéro. Les principes restent les mêmes, donner à votre chat un espace sécurisé et travailler avec votre chien.Vous allez pratiquer régulièrement (quelques minutes tous les jours) des exercices avec votre chien devant votre chat. Prenez quelques friandises et travaillez les ordres de bases avec votre chien ou votre chiot.Assis, couché, donner la patte, travaillez ce que vous voulez. Le principal est qu’il s’habitue à la présence du chat et qu’il soit concentré sur vous.Récompensez-le s’il fait bien les choses, au moindre mauvais comportement détournez son attention avec un jouet ou un ordre et récompensez-le.Evidemment si votre chien et votre chat se mettent à interagir récompensez-les (attention à ne pas faire de jaloux).Soyez patient et consistant, avec le temps votre chien et votre chat devrait s’habituer l’un à l’autre et mieux décrypter leur langage respectif. Une fois cette étape passée, la cohabitation entre chien et chat devient plus facile.Avec le temps, ils pourront s’ignorer et vivre en paix ou si vous avez de la chance devenir les meilleurs amis du monde !

En commençant par étudier votre rythme de vie et étudier les races de chien calme comme celles que vous venez de lire vous verrez que votre choix sera plus limité et donc plus facile.Mais attention avoir un chien calme ne veut pas dire que vous n’aurez pas à vous en occuper ou à le stimuler.Même si vous êtes casanier, que vous préférez rester chez vous et que vous avez choisi une race de chien adaptée à votre style de vie, il faudra tout de même le stimuler au quotidien.En revanche ce sera plus facile et moins physique. Au lieu de le faire courir pendant des heures, faîtes lui faire des jeux basés sur la mémoire, l’odorat, faîtes lui découvrir de nouvelles odeurs, de nouvelles matières…Et surtout puisque vous allez passer beaucoup de temps à l’intérieur avec lui, profitez-en pour travailler son éducation.

TITRE: Comment apprendre l’ordre couché à son chien ?
CATÉGORIE: Non catégorisé
CONTENU:
Si vous maîtrisez l’ordre « assis » et que votre chien l’a bien assimilé, vous allez pouvoir passer à l’ordre «couché».C’est un ordre essentiel dans l’éducation de base de votre chien. Impossible de dresser son chien sans cet ordre.L’ordre «couché» renforce les liens entre le chien et son maître et se révèlera très utile au quotidien et au cours des promenades avec votre chien. BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! Plusieurs méthodes pour dresser son chien à l’ordre couchéLa position couchée est une position d’attente de longue durée chez le chien. ll sera donc beaucoup plus simple de garder votre chien au même endroit durant votre absence si celui-ci est couché que s’il est assis ou debout.C’est aussi une position de soumission pour le chien. Elle est donc utile pour recadrer ou canaliser un chien qui teste votre autorité, qui est turbulent ou qui adopte une posture sexuelle.Cela permet aussi de rassurer les gens au restaurant, dans le bus ou le métro, devant la sortie d’école tout simplement parce qu’un chien couché est moins impressionnant que debout.Bref dresser son chien à l’ordre couché va vous faciliter la vie et celle de votre entourage. Comme l’apprentissage pour l’ordre «assis», il y a plusieurs manières d’apprendre à son chien à se coucher sur ordre. Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! Méthode passive pour dresser son chien l’ordre couchéIl s’agit comme pour l’ordre assis de bien observer votre chien et de repérer les moments où votre chien va se coucher. Lorsque votre chien prend la position couchée de lui-même, dîtes couché et félicitez-le en le caressant pour le récompenser.De la même manière que pour l’ordre assis, le timing est très important. Il est nécessaire de bien synchroniser l’ordre avec le moment où votre chien exécute la position. Dresser son chien est souvent l’affaire de quelques secondes.Répétez plusieurs fois cet exercice et vous verrez que votre chien comprendra assez vite cet ordre. L’avantage avec cette méthode, c’est que vous pouvez l’utiliser même si votre chien n’a pas encore parfaitement assimilé l’ordre «assis».Il y a également des techniques très simples qui permettent de provoquer naturellement la position couchée chez le chien si vous n’avez pas le temps d’attendre qu’il le fasse de lui-même.Méthode classique pour dresser son chien à l’ordre couchéC’est une méthode qui fonctionne très bien avec les chiots ou jeunes chiens. Commencez par demander à votre chien de s’asseoir (voir : dresser son chien à l’ordre assis).Lorsque votre chien est en position assise, dîtes couché tout en lui prenant les pattes avant et en les tirant doucement vers l’avant afin d’accompagner votre chien au sol en position couchée.Allez-y doucement pour ne pas l’inquiéter. N’oubliez pas que c’est une position de soumission chez le chien et il aura besoin d’être en confiance pour se laisser faire.N’hésitez pas à le rassurer lorsque vous le manipulerez, dresser son chien demande une certaine complicité donc prenez votre temps, et surtout lorsqu’il prend la position couchée, félicitez-le.Autre méthode pour dresser son chien à l’ordre couché Voici une autre méthode qui marche très bien avec les chiens de grande taille. Demandez d’abord à votre chien de s’asseoir.Une fois qu’il est assis, prenez une croquette, un gâteau ou un biscuit que vous mettrez dans votre main. Ensuite, placez votre main poing fermé à environ 20cm devant votre chien et descendez votre main jusqu’au sol.Votre chien devrait se coucher automatiquement car ses pattes sont plus longues que sa gueule et il sera plus facile pour lui de se coucher pour atteindre la nourriture que de se relever.Si votre chien baisse la tête pour renifler la nourriture dans votre main mais ne s’est pas couché, essayez d’éloigner votre main, toujours au ras du sol.Le chien va suivre avec son nez votre main et adopter la position couchée.Il ne reste plus qu’à joindre le mot « Couché ! » à sa position et félicitez-le vivement en lui donnant sa récompense et en le caressant.Essayez ensuite de faire cet exercice sans lui présenter de croquettes. Demandez-lui de se coucher. Dès qu’il obéit, donnez-lui la croquette pour le récompenser. Continuez jusqu’à supprimer complètement la croquette.Félicitez-le à chaque fois qu’il se couche.Répétez le jeu plusieurs fois pendant plusieurs jours. Au début, ne demandez pas à votre chien de rester trop longtemps en position couchée. Allongez progressivement cette durée par la suite.Ca y’est ! vous avez dressé votre chien à l’ordre « couché ». Essayez maintenant de ne plus demander à votre chien de s’asseoir avant et donnez-lui l’ordre de se coucher lorsqu’il est debout.A vous de jouer !N’oubliez pas dresser son chien demande avant tout de la patience et doit être un moment de plaisir pour vous comme pour votre chien.L’ordre couché fait partie des basiques que votre chien devrait maîtriser rapidement. D’ici quelques temps votre chien devrait avoir compris l’ordre et vous n’aurez plus qu’à le renforcer en pratiquant un peu tous les jours.Attention ne vous arrêtez pas en chemin, continuez l’éducation de votre chien car il ne demande que ça. Passez à la marche en laisse sans tirer, à l’apprentissage du rappel par exemple qui sont très importants !Si vous cherchez un programme clé en main, complet et simple à mettre en oeuvre, je vous recommande « Dresser son chien en 15 minutes par jour« .Cette méthode contient de multiples jeux et exercices à pratiquer avec votre chien pour non seulement qu’il soit parfaitement éduqué mais aussi renforcer vos liens !Alors n’attendez plus et découvrez dès maintenant « Dresser son chien en 15 minutes par jour » Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour !

Suivez ces quelques conseils pour faire en sorte que ce moment soit aussi merveilleux pour vous que pour lui.L’arrivée de votre chiot va se dérouler en deux étapes : le premier jour et surtout la première nuit. Chacune d’entre elles demandent un minimum de préparation… BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! Le premier jour de votre chiot à la maison Pour votre chiot ce premier jour est surtout un grand moment de stress, probablement le plus grand stress qu’il ai connut.Votre chiot vient de perdre sa mère, ses frères et sœurs, et sa maison. Même si vous êtes évidemment prêt à lui fournir toute l’affection dont il a besoin, votre chiot aura besoin d’un petit temps d’adaptation (ça n’est pas le moment de commencer à le dresser ;-).Donc laissez le découvrir à son rythme, ne le bousculez pas, et n’oubliez pas de prévenir le reste de la famille (surtout les enfants si vous en avez) qu’il est préférable de le laisser tranquille pour son premier jour.Soyez surtout attentif au sommeil de votre chiot.Un chiot a besoin de repos régulièrement et il est important qu’il puisse se reposer dans un endroit calme sans être dérangé. Mise à part ça, il n’y a pas vraiment d’inquiétude à avoir. Si vous avez sécurisé votre maison avant l’arrivée de votre chiot et que vous avez les accessoires indispensables pour votre chiot il ne vous reste plus qu’à vous asseoir et l’observer évoluer dans son nouvel environnement.Les choses vont se corser quand la nuit va tomber… Votre chien mérite le meilleur départ ! Ne ratez pas notre ebook essentiel⤹ Prénom * Email * La première nuit de votre chiot à la maison Votre chiot avait l’habitude de se coucher avec sa petite famille pour lui tenir chaud et c’est évidemment à ça qu’il va penser à l’heure d’aller se coucher.Il se sentira seul et un peu stressé par ce nouvel environnement.Rassurez-vous si vous appliquez l’une de ces méthodes ça passera très vite et surtout votre chiot dormira rapidement à l’endroit où vous le souhaitez.Première nuit « à la dure »C’est la méthode classique mais parfois difficile à réaliser pour certains d’entre nous.Il suffit d’installer le panier de votre chiot dans la pièce où vous souhaitez qu’il dorme. Laissez un tissu avec votre odeur dans son panier, l’idéal étant un tissu provenant de chez l’éleveur avec l’odeur de sa mère et du reste de sa famille pour qu’il se sente en confiance.Si votre éleveur ne vous a rien fournit sachez qu’il existe des sprays contenant des phéromones d’apaisement que votre vétérinaire pourra vous fournir si vraiment votre chien est trop stressé et qu’il a du mal à s’habituer à sa nouvelle maison. Une goutte dans le panier de votre chiot et celui-ci se sentira apaisé et en sécurité.Avant d’aller se coucher, n’oubliez pas le diner de votre chiot, la ballade pour faire ses besoins et même de jouer avec lui pour le fatiguer un peu.Ensuite emmenez le dans son panier et quittez la pièce. Il est fort probable que votre chiot se mette à pleurer.C’est la partie difficile de cette méthode. Malheureusement si vous céder et retournez voir votre chiot pour le consoler, vous lui aurez appris qu’il suffit de pleurer pour obtenir ce qu’il veut et les choses risques d’être très compliquées par la suite.Donc vous aurez besoin d’être solide et le reste de votre famille aussi (dresser son chien est parfois une épreuve). N’oubliez pas non plus de prévenir vos voisins de l’arrivée de votre chiot et des éventuels bruits la nuit qui ne dureront pas.Première nuit en douceur Cette méthode est moins dure psychologiquement. Il s’agit d’installer le panier de votre chiot dans votre chambre pour la première nuit.Ensuite au fur et à mesure que votre chien s’habitue à son nouvel environnement vous pourrez éloigner son panier.Commencez près de votre lit, puis dans un coin de votre chambre, puis dans le couloir, et ainsi de suite jusqu’à ce qu’il finisse dans la pièce ou vous souhaitez le faire dormir.Avec cette méthode vous éviterez surement les pleurs de votre chiot.En revanche il est parfois difficile d’éloigner le panier de votre chiot même si vous le faîtes de façon progressive. Au final, certains d’entre vous seront donc obligés d’appliquer la première méthode.Faites de beaux rêves avec votre chiot… Votre chien mérite le meilleur départ !

Délimiter l’espace pour votre chiot ou votre chien La première chose à faire est de délimiter le périmètre dans lequel votre chiot ou votre chien pourra circuler.Il est fort probable que vous ayez besoin d’empêcher votre chien d’accéder à certains endroits de votre appartement ou de votre maison.Que ce soit pour sa propre sécurité (éviter qu’il ne tombe dans les escaliers) ou votre propre confort (protéger une pièce des dégâts que peut faire un chiot) pensez à sécuriser toutes les portes et toutes les fenêtres.Dans certains cas une barrière comme celle-ci : Barrière Bettacare peut être un bon investissement (ou une bonne source d’inspiration si vous êtes un peu bricoleur ;-).Restreindre l’espace disponible pour votre chien vous permettra également de dresser votre chien plus facilement.Une fois le périmètre délimiter il ne vous reste plus qu’à le sécuriser en vous mettant à la place de votre chien.

Un lot comme celui-ci : Protections Coins suffit à protéger plusieurs pièces.Si certains placards accessibles à votre chien, contiennent des produits dangereux essayez de les mettre ailleurs ou installez des systèmes d’ouverture sécurisé de ce type : Bloque Porte.Attention également à vos plantes d’intérieurs, qu’elles soient toxiques ou pas faîtes en sorte qu’elles soient hors de portée de votre chien ainsi que tout objet fragile ou précieux à vos yeux.Si vraiment vous êtes dans l’incapacité de mettre certaines plantes ou certains objets hors de portée de votre chien sachez qu’il existe des sprays répulsifs qui permettent de maintenir votre chien à l’écart des zones sensibles.Félicitation, votre maison est maintenant prête à accueillir votre chien en toute sécurité !Dernière vérification avant l’arrivée de votre chiot ou de votre chien En matière de sécurité on n’est jamais assez prudent !

TITRE: Votre chien est droitier ou gaucher ?
CATÉGORIE: Non catégorisé
CONTENU:
Vous êtes vous déjà demandé si votre chien est droitier ou gaucher ? Moi oui, et comme je ne suis pas le seul à me poser des questions bizarres sur les chiens, la science a décidé de réaliser quelques tests sur nos boules de poils préférées.Comme je ne pouvais pas garder ça pour moi, voici quelques techniques simples pour savoir si votre chien est droitier ou gaucher et les informations que vous pouvez en déduire sur son comportement. BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! Parlons latéralisation !C’est ainsi que les scientifiques nomment la préférence de votre chien pour sa patte gauche, droite ou les deux.Aussi surprenant que ça puisse paraître, de nombreuses études ont été menées sur le sujet.Il se trouve qu’il existe une relation entre les comportements latéralisés de votre chien et certaines autres caractéristiques comportementales et physiologique (comme la peur, le stress et la réactivité).Ces études sont notamment utiles pour mieux sélectionner les chiens susceptibles de devenir chien guide.C’est une formation difficile et peu de chien vont jusqu’au bout. Suivant sa latéralisation, un chien aurait plus ou moins de chance de réussir.Mais revenons à nos moutons… Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! Test pour savoir si votre chien est droitier ou gaucherPour connaître les préférences d’un chien, la science a utilisé plusieurs techniques.Le test le plus courant consiste à coller un bout de scotch sur le museau de votre chien et d’observer quelle patte il utilise pour l’enlever. Vous pouvez également simplement poser un morceau de tissu sur la tête de votre chien et attendre de voir s’il va utiliser sa patte gauche ou droite.Vous pouvez aussi utiliser la nourriture. Mettez une friandise dans votre main, gardez la fermée et présentez lui. Votre chien devrait poser l’une de ses pattes sur votre main. Vous pouvez également faire le test avec un récipient ou avec un jouet distributeur de friandises.Dernier test, il vous suffit d’observer la patte mise en avant quand votre se met à marcher ou à courir.Les scientifiques ont également mis au point une formule pour déterminer le degré de latéralisation, autrement dit pour savoir si votre chien est un gaucher très prononcé ou plutôt léger :LI = (R-L/R+L)x100 (j’adore les scientifiques ;-)R c’est le nombre de fois que votre chien a utilisé sa patte droite et L pour sa patte gauche. Plus le résultat est élevé plus la préférence de votre chien est forte.Généralement, les femelles sont plutôt droitières tandis que les mâles sont gauchers. Il ne vous reste plus qu’à faire le test et voir ce que l’on peut en déduire sur votre chien…Droitier, gaucher : qu’est ce que ça change ?Les grands vainqueurs de ce test sont les chiens droitiers et si votre chien est un droitier très prononcé c’est encore mieux.Apparemment, le dressage d’un chien droitier est plus facile que celui d’un gaucher. Les tests ont montré que les chiens droitiers réussissent plus souvent le cursus de chien guide.Les résultats montrent également que les chiens ayant une faible latéralisation ont plus peur des sons forts que les chiens ayant une forte latéralisation (droitier ou gaucher).Ils ont également plus de mal à rester au repos dans un endroit qu’ils ne connaissent pas. Donc plus la latéralisation de votre chien est forte moins il est peureux et anxieux.Evidemment ces résultats ne sont que des moyennes et il faut les prendre avec du recul. Les études sur le sujet sont assez récentes et il y a encore beaucoup de choses à découvrir.Mais au moins vous savez maintenant si votre chien est droitier ou gaucher. Croyez-moi peu de maîtres savent ce genre de chose sur leur chien.Faîtes le test, la prochaine fois que vous croisez un autre maître et son chien en ballade, plutôt que de lui demander le nom ou l’âge de son chien, demandez lui s’il est droitier ou gaucher ;-)Alors votre chien est droitier ou gaucher ?

TITRE: Comment apprendre l’ordre couché à son chien ?
CATÉGORIE: Non catégorisé
CONTENU:
Si vous maîtrisez l’ordre « assis » et que votre chien l’a bien assimilé, vous allez pouvoir passer à l’ordre «couché».C’est un ordre essentiel dans l’éducation de base de votre chien. Impossible de dresser son chien sans cet ordre.L’ordre «couché» renforce les liens entre le chien et son maître et se révèlera très utile au quotidien et au cours des promenades avec votre chien. BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! Plusieurs méthodes pour dresser son chien à l’ordre couchéLa position couchée est une position d’attente de longue durée chez le chien. ll sera donc beaucoup plus simple de garder votre chien au même endroit durant votre absence si celui-ci est couché que s’il est assis ou debout.C’est aussi une position de soumission pour le chien. Elle est donc utile pour recadrer ou canaliser un chien qui teste votre autorité, qui est turbulent ou qui adopte une posture sexuelle.Cela permet aussi de rassurer les gens au restaurant, dans le bus ou le métro, devant la sortie d’école tout simplement parce qu’un chien couché est moins impressionnant que debout.Bref dresser son chien à l’ordre couché va vous faciliter la vie et celle de votre entourage. Comme l’apprentissage pour l’ordre «assis», il y a plusieurs manières d’apprendre à son chien à se coucher sur ordre. Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! Méthode passive pour dresser son chien l’ordre couchéIl s’agit comme pour l’ordre assis de bien observer votre chien et de repérer les moments où votre chien va se coucher. Lorsque votre chien prend la position couchée de lui-même, dîtes couché et félicitez-le en le caressant pour le récompenser.De la même manière que pour l’ordre assis, le timing est très important. Il est nécessaire de bien synchroniser l’ordre avec le moment où votre chien exécute la position. Dresser son chien est souvent l’affaire de quelques secondes.Répétez plusieurs fois cet exercice et vous verrez que votre chien comprendra assez vite cet ordre. L’avantage avec cette méthode, c’est que vous pouvez l’utiliser même si votre chien n’a pas encore parfaitement assimilé l’ordre «assis».Il y a également des techniques très simples qui permettent de provoquer naturellement la position couchée chez le chien si vous n’avez pas le temps d’attendre qu’il le fasse de lui-même.Méthode classique pour dresser son chien à l’ordre couchéC’est une méthode qui fonctionne très bien avec les chiots ou jeunes chiens. Commencez par demander à votre chien de s’asseoir (voir : dresser son chien à l’ordre assis).Lorsque votre chien est en position assise, dîtes couché tout en lui prenant les pattes avant et en les tirant doucement vers l’avant afin d’accompagner votre chien au sol en position couchée.Allez-y doucement pour ne pas l’inquiéter. N’oubliez pas que c’est une position de soumission chez le chien et il aura besoin d’être en confiance pour se laisser faire.N’hésitez pas à le rassurer lorsque vous le manipulerez, dresser son chien demande une certaine complicité donc prenez votre temps, et surtout lorsqu’il prend la position couchée, félicitez-le.Autre méthode pour dresser son chien à l’ordre couché Voici une autre méthode qui marche très bien avec les chiens de grande taille. Demandez d’abord à votre chien de s’asseoir.Une fois qu’il est assis, prenez une croquette, un gâteau ou un biscuit que vous mettrez dans votre main. Ensuite, placez votre main poing fermé à environ 20cm devant votre chien et descendez votre main jusqu’au sol.Votre chien devrait se coucher automatiquement car ses pattes sont plus longues que sa gueule et il sera plus facile pour lui de se coucher pour atteindre la nourriture que de se relever.Si votre chien baisse la tête pour renifler la nourriture dans votre main mais ne s’est pas couché, essayez d’éloigner votre main, toujours au ras du sol.Le chien va suivre avec son nez votre main et adopter la position couchée.Il ne reste plus qu’à joindre le mot « Couché ! » à sa position et félicitez-le vivement en lui donnant sa récompense et en le caressant.Essayez ensuite de faire cet exercice sans lui présenter de croquettes. Demandez-lui de se coucher. Dès qu’il obéit, donnez-lui la croquette pour le récompenser. Continuez jusqu’à supprimer complètement la croquette.Félicitez-le à chaque fois qu’il se couche.Répétez le jeu plusieurs fois pendant plusieurs jours. Au début, ne demandez pas à votre chien de rester trop longtemps en position couchée. Allongez progressivement cette durée par la suite.Ca y’est ! vous avez dressé votre chien à l’ordre « couché ». Essayez maintenant de ne plus demander à votre chien de s’asseoir avant et donnez-lui l’ordre de se coucher lorsqu’il est debout.A vous de jouer !N’oubliez pas dresser son chien demande avant tout de la patience et doit être un moment de plaisir pour vous comme pour votre chien.L’ordre couché fait partie des basiques que votre chien devrait maîtriser rapidement. D’ici quelques temps votre chien devrait avoir compris l’ordre et vous n’aurez plus qu’à le renforcer en pratiquant un peu tous les jours.Attention ne vous arrêtez pas en chemin, continuez l’éducation de votre chien car il ne demande que ça. Passez à la marche en laisse sans tirer, à l’apprentissage du rappel par exemple qui sont très importants !Si vous cherchez un programme clé en main, complet et simple à mettre en oeuvre, je vous recommande « Dresser son chien en 15 minutes par jour« .Cette méthode contient de multiples jeux et exercices à pratiquer avec votre chien pour non seulement qu’il soit parfaitement éduqué mais aussi renforcer vos liens !Alors n’attendez plus et découvrez dès maintenant « Dresser son chien en 15 minutes par jour » Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour !

TITRE: Les besoins nutritionnels de votre chien
CATÉGORIE: Non catégorisé
CONTENU:
Bien comprendre les besoins nutritionnels de votre chien est très important. La nourriture joue un rôle primordial sur sa santé. Le chien est un omnivore, ce qui veut dire qu’il peut manger n’importe quelle nourriture (je ne tiens pas compte des chaussures ou tout autre objet que votre chien a l’habitude de manger ;-).Pour répondre aux besoins nutritionnels de votre chien il faut que son alimentation soit répartie en 6 groupes alimentaires.C’est la clef d’une alimentation équilibrée et d’un chien en pleine forme ! BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! De l’eau pour votre chienDe l’eau, de l’air, la vie ! C’est vrai pour vous et c’est aussi vrai pour votre chien. L’eau représente 60 à 70% du poids d’un chien adulte.Une partie des besoins en eau de votre chien se trouve dans sa nourriture (la nourriture en boite contient environ 78% d’eau et la nourriture sèche environ 10%).Il est donc primordial que votre chien ait accès à de l’eau fraîche (je ne parle pas de température, simplement renouvelez tous les jours la gamelle d’eau de votre chien).Petite précision pour ceux qui sont en train d’apprendre la propreté à leur chiot : vous pouvez surveiller et limiter la quantité d’eau que votre chiot absorbe (donner lui de l’eau à des moments spécifiques comme après la balade par exemple).En cas de forte chaleur ne prenez pas de risques, un chien se déshydrate rapidement (vous pouvez également lui mettre un glaçon à la place de l’eau, il l’absorbera plus lentement).

Elles vont lui fournir les acides aminés nécessaires au bon développement de son corps. Les protéines contiennent 23 acides aminés dont 10 sont essentiels pour la bonne santé de votre chien. Les autres sont également importants mais votre chien peut les fabriquer lui même.Généralement, on considère que les protéines animales sont plus intéressantes pour votre chien que les protéines végétales.Des minéraux pour votre chienLes minéraux n’ont aucune valeur énergétique mais ils font partie des besoins alimentaires de votre chien. Ils doivent être présents dans l’alimentation de votre chien car contrairement à certains acides aminés, les chiens ne peuvent pas les produire.Le fer, le magnésium, le zinc, le calcium vont permettre des réactions métaboliques assurant ainsi le bon fonctionnement de l’organisme de votre chien.Par exemple, sans minéraux dans son alimentation votre chien n’aura pas les os solides. Ils participent également à la bonne santé des dents de votre chien qui est un élément crucial pour lui et sa longévité (n’oubliez pas de brosser les dents de votre chien régulièrement et les vôtres aussi ;-).De la graisse pour votre chien Si votre chien n’a pas une belle peau ou une belle fourrure, surveillez ses besoins en graisse. La graisse a non seulement un rôle énergétique mais elle permet aussi à votre chien d’absorber certains vitamines qui se dissolvent dans la graisse.Autre point important, les chiens aiment les graisses. C’est très bien de répondre à ses besoins alimentaires mais il faut aussi prendre du plaisir dans tout ça ! Attention tout de même aux excès.La nourriture industrielle est généralement adaptée aux besoins de vos chiens mais attention aux petites friandises qui sont souvent un peu plus riches.Surtout si vous utilisez la nourriture pour le éduquer votre chien, n’oubliez pas de diminuer les quantités aux repas.Des vitamines pour votre chienVotre chien a besoin de vitamines, tout comme vous. Ils participent au bon fonctionnement de l’organisme ils sont indispensables aux échanges vitaux.Votre chien ne peut pas les synthétiser lui même, mais rassurez-vous si son alimentation est équilibrée, il aura les vitamines dont il a besoin.Inutile de donner des suppléments de vitamine à votre chien sauf si votre chien a une déficience et que votre vétérinaire vous le demande. Contrairement à ce qu’on pourrait croire, trop de vitamines peut être dangereux.Des glucides pour votre chienLes glucides sont le dernier élément des besoins nutritionnels de votre chien. Ils n’ont pas toujours bonne réputation et pourtant ils sont une aide précieuse pour le corps de votre chien.Ils permettent de conserver les intestins de votre chien en bon état et d’éviter des diarrhées ou constipation. Ils fournissent également de l’énergie aux tissus ce qui permet à votre chien de conserver ses protéines et de les utiliser à bon escient.Comme pour les graisses il faut contrôler et gérer les quantités, mise à part ça les glucides font partie intégrante des besoins nutritionnels de votre chien.

TITRE: L’âge du chien
CATÉGORIE: Non catégorisé
CONTENU:
Il est communément admis qu’un chien vieilli 7 fois plus vite qu’un homme. Il suffirait donc de multiplier par 7 l’âge de votre chien pour obtenir l’âge correspondant à un humain.En réalité cette méthode n’est pas très précise car de nombreux paramètres entrent en compte dans l’âge du chien et peuvent entrainer de grosses variations.Voici donc un peu plus d’informations sur le sujet et un tableau de correspondance de l’âge du chien par rapport à l’homme qui vous apportera plus de précisions.L’un des facteurs les plus importants dans l’âge du chien est son poids.Nous avons donc réalisé un tableau qui prend en compte cet élément pour avoir une idée un peu plus précise de l’âge du chien.Vous verrez que les résultats sont parfois très différents de ceux obtenus en multipliant l’âge de votre chien par 7.Age de votre chienPoids de votre chien– de 15kg Entre 15 et 40 kg+ de 40 kg6 mois15 ans10 ans8 ans1 an20 ans18 ans14 ans1,5 ans25 ans21 ans18 ans2 ans28 ans27 ans22 ans3 ans32 ans33 ans31 ans4 ans36 ans39 ans40 ans5 ans40 ans45 ans49 ans6 ans44 ans51 ans58 ans7 ans48 ans57 ans67 ans8 ans52 ans63 ans76 ans9 ans56 ans69 ans85 ans10 ans60 ans75 ans96 ans11 ans64 ans80 ans105 ans12 ans68 ans85 ans112 ans13 ans72 ans90 ans120 ans14 ans76 ans96 ans15 ans80 ans102 ans16 ans84 ans110 ans17 ans88 ans18 ans94 ans19 ans100 ans20 ans110 ans Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! Comment utiliser le tableau de correspondance d’âge du chien?Tout d’abord, déterminez la catégorie à laquelle appartient votre chien.Pour les chiens de moins de 15 kilos, on trouve entre autres les Yorkshires, Cockers, Teckels, CKC, Westies, Shih Tzus, Bichons, Caniches, Beagles, Fox terriers, Cotons de Tuléar, Cairn Terriers, Whippets, Chichuahuas…Pour les chiens de 15 à 40 kilos, citons notamment les Bergers allemands, Labradors, Setters, Epagneuls, Bergers Belges, Golden Retrievers, Beaucerons, Braques, Boxers, Dobermans, Bassets, Colleys, Briards, Husky…Et, enfin pour les chiens de plus de 40 kilos, il y a en particulier les Dogues, Bouviers bernois, Terre-Neuves, Leonbergs, Saint-Bernards, Montagnes des Pyrénées…A 6 mois, la maturité d’un Golden Retriever (catégorie des chiens entre 15kg et 40kg) correspond à celle d’un enfant de 10 ans et ainsi de suite.Ces chiffres sont une moyenne générale, la maturité et le vieillissement suivent des courbes différentes selon la taille du chien.Par exemple, les gros chiens mûrissent plus lentement mais vieillissent plus vite et leur durée moyenne de vie est généralement inférieure de 25% à celle des plus petits chiens.A 2 ans, un Saint-Bernard est beaucoup plus jeune psychologiquement et physiquement qu’un caniche du même âge. Mais à 6 ans, c’est le contraire, le Saint-Bernard sera plus mâture et plus vieux physiquement qu’un caniche du même âge.Un chien de grandes races ou qui vit à l’extérieur soumis aux aléas du climat ou qui fait beaucoup d’exercices a une durée de vie plus courte qu’un chien de petites races ou un chien d’appartement.Alors, dîtes-moi quel âge a votre chien ? Quand votre chien entrera dans sa période sénescence :10 ans pour un chien de moins de 15kg,9 ans pour un chien entre 15kg et 40kg,7 ans pour un chien de plus de 40kg,il est conseillé de faire un bilan de santé de votre chien par votre vétérinaire.En effet, votre chien ne présenta pas soudainement des signes de sénilité. Mais c’est la période où les symptômes de ralentissement des fonctions de l’organisme sont visibles.Cette période de sénescence peut durer de nombreuses années et il est important de connaître les points à surveiller afin de garder votre chien en pleine forme.Cela peut éviter bien des soucis tant au chien qu’à son maître mais ce sujet fera l’objet d’un prochain article plein de conseils pour aider son chien à bien vieillir…Mieux vaut prévenir que guérir !

Bien comprendre les besoins nutritionnels de votre chien est très important. La nourriture joue un rôle primordial sur sa santé. Le chien est un omnivore, ce qui veut dire qu’il peut manger n’importe quelle nourriture (je ne tiens pas compte des chaussures ou tout autre objet que votre chien a l’habitude de manger ;-).Pour répondre aux besoins nutritionnels de votre chien il faut que son alimentation soit répartie en 6 groupes alimentaires.C’est la clef d’une alimentation équilibrée et d’un chien en pleine forme !

De l’eau pour votre chienDe l’eau, de l’air, la vie ! C’est vrai pour vous et c’est aussi vrai pour votre chien. L’eau représente 60 à 70% du poids d’un chien adulte.Une partie des besoins en eau de votre chien se trouve dans sa nourriture (la nourriture en boite contient environ 78% d’eau et la nourriture sèche environ 10%).Il est donc primordial que votre chien ait accès à de l’eau fraîche (je ne parle pas de température, simplement renouvelez tous les jours la gamelle d’eau de votre chien).Petite précision pour ceux qui sont en train d’apprendre la propreté à leur chiot : vous pouvez surveiller et limiter la quantité d’eau que votre chiot absorbe (donner lui de l’eau à des moments spécifiques comme après la balade par exemple).En cas de forte chaleur ne prenez pas de risques, un chien se déshydrate rapidement (vous pouvez également lui mettre un glaçon à la place de l’eau, il l’absorbera plus lentement).

Elles vont lui fournir les acides aminés nécessaires au bon développement de son corps. Les protéines contiennent 23 acides aminés dont 10 sont essentiels pour la bonne santé de votre chien. Les autres sont également importants mais votre chien peut les fabriquer lui même.Généralement, on considère que les protéines animales sont plus intéressantes pour votre chien que les protéines végétales.Des minéraux pour votre chienLes minéraux n’ont aucune valeur énergétique mais ils font partie des besoins alimentaires de votre chien.

TITRE: Les principales idées reçues sur les chiens
CATÉGORIE: Non catégorisé
CONTENU:
Un chien qui a mordu remordra forcément, un chien qui remue la queue est heureux… C’est le genre d’idée reçu que l’on entend, que l’on répète et qui finissent par être considérées comme acquises.Mais que sait-on vraiment sur ces idées reçues vieilles comme le monde ? Parfois fausses, parfois vraies et la plupart du temps imprécises… Alors faîtes le test pour savoir si vous connaissez bien votre chien et découvrez toute la vérité !Un chien qui remue la queue est heureux ?Non, un chien remue la queue en cas d’agitation ou d’excitation. Mais cette agitation peut-être positive ou négative. Un chien heureux remue la queue mais un chien agressif la remue tout autant !Plus le chien est petit, plus il est fragile ?Non, il suffit de comparer l’espérance de vie d’un chien de petite taille à un chien de grande taille (Lire notre rubrique Calculez l’âge du chien).Avec bien sûr une bonne hygiène de vie, une activité physique régulière ainsi qu’une alimentation adaptée à ses besoins, un petit chien pourra facilement dépasser l’âge de 15 ans !Un chien qui a mordu… remordra forcément !Pas forcément, le chien menace pour prévenir son entourage que quelque chose l’inquiète, lui fait peur ou mal et qu’il souhaite que cela cesse.Il est capital de savoir pourquoi il a mordu : dans quelles circonstances ? Qu’est-ce qu’il a vécu si négativement ? En réaction à quel événement ?C’est en comprenant ce qu’il a ressenti comme une menace qu’on se protège d’une nouvelle morsure dans les mêmes circonstances. Votre chien mérite le meilleur départ ! Ne ratez pas notre ebook essentiel⤹ Prénom * Email * Seul le chien mâle lève la patte pour uriner ?Non, certaines femelles dominantes lèvent également la patte pour uriner.Le chien qui lèche sa blessure guérit plus vite ?Oui, sauf s’il le fait trop.Le chocolat est-il nocif pour mon chien ?Oui, le chocolat contient de la théobromine qui à forte dose peut déclencher de graves troubles cardiaques, respiratoires et nerveux.Par exemple, l’ingestion de 200 grammes de chocolat noir peut terrasser un chien de taille moyenne.Il faut donc se montrer très vigilant et ne pas hésiter à rappeler aux enfants comme aux invités de ne pas donner du chocolat aux chiens.Sachez également que vous pouvez dresser votre chien pour qu’il ne mange que ce que vous lui donnez ( voir dresser son chien contre l’empoisonnement).Un chien qui mange de l’herbe est malade ?Non, c’est tout à fait normal chez le chien.Un chien n’a pas de problème de dents !Oui et non, le chien n’a généralement pas de caries mais est fortement sujet aux problèmes liées à la formation de tartre.Le chien a une salive beaucoup moins acide que celle de l’homme et le dépôt de tartre peut entraîner mauvaise haleine, inflammation de la gencive provoquant des douleurs qui peuvent décourager le chien de manger.Le chien a besoin d’une alimentation variée ?Non, le chien a besoin d’une alimentation équilibrée mais pas forcément variée.En effet, en changeant fréquemment et brutalement d’aliment, vous risquez de perturber le transit digestif du chien et d’entraîner l’apparition de flatulences, diarrhées ou réactions cutanées.Un chien malade a la truffe tiède ?Non, la température de la truffe du chien ne donne pas son état de santé.Pour connaître sa température, il faut utiliser un thermomètre.Le chien sait vous montrer qu’il est malade ?Non, l’instinct de survie du chien fait qu’il sait très bien cacher son état.S’il vous montre qu’il est malade, c’est qu’il est très mal en point.Une détérioration de la qualité du poil du chien est signe d’une déficience nutritionnelle ?Oui, le pelage est le miroir de la santé du chien. Excès de sébum, poils cassants et ternes, démangeaisons…Tout changement sonne comme une alarme et peut provenir d’une déficience en acides gras essentiels (Lire notre article Mon chien perd ses poils).Savez-vous que le chien utilise jusqu’à 30% de ses apports en protéines pour renouveler son pelage notamment en période de mue ?

Alors, avez vous appris des choses sur votre chien ?Quand j’ai eu mon chien, je n’avais pas d’expérience et il était facile de croire à tout cela.Je ne me méfiais pas assez des idées reçues autour du chien et les croyances persistaient. Maintenant, j’ai abandonné ces idées reçues et j’étudie les réactions de mon chien pour construire une bonne relation avec lui. Votre chien mérite le meilleur départ !

Ils participent au bon fonctionnement de l’organisme ils sont indispensables aux échanges vitaux.Votre chien ne peut pas les synthétiser lui même, mais rassurez-vous si son alimentation est équilibrée, il aura les vitamines dont il a besoin.Inutile de donner des suppléments de vitamine à votre chien sauf si votre chien a une déficience et que votre vétérinaire vous le demande. Contrairement à ce qu’on pourrait croire, trop de vitamines peut être dangereux.Des glucides pour votre chienLes glucides sont le dernier élément des besoins nutritionnels de votre chien. Ils n’ont pas toujours bonne réputation et pourtant ils sont une aide précieuse pour le corps de votre chien.Ils permettent de conserver les intestins de votre chien en bon état et d’éviter des diarrhées ou constipation. Ils fournissent également de l’énergie aux tissus ce qui permet à votre chien de conserver ses protéines et de les utiliser à bon escient.Comme pour les graisses il faut contrôler et gérer les quantités, mise à part ça les glucides font partie intégrante des besoins nutritionnels de votre chien.

CONTENU:
Je reçois régulièrement des demandes pour savoir quelle punition est efficace pour éduquer son chien à tel ou tel ordre. C’est évidemment un choix délicat car personne n’a envie de faire souffrir son chien inutilement.J’ai donc décidé de partager avec vous les 10 punitions les plus efficaces pour corriger les mauvais comportements de votre chien. Mais avant tout je vais faire avec vous une petite mise en situation pour bien comprendre ce qui fait l’efficacité d’une punition.Ainsi vous serez sûr de toujours choisir la bonne punition pour votre chien… BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! Mise en situation de la punitionImaginons que je sois votre meilleur ami. Entre nous tout va bien et la vie est belle. Un beau jour vous commencez à avoir des soucis au travail, avec votre famille, des factures qui s’accumulent…Sans vous en rendre compte, vous commencez à vous ronger les ongles. C’est une habitude que je n’aime pas du tout.Je vais essayer de vous l’expliquer mais nous ne parlons pas la même langue et vous ne comprenez pas ce que je dis.Un soir où nous sommes tranquillement assis dans le canapé, nous regardons notre émission préférée et sans vous en rendre compte, vous commencez à vous ronger les ongles.Cette fois-ci s’en est trop ! Je me lève et je vous colle une BAFFE !Evidemment vous arrêtez instantanément de vous ronger les ongles. Je me sens beaucoup mieux. Vous êtes un peu stressé mais comme vous avez un coeur en or, vous me pardonnez et nous reprenons tranquillement notre petite soirée.2 jours plus tard, nous nous retrouvons dans la même situation. Toujours stressé vous commencez à vous ronger les ongles à nouveau. Déçu que vous n’ayez pas encore compris ce que j’attends de vous, je me lève et je vous colle une ENORME BAFFE !Comme je n’aime pas la violence, je vais arrêter l’expérience ici. Je pense que vous avez compris le principe. Nous pouvons analyser maintenant ce qui s’est passé pour vous et pour moi. Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! Efficacité des punitionsVous ne savez pas pourquoi je vous ai collé cette première baffe.Est-ce que c’est parce que vous êtes assis dans le canapé ? Parce que je n’aime pas votre pyjama ? Vous n’avez pas sorti la poubelle ? Aucune idée !De mon coté, comme vous avez arrêté de vous ronger les ongles, je pense avoir réglé le problème, mais est-ce vraiment le cas ?Ai-je réglé votre problème au travail, avec votre famille ou vos factures ? Bien sur que non. Comme votre problème n’est pas réglé, votre comportement ne changera pas.A la seconde baffe, vous perdez toute confiance en moi. Vous commencez à vous dire : ce type est malade et dangereux pour moi.La prochaine fois que je m’approcherai de vous, vous aurez un doute sur mes intentions. Vous serez sur la défensive et peut-être même que vous allez montrer les dents !A ce stade je pense que vous avez compris que la punition est incompréhensible pour un chien. Elle stoppe un comportement sur le coup, mais ne règle pas le problème. Au contraire, elle va avoir des conséquences ravageuses sur la santé physique et morale de votre chien. Mais ce n’est pas tout :La punition va également détruire la relation de confiance entre vous et votre chien, doucement mais sûrement.Alors comment corriger son chien ? Je sais que certains d’entre vous se demandent : c’est bien gentil mais comment je fais quand mon chien fait des bêtises ?La première étape est de comprendre l’origine du mauvais comportement. Pourquoi votre chien a mangé votre chaussure, pourquoi il saute sur les invités, pourquoi il creuse des tranchées dans votre jardin.Vous ne pouvez pas corriger quelque chose que vous ne comprenez pas. Vous ne pouvez pas soigner une maladie si vous ne savez pas la diagnostiquer.Une fois que vous connaissez l’origine du problème, demandez-vous ce que vous aimeriez que votre chien fasse à la place.Comment répondre à son besoin, à son envie, tout en respectant vos règles du jeu.Une fois que vous savez ce que vous voulez, apprenez-le à votre chien et récompensez-le à chaque fois qu’il le fait. Apprenez-lui à s’asseoir quand les invités arrivent, vous verrez que petit à petit, il ne sautera plus sur personne !Si vous cherchez à punir votre chien, je suis désolé de vous le dire, mais c’est que vous manquez de connaissance sur les chiens.Utilisez ce site et d’autres sites sur les chiens, éduquez-vous et bannissez tous ceux qui utilisent la violence, la punition, la soumission, l’intimidation et toutes les vielles méthodes dépassées.Ces méthodes sont dangereuses pour le bien être de votre chien et se retourneront, un jour ou l’autre, contre vous ou l’un de vos proches.

TITRE: Les 7 règles d’or pour éduquer son chien
CATÉGORIE: Non catégorisé
CONTENU:
Il y a beaucoup de choses à apprendre pour éduquer son chien, mais il faut commencer par maîtriser les règles de base. Une fois que vous les aurez assimilées, éduquer votre chien sera beaucoup plus facile pour vous et surtout pour votre chien.Alors voici les 7 règles d’or à connaître pour éduquer son chien… BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! La positive attitude !Pour éduquer son chien, la méthode la plus efficace est de récompenser les bons comportements et d’ignorer/rediriger les mauvais.Je dis souvent qu’éduquer son chien rend meilleur car vous allez développer une capacité à repérer tout ce qu’il fait de bien.Petit à petit cette habitude peut s’élargir à tout votre entourage, vos enfants, vos amis, vos collègues…Et c’est ainsi que vous devenez une personne positive et appréciée de tous. Mais revenons à l’éducation de votre chien…Soyez patientIl faut de la patience pour éduquer son chien, c’est une qualité primordiale.Vous serez souvent surpris de voir à quel point votre chien peut apprendre certaines choses très vite et d’autres un peu plus lentement. Dans tous les cas faites preuve de patience car votre chien fait de son mieux.Ne tombez pas dans le piège des méthodes d’éducations « dures » qui utilisent la force, l’intimidation, la domination, la violence…Elles donnent l’impression d’être efficaces à court terme mais à long terme c’est tout le contraire.Ces méthodes détruisent la relation de confiance entre vous et votre chien et elles créent des troubles souvent plus importants que ceux que vous pensiez avoir réglés.Soyez régulier Pour éduquer son chien, il faut être régulier. Votre chien apprend par répétition. Plus vous répétez, plus il comprendra. Choisissez une méthode d’éducation positive et soyez régulier.Pour éduquer votre chien à s’asseoir, choisissez un mot clef (assis par exemple), un geste de la main et répétez, répétez, répétez.Essayez de garder la même tonalité de voix, plus vous êtes constant et mieux c’est. N’oubliez pas non plus de communiquer avec tous ceux qui participent à l’éducation de votre chien, mettez vous d’accord pour utiliser les mêmes règles.C’est beaucoup plus facile d’éduquer son chien si tout le monde est sur la même longueur d’onde. Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! Mettez-vous dans les pattes de votre chienPour bien éduquer son chien, il faut essayer de se mettre à sa place.Cela demande un peu de connaissance sur la façon dont fonctionne un chien, ses instincts, la façon dont il utilise ses sens… mais croyez-moi les choses seront beaucoup plus faciles pour vous et votre chien.Je me souviens d’un maître qui n’arrivait pas à apprendre la propreté à son chiot. Tous les soirs en rentrant du travail, il était de corvée de serpillère.Sauf que ce monsieur utilisait de la javel pour nettoyer (la javel incite un chiot à uriner). Evidemment, ça ne se devine pas. Cette simple information a changé la vie de ce maître et de son chien pour mon plus grand plaisir !Moralité de l’histoire : pour éduquer son chien, il faut avant tout s’éduquer soi même.Apprendre à écouter pour mieux éduquer son chienJe dis souvent que les chiens parlent à ceux qui savent écouter. Pour éduquer son chien, il vaut mieux savoir écouter.Pour reprendre l’exemple de la propreté, j’explique souvent qu’un chien prévient son maître avant de faire ses besoins.Il a son propre langage à lui, un langage corporel le plus souvent.Là encore, inutile de vous dire que découvrir le langage corporel de son chien est une véritable révélation pour certains maîtres, surtout pour l’apprentissage de la propreté.Apprendre à observer et à écouter votre chien vous aidera énormément pour l’éduquer.Surveillez la santé de son chienUn chien qui n’est pas en forme aura du mal à apprendre quelque chose.Votre chien a besoin d’exercice physique régulier pour être en forme et c’est aussi un très bon moyen de créer du lien avec lui.Attention également à la nourriture que vous lui donnez. Une mauvaise alimentation peut entraîner des troubles de santé mais aussi des troubles du comportement.N’oubliez pas de brosser les dents de votre chien et de l’emmener régulièrement voir le vétérinaire.Il est beaucoup plus facile d’éduquer son chien lorsqu’il est en pleine forme !Eduquer son chien tout au long de sa vieUn chien a besoin d’être stimulé mentalement. Eduquer son chien est l’une des meilleures réponses à ce besoin.Certains maitres arrêtent d’éduquer leur chien une fois qu’il maîtrise quelques ordres de base. C’est une erreur qui engendre des problèmes. Votre chien est heureux d’avoir quelque chose à faire.Demandez lui de s’asseoir, de se coucher, de faire le mort et il sera heureux. Faites lui également découvrir de nouvelles choses, de nouveaux objets, de nouveaux environnements, de nouvelles odeurs…Continuez de l’éduquer, de lui apprendre de nouvelles choses et de renforcer les anciennes. L’éducation de votre chien ne doit pas avoir de fin !Démarrer au plus vite l’éducation de votre chienVous avez énormément de choses à apprendre pour éduquer votre chien. Plus vous démarrez votre apprentissage rapidement, plus l’apprentissage de votre chien sera facile.Croyez-en mon expérience, il est bien plus facile d’apprendre les bonnes choses à son chien dès le départ que de rectifier les mauvaises habitudes qu’il prendra forcément si vous ne savez pas comment l’éduquer.Si vous souhaitez réellement prendre en main l’éducation de votre chien, je vous recommande la formation Dresser son chien en 15 minutes par jour.Elle contient toutes les notions théoriques pour comprendre votre chien mais aussi des tonnes d’exercices / jeux à pratiquer quelques minutes par jour pour non seulement avoir un chien parfaitement éduqué mais en plus renforcer vos liens avec lui. C’est à mon avis le meilleur cadeau que vous pouvez faire à votre chien ! Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour !

CATÉGORIE: Non catégorisé
CONTENU:
Choisir un chien est une étape difficile et souvent un véritable casse-tête pour toute la famille.On a souvent tendance à se laisser guider par l’esthétisme, la couleur, la taille, … Pourtant le critère le plus important pour choisir son chien reste votre rythme de vie. La pire erreur est de choisir un chien sportif, quand on est plutôt casanier et que l’on aime plus que tout rester chez soi.Alors pour aider certains d’entre vous et éviter de faire souffrir votre futur chien voici 12 races de chien pour nous : les pantouflards ! BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! Le Bichon Frisé Gentil et joueur le Bichon frisé a ses quarts d’heure de folie où il va se mettre à courir et à faire le fou dans votre appartement ou votre jardin.Mais très rapidement il s’arrête pour revenir à son activité principale, rester tranquille à vos cotés.Ces petits pics d’activités ainsi qu’une balade journalière sont tout ce dont il a besoin au quotidien pour être heureux (en plus de tout l’amour que vous avez à offrir ;-)C’est un petit chien qui ne prend pas beaucoup d’espace et ne demande pas beaucoup d’activité, parfait pour les pantouflards !Le bulldog Le bulldog n’a pas toujours l’air commode, mais c’est une race très gentille, très familiale et qui n’a pas besoin de faire beaucoup d’exercices.C’est une race très sensible à la chaleur, et il vaut mieux éviter de le faire courir en cas de températures élevées.C’est une race de taille moyenne qui peut peser jusqu’à 20-25KG et prendre un peu de place sur votre canapé.Le cavalier King Charles Spaniel Le Cavalier King Charles est un chien très vif et joyeux. Ce qu’il aime avant tout c’est passer du temps avec son maître mais il a surtout la capacité de s’adapter à son style de vie.Vous aimez passer votre dimanche en cuisine à faire des pâtisseries : il vous tiendra compagnie, vous préférez rester dans votre canapé à manger des pâtisseries : pas de problème pour lui, vos enfants ont besoin d’un compagnon de jeu : pas de problème pour lui non plus !Le Cavalier King Charles peut et sait tout faire !Le Shar Pei Le Shar Pei est un chien très doux et très tranquille. Il adorera passer des heures avec vous sur le canapé ou étalé devant la cheminée.C’est aussi un bon compagnon pour les enfants et il est également capable de monter la garde. Une petite balade journalière en guise d’exercice lui suffira amplement et il sera très heureux de rentrer au chaud à la maison !Attention tout de même à sa peau et à ses nombreux plis qui demandent de la vigilance et de l’entretien. Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! Le Chow Chow Le Chow Chow ressemble à un petit lion et il est aussi actif que ce dernier.C’est un très bon chien de garde et il demande peu d’activité car il fatigue vite.Attention ce chien peut être dominant, surtout envers ses congénères. Pour éviter ce problème il est toujours préférable d’éduquer son chien.Il a également besoin de fréquents brossages, mais tout va bien car c’est une activité d’intérieur !Le Bouledogue Français Le Bouledogue Français est très à la mode depuis quelques années car c’est un chien plein de joie de vivre et qui convient parfaitement à la vie en appartement.Une simple balade journalière lui suffit, et si le temps ne s’y prête pas il sera très heureux de jouer avec vous à l’intérieur car il n’aime pas les températures excessives.Il reste joueur même en vieillissant et adorera faire le clown et égayer vos journées tranquilles à la maison.Le Spitz Loup Le Spitz Loup est un chien vif et très attaché à son maître.Il fait un très bon chien de garde et il demande peu d’exercice.Il s’adapte très bien au rythme de vie de son maître avec qui il passera le maximum de temps possible.Il aime la vie de famille et s’adapte facilement en ville.Le Lhassa Apso C’est un très bon chien d’appartement. Il fut gardien de temple au Tibet pendant des années et garder votre maison reste son activité préférée.Une balade journalière ou quelques activités d’intérieures avec les enfants suffira pour sa dose d’exercice.C’est une race très fidèle qui peut avoir tendance à l’attachement et ne pas supporter la solitude.Le Pékinois Le Pékinois demande peu d’activité. Une petite balade au parc, et quelques jeux d’intérieurs lui suffisent.Il est loyal et obéissant mais ne sera pas idéal avec les enfants car il aura tendance à les ignorer.Il peut avoir un caractère assez froid et il demandera quelques efforts pour l’éducation.Le Shih Tzu Le Shih Tzu n’est pas un chien de garde ou de chasse mais il aimera vous ramener la balle de temps en temps.Il sera très heureux de sortir mais si vous n’êtes pas très courageux, une petite course dans l’appartement lui suffira.C’est un chien doux qui sait se faire respecter avec un caractère très jovial.Le Skye Terrier Comme son nom l’indique, c’est un terrier mais il n’en a pas forcément le comportement.C’est une race de chien qui a un lien très fort avec son maître. Il a son petit caractère mais il s’adaptera très bien à votre rythme de vie.Il a quelques petits problèmes avec les inconnus et son éducation n’est pas toujours facile. Mais il saura égayer vos journées sans vous demander de grosses activités.L’épagneul Tibétain Comme son cousin le Lhassa, il est originaire du Tibet.Lui aussi sera très heureux d’une petite balade mais quelques jeux en intérieur feront très bien l’affaire. Son activité préférée sera de protéger votre canapé des intrus.C’est un chien intelligent, éveillé et très lié à son maître. Il est également très sensible aux émotions de son maître.Des races de chien calmes mais qui doivent être stimulées quand même Choisir un chien adapté à son rythme de vie est vraiment l’un des critères les plus importants pour faire le bon choix, non seulement pour vous mais aussi pour votre chien.Beaucoup de troubles du comportement du chien sont dus à une frustration ou un déséquilibre de son rythme de vie. En commençant par étudier votre rythme de vie et étudier les races de chien calme comme celles que vous venez de lire vous verrez que votre choix sera plus limité et donc plus facile.Mais attention avoir un chien calme ne veut pas dire que vous n’aurez pas à vous en occuper ou à le stimuler.Même si vous êtes casanier, que vous préférez rester chez vous et que vous avez choisi une race de chien adaptée à votre style de vie, il faudra tout de même le stimuler au quotidien.En revanche ce sera plus facile et moins physique. Au lieu de le faire courir pendant des heures, faîtes lui faire des jeux basés sur la mémoire, l’odorat, faîtes lui découvrir de nouvelles odeurs, de nouvelles matières…Et surtout puisque vous allez passer beaucoup de temps à l’intérieur avec lui, profitez-en pour travailler son éducation. Eduquer un chien avec les bonnes méthodes est une très bonne activité, particulièrement stimulante !N’hésitez pas à partager cet article si vous connaissez quelqu’un de pantouflard et qui souhaite adopter un chien !

TITRE: Les besoins nutritionnels de votre chien
CATÉGORIE: Non catégorisé
CONTENU:
Bien comprendre les besoins nutritionnels de votre chien est très important. La nourriture joue un rôle primordial sur sa santé. Le chien est un omnivore, ce qui veut dire qu’il peut manger n’importe quelle nourriture (je ne tiens pas compte des chaussures ou tout autre objet que votre chien a l’habitude de manger ;-).Pour répondre aux besoins nutritionnels de votre chien il faut que son alimentation soit répartie en 6 groupes alimentaires.C’est la clef d’une alimentation équilibrée et d’un chien en pleine forme ! BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! De l’eau pour votre chienDe l’eau, de l’air, la vie ! C’est vrai pour vous et c’est aussi vrai pour votre chien. L’eau représente 60 à 70% du poids d’un chien adulte.Une partie des besoins en eau de votre chien se trouve dans sa nourriture (la nourriture en boite contient environ 78% d’eau et la nourriture sèche environ 10%).Il est donc primordial que votre chien ait accès à de l’eau fraîche (je ne parle pas de température, simplement renouvelez tous les jours la gamelle d’eau de votre chien).Petite précision pour ceux qui sont en train d’apprendre la propreté à leur chiot : vous pouvez surveiller et limiter la quantité d’eau que votre chiot absorbe (donner lui de l’eau à des moments spécifiques comme après la balade par exemple).En cas de forte chaleur ne prenez pas de risques, un chien se déshydrate rapidement (vous pouvez également lui mettre un glaçon à la place de l’eau, il l’absorbera plus lentement). Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! Des protéines pour votre chienLes protéines sont également très importantes pour votre chien. Elles vont lui fournir les acides aminés nécessaires au bon développement de son corps. Les protéines contiennent 23 acides aminés dont 10 sont essentiels pour la bonne santé de votre chien. Les autres sont également importants mais votre chien peut les fabriquer lui même.Généralement, on considère que les protéines animales sont plus intéressantes pour votre chien que les protéines végétales.Des minéraux pour votre chienLes minéraux n’ont aucune valeur énergétique mais ils font partie des besoins alimentaires de votre chien. Ils doivent être présents dans l’alimentation de votre chien car contrairement à certains acides aminés, les chiens ne peuvent pas les produire.Le fer, le magnésium, le zinc, le calcium vont permettre des réactions métaboliques assurant ainsi le bon fonctionnement de l’organisme de votre chien.Par exemple, sans minéraux dans son alimentation votre chien n’aura pas les os solides. Ils participent également à la bonne santé des dents de votre chien qui est un élément crucial pour lui et sa longévité (n’oubliez pas de brosser les dents de votre chien régulièrement et les vôtres aussi ;-).De la graisse pour votre chien Si votre chien n’a pas une belle peau ou une belle fourrure, surveillez ses besoins en graisse. La graisse a non seulement un rôle énergétique mais elle permet aussi à votre chien d’absorber certains vitamines qui se dissolvent dans la graisse.Autre point important, les chiens aiment les graisses. C’est très bien de répondre à ses besoins alimentaires mais il faut aussi prendre du plaisir dans tout ça ! Attention tout de même aux excès.La nourriture industrielle est généralement adaptée aux besoins de vos chiens mais attention aux petites friandises qui sont souvent un peu plus riches.Surtout si vous utilisez la nourriture pour le éduquer votre chien, n’oubliez pas de diminuer les quantités aux repas.Des vitamines pour votre chienVotre chien a besoin de vitamines, tout comme vous. Ils participent au bon fonctionnement de l’organisme ils sont indispensables aux échanges vitaux.Votre chien ne peut pas les synthétiser lui même, mais rassurez-vous si son alimentation est équilibrée, il aura les vitamines dont il a besoin.Inutile de donner des suppléments de vitamine à votre chien sauf si votre chien a une déficience et que votre vétérinaire vous le demande. Contrairement à ce qu’on pourrait croire, trop de vitamines peut être dangereux.Des glucides pour votre chienLes glucides sont le dernier élément des besoins nutritionnels de votre chien. Ils n’ont pas toujours bonne réputation et pourtant ils sont une aide précieuse pour le corps de votre chien.Ils permettent de conserver les intestins de votre chien en bon état et d’éviter des diarrhées ou constipation.

TITRE: Assurer son chien
CATÉGORIE: Non catégorisé
CONTENU:
En devenant maître de votre chien, vous êtes légalement responsable des dommages qu’il subit ou qu’il provoque.Comme tout être humain, il peut donc être assuré contre certains risques : dommages, maladies, décès… et pour certains chiens une assurance est obligatoire.Dresser-son-chien.com souhaite parler d’assurance pour chien en toute transparence. Ce site n’est pas là pour vous forcer à souscrire à une assurance chien mais plus pour vous aider à faire votre choix et pour décrypter les contrats d’assurance chien. BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! Est-il obligatoire d’assurer son chien ? Tous les maîtres de chien ne sont pas logés à la même enseigne. En fonction de la race et de la catégorie à laquelle appartient votre chien, vous avez l’obligation ou non d’assurer votre chien.La loi oblige uniquement les maîtres de chiens qui sont jugés à risque, à souscrire une assurance responsabilité civile (RC). Cette assurance protège des dommages et préjudices causés par votre chien aux tiers. Les chiens estimés à risque sont listés dans l’arrêté du 27 avril 1999, en deux catégories. La catégorie 1 regroupe les chiens d’attaque ; il s’agit par exemple des Pitbulls, des Mastiffs ou Boerbulls et des chiens de race Tosa. La catégorie 2 concerne les chiens de défense ou de garde tels que les Rottweilers ou les American Staffordshire Terriers.Tous ces chiens doivent donc être assurés pour leur responsabilité civile. Souvent, cette assurance se présente sous forme d’option payante dans votre assurance habitation.Cependant, toutes les assurances n’acceptent pas de couvrir ce risque. Certains assureurs sont plus réticents pour assurer les chiens de 1ère et 2e catégorie et peuvent refuser entièrement le risque, c’est-à-dire qu’ils refusent d’assurer le chien mais aussi de souscrire un contrat d’assurance habitation. Il existe donc des compagnies d’assurance qui se spécialisent dans ce type de risque et proposent un contrat spécifique pour les dommages causés par ces chiens.Quant à toutes les autres races de chiens, la loi n’oblige pas leurs maîtres à souscrire une assurance : ni responsabilité civile, ni mutuelle santé, ni obsèques décès.Mais, sachez que la plupart des races de chiens tels que bouvier, épagneul, chihuahua, bichon, boxer, labrador, teckel, caniche, berger, shetland, border collie, colley, griffon, carlin, bobtail, shih tzu… sont généralement couverts gratuitement par la garantie responsabilité civile incluse dans votre contrat d’assurance habitation. Pensez juste à le déclarer à votre compagnie d’assurance !Même si ces assurances ne sont pas obligatoires, selon votre situation, il est parfois nécessaire de choisir une assurance chien adaptée à vos besoins. Voici donc un peu plus d’informations sur les différents types d’assurances pour chien…Les différents types d’assurance pour chien La garantie de responsabilité civile pour chienTout d’abord, l’assurance de base est la garantie de responsabilité civile.Ce type d’assurance couvre les éventuels dégâts occasionnés par votre chien à un tiers.C’est généralement celle à laquelle on fait référence quand on parle de l’assurance pour chien et celle qui est obligatoire pour les chiens de catégorie 1 et 2.Attention, cette assurance ne protège aucunement votre chien, uniquement les dégâts qu’il peut causer, notamment lorsqu’il mord quelqu’un, qu’il provoque un accident de voiture ou renverse un cycliste en courant sur la chaussée …Ce qui signifie que les dommages subis par votre chien (blessures, accidents ou maladies…) ne sont pas pris en charge par cette garantie.Alors comment faire face alors à ces dommages qui ne sont pas couverts par la garantie de responsabilité civile ? Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! L’assurance santé pour chienPour protéger votre chien, il convient de souscrire une assurance santé chien auprès d’assureurs spécialisés.C’est elle qui remboursera les frais de santé de votre chien comme les visites chez le vétérinaire en cas de maladie ou d’accident.Les frais de santé d’un chien peuvent parfois devenir astronomiques. Tant que votre chien est en bonne santé une visite annuelle chez le vétérinaire suffit.En revanche si malheureusement votre chien connaît des problèmes de santé la facture peut devenir rapidement salée (100€ pour une analyse en laboratoire ou des medicaments antibiotiques, 300€ pour un diagnostic tumoral, entre 800€ et 1 500€ pour une fracture de la patte…).Ce n’est donc pas donné à tout le monde de bien soigner son chien. A tel point qu’un maître désemparé et dans l’impossibilité de faire face à de telles dépenses, est parfois dans l’obligation de faire euthanasier son chien.Avec une assurance maladie pour chien, vous êtes donc certain de pouvoir couvrir les soins médicaux de votre chien en cas de maladie ou d’accident.Il est bon de savoir que bien souvent les assureurs qui acceptent de couvrir les chiens de moins de 2 mois ou de plus de 10 ans à la date de souscription sont rares.En revanche, si votre chien a entre 3 mois et 8 ans, qu’il a une bonne santé et qu’il ne participe pas à votre activité professionnelle, vous n’aurez aucune difficulté à trouver une mutuelle adaptée à vos besoins. La plupart des assureurs proposent une mutuelle pour 20€ à 35€ par mois pour une formule complète.D’autres assureurs proposent à des prix très attractifs des assurances pour chiens. Attention toutefois à bien comparer avant de faire son choix. Il est important de bien connaître les soins pris en charge, à quel taux et ceux qui ne le sont pas. (Nous vous en reparlerons dans un prochain article)L’assurance obsèques décès pour chienIl existe également une assurance décès, généralement sous forme d’option gratuite ou payante dans l’assurance santé chien. Elle permet de couvrir tous les frais liés au décès de votre chien (inhumation, transports, etc.)Le chagrin est souvent immense au décès de son chien. Certes, une assurance décès chien ne vous aidera pas à surmonter l’épreuve mais tout du moins, vous pourrez lui offrir une fin digne. L’assurance décès vous verse également une somme qui vous permettra de vous offrir un nouveau compagnon. Un nouveau compagnon qui ne remplacera jamais celui que vous aurez perdu mais qui vous accompagnera dans votre douleur.Cette assurance est souvent incluse dans la mutuelle chien soit gratuitement, soit pour quelques euros en plus. Alors pourquoi s’en priver ?La première étape avant de souscrire une assurance pour chien Notre dernier conseil concernant l’assurance pour chien : éduquez votre chien. Quelle que soit votre décision concernant les assurances pour chien, il est important que vous puissiez contrôler votre chien en toutes circonstances.Evidemment le risque zéro n’existe pas, mais en dressant votre chien vous éliminerez une bonne partie des problèmes. Si votre chien saute sur tous ce qui bouge et qu’il ne répond pas à vos ordres, il y a de fortes chances que vous ayez besoin d’une assurance un jour ou l’autre.Donc prenez le temps de dresser votre chien, n’oubliez pas que c’est une activité amusante et que votre relation avec votre chien n’en sera que plus forte. Essayez de trouver un éducateur canin près de chez vous pour acquérir les bases, ou utiliser des méthodes comme celle-ci : Dresser votre chien en 15 minutes par jour.Non seulement vous éviterez les petits tracas qu’un chien peut provoquer au quotidien mais vous éviterez également des problèmes qui peuvent parfois être beaucoup plus importants et avoir des conséquences graves pour vous, votre famille et votre chien.Dans un prochain article nous vous apporterons un peu plus d’informations pour bien choisir une assurance chien, éviter les pièges, et trouver les meilleurs rapport qualité prix.D’ici là, commencez d’ores et déjà à apprendre à dresser votre chien ;-) Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour !

BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! Parlons latéralisation !C’est ainsi que les scientifiques nomment la préférence de votre chien pour sa patte gauche, droite ou les deux.Aussi surprenant que ça puisse paraître, de nombreuses études ont été menées sur le sujet.Il se trouve qu’il existe une relation entre les comportements latéralisés de votre chien et certaines autres caractéristiques comportementales et physiologique (comme la peur, le stress et la réactivité).Ces études sont notamment utiles pour mieux sélectionner les chiens susceptibles de devenir chien guide.C’est une formation difficile et peu de chien vont jusqu’au bout. Suivant sa latéralisation, un chien aurait plus ou moins de chance de réussir.Mais revenons à nos moutons… Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! Test pour savoir si votre chien est droitier ou gaucherPour connaître les préférences d’un chien, la science a utilisé plusieurs techniques.Le test le plus courant consiste à coller un bout de scotch sur le museau de votre chien et d’observer quelle patte il utilise pour l’enlever. Vous pouvez également simplement poser un morceau de tissu sur la tête de votre chien et attendre de voir s’il va utiliser sa patte gauche ou droite.Vous pouvez aussi utiliser la nourriture. Mettez une friandise dans votre main, gardez la fermée et présentez lui. Votre chien devrait poser l’une de ses pattes sur votre main. Vous pouvez également faire le test avec un récipient ou avec un jouet distributeur de friandises.Dernier test, il vous suffit d’observer la patte mise en avant quand votre se met à marcher ou à courir.Les scientifiques ont également mis au point une formule pour déterminer le degré de latéralisation, autrement dit pour savoir si votre chien est un gaucher très prononcé ou plutôt léger :LI = (R-L/R+L)x100 (j’adore les scientifiques ;-)R c’est le nombre de fois que votre chien a utilisé sa patte droite et L pour sa patte gauche. Plus le résultat est élevé plus la préférence de votre chien est forte.Généralement, les femelles sont plutôt droitières tandis que les mâles sont gauchers. Il ne vous reste plus qu’à faire le test et voir ce que l’on peut en déduire sur votre chien…Droitier, gaucher : qu’est ce que ça change ?Les grands vainqueurs de ce test sont les chiens droitiers et si votre chien est un droitier très prononcé c’est encore mieux.Apparemment, le dressage d’un chien droitier est plus facile que celui d’un gaucher. Les tests ont montré que les chiens droitiers réussissent plus souvent le cursus de chien guide.Les résultats montrent également que les chiens ayant une faible latéralisation ont plus peur des sons forts que les chiens ayant une forte latéralisation (droitier ou gaucher).Ils ont également plus de mal à rester au repos dans un endroit qu’ils ne connaissent pas. Donc plus la latéralisation de votre chien est forte moins il est peureux et anxieux.Evidemment ces résultats ne sont que des moyennes et il faut les prendre avec du recul. Les études sur le sujet sont assez récentes et il y a encore beaucoup de choses à découvrir.Mais au moins vous savez maintenant si votre chien est droitier ou gaucher. Croyez-moi peu de maîtres savent ce genre de chose sur leur chien.Faîtes le test, la prochaine fois que vous croisez un autre maître et son chien en ballade, plutôt que de lui demander le nom ou l’âge de son chien, demandez lui s’il est droitier ou gaucher ;-)Alors votre chien est droitier ou gaucher ?

Pas simple de trouver des noms de chien en X ! Rassurez-vous, je vous ai préparé une liste qui devrait vous aider. Pour vous proposer un peu plus de choix et faciliter la vie de votre chien, j’ai utilisé une petite astuce en ajoutant tous les mots commençant par « EX ».En effet, en plus d’offrir peu de noms de chien, le son X ou plutôt « CZ » comme dans Xavier, est difficilement identifiable pour un chien.

Voici quelques techniques qui pourraient vous aider.D’abord, faites le tour de vos passions et hobbies comme je l’ai fait. Il y a surement un vocabulaire propre à cette passion avec des mots qui commencent par un X. Ou peut-être un mot lié à cette passion que vous aimez particulièrement auquel vous pourriez simplement ajouter un X.C’est d’ailleurs la seconde technique que j’aime beaucoup qui consiste simplement à ajouter un X devant un mot qui vous plaît et qui sonne bien à votre oreille. Si ce mot commence par une consonne, remplacez simplement cette consonne par X.Enfin, la dernière technique consiste à découper et mélanger les syllabes des noms de votre proche ou de personnes que vous aimez et de reconstruire un nom pour votre chien. Là encore, il vous suffira d’ajouter un X au début du prénom.Ces techniques donnent souvent de bons résultats et surtout des noms vraiment uniques et personnels. Attention, tout de même à ce qu’il respecte les quelques règles suivantes pour qu’il soit pratique pour vous comme pour votre chien…Quelques règles pour un nom facile à comprendre pour votre chienQuelle que soit votre situation, il y a quelques règles à suivre pour choisir un nom de chien qui soit facile pour vous comme pour votre chien.D’abord, il vaut mieux choisir un nom que vous pourrez utiliser facilement en public. Imaginez-vous en train de rappeler votre chien Xtasie dans un parc, vous pourriez rapidement avoir l’air d’un dealer qui cherche des clients.Donc même si certains mots peuvent être drôles à première vue, attention de ne pas vous placer dans une situation compliquée.La seconde règle qui facilitera la vie de votre chien, consiste à choisir des mots que vous n’utilisez pas trop fréquemment. Evitez les noms humains, surtout ceux des personnes qui feront partie du quotidien de votre chien. Enfin, évitez des noms comme xassi ou xanier que votre chien aura du mal à distinguer du mot « assis » ou « panier ».Dernière règle : choisissez un prénom court de 2 syllabes et si possible se terminant par une voyelle. Xpo (expo) est un nom qui respecte très bien ces règles, il est court, il contient des sonorités qui « claque » et finit par un O.Peut-on choisir un nom de chien en X en 2024 ? Si vous ne vivez pas en France, en Belgique ou au Luxembourg, vous êtes libre de choisir le nom de chien que vous voulez et les seules restrictions que vous devriez suivre sont celles qui vous permettront de choisir un nom facile à comprendre pour votre chien et que nous venons de voir.En revanche, si vous vivez dans l’un de ces trois pays et que vous souhaitez que votre chien soit enregistré comme un « Chien de race », les choses sont un peu différentes.En effet, ces pays imposent la première lettre du nom de votre chien. En l’occurence pour cette année, vous devrait choisir un nom commençant par les lettres suivantes en fonction de votre pays :Pour la France et le Luxembourg : nom de chien en VPour la Belgique : nom de chien en XRassurez-vous, vous pourrez choisir un nom d’usage lors de l’enregistrement de votre chien et aucune restriction ne s’applique à ce nom d’usage. Votre chien aura donc un nom officiel commençant par la « bonne » lettre et un nom d’usage que vous utiliserez au quotidien.Vous pouvez aussi simplement ajouter la lettre de l’année devant le prénom de votre choix lors de l’enregistrement, c’est une pratique courante même si cela donne parfois des noms officiels étranges.Comment apprendre à votre chien son nom rapidement ?La première étape de l’éducation de votre chien passera par l’apprentissage de son nom. Une fois cette étape réussie, vous pourrez démarrer tout le reste de son éducation.Je vous conseille de démarrer au plus tôt car votre chien lui, n’attendra pas et commencera à prendre les bonnes et les mauvaises habitudes dès son arrivée chez vous. Donc préparez-vous dès maintenant, l’idéal étant d’être déjà « prêt » lorsque votre chien arrive.Si vous allez accueillir un chiot, je vous recommande particulièrement de lire l’article : Eduquer son chiot entre 2 et 5 mois pour être sûr de prendre un bon départ.Mais commencez avant tout par jeter un oeil à notre article : Comment apprendre son nom à son chien pour découvrir la bonne méthode et les erreurs à éviter pour qu’il reconnaisse son nom rapidement et qu’il comprenne que vous avez besoin de son attention quand vous l’appelez.J’ai oublié des noms ?

Bien comprendre les besoins nutritionnels de votre chien est très important. La nourriture joue un rôle primordial sur sa santé. Le chien est un omnivore, ce qui veut dire qu’il peut manger n’importe quelle nourriture (je ne tiens pas compte des chaussures ou tout autre objet que votre chien a l’habitude de manger ;-).Pour répondre aux besoins nutritionnels de votre chien il faut que son alimentation soit répartie en 6 groupes alimentaires.C’est la clef d’une alimentation équilibrée et d’un chien en pleine forme !

L’eau représente 60 à 70% du poids d’un chien adulte.Une partie des besoins en eau de votre chien se trouve dans sa nourriture (la nourriture en boite contient environ 78% d’eau et la nourriture sèche environ 10%).Il est donc primordial que votre chien ait accès à de l’eau fraîche (je ne parle pas de température, simplement renouvelez tous les jours la gamelle d’eau de votre chien).Petite précision pour ceux qui sont en train d’apprendre la propreté à leur chiot : vous pouvez surveiller et limiter la quantité d’eau que votre chiot absorbe (donner lui de l’eau à des moments spécifiques comme après la balade par exemple).En cas de forte chaleur ne prenez pas de risques, un chien se déshydrate rapidement (vous pouvez également lui mettre un glaçon à la place de l’eau, il l’absorbera plus lentement). Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! Des protéines pour votre chienLes protéines sont également très importantes pour votre chien. Elles vont lui fournir les acides aminés nécessaires au bon développement de son corps. Les protéines contiennent 23 acides aminés dont 10 sont essentiels pour la bonne santé de votre chien. Les autres sont également importants mais votre chien peut les fabriquer lui même.Généralement, on considère que les protéines animales sont plus intéressantes pour votre chien que les protéines végétales.Des minéraux pour votre chienLes minéraux n’ont aucune valeur énergétique mais ils font partie des besoins alimentaires de votre chien. Ils doivent être présents dans l’alimentation de votre chien car contrairement à certains acides aminés, les chiens ne peuvent pas les produire.Le fer, le magnésium, le zinc, le calcium vont permettre des réactions métaboliques assurant ainsi le bon fonctionnement de l’organisme de votre chien.Par exemple, sans minéraux dans son alimentation votre chien n’aura pas les os solides. Ils participent également à la bonne santé des dents de votre chien qui est un élément crucial pour lui et sa longévité (n’oubliez pas de brosser les dents de votre chien régulièrement et les vôtres aussi ;-).De la graisse pour votre chien Si votre chien n’a pas une belle peau ou une belle fourrure, surveillez ses besoins en graisse. La graisse a non seulement un rôle énergétique mais elle permet aussi à votre chien d’absorber certains vitamines qui se dissolvent dans la graisse.Autre point important, les chiens aiment les graisses. C’est très bien de répondre à ses besoins alimentaires mais il faut aussi prendre du plaisir dans tout ça ! Attention tout de même aux excès.La nourriture industrielle est généralement adaptée aux besoins de vos chiens mais attention aux petites friandises qui sont souvent un peu plus riches.Surtout si vous utilisez la nourriture pour le éduquer votre chien, n’oubliez pas de diminuer les quantités aux repas.Des vitamines pour votre chienVotre chien a besoin de vitamines, tout comme vous. Ils participent au bon fonctionnement de l’organisme ils sont indispensables aux échanges vitaux.Votre chien ne peut pas les synthétiser lui même, mais rassurez-vous si son alimentation est équilibrée, il aura les vitamines dont il a besoin.Inutile de donner des suppléments de vitamine à votre chien sauf si votre chien a une déficience et que votre vétérinaire vous le demande. Contrairement à ce qu’on pourrait croire, trop de vitamines peut être dangereux.Des glucides pour votre chienLes glucides sont le dernier élément des besoins nutritionnels de votre chien. Ils n’ont pas toujours bonne réputation et pourtant ils sont une aide précieuse pour le corps de votre chien.Ils permettent de conserver les intestins de votre chien en bon état et d’éviter des diarrhées ou constipation. Ils fournissent également de l’énergie aux tissus ce qui permet à votre chien de conserver ses protéines et de les utiliser à bon escient.Comme pour les graisses il faut contrôler et gérer les quantités, mise à part ça les glucides font partie intégrante des besoins nutritionnels de votre chien.

TITRE: Comment couper les griffes de son chien ?
CATÉGORIE: Non catégorisé
CONTENU:
Normalement les griffes d’un chien s’usent naturellement par le frottement sur les surfaces dures et il n’est pas nécessaire de les couper.Mais dans certains cas l’usure n’est pas suffisante et vous devrez couper les griffes de votre chien vous même.Voici donc plus d’infos pour comprendre pourquoi vous devez le faire, quand et surtout comment couper les griffes de son chien. BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! Pourquoi couper les griffes de son chien ?Ce n’est pas qu’une question d’esthétique ou de confort mais également une question de santé. Une griffe trop longue peut se tordre, se casser, s’incarner et entrainer des saignements et infections. Des griffes trop longues peuvent également gêner un chien dans ses appuis et provoquer des douleurs dorsales.Sachez également que les griffes de votre chien sont composées d’une partie irriguée par des vaisseaux sanguins comme indiqué sur la photo ci-dessous. Plus les griffes poussent plus la partie irriguée grandit. Si vous laissez trop pousser les griffes de votre chien il vous faudra beaucoup de temps et lui couper les griffes très souvent pour faire rétrécir cette zone irriguée et revenir à une taille normale.Donc ne laisser pas les griffes de votre chien sans surveillance, vérifiez régulièrement leur taille pour savoir si votre chien a besoin d’une petite pédicure.Quand doit-on couper les griffes de son chien et à quelle fréquence ?Pour savoir si il est temps de couper les griffes de votre chien observer le quand il est debout. Les griffes de votre chien doivent effleurer le sol. Votre chien doit être en appui sur ses coussinets, pas sur ses griffes.Si ce sont ses griffes qui touchent le sol ou si elles tordent les orteils de votre chien elles sont trop longues.En moyenne un chien a besoin de se faire couper les griffes tous les 2 mois mais c’est une moyenne. Un chien d’appartement aura des besoins plus réguliers qu’un chien qui passe son temps dehors à creuser votre jardin ;-)Vous devez donc vérifier régulièrement les griffes de votre chien. Attrapez ses pattes et poussez les coussinets pour sortir ses griffes. C’est également un bon moyen de l’habituer à se faire manipuler ce qui vous facilitera la vie le jour ou vous devrez réellement lui couper les griffes. Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! Matériel pour couper les griffes de son chienPour couper les griffes de votre chien il vous faut un matériel adapté. Vous ne pouvez pas utiliser votre dentifrice pour brosser les dents de votre chien et de la même façon vous ne pouvez pas utiliser votre coupe ongle pour lui couper les griffes.Vous aurez besoin d’un coupe griffe bien aiguisé et que vous tenez bien en main. Préparez également des compresses avec un peu d’eau. Si par accident vous coupez une griffe trop courte, celle-ci risque de saigner et vous aurez besoin de presser une compresse pour stopper le saignement.Rassurez-vous avec la bonne méthode ça ne devrait pas vous arriver.Méthode pour couper les griffes de son chien Dernier conseils pour couper les griffes de son chienCouper les griffes de son chien n’a rien de compliqué. Pour les premières fois, allez-y doucement, quelques millimètres suffisent. Mieux vaux répéter l’opération que de faire saigner votre chien et le traumatiser.Pensez aux ergots, beaucoup de chiens n’ont que quatre griffes mais certains chiens en ont une cinquième sur la face interne de la patte un peu au-dessus du pied.Comme elle n’est pas en contact avec le sol il faut la vérifier régulièrement. Les chiens n’aiment pas qu’on manipule leurs pattes.Si vous avez téléchargé la méthode Dresser son chien en 15 minutes par jour, utilisez l’exercice pour donner la patte.Commencez dès le plus jeune âge à manipuler votre chien, le maintenir en place, lui tenir les pattes, inspecter ses griffes…Préférez faire cette opération après une longue ballade et n’oubliez pas de récompenser votre chien après lui avoir coupé les griffes.

TITRE: Collier anti-aboiement : vraiment efficace ?
CATÉGORIE: Non catégorisé
CONTENU:
Un chien qui aboie c’est naturel et pourtant ça peut rapidement devenir un problème pour vous et pour vos voisins.Il y a différentes méthodes pour stopper les aboiements de son chien. La plus connue est d’utiliser un collier anti aboiement.Mais quel modèle choisir, est-ce vraiment efficace et n’y a t il pas de meilleures solutions pour que votre chien arrête d’aboyer ? Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! Les différents types de collier anti aboiementCollier anti-aboiement à sprayC’est la version « douce » des colliers anti-aboiements. A chaque fois que votre chien aboie le collier pulvérise un spray à la citronnelle. Le chien est à la fois surpris et dérangé par l’odeur ce qui a pour effet de diminuer puis de stopper les aboiements.Collier anti-aboiement à ultrasonsCe type de collier fait également partie des « méthodes douces ». Le principe est simple : à chaque aboiement le collier va émettre des ultrasons désagréables pour votre chien.Collier anti-aboiement à vibrationsCe type de collier est également une alternative au collier électrique. A chaque aboiement le collier se met à vibrer. C’est désagréable pour le chien mais totalement inoffensif.Collier anti-aboiement électriqueCe type de collier va dans un premier temps émettre un bip sonore pour avertir le chien. Si celui-ci continue d’aboyer, le collier va déclencher une stimulation électrique. Selon le collier la puissance de la stimulation est réglable.Efficacité d’un collier anti aboiementEst ce qu’un collier anti-aboiement va réellement stopper les aboiements de votre chien ?Malheureusement dans la plupart des cas, les colliers anti-aboiements ne sont pas efficaces et les maîtres qui en sont satisfaits se rendront compte plus tard que le problème est loin d’être réglé.Pour dresser son chien il faut intervenir au bon moment. C’est l’une des bases du dressage d’un chien.Si vous intervenez trop tard votre chien ne fera pas le lien entre son mauvais comportement et votre mécontentement. Il faut donc que les colliers soient très réactifs et se déclenchent au bon moment.Malheureusement c’est rarement le cas et dans la plupart des cas votre chien ne comprendra pas ce qui se passe…Délai de réactivité d’un collier anti aboiementLes colliers anti aboiement sont trop longs à se déclencher et votre chien ne comprendra pas forcement le message.C’est également le problème des colliers à spray qui diffusent de la citronnelle. Même si votre chien interprète correctement le premier jet, l’odeur va ensuite rester sur lui pour le reste de la journée qu’il aboie ou pas. Il est donc très difficile pour lui d’associer les aboiements à l’odeur.En revanche, les colliers électrostatique vont faire passer le message de façon beaucoup plus claire mais aussi beaucoup plus douloureuse. Imaginez prendre une décharge électrique dans les cordes vocales !Autre problème de ce type de collier est l’intensité de la décharge. Certains colliers ne proposent que 2 ou 3 intensités.Dans la majorité des cas les 2 premières sont inefficaces et la troisième une véritable torture.Dernier point très important : de nombreux maîtres se rendent compte que leur chien trouve rapidement la faille de leur collier. Par exemple ils jappent une bonne partie de la journée pour déclencher le bip sonore du collier sans la décharge, jusqu’à que le collier n’est plus de batterie. Ils sont ensuite libres d’aboyer le reste de la journée.Votre chien est très malin, beaucoup plus qu’un simple collier électrique !Un collier anti aboiement est une erreur de diagnostiqueVotre chien aboie pour de bonnes raisons. Evidemment on ne comprend pas toujours ces raisons et c’est bien le problème.Un chien aboie parce qu’il a peur, parce que quelqu’un entre dans son espace, parce qu’il est en colère, parce qu’il est en détresse ou parce qu’il est seul.Dans bien des cas un chien se met à aboyer pour tromper l’ennui et libéré un excès d’énergie accumulé tout au long de la journée à attendre le retour de son maître.Malheureusement il est plus facile d’acheter un collier anti-aboiement que de chercher la cause réelle du problème et de le solutionner.C’est ainsi qu’un chien qui aurait simplement besoin d’un jouet spécial ennui, se retrouve avec un objet de torture autour du cou.Solutionner le vrai problème de votre chien ou il l’exprimera autrementVous connaissez peut-être certains maîtres qui ont utilisé un collier anti-aboiement avec succès. Il suffit d’ailleurs de lire les commentaires sur les sites de ventes pour croire que ça semble marcher.Certains maîtres utilisant un collier anti-aboiement vont effectivement stopper les aboiements de leur chien. Mais le problème du chien sera toujours présent, et sa frustration aussi. Il va donc l’exprimer autrement.Fuguer, détruire votre mobilier, votre jardin, faire ses besoins n’importe où, devenir agressif envers les visiteurs ou vos enfants, s’automutiler… la liste des problèmes est longueMais peu de maîtres font le lien entre l’utilisation du collier et l’apparition des troubles du comportement de leur chien. Ils ont simplement l’impression que leur chien a de nouveau un problème. C’est ce qui explique les témoignages positifs sur les colliers anti-aboiements.Le collier anti-aboiement n’a pas solutionner le problème mais la simplement déplacer.Dans quel cas utiliser un collier anti-aboiement ?La seule raison d’utiliser un collier anti-aboiement est une plainte ou une menace de plainte déposée par vos voisins.

TITRE: Les besoins nutritionnels de votre chien
CATÉGORIE: Non catégorisé
CONTENU:
Bien comprendre les besoins nutritionnels de votre chien est très important. La nourriture joue un rôle primordial sur sa santé. Le chien est un omnivore, ce qui veut dire qu’il peut manger n’importe quelle nourriture (je ne tiens pas compte des chaussures ou tout autre objet que votre chien a l’habitude de manger ;-).Pour répondre aux besoins nutritionnels de votre chien il faut que son alimentation soit répartie en 6 groupes alimentaires.C’est la clef d’une alimentation équilibrée et d’un chien en pleine forme ! BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! De l’eau pour votre chienDe l’eau, de l’air, la vie ! C’est vrai pour vous et c’est aussi vrai pour votre chien. L’eau représente 60 à 70% du poids d’un chien adulte.Une partie des besoins en eau de votre chien se trouve dans sa nourriture (la nourriture en boite contient environ 78% d’eau et la nourriture sèche environ 10%).Il est donc primordial que votre chien ait accès à de l’eau fraîche (je ne parle pas de température, simplement renouvelez tous les jours la gamelle d’eau de votre chien).Petite précision pour ceux qui sont en train d’apprendre la propreté à leur chiot : vous pouvez surveiller et limiter la quantité d’eau que votre chiot absorbe (donner lui de l’eau à des moments spécifiques comme après la balade par exemple).En cas de forte chaleur ne prenez pas de risques, un chien se déshydrate rapidement (vous pouvez également lui mettre un glaçon à la place de l’eau, il l’absorbera plus lentement). Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! Des protéines pour votre chienLes protéines sont également très importantes pour votre chien. Elles vont lui fournir les acides aminés nécessaires au bon développement de son corps. Les protéines contiennent 23 acides aminés dont 10 sont essentiels pour la bonne santé de votre chien. Les autres sont également importants mais votre chien peut les fabriquer lui même.Généralement, on considère que les protéines animales sont plus intéressantes pour votre chien que les protéines végétales.Des minéraux pour votre chienLes minéraux n’ont aucune valeur énergétique mais ils font partie des besoins alimentaires de votre chien. Ils doivent être présents dans l’alimentation de votre chien car contrairement à certains acides aminés, les chiens ne peuvent pas les produire.Le fer, le magnésium, le zinc, le calcium vont permettre des réactions métaboliques assurant ainsi le bon fonctionnement de l’organisme de votre chien.Par exemple, sans minéraux dans son alimentation votre chien n’aura pas les os solides. Ils participent également à la bonne santé des dents de votre chien qui est un élément crucial pour lui et sa longévité (n’oubliez pas de brosser les dents de votre chien régulièrement et les vôtres aussi ;-).De la graisse pour votre chien Si votre chien n’a pas une belle peau ou une belle fourrure, surveillez ses besoins en graisse. La graisse a non seulement un rôle énergétique mais elle permet aussi à votre chien d’absorber certains vitamines qui se dissolvent dans la graisse.Autre point important, les chiens aiment les graisses. C’est très bien de répondre à ses besoins alimentaires mais il faut aussi prendre du plaisir dans tout ça ! Attention tout de même aux excès.La nourriture industrielle est généralement adaptée aux besoins de vos chiens mais attention aux petites friandises qui sont souvent un peu plus riches.Surtout si vous utilisez la nourriture pour le éduquer votre chien, n’oubliez pas de diminuer les quantités aux repas.Des vitamines pour votre chienVotre chien a besoin de vitamines, tout comme vous. Ils participent au bon fonctionnement de l’organisme ils sont indispensables aux échanges vitaux.Votre chien ne peut pas les synthétiser lui même, mais rassurez-vous si son alimentation est équilibrée, il aura les vitamines dont il a besoin.Inutile de donner des suppléments de vitamine à votre chien sauf si votre chien a une déficience et que votre vétérinaire vous le demande. Contrairement à ce qu’on pourrait croire, trop de vitamines peut être dangereux.Des glucides pour votre chienLes glucides sont le dernier élément des besoins nutritionnels de votre chien. Ils n’ont pas toujours bonne réputation et pourtant ils sont une aide précieuse pour le corps de votre chien.Ils permettent de conserver les intestins de votre chien en bon état et d’éviter des diarrhées ou constipation. Ils fournissent également de l’énergie aux tissus ce qui permet à votre chien de conserver ses protéines et de les utiliser à bon escient.Comme pour les graisses il faut contrôler et gérer les quantités, mise à part ça les glucides font partie intégrante des besoins nutritionnels de votre chien.

TITRE: Comment apprendre l’ordre assis à son chien ?
CATÉGORIE: Non catégorisé
CONTENU:
L’ordre «assis» fait partie de l’éducation de base du chien. L’ordre assis est donc utile dans la vie de tous les jours à la maison ou dans la rue et très important pour dresser son chien.Cela va vous permettre entre autre de le rappeler à l’ordre quand il saute sur les invités, de vous éloigner un moment de lui sans qu’il ne bouge, par exemple de rester sagement dehors quand vous entrez dans une boulangerie… BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! Plusieurs méthodes pour dresser son chien à l’ordre assisDresser son chien à l’ordre assis est assez facile et intuitif. Vous verrez que dès l’âge de 2 mois, votre chien sera très réceptif à l’ordre «assis» et vous avez plusieurs méthodes à votre disposition.Choisissez celle qui fonctionne le mieux pour vous et votre chien. Vous pouvez également utiliser les deux méthodes simultanément. Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! La méthode passive pour dresser son chien à l’ordre assisCette méthode demande beaucoup d’observation et de synchronisation. Chaque fois que vous verrez votre chien s’asseoir, dîtes-lui « assis » et félicitez-le pour le récompenser.Il faut donc bien anticiper le moment où votre chien va s’asseoir pour pouvoir dire «assis» au moment même où il est en train de le faire.Pourquoi ? Pour que votre chien associe le mot «assis» et la récompense à cette position.Le chien a une mauvaise notion du temps. Donc si vous dîtes l’ordre « assis » trop tôt avant qu’il ne le fasse ou trop tard après qu’il se soit assis, le chien ne pourra pas associer la bonne position avec le mot assis.On dit que cette méthode est passive parce qu’on attend que le chien s’assoit naturellement de lui-même pour lui apprendre l’ordre. Cette méthode pour dresser son chien demande énormément de patience.Pour éviter d’observer votre chien toute la journée et de regarder à quel moment il va s’asseoir, il est aussi possible de provoquer la position assise chez votre chien. C’est la méthode active par opposition à la méthode passive.La méthode active pour dresser son chien à l’ordre assis Vous pouvez faire asseoir votre chien de plusieurs manières naturelles, c’est-à–dire sans contraintes physiques (appuyer sur sa croupe en est une pour le chien).Vous avez probablement remarqué que votre chien qui lève la tête de plus en plus en arrière a tendance à s’asseoir de lui-même. C’est une question d’équilibre.Il vous suffit tout simplement de vous munir d’une friandise et de la tendre au-dessus du nez de votre chien qui va lever la tête pour la regarder.Amenez alors la friandise vers la croupe de votre chien. Pour la regarder, votre chien va devoir lever la tête en arrière et donc s’asseoir. Les chiens s’assoient instinctivement quand on leur fait cet exercice et n’ont pas l’idée de se retourner.Il ne vous reste plus qu’à dire « assis » au moment où votre chien s’assoit et à lui donner la friandise.Puis passez à l’étape suivante en supprimant la friandise et en levant votre doigt au-dessus de la tête de votre chien. Quand il s’assoit, dîtes « assis » et félicitez-le.En dernière phase d’apprentissage, dîtes seulement « assis » sans avoir à faire lever la tête de votre chien en arrière. Quand il s’assoit, félicitez-le ! Voilà, vous venez de dresser votre chien à l’ordre « assis ! »Quelques trucs et astuces pour l’ordre assisEvitez d’appuyer sur sa croupe pour le faire asseoir. On n’utilise jamais la force pour dresser son chienLe chien résiste et essaie au contraire de se relever. Même si par la force, vous arrivez à le faire asseoir, votre chien va le ressentir comme une contrainte et ne va donc plus la rechercher naturellement.Si votre chien a tendance à sauter sur la friandise plutôt qu’à lever la tête et à s’asseoir, essayez de faire lever sa tête avec votre main puis touchez l’articulation de sa patte arrière (entre la cuisse et la jambe) pour le faire asseoir.Dernier conseil : faîtes preuve de patience. Apprendre l’ordre assis à son chien est assez rapide et logiquement votre chiot ou votre chien saura très prochainement s’asseoir lorsque vous lui demanderez.Dresser son chien à l’ordre assis est souvent la première étape de l’apprentissage d’un chien (souvent la plus facile) et n’hésitez pas à travailler cette ordre en même temps que d’autres. Vous pouvez par exemple travaillez l’ordre couché dans la foulée.En revanche attention de garder des sessions courtes et fun. L’objectif est que votre chien apprécie ces moments avec vous et de construire votre relation de confiance.Si vous cherchez une méthode complète et simple à mettre en oeuvre, je vous recommande la méthode « Dresser son chien en 15 minutes par jour ». Vous n’aurez plus qu’à vous laisser guider et pratiquer simplement les nombreux jeux / exercices avec votre chien à votre rythme pour qu’il soit bien éduqué et établir une relation forte avec lui.Cliquez ici pour découvrir la méthode « Dresser son chien en 15 Minutes par jour » Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour !

TITRE: Aider votre chien pour sa rentrée
CATÉGORIE: Non catégorisé
CONTENU:
Nous sommes nombreux à ne pas aimer les rentrées, et sur ce point nos chiens partagent ce sentiment.Pour de nombreux chiens c’est un retour à la solitude, de longues heures à attendre votre retour.A chaque rentrée de nombreux maîtres voient le comportement de leur chien changer : boulimie, perte d’appétit, plus envie de jouer, comportement destructif, problèmes de propreté, troubles du comportement, …Ces signes sont un avertissement que votre chien fait une petite déprime, il s’ennuie ou vous lui manquez. Parce que votre chien il s’en fiche de votre travail, lui ce qu’il veut c’est être avec vous.Alors voici quelques conseils pour aider votre chien pour sa rentrée… BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! Une rentrée en douceurL’idéal est de faire une période de transition, si vous le pouvez prenez quelques jours pour réhabituer votre chien à votre absence (c’est terrible de dire ça mais c’est pour son bien). Lorsque vous rentrez chez vous, même si vous ne travaillez pas essayez de reprendre vos horaires habituels.Ne passez pas tout votre temps avec votre chien. Laissez-le seul quelques heures comme si vous alliez travailler. En faisant les choses en douceur, le choc sera moins brutal, vous éviterez ainsi l’angoisse de la séparation. Le sentiment d’abandon sera beaucoup moins fort que si vous disparaissiez du jour au lendemain pendant une journée entière. Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! Fatigué, occupé mais pas angoissé !Il y deux choses très importantes si vous voulez vraiment aider votre chien pour sa rentrée (et je suis sûr que vous le voulez ;-). La première est d’éviter l’angoisse de la séparation et l’autre d’éviter l’ennui.La procédure pour éviter l’angoisse de la séparationLa procédure avant de partir de chez vous et de laisser votre chien est la suivante : vous faîtes une balade avec votre chien, vous jouez avec lui, vous le faîtes courir, il faut qu’il se dépense un maximum et qu’il fasse ses besoins aussi. Lorsque vous rentrez chez vous votre chien doit être fatigué.Ensuite, utilisez l’ordre panier si vous lui avez appris (avec cet ordre votre chien comprend tout de suite que la fête est terminée et que c’est l’heure du repos). Sinon faîtes au mieux pour que votre chien se calme de lui même, il suffit de l’ignorer quelques minutes, si vous l’avez bien fatigué il devrait aller se coucher tout seul.Quand vient le temps de partir, inutile d’en faire des tonnes, même si vous culpabilisez ne transmettez pas votre stress à votre chien. Jetez un dernier regard vers votre chien et partez sans vous retourner, oui je sais c’est dur :-(.Avec cette méthode, votre chien ne devrait pas souffrir de la séparation, en revanche pour vous je ne peux pas faire grand chose si ce n’est de vous conseiller d’avoir toujours une photo de vos chiens sur vous.La méthode pour éviter l’ennui de votre chien L’ennui est un fléau pour les chiens et de nombreux maîtres le sous-estiment jusqu’au jour où leur chien se lèche la patte jusqu’à se faire mal ou développe d’autres troubles du comportement.Il y a des moyens très simples d’occuper votre chien quand vous n’êtes pas là et qui ne coûtent pas très chers, en tout cas beaucoup moins qu’un passage chez le vétérinaire pour soigner sa patte.Commençons par les jouets. Je ne vais pas vous faire un article sur les 12 jouets à acheter pour votre chien, je ne vous en recommanderais qu’un seul type les jouets distributeurs de friandises.Ce type de jouet, en balle ou en puzzle règle souvent bien des problèmes liés à la solitude ou à l’ennui.Son gros avantage : vous pouvez glisser de la nourriture dedans ce qui occupera votre chien pendant quelques heures. Avant de partir glissez quelques friandises dans le jouet et placez-le dans un coin de la pièce de votre choix.Vous pouvez également cacher quelques friandises dans les recoins de votre appartement, votre chien passera quelques heures de plus à inspecter chaque coin et recoin.Inutile de préciser que si vous pouvez rentrer ou demander à quelqu’un de passer pour rendre visite à votre chien pendant la journée, au moins pendant les débuts, vous ferez un heureux (en fait vous en ferez deux : moi et votre chien ;-).Enfin quand vous êtes présent, essayez de passer des moments de qualité avec lui, de le stimuler. Rallongez le temps de balade de quelques minutes, changez régulièrement de chemin, jouez avec lui, travaillez son éducation, bref faîtes en sorte que ce soit des moments de qualité.C’est le meilleur moyen d’aider votre chien pour la rentrée et de renforcer les liens qui vous unissent.Bonne rentrée à vous et votre chien !

Vous adorez votre chien et vous souhaitez lui trouver un nom unique qui lui corresponde parfaitement ? Ne cherchez pas plus loin ! Voici quelques astuces simples et ingénieuses pour créer un nom de chien personnalisé commençant par la lettre « D ».La première technique consiste à explorer des mots liés à vos centres d’intérêt ou passions, débutant par « D ». Un dictionnaire spécialisé peut vous aider à trouver des termes pertinents et originaux.Ensuite, vous pouvez mélanger les syllabes de prénoms ou de noms que vous aimez pour créer un nouveau nom. En combinant différentes parties de mots et en ajoutant un « D » au début, vous obtiendrez un nom unique et significatif pour votre chien.Enfin, une méthode que j’apprécie particulièrement est de simplement choisir un mot que vous aimez et de remplacer ou d’ajouter la lettre « D » au début. Par exemple, si vous trouvez votre chienne très jolie, pourquoi ne pas l’appeler « Dolie » ?Avec ces astuces simples, vous devriez rapidement trouver des idées de noms pour votre chien ou chienne en « D ». Assurez-vous simplement de respecter les quelques règles suivantes…Les règles à respecter pour un nom de chien efficace Voici quelques conseils pratiques pour choisir un bon nom de chien commençant par la lettre « D », facile pour vous comme pour votre chien :Tout d’abord, optez pour un nom facile à prononcer, sans connotations négatives ou embarrassantes. Imaginez-vous en train d’appeler votre chien dans un parc public : « Débile, viens ici ! »Ensuite, évitez de choisir un nom qui pourrait être confondu avec un prénom humain. Bien que le prénom « Daniel » puisse vous sembler charmant, cela pourrait prêter à confusion si vous avez un ami du même nom. Il est préférable de choisir un nom distinctif pour votre chien.Enfin, privilégiez un nom court et facile à prononcer. Les noms trop longs comme « Dinosaure » peuvent être difficiles à utiliser au quotidien, tant pour vous que pour votre chien. Optez plutôt pour des noms courts et percutants, comme « Dora » ou « Dico ».En suivant ces conseils, vous trouverez sûrement un nom de chien en « D » parfaitement adapté à votre fidèle compagnon à quatre pattes !Apprendre son nom à votre chien : le premier pas de son éducation Commencer l’éducation de votre chien par l’apprentissage de son nom est une étape cruciale dans sa formation. Voici quelques conseils simples et positifs pour vous aider à réussir cette étape importante :Choisissez un moment calme dans une pièce sans distractions, avec quelques friandises à portée de main et/ou un jouet préféré de votre chien.Appelez votre chien par son nom et, s’il vous regarde, félicitez-le avec un « oui, bon chien ». Récompensez-le ensuite avec une friandise et quelques caresses ou une courte séance de jeu.Répétez cette séquence quelques fois, en espaçant les sessions d’une minute environ. Votre chien devrait rapidement comprendre que son nom est associé à quelque chose de positif et qu’il doit vous regarder et venir vers vous lorsqu’il est appelé.N’oubliez pas que l’éducation de votre chien commence dès son arrivée chez vous. Préparez-vous au mieux dès maintenant, car il y a beaucoup à apprendre ! Si vous n’avez pas encore eu l’occasion de le faire, je vous recommande vivement de consulter les articles suivants, qui vous aideront à être prêt pour accueillir votre chien :Préparer son domicile pour accueillir son nouveau chienAccueillir un chiot : conseils pour le premier jour et la première nuitGuide pour éduquer un chiot de 8 semaines à 3 moisMéthode détaillée pour enseigner la propreté à un jeune chienEn suivant ces conseils et en vous préparant adéquatement, vous et votre chien pouvez entamer une relation basée sur la confiance, le respect et la complicité.

TITRE: Les besoins nutritionnels de votre chien
CATÉGORIE: Non catégorisé
CONTENU:
Bien comprendre les besoins nutritionnels de votre chien est très important. La nourriture joue un rôle primordial sur sa santé. Le chien est un omnivore, ce qui veut dire qu’il peut manger n’importe quelle nourriture (je ne tiens pas compte des chaussures ou tout autre objet que votre chien a l’habitude de manger ;-).Pour répondre aux besoins nutritionnels de votre chien il faut que son alimentation soit répartie en 6 groupes alimentaires.C’est la clef d’une alimentation équilibrée et d’un chien en pleine forme ! BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! De l’eau pour votre chienDe l’eau, de l’air, la vie ! C’est vrai pour vous et c’est aussi vrai pour votre chien. L’eau représente 60 à 70% du poids d’un chien adulte.Une partie des besoins en eau de votre chien se trouve dans sa nourriture (la nourriture en boite contient environ 78% d’eau et la nourriture sèche environ 10%).Il est donc primordial que votre chien ait accès à de l’eau fraîche (je ne parle pas de température, simplement renouvelez tous les jours la gamelle d’eau de votre chien).Petite précision pour ceux qui sont en train d’apprendre la propreté à leur chiot : vous pouvez surveiller et limiter la quantité d’eau que votre chiot absorbe (donner lui de l’eau à des moments spécifiques comme après la balade par exemple).En cas de forte chaleur ne prenez pas de risques, un chien se déshydrate rapidement (vous pouvez également lui mettre un glaçon à la place de l’eau, il l’absorbera plus lentement). Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! Des protéines pour votre chienLes protéines sont également très importantes pour votre chien. Elles vont lui fournir les acides aminés nécessaires au bon développement de son corps. Les protéines contiennent 23 acides aminés dont 10 sont essentiels pour la bonne santé de votre chien. Les autres sont également importants mais votre chien peut les fabriquer lui même.Généralement, on considère que les protéines animales sont plus intéressantes pour votre chien que les protéines végétales.Des minéraux pour votre chienLes minéraux n’ont aucune valeur énergétique mais ils font partie des besoins alimentaires de votre chien. Ils doivent être présents dans l’alimentation de votre chien car contrairement à certains acides aminés, les chiens ne peuvent pas les produire.Le fer, le magnésium, le zinc, le calcium vont permettre des réactions métaboliques assurant ainsi le bon fonctionnement de l’organisme de votre chien.Par exemple, sans minéraux dans son alimentation votre chien n’aura pas les os solides. Ils participent également à la bonne santé des dents de votre chien qui est un élément crucial pour lui et sa longévité (n’oubliez pas de brosser les dents de votre chien régulièrement et les vôtres aussi ;-).De la graisse pour votre chien Si votre chien n’a pas une belle peau ou une belle fourrure, surveillez ses besoins en graisse. La graisse a non seulement un rôle énergétique mais elle permet aussi à votre chien d’absorber certains vitamines qui se dissolvent dans la graisse.Autre point important, les chiens aiment les graisses. C’est très bien de répondre à ses besoins alimentaires mais il faut aussi prendre du plaisir dans tout ça ! Attention tout de même aux excès.La nourriture industrielle est généralement adaptée aux besoins de vos chiens mais attention aux petites friandises qui sont souvent un peu plus riches.Surtout si vous utilisez la nourriture pour le éduquer votre chien, n’oubliez pas de diminuer les quantités aux repas.Des vitamines pour votre chienVotre chien a besoin de vitamines, tout comme vous. Ils participent au bon fonctionnement de l’organisme ils sont indispensables aux échanges vitaux.Votre chien ne peut pas les synthétiser lui même, mais rassurez-vous si son alimentation est équilibrée, il aura les vitamines dont il a besoin.Inutile de donner des suppléments de vitamine à votre chien sauf si votre chien a une déficience et que votre vétérinaire vous le demande. Contrairement à ce qu’on pourrait croire, trop de vitamines peut être dangereux.Des glucides pour votre chienLes glucides sont le dernier élément des besoins nutritionnels de votre chien. Ils n’ont pas toujours bonne réputation et pourtant ils sont une aide précieuse pour le corps de votre chien.Ils permettent de conserver les intestins de votre chien en bon état et d’éviter des diarrhées ou constipation. Ils fournissent également de l’énergie aux tissus ce qui permet à votre chien de conserver ses protéines et de les utiliser à bon escient.Comme pour les graisses il faut contrôler et gérer les quantités, mise à part ça les glucides font partie intégrante des besoins nutritionnels de votre chien.

TITRE: Plaidoyer en faveur de la caisse/cage
CATÉGORIE: Non catégorisé
CONTENU:
Je passe beaucoup de temps à convaincre des maîtres qu’une caisse ou une cage est bénéfique pour leur chien. Ils passent ensuite beaucoup de temps à convaincre leur conjoint, leur famille, leur belle-famille… Malheureusement ils ne retrouvent pas toujours les arguments que je leur ai donnés.Donc, vous trouverez dans cet article tous les avantages de la caisse pour votre chien. Les caisses/cages ont mauvaise réputation mais croyez-moi, ce n’est pas l’avis de votre chien ! La prochaine fois qu’on vous lancera sur le sujet, il vous suffira de relire cet article pour avoir le dernier mot ;-) BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! A l’abri dans ma tanièreUn chien a besoin d’une tanière, c’est un besoin instinctif pour se protéger des prédateurs et des conditions climatiques.La caisse reproduit cette tanière (contrairement à un simple panier) et votre chien y dormira mieux et sera plus en forme.Il y trouvera refuge et réconfort quand vous sortirez votre horrible aspirateur, quand un bruit lui fera peur ou quand vous accueillerez des amis qu’il n’a pas franchement envie de voir.Le simple fait que votre chien ait la possibilité de se réfugier dans sa caisse est un atout énorme pour lui. Il m’est arrivé de rectifier des mauvais comportements chez des chiens simplement grâce à une caisse.Le chien est plus reposé, moins anxieux et beaucoup plus apte à apprendre de nouvelles choses. Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! Ma caisse restera propreLa mère de votre chien lui a appris dès son plus jeune âge, à ne pas faire ses besoins dans la tanière car l’odeur risquerait d’attirer les prédateurs.Les premières semaines, la mère mange les excréments de ses chiots. Ensuite, elle leur montre l’exemple et les accompagne faire leurs besoins dehors.Pendant toute son enfance, la tanière de votre chien est toujours restée propre.C’est pour cette raison que la caisse est le meilleur outil pour apprendre la propreté à votre chien (voir article : propreté du chiot).Votre chien fera tout ce qui est en son pouvoir pour ne pas salir sa tanière, autrement dit sa caisse. Si vous savez l’utiliser, elle reste le meilleur moyen d’aider votre chien à développer les muscles de sa vessie.Partout chez moi !Une caisse se transporte facilement, ce qui veut dire que votre chien sera partout chez lui.Il vous suffira d’installer sa caisse à l’endroit de votre choix et votre chien aura ses repères.Inutile de vous dire que c’est une source de stress en moins pour lui, et un chien qui n’est pas stressé aura beaucoup moins de raisons d’adopter des comportements gênants.La caisse est aussi le meilleur moyen de transporter votre chien en voiture ou même en avion.C’est la manière la plus sécurisée pour vous, vos passagers et votre chien.Pas toujours le choixJe ne vous le souhaite pas, mais il se peut qu’un jour votre chien se retrouve en cage que vous le vouliez ou non.Si un jour vous perdez votre chien, s’il s’enfuit et qu’il fini dans un refuge, il devra patienter dans une cage.Le temps que le chien soit identifié, que le centre vous contacte et que vous veniez le chercher, le temps sera très long pour un chien qui n’est pas habitué à une cage.C’est le même principe pour un chien qui reste en convalescence chez le vétérinaire.L’expérience sera moins traumatisante s’il est habitué aux cages et il pourra éventuellement, guérir plus vite.La caisse n’est pas un objet de tortureOn peut faire de n’importe quel objet, un objet de torture. Un tournevis ou un marteau peut devenir un objet de torture.Ce n’est pas l’objet qu’il faut condamner mais celui qui l’utilise et qui ne sait pas s’en servir.Pourquoi juger la caisse à cause de quelques imbéciles, pourquoi condamner le pitbull à cause de quelques abrutis ?J’utilise des caisses depuis toujours. Tous mes chiens ont toujours aimé leur caisse et c’est très important pour moi car c’est un allié précieux pour avoir un chien bien éduqué et équilibré.En général, sauf cas exceptionnels, une fois l’apprentissage de la propreté passé, mes chiens sont libres d’aller et venir dans leur caisse quand ils veulent.Ils sont totalement libres. Ils sont même plus libres que les chiens sans caisse puisqu’ils ont la liberté de s’isoler s’ils le souhaitent.Vive les caisses !

Vous n’avez toujours pas trouver le nom de votre chien ? Inutile de chercher plus loin, il vous faut du sur-mesure.Il y a différentes techniques pour trouver ou créer vous même un nom de chien en N que vous aimerez.La première est de fonctionner par thème, comme je l’ai fait. Vous avez peut-être une passion, un hobby.Si c’est le cas cherchez tout simplement un dictionnaire sur le sujet et faites le tour des noms en N. Choisissez un nom court ou facilement prononçable.Si vous êtes fan d’histoire, vous pourriez être tenté d’appeler votre chien Napoléon, mais vous ne faciliterez pas la vie de votre chien et de toute façon vous finirez par l’appeler Nana ou Napo.L’autre solution consiste à détourner un mot que vous aimez. Prenons le thème de la pâtisserie et imaginons que vous êtes fan de chouquettes. Remplacez le C par un N et vous obtenez Nouquette ;-) C’est drôle et originale !Vous pouvez également vous servir des noms de vos proches. Il suffit de prendre quelques lettres des prénoms de ceux qui partagent votre vie, de mixer et d’ajouter un N !Prenez votre temps pour bien choisir le nom de votre chien et n’oubliez pas de partager cette article avec vos proches qui pourront eux aussi vous donner de très bonnes idées.J’ai oublié des noms ? Vous avez choisi un autre nom de chien en N ? N’hésitez pas à le partager dans les commentaires… Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour !

TITRE: Les besoins nutritionnels de votre chien
CATÉGORIE: Non catégorisé

Bien comprendre les besoins nutritionnels de votre chien est très important. La nourriture joue un rôle primordial sur sa santé. Le chien est un omnivore, ce qui veut dire qu’il peut manger n’importe quelle nourriture (je ne tiens pas compte des chaussures ou tout autre objet que votre chien a l’habitude de manger ;-).Pour répondre aux besoins nutritionnels de votre chien il faut que son alimentation soit répartie en 6 groupes alimentaires.C’est la clef d’une alimentation équilibrée et d’un chien en pleine forme ! BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! De l’eau pour votre chienDe l’eau, de l’air, la vie ! C’est vrai pour vous et c’est aussi vrai pour votre chien. L’eau représente 60 à 70% du poids d’un chien adulte.Une partie des besoins en eau de votre chien se trouve dans sa nourriture (la nourriture en boite contient environ 78% d’eau et la nourriture sèche environ 10%).Il est donc primordial que votre chien ait accès à de l’eau fraîche (je ne parle pas de température, simplement renouvelez tous les jours la gamelle d’eau de votre chien).Petite précision pour ceux qui sont en train d’apprendre la propreté à leur chiot : vous pouvez surveiller et limiter la quantité d’eau que votre chiot absorbe (donner lui de l’eau à des moments spécifiques comme après la balade par exemple).En cas de forte chaleur ne prenez pas de risques, un chien se déshydrate rapidement (vous pouvez également lui mettre un glaçon à la place de l’eau, il l’absorbera plus lentement). Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! Des protéines pour votre chienLes protéines sont également très importantes pour votre chien. Elles vont lui fournir les acides aminés nécessaires au bon développement de son corps. Les protéines contiennent 23 acides aminés dont 10 sont essentiels pour la bonne santé de votre chien. Les autres sont également importants mais votre chien peut les fabriquer lui même.Généralement, on considère que les protéines animales sont plus intéressantes pour votre chien que les protéines végétales.Des minéraux pour votre chienLes minéraux n’ont aucune valeur énergétique mais ils font partie des besoins alimentaires de votre chien. Ils doivent être présents dans l’alimentation de votre chien car contrairement à certains acides aminés, les chiens ne peuvent pas les produire.Le fer, le magnésium, le zinc, le calcium vont permettre des réactions métaboliques assurant ainsi le bon fonctionnement de l’organisme de votre chien.Par exemple, sans minéraux dans son alimentation votre chien n’aura pas les os solides. Ils participent également à la bonne santé des dents de votre chien qui est un élément crucial pour lui et sa longévité (n’oubliez pas de brosser les dents de votre chien régulièrement et les vôtres aussi ;-).De la graisse pour votre chien Si votre chien n’a pas une belle peau ou une belle fourrure, surveillez ses besoins en graisse. La graisse a non seulement un rôle énergétique mais elle permet aussi à votre chien d’absorber certains vitamines qui se dissolvent dans la graisse.Autre point important, les chiens aiment les graisses. C’est très bien de répondre à ses besoins alimentaires mais il faut aussi prendre du plaisir dans tout ça ! Attention tout de même aux excès.La nourriture industrielle est généralement adaptée aux besoins de vos chiens mais attention aux petites friandises qui sont souvent un peu plus riches.Surtout si vous utilisez la nourriture pour le éduquer votre chien, n’oubliez pas de diminuer les quantités aux repas.Des vitamines pour votre chienVotre chien a besoin de vitamines, tout comme vous. Ils participent au bon fonctionnement de l’organisme ils sont indispensables aux échanges vitaux.Votre chien ne peut pas les synthétiser lui même, mais rassurez-vous si son alimentation est équilibrée, il aura les vitamines dont il a besoin.Inutile de donner des suppléments de vitamine à votre chien sauf si votre chien a une déficience et que votre vétérinaire vous le demande. Contrairement à ce qu’on pourrait croire, trop de vitamines peut être dangereux.Des glucides pour votre chienLes glucides sont le dernier élément des besoins nutritionnels de votre chien. Ils n’ont pas toujours bonne réputation et pourtant ils sont une aide précieuse pour le corps de votre chien.Ils permettent de conserver les intestins de votre chien en bon état et d’éviter des diarrhées ou constipation. Ils fournissent également de l’énergie aux tissus ce qui permet à votre chien de conserver ses protéines et de les utiliser à bon escient.Comme pour les graisses il faut contrôler et gérer les quantités, mise à part ça les glucides font partie intégrante des besoins nutritionnels de votre chien.

TITRE: Tapis de propreté pour son chiot
CATÉGORIE: Non catégorisé
CONTENU:
Les tapis de propreté sont vendus comme le produit miracle pour apprendre la propreté à son chiot.Pourtant les choses ne sont pas si simples ! Voici mes conseils pour utiliser correctement un tapis de propreté.Et surtout pour savoir si réellement vous avez besoin d’en utiliser car dans certains cas ils peuvent être très utiles et dans d’autres ils peuvent ralentir l’apprentissage de la propreté de votre chiot. BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Lot de 50 tapis de propreté pour seulement 14,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! Les tapis de propretéLes tapis de propreté sont très bien conçus. Ils sont ultra absorbants et dotés d’un gel qui va à la fois retenir l’humidité et les odeurs.Pour que votre chiot puisse l’utiliser confortablement certains tapis de propreté sont munis d’adhésif.Ainsi, même si votre chiot est un peu brutal quand il fait ses besoins, le tapis restera en place.Vous pouvez également choisir un kit complet comme celui de la marque Savic dans lequel vous trouverez à la fois une caisse en plastique et des tapis absorbants.La caisse en plastique évitera tout contact entre les excréments de votre chiot et le sol.A première vue, un tapis de propreté est très pratique et vous permettra de limiter la casse le temps que votre chiot devienne propre.Mais sont-ils vraiment une aide pour la propreté du chiot, comme on le voit souvent dans les descriptifs des produits ?Tapis de propreté : bonne ou mauvaise idée ?Certains maîtres choisissent de laisser leur chien faire ses besoins à l’intérieur et dans ces cas là un tapis de propreté est très utile.En revanche si vous souhaitez apprendre à votre chiot à faire ses besoins dehors un tapis de propreté n’est pas obligatoire.Un jeune chiot n’a pas encore le contrôle de sa vessie et l’une des premières étapes pour le rendre propre est de l’aider à développer ses muscles progressivement pour qu’il puisse se retenir.Un tapis de propreté aura l’effet inverse puisque votre chiot pourra faire ses besoins quand il le veut.Autre point négatif : vous allez autoriser votre chiot à faire ses besoins à l’intérieur.Il est très difficile pour un chiot de comprendre qu’il peut faire à l’intérieur mais que vous préférez qu’il fasse à l’extérieur. Utiliser un tapis de propreté va donc créer de la confusion pour votre chiot.Pour ces deux raisons, un tapis de propreté ne va pas aider votre chiot à devenir propre mais au contraire va retarder son apprentissage.Donc si vous pouvez vous en passer, c’est à dire que vous êtes chez vous la plupart du temps et que vous avez la possibilité de sortir votre chiot à chaque fois qu’il en a besoin, n’utilisez surtout pas de tapis de propreté, ils ralentiront le développement de votre chiot.En revanche si vous ne pouvez pas sortir votre chiot à chaque fois qu’il en a besoin (si vous travaillez à temps plein par exemple) un tapis de propreté vous sera très utile. Mais il vous faudra un peu plus de temps pour rendre votre chiot entièrement propre.Autre cas dans lequel un tapis de propreté est obligatoire : votre chiot n’a pas encore fini ses vaccins. Ne prenez pas le risque de sortir votre chiot si c’est le cas, c’est très important puisque votre chiot peut en mourir, utilisez un tapis de propreté provisoirement. Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! Bien utiliser les tapis de propretéInstallez le tapis de propreté dans une pièce carrelée de préférence pour vous faciliter le nettoyage. Même si vous utilisez une caisse en plastique, il y a de fortes chances que votre chiot ne vise pas très bien.Placez votre tapis de propreté loin des gamelles de votre chiot et de sa caisse ou de son couchage.Par instinct votre chiot ne fera jamais ses besoins à l’endroit où il dort et mange et vous devez absolument faire en sorte qu’il conserve cet instinct très utile pour lui apprendre la propreté.N’installez pas de tapis à chaque coin de votre maison ou appartement, votre chiot doit bien comprendre qu’il peut faire ses besoins à un endroit précis.Pour bien faire comprendre à votre chiot qu’il doit faire ses besoins sur le tapis, il vous suffit de l’imprégner de l’odeur de ses excréments avant de l’installer.Pour cela vous pouvez frotter un tapis neuf sur un tapis souillé ou au dernier endroit où votre chiot à fait ses besoins.Nettoyez régulièrement, l’endroit doit rester propre. Si possible ne nettoyez pas devant votre chiot. Si vous souhaitez que votre chiot apprenne à faire ses besoins dehors et que vous utilisez des tapis provisoirement ne le félicitez pas quand il fait ses besoins dessus. Gardez vos félicitations pour le jour où il fera dehors comme un bon chien propre.Une alternative au tapis de propreté De nombreux maîtres se tournent vers les tapis de propreté pour apprendre la propreté à leur chiot. Nous avons vu que dans de nombreux cas, ça n’est pas la meilleure solution.Pour le prix d’un kit de propreté (caisse et tapis) vous pouvez acquérir une méthode d’éducation qui vous aidera pour apprendre la propreté à votre chiot.En plus de la propreté, vous apprendrez également toutes les bonnes techniques pour éduquer votre chiot comme la marche en laisse, le rappel, éviter les mordillements, de sauter sur les invités, les aboiements et bien d’autres choses…Si vous avez du mal à rendre votre chiot propre sachez que cette méthode a déjà aidé de nombreux maîtres et de nombreux chiots !Apprendre la propreté à son chiot n’est pas si compliqué et les accessoires ne vous seront d’aucune utilité. Pour tout ce qui concerne le dressage d’un chien, il vous faut surtout une bonne méthode, de la rigueur et de la patience.En ce qui concerne la rigueur et la patience je ne peux pas faire grand chose pour vous ;-) En revanche pour la bonne méthode vous savez maintenant où la trouver… Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour !

TITRE: Le Bulldog : une race à la personnalité unique !
CATÉGORIE: Non catégorisé
CONTENU:
Entrez dans le monde fascinant du Bulldog ou Bouledogue Anglais, un compagnon fidèle et plein de caractère !Connue pour sa loyauté sans faille et son tempérament doux, cette race de chien a conquis le cœur de nombreux propriétaires de chiens à travers le monde.Mais avant de plonger dans cette aventure, il est essentiel de connaître tous les aspects de cette race de chien, des origines historiques à ses besoins quotidiens, comment trouver un bon éleveur...Préparez-vous à découvrir tout ce qu’il faut savoir sur le Bulldog, afin de prendre les meilleures décisions pour accueillir ce charmant compagnon dans votre vie.PoidsDe 18 à 25 kgTailleDe 31 à 40 cmEspérance de vieDe 8 à 12 ansSanté robuste Facile d’entretien Besoin d’exercice Perd peu de poils Bave peu Facile à éduquer Supporte la solitude Aboie peu Avec les enfants Avec les autres animaux Caractère du BulldogLe Bulldog est est une race unique, dotée de caractéristiques et d’aptitudes qui lui sont propres. D’un tempérament calme et doux, il est connu pour sa loyauté inébranlable envers sa famille et son affection sans limites. Avec son air débonnaire et son visage expressif, le Bulldog est un compagnon de vie charmant et attachant.Malgré sa stature robuste, le Bulldog n’est pas un chien de travail au sens traditionnel. Cependant, il excelle dans le rôle de compagnon de famille et de chien de compagnie. Son caractère paisible en fait un excellent compagnon pour les enfants et les personnes âgées, tandis que sa présence réconfortante apporte de la joie à tous ceux qui l’entourent.En tant qu’éducateur canin passionné, je peux attester que le Bulldog est également un élève intelligent et réceptif lorsqu’il est correctement éduqué et socialisé. Bien qu’il puisse parfois être un peu têtu, sa nature aimante et sa volonté de plaire font de lui un compagnon agréable à éduquer.En résumé, le Bulldog incarne la quintessence du chien de compagnie, avec son caractère aimable, son tempérament docile et son amour inconditionnel pour sa famille.Facilité d’éducation du BulldogÉduquer un Bulldog peut être à la fois amusant et gratifiant, mais cela nécessite également un peu de patience et de cohérence. Ces chiens ont un côté têtu (ou devrais-je dire déterminé ?), ce qui peut parfois rendre l’éducation un peu plus corsée. Mais ne vous inquiétez pas, avec les bonnes méthodes vous pouvez faire de votre Bulldog un élève modèle.La clé avec les Bulldogs est de rester cohérent dans votre approche éducative. Utilisez des techniques de renforcement positif pour encourager les comportements désirés, comme la propreté ou le rappel, en récompensant votre chien avec des friandises ou des éloges.Pour la marche en laisse, il est important de commencer tôt et d’être patient. Les Bulldogs peuvent être un peu têtus (ou peut-être qu’ils préfèrent juste leur propre rythme !), alors soyez prêt à prendre votre temps et à récompenser les progrès.Choisir les bonnes méthodes d’éducation est également crucial. Optez pour des approches douces et positives, évitant les techniques coercitives qui pourraient rebuter votre Bulldog.En résumé, l’éducation d’un Bulldog peut nécessiter un peu plus de temps et de patience que certaines autres races, mais avec une approche positive et cohérente vous pouvez faire de votre Bulldog un chien bien éduqué et heureux.Cohabitation avec les enfants et les autres animauxLe Bulldog est un compagnon formidable pour tout le monde.Avec les enfants, le Bulldog est doux et patient. Il adore jouer avec eux et est souvent prêt à se prêter aux jeux les plus fous. Cependant, une supervision est toujours recommandée, surtout avec de jeunes enfants, pour éviter tout accident involontaire.Avec les personnes âgées, le Bulldog peut être un compagnon réconfortant. Son tempérament calme et son besoin de compagnie en font un compagnon idéal pour ceux qui recherchent une présence chaleureuse et aimante.En ce qui concerne les autres chiens et les chats, la cohabitation dépend largement de la socialisation précoce et de l’individu. En général, le Bulldog s’entend bien avec d’autres chiens et les chats s’ils ont été introduits de manière appropriée et sont habitués à leur présence.Voilà, en quelques mots, comment le Bulldog peut s’intégrer harmonieusement dans divers environnements familiaux, qu’il s’agisse de vivre avec des enfants, des personnes âgées, d’autres chiens ou des chats. Votre Bulldog mérite le meilleur départ !

N’hésitez pas à jeter un oeil au standard officiel de la FCI ou du Club canin Canadien pour plus de détails !Standard FCI (Fédération Cynologique Internationale)Standard Club Canin CanadienLe Bulldog en images Les besoins d’exercice de cette race de chienLe bulldog aime être actif tout en étant à l’aise.Il n’a pas besoin d’exercices intenses, mais il apprécie une promenade quotidienne modérée pour rester en forme et socialiser avec d’autres chiens. Assurez-vous simplement de ne pas trop le pousser par temps chaud, car il peut avoir du mal à réguler sa température corporelle en raison de son museau court.En plus des promenades, le Bulldog aime aussi jouer à des jeux d’intérieur comme chercher la balle ou tirer sur une corde. Ces activités lui permettent de dépenser de l’énergie tout en restant à l’abri des températures extrêmes.En résumé, votre Bulldog appréciera les activités qui lui permettent de rester actif sans trop forcer, en gardant à l’esprit ses limites physiques. Avec un peu de créativité, vous trouverez sûrement des façons amusantes de le divertir tout en renforçant votre lien avec lui.La santé du BulldogLa santé du Bulldog a quelques particularités à prendre en compte.En raison de sa morphologie particulière, le Bulldog peut être sujet à certains problèmes de santé. Les principaux concernent son système respiratoire et sa peau.Son museau court peut entraîner des difficultés respiratoires, surtout par temps chaud ou lors d’efforts physiques. Il est donc important de surveiller sa respiration et de lui éviter les situations stressantes par temps chaud.De plus, sa peau plissée nécessite une attention particulière pour éviter les irritations et les infections cutanées. Un nettoyage régulier des plis et une alimentation adaptée peuvent aider à prévenir ces problèmes.En outre, le Bulldog peut être prédisposé à certaines maladies héréditaires, telles que les problèmes oculaires, les allergies et les troubles gastro-intestinaux. Il est donc recommandé de choisir un éleveur réputé et de faire des contrôles vétérinaires réguliers pour détecter tout problème de santé dès son apparition.En prenant soin de sa santé et en restant attentif à ses besoins spécifiques, vous pouvez aider votre Bulldog à mener une vie longue et heureuse.Entretien au quotidienVous vous demandez peut-être comment prendre soin de votre Bulldog au quotidien. Eh bien, laissez-moi vous dire que ce n’est pas très compliqué.Nettoyez régulièrement les plis de votre Bulldog pour éviter les irritations et les infections cutanées. Utilisez simplement un chiffon doux et humide pour nettoyer délicatement les plis, en veillant à bien les sécher par la suite pour éviter l’humidité.En ce qui concerne son pelage, un brossage hebdomadaire suffit généralement pour éliminer les poils morts et maintenir sa peau en bonne santé. Utilisez une brosse douce pour ne pas irriter sa peau sensible.N’oubliez pas non plus de prendre soin de ses dents et de ses oreilles. Brossez ses dents régulièrement avec une brosse à dents pour chiens et nettoyez ses oreilles avec une solution recommandée par votre vétérinaire pour éviter les infections.Enfin, assurez-vous de lui fournir une alimentation équilibrée et adaptée à ses besoins spécifiques. Consultez votre vétérinaire pour déterminer la meilleure alimentation pour votre Bulldog en fonction de son âge, de son poids et de son niveau d’activité.En suivant ces quelques conseils simples, vous pouvez assurer le bien-être et la santé de votre Bulldog au quotidien.Combien coûte un Bulldog ?Le prix d’un Bulldog peut varier considérablement selon différents critères. En moyenne, vous pouvez vous attendre à dépenser entre 1500 et 4000 euros pour un chiot Bulldog. Ce coût dépend de facteurs tels que la lignée du chien, sa couleur, son sexe et la réputation de l’éleveur.Assurez-vous de choisir un éleveur réputé et responsable, même si cela signifie payer un peu plus cher. Un chien en bonne santé et bien élevé en vaut toujours la peine. N’oubliez pas de prendre en compte les frais continus tels que la nourriture, les soins vétérinaires et les accessoires pour votre nouveau compagnon canin.Trouver un bon élevage de BulldogPour trouver un bon élevage pour votre Bulldog, la recherche minutieuse est essentielle. Commencez par explorer différents élevages en ligne, en vérifiant les avis et les recommandations des clients précédents. Assurez-vous que l’éleveur est enregistré et respecte les normes de bien-être animal.Une visite en personne à l’élevage est indispensable. Cela vous permettra d’évaluer les conditions de vie des chiens et d’interagir avec les éleveurs. Observez si les installations sont propres et si les chiens semblent en bonne santé et heureux.N’hésitez pas à poser des questions à l’éleveur sur la lignée des chiens, leur santé, leur tempérament et leurs conditions de vie. Un éleveur responsable sera transparent et répondra à toutes vos interrogations.Méfiez-vous des signaux d’alarme, comme un refus de visite des installations, l’absence de documents de santé pour les chiots ou des réponses évasives aux questions.En suivant ces étapes, vous maximiserez vos chances de trouver un élevage de qualité et de ramener à la maison un Bulldog en bonne santé et bien équilibré.L’histoire du BulldogVous vous demandez peut-être d’où vient ce chien trapu au visage si caractéristique. Eh bien, laissez-moi vous raconter l’histoire fascinante du Bulldog.Originaire d’Angleterre, le Bulldog a une lignée qui remonte à des siècles. Au 13e siècle, ces chiens étaient utilisés pour des combats contre des taureaux, d’où leur nom « Bulldog ». Ils étaient élevés pour leur force, leur courage et leur endurance impressionnante dans l’arène.Cependant, à partir de 1835, les combats de chiens ont été interdits en Angleterre, et le Bulldog a dû changer de vocation. Les éleveurs ont commencé à sélectionner des traits plus doux et calmes pour en faire des compagnons de famille. Ils ont réussi à transformer cette brute courageuse en un compagnon aimant et loyal.Au fil des ans, le Bulldog est devenu un symbole de ténacité et de détermination. Pendant la Première Guerre mondiale, il était utilisé comme mascotte pour symboliser la ténacité des troupes britanniques.Aujourd’hui, le Bulldog est devenu une icône de la culture populaire, apparaissant dans des films, des publicités et même comme mascotte de diverses équipes sportives.Voilà, en quelques mots, l’histoire captivante du Bulldog. Une race qui a su évoluer au fil du temps, mais qui garde toujours en elle l’esprit intrépide de ses ancêtres.Quelques Bulldogs célèbrentDe nombreuses célébrités ont adopté un Bulldog. En voici quelques unes : Olivia Wilde, Adam Sandler, Brad Pitt, Pink, David Beckham, Jessica Biel, Lewis Hamilton, Lou Doillon, Sha Labeouf, Gordon Ramsay. Popularité du BulldogContrairement au Bouledogue Français, le Bouledogue Anglais ne fait pas partie du top 20 des races de chien préférées des Français.Malgré tous les avantages que présente cette race de chien, on constate même que le nombre d’inscriptions au LOF ne cesse de diminuer année après année. En effet, en 2020, on a compté 2189 nouvelles inscriptions de Bulldogs, 2116 en 2021, 1865 en 2022 pour finir à 1429 en 2023.À noter tout de même que dans sa catégorie (chien du groupe 2), le Bulldog reste dans le top 5 depuis 2020. Il reste derrière le chien de cour italien (Cane Corso), le Rottweiler, le Bouvier Bernois et depuis 2022 derrière le Boxer.Quelques idées de noms idéals pour cette race de chienL’enregistrement de votre Bulldog comme chien de race peut être une étape importante. Dans certains pays, il est courant de suivre une lettre spécifique chaque année pour nommer les chiens de race enregistrés.Ainsi, si vous avez un Bulldog et souhaitez l’enregistrer, assurez-vous de choisir un nom qui commence par la lettre désignée pour l’année en cours :Pour la France et le Luxembourg : nom de chien en VPour la Belgique : nom de chien en XVoici quelques suggestions de noms adaptés pour votre Bulldog mâle ou femelle, en respectant cette tradition :VaillantVirileVigileVadrouilleVictoireAlors, qu’en pensez-vous ?

Les chiens tournent souvent en rond quelques instants avant de faire leurs besoins. On a l’impression qu’ils réfléchissent ou qu’ils cherchent quelque chose.En réalité ce n’est pas qu’une impression ! Après deux ans de travail intensif, la science vient de faire une grande découverte…Les chiens ont tendance à s’aligner selon un axe Nord-Sud pour faire leur grosse commission, il y a donc de fortes chances que votre chien indique le nord !

Les chiens sont sensibles au champ magnétique terrestreCa paraît incroyable mais il nous reste énormément de chose à découvrir sur le meilleur ami de l’homme.On sait comment nourrir son chien, comment dresser son chien, comment le soigner, … mais très fréquemment la science arrive à nous surprendre !Pendant 2 ans les propriétaires de 70 chiens (37 races différentes) ont eu la lourde tâche de surveiller leurs chiens pendant qu’ils faisaient leurs besoins.Ils ont enregistré la date, l’heure, le lieu et l’orientation de leur chien (j’aurai adoré croiser l’un de ces propriétaires pendant sa promenade ;-) Après 1893 cacas et 5582 pipis, les scientifiques ont regroupé, étudié et analysé toutes les données.Ils les ont ensuite comparé avec les données du champ magnétique terrestre pour savoir si les chiens peuvent éventuellement le ressentir.Les conclusions montrent que les chiens, quelle que soit la race, préfèrent faire leurs besoins sur un axe nord-sud lorsque le champ magnétique est stable (environ 20% d’une journée).Dans le cas contraire le chien fait ses besoins comme bon lui semble. C’est la première fois que la science prouve que les chiens sont magnétosensibles.C’est une avancée majeure qui permet de mieux comprendre le merveilleux sens de l’orientation de nos chiens.Concrètement qu’est ce que ça change pour vous et votre chien ?La première des choses qui me paraît évidente : vous ne regarderez plus jamais votre chien faire ses besoins de la même manière ;-)Qui aurait cru que pendant sa promenade votre chien en plus de faire ses besoins prend le temps de vous indiquer le nord ?J’espère que comme moi lors de votre prochaine promenade avec votre chien vous prendrai votre boussole pour vérifier sa magnétosensibilité.Et si vous croisez un autre maître avec une boussole qui observe scrupuleusement son chien pendant qu’il fait ses besoins rassurez-vous c’est surement un autre lecteur de Woufipedia.Ensuite cette découverte permet de mieux comprendre le fameux mystère du sens de l’orientation de nos chiens. Il y a fort à parier qu’un chien perdu utilise le champ magnétique terrestre pour trouver la direction de son domicile.Cette découverte peut faire sourire, on peut également se demander si la science n’a pas des sujets plus importants à traiter.Mais comme bien souvent une découverte scientifique amène plus de questions que de réponses et certaines de ces questions peuvent entrainer d’autres découvertes incroyables qui finiront par bouleverser votre quotidien et celui de votre chien.On est encore loin de tout savoir sur nos chiens et il n’y a aucun doute sur le fait que les scientifiques nous réservent encore de belles surprises…Pour plus d’infos sur cette étude cliquez ici…Pour la prochaine promenade de votre chien n’oubliez pas la boussole !!!

TITRE: Apprendre la propreté à son chiot : les erreurs à éviter
CATÉGORIE: Non catégorisé
CONTENU:
Apprendre la propreté à son chiot ou à son chien demande de la persévérance et de la patience (qualités indispensables pour dresser son chien ;-).Même si vous appliquez à la lettre les bonnes méthodes votre chien ne sera pas propre du jour au lendemain.Avec le temps certains maîtres perdent confiance et finissent par faire n’importe quoi (consciemment ou inconsciemment). Voici donc ce qu’il ne faut pas faire pour rendre son chiot propre. BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! Eviter les excès pour apprendre la propretéQuand on est confronté à l’échec, on a tendance à tomber dans l’excès. Dans le domaine de la propreté du chiot c’est assez fréquent.Ainsi certains maîtres installent des tapis d’entrainements dans chaque pièce pour parer à tout accident. C’est ce qu’on appelle tomber dans l’excès.Un tapis d’entrainement est utile et peut vous aider à apprendre la propreté à votre chiot. En revanche si vous en abusé, vous encouragez votre chiot à faire ses besoins un peu partout chez vous.Un chiot prend très rapidement des habitudes et le jour où vous voudrez retirer ces tapis vous risquez d’avoir des surprises. Ne tombez pas dans l’excès pour rendre votre chiot propre plus rapidement. Il est impossible de dresser son chien en grillant les étapes. Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! Moins de liberté et plus de propretéTant que votre chiot n’est pas propre, il est important de limiter son espace de liberté (voir article : préparer sa maison pour l’arrivée de son chien). Le but est de garder un œil sur lui le plus souvent possible.Pour dresser son chiot à la propreté vous devez le prendre sur le fait lorsqu’il se laisse aller à l’intérieur, et c’est beaucoup plus facile si vous savez dans quelle pièce il se trouve.Le fait de garder un œil sur lui peut également vous permettre de déceler les signes d’une éventuelle envie et donc de le sortir au bon moment.Ce qui non seulement vous évitera de nettoyer et surtout vous permettra de féliciter votre chien pour avoir fait ses besoins au bon endroit. D’ailleurs ce conseil est valable tant que vous n’aurez pas dresser votre chiot à tous les ordres de bases.La propreté du chiot est un travail d’équipe Si vous voulez rendre votre chiot propre vous devez l’accompagner. Vous devez être à ses cotés quand il fait ses besoins dehors.Quel que soit le temps ne laissez pas sortir votre chiot sans vous. Qu’il pleuve, qu’il vente, qu’il neige, ou en pleine canicule vous devez travailler en équipe.Inutile d’espérer qu’il comprenne vos encouragements à travers la fenêtre, ou de lui donner une friandise à son retour, votre chiot ne fera pas le lien.Vous devez l’encourager au moment où il fait ses besoins, quelques minutes de trop et vous aurez raté une occasion en or de dresser votre chiot. C’est aussi le meilleur moyen de lui apprendre à faire ses besoins sur commande (si vous souhaitez lui apprendre).La propreté du chiot est un travail d’équipe !Hygiène et propreté du chienVotre chiot va commettre des erreurs, c’est inévitable. Avec le temps certains maîtres finissent par être moins rigoureux, pourtant il est important qu’il ne reste aucune traces de ces erreurs.Je ne parle pas des traces visibles pour vous mais plutôt de celles que votre chiot pourrait sentir.Si votre chiot a une soudaine envie et qu’il sent l’odeur de son urine à un endroit de la pièce, il y a de grande chance qu’il oubli de sortir et qu’il fasse ses besoins au même endroit.Donc ne négligez pas le nettoyage et investissez dans un Spray détachant salissure animal, ça n’est pas plus cher qu’un détergent classique et beaucoup plus efficace.Communiquer proprementPour bien communiquer avec son chiot il est important de comprendre son mode de fonctionnement : votre chiot fonctionne par association (c’est l’une des premières choses à comprendre quand on veut eduquer un chiot de quelques mois.Il ne faut jamais crier après votre chiot lorsqu’il a fait ses besoins ou vous risquez de lui faire comprendre qu’il n’a pas le droit de faire ses besoins.Certains chiots finissent pas développer des problèmes comportementaux (ils effacent toutes traces de leurs besoins en les mangeant) ou des maladies (infections urinaires) uniquement parce qu’ils pensent que leurs maîtres n’apprécient pas qu’ils fassent leurs besoins.Accélérez l’apprentissage de la propretéIl est facile de faire des erreurs quand on essaye de rendre son chiot propre.Pour ceux et celles qui sont au bord de la crise et qui veulent accélérer les choses, sachez que la méthode Dresser son chien en 15 minutes par jour peut vous faire gagner beaucoup de temps. C’est une méthode simple, rapide et efficace. Il vous suffit de reprendre tout à zéro et de suivre cette méthode pas à pas. En quelques jours votre chiot ou chien sera propre !Vous saurez tout sur l’apprentissage de la propreté et comment faire comprendre à votre chiot ce que vous attendez de lui. Au passage vous apprendrez également comment éduquer votre chiot de manière plus globale.L’apprentissage des ordres de base, du rappel, de la marche en laisse seront donc facilité par la suite.

En devenant maître de votre chien, vous êtes légalement responsable des dommages qu’il subit ou qu’il provoque.Comme tout être humain, il peut donc être assuré contre certains risques : dommages, maladies, décès… et pour certains chiens une assurance est obligatoire.Dresser-son-chien.com souhaite parler d’assurance pour chien en toute transparence. Ce site n’est pas là pour vous forcer à souscrire à une assurance chien mais plus pour vous aider à faire votre choix et pour décrypter les contrats d’assurance chien. BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! Est-il obligatoire d’assurer son chien ? Tous les maîtres de chien ne sont pas logés à la même enseigne. En fonction de la race et de la catégorie à laquelle appartient votre chien, vous avez l’obligation ou non d’assurer votre chien.La loi oblige uniquement les maîtres de chiens qui sont jugés à risque, à souscrire une assurance responsabilité civile (RC). Cette assurance protège des dommages et préjudices causés par votre chien aux tiers. Les chiens estimés à risque sont listés dans l’arrêté du 27 avril 1999, en deux catégories. La catégorie 1 regroupe les chiens d’attaque ; il s’agit par exemple des Pitbulls, des Mastiffs ou Boerbulls et des chiens de race Tosa. La catégorie 2 concerne les chiens de défense ou de garde tels que les Rottweilers ou les American Staffordshire Terriers.Tous ces chiens doivent donc être assurés pour leur responsabilité civile. Souvent, cette assurance se présente sous forme d’option payante dans votre assurance habitation.Cependant, toutes les assurances n’acceptent pas de couvrir ce risque. Certains assureurs sont plus réticents pour assurer les chiens de 1ère et 2e catégorie et peuvent refuser entièrement le risque, c’est-à-dire qu’ils refusent d’assurer le chien mais aussi de souscrire un contrat d’assurance habitation. Il existe donc des compagnies d’assurance qui se spécialisent dans ce type de risque et proposent un contrat spécifique pour les dommages causés par ces chiens.Quant à toutes les autres races de chiens, la loi n’oblige pas leurs maîtres à souscrire une assurance : ni responsabilité civile, ni mutuelle santé, ni obsèques décès.Mais, sachez que la plupart des races de chiens tels que bouvier, épagneul, chihuahua, bichon, boxer, labrador, teckel, caniche, berger, shetland, border collie, colley, griffon, carlin, bobtail, shih tzu… sont généralement couverts gratuitement par la garantie responsabilité civile incluse dans votre contrat d’assurance habitation. Pensez juste à le déclarer à votre compagnie d’assurance !Même si ces assurances ne sont pas obligatoires, selon votre situation, il est parfois nécessaire de choisir une assurance chien adaptée à vos besoins. Voici donc un peu plus d’informations sur les différents types d’assurances pour chien…Les différents types d’assurance pour chien La garantie de responsabilité civile pour chienTout d’abord, l’assurance de base est la garantie de responsabilité civile.Ce type d’assurance couvre les éventuels dégâts occasionnés par votre chien à un tiers.C’est généralement celle à laquelle on fait référence quand on parle de l’assurance pour chien et celle qui est obligatoire pour les chiens de catégorie 1 et 2.Attention, cette assurance ne protège aucunement votre chien, uniquement les dégâts qu’il peut causer, notamment lorsqu’il mord quelqu’un, qu’il provoque un accident de voiture ou renverse un cycliste en courant sur la chaussée …Ce qui signifie que les dommages subis par votre chien (blessures, accidents ou maladies…) ne sont pas pris en charge par cette garantie.Alors comment faire face alors à ces dommages qui ne sont pas couverts par la garantie de responsabilité civile ? Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! L’assurance santé pour chienPour protéger votre chien, il convient de souscrire une assurance santé chien auprès d’assureurs spécialisés.C’est elle qui remboursera les frais de santé de votre chien comme les visites chez le vétérinaire en cas de maladie ou d’accident.Les frais de santé d’un chien peuvent parfois devenir astronomiques. Tant que votre chien est en bonne santé une visite annuelle chez le vétérinaire suffit.En revanche si malheureusement votre chien connaît des problèmes de santé la facture peut devenir rapidement salée (100€ pour une analyse en laboratoire ou des medicaments antibiotiques, 300€ pour un diagnostic tumoral, entre 800€ et 1 500€ pour une fracture de la patte…).Ce n’est donc pas donné à tout le monde de bien soigner son chien. A tel point qu’un maître désemparé et dans l’impossibilité de faire face à de telles dépenses, est parfois dans l’obligation de faire euthanasier son chien.Avec une assurance maladie pour chien, vous êtes donc certain de pouvoir couvrir les soins médicaux de votre chien en cas de maladie ou d’accident.Il est bon de savoir que bien souvent les assureurs qui acceptent de couvrir les chiens de moins de 2 mois ou de plus de 10 ans à la date de souscription sont rares.En revanche, si votre chien a entre 3 mois et 8 ans, qu’il a une bonne santé et qu’il ne participe pas à votre activité professionnelle, vous n’aurez aucune difficulté à trouver une mutuelle adaptée à vos besoins. La plupart des assureurs proposent une mutuelle pour 20€ à 35€ par mois pour une formule complète.D’autres assureurs proposent à des prix très attractifs des assurances pour chiens. Attention toutefois à bien comparer avant de faire son choix. Il est important de bien connaître les soins pris en charge, à quel taux et ceux qui ne le sont pas. (Nous vous en reparlerons dans un prochain article)L’assurance obsèques décès pour chienIl existe également une assurance décès, généralement sous forme d’option gratuite ou payante dans l’assurance santé chien. Elle permet de couvrir tous les frais liés au décès de votre chien (inhumation, transports, etc.)Le chagrin est souvent immense au décès de son chien. Certes, une assurance décès chien ne vous aidera pas à surmonter l’épreuve mais tout du moins, vous pourrez lui offrir une fin digne. L’assurance décès vous verse également une somme qui vous permettra de vous offrir un nouveau compagnon. Un nouveau compagnon qui ne remplacera jamais celui que vous aurez perdu mais qui vous accompagnera dans votre douleur.Cette assurance est souvent incluse dans la mutuelle chien soit gratuitement, soit pour quelques euros en plus. Alors pourquoi s’en priver ?La première étape avant de souscrire une assurance pour chien Notre dernier conseil concernant l’assurance pour chien : éduquez votre chien. Quelle que soit votre décision concernant les assurances pour chien, il est important que vous puissiez contrôler votre chien en toutes circonstances.Evidemment le risque zéro n’existe pas, mais en dressant votre chien vous éliminerez une bonne partie des problèmes. Si votre chien saute sur tous ce qui bouge et qu’il ne répond pas à vos ordres, il y a de fortes chances que vous ayez besoin d’une assurance un jour ou l’autre.Donc prenez le temps de dresser votre chien, n’oubliez pas que c’est une activité amusante et que votre relation avec votre chien n’en sera que plus forte. Essayez de trouver un éducateur canin près de chez vous pour acquérir les bases, ou utiliser des méthodes comme celle-ci : Dresser votre chien en 15 minutes par jour.Non seulement vous éviterez les petits tracas qu’un chien peut provoquer au quotidien mais vous éviterez également des problèmes qui peuvent parfois être beaucoup plus importants et avoir des conséquences graves pour vous, votre famille et votre chien.Dans un prochain article nous vous apporterons un peu plus d’informations pour bien choisir une assurance chien, éviter les pièges, et trouver les meilleurs rapport qualité prix.D’ici là, commencez d’ores et déjà à apprendre à dresser votre chien ;-) Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour !

A quel âge débuter l’éducation de son chiot ? Est-ce que mon chiot est trop jeune pour démarrer son éducation ?Voilà des questions que de nombreux maîtres se posent. En règle générale, de nombreux maîtres démarrent l’éducation de leur chiot trop tard. Lorsque les mauvais comportements font leur apparition ils prennent conscience qu’il est temps d’éduquer leur chiot.Même si il n’est jamais trop tard pour le faire c’est beaucoup plus difficile puisqu’il ne s’agit plus simplement d’éduquer son chiot mais bien de le rééduquer.

Trop jeune pour débuter l’éducation de son chiot ?C’est l’argument qui revient le plus souvent : «mon chiot est trop jeune pour être éduquer».Pourtant c’est une erreur de penser cela. En réalité l’éducation de votre chiot a démarré depuis longtemps.Dès sa naissance, sa mère a commencé à l’élever. Ses frères et sœurs ont également participé à son éducation à travers le jeu par exemple.Enfin l’éleveur a lui aussi contribué à son éducation. Les meilleurs éleveurs sociabilisent, apprennent la propreté au chiot et certains vont même jusqu’à les préparer à l’angoisse de la séparation.Donc votre chiot n’est pas trop jeune pour être éduqué, ne perdez pas de temps ! Vous devez démarrer l’éducation de votre chiot dès son arrivée chez vous. Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! Eduquer tôt pour un futur chien équilibréLorsqu’on accueille un chiot on est tenté de le laisser faire ce qu’il veut à travers l’appartement et la maison. Quoi de plus amusant que de voir un petit chiot courir partout et sauter sur tout ce qui bouge !Pourtant trop de liberté n’est pas sain pour le développement de votre chiot. Depuis sa naissance votre chiot a toujours suivi des règles.Les règles peuvent être une privation de liberté pour nous, mais pour un chiot elles sont nécessaires. Elles sont rassurantes, elles donnent des repères à votre chiot, lui permette de se situer au sein d’une meute.Un chiot qui ne suit pas de règles est comme un navire sans gouvernail, dans très peu de temps il n’aura plus de repères et les troubles du comportement vont apparaître.Votre chiot s’éduque avec ou sans vous Les chiots sont très observateurs et ils apprennent par répétition dès le plus jeune âge.Que vous le vouliez ou non votre chiot va apprendre des choses autant faire en sorte que ce soit les bonnes du premier coup.Vous appréciez surement qu’il vous saute dessus pour l’instant et lui donner une caresse quand il le fait.Votre chiot va enregistrer cette information : je saute dessus = caresse. Quand il aura pris 15kg de plus vous risquez de le regretter.L’éducation de votre chiot se fera dans tous les cas, avec vous ou à vos dépend. A vous de voir ce que vous préférez.Comment éduquer son chiot ?Pour éduquer un chiot il faut évidemment commencer en douceur. Vous trouverez de nombreuses informations dans cet article sur l’éducation du chiot entre 2 et 5 mois.Vous avez énormément de choses à apprendre pour comprendre comment fonctionne votre chiot et comment il apprend.Votre chiot lui aussi a énormément de choses à apprendre : son nom et tous les ordres de bases comme assis, couché, le rappel, pas bougé, marcher en laisse… et bien entendu la propreté.Vous devez également apprendre à gérer les mauvais comportement comme le fait qu’il tire en laisse, qu’il saute sur les invités, qu’il morde, qu’il mâchouille vos chaussures…Comme vous pouvez le constater la liste est longue et plus vous démarrer l’éducation de votre chiot tôt, plus ce sera facile.Si vous cherchez une méthode pas à pas pour éduquer votre chiot en douceur, je vous recommande la méthode « Dresser son chien en 15 minutes par jour« .C’est une formation complète et simple à suivre !

CONTENU:
Choisir un bon vétérinaire est sans aucun doute le plus beau cadeau que vous puissiez lui faire. Après vous et votre famille, le vétérinaire est la personne la plus importante pour votre chien.Voici quelques critères à prendre en compte et quelques vérifications à faire pour choisir le bon vétérinaire. BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! Critères pour choisir un vétérinaire Proximité du vétérinaireL’un des critères les plus importants pour choisir son vétérinaire reste la proximité. C’est très pratique, en cas d’urgence, de pouvoir emmener son chien en quelques minutes chez son vétérinaire.L’idéal étant de pouvoir y aller à pied pour éviter un trajet en voiture à votre chien. Pour trouver les vétérinaires près de chez vous rendez vous sur www.veterinaire.fr Votre chien mérite le meilleur départ ! Ne ratez pas notre ebook essentiel⤹ Prénom * Email * Le bouche à oreilleC’est un bon moyen d’obtenir de bonnes adresses et des informations.Mais attention n’écartez pas un vétérinaire de votre liste à cause d’un avis négatif. Certaines personnes ne sont jamais satisfaites et il est préférable de visiter le vétérinaire vous même et de vous faire votre propre opinion.Il serait dommage de ne pas choisir le vétérinaire en bas de chez vous uniquement parce que votre voisin a une dent contre lui.Les horaires de votre vétérinaireDans la mesure du possible il est préférable que les horaires de votre vétérinaire soient adaptées aux vôtres ou au moins à l’un des membres de votre famille qui est en mesure d’emmener votre chien chez le vétérinaire.Services d’urgence de votre vétérinaireIl est intéressant de savoir comment fonctionne votre vétérinaire en cas d’urgence.Est ce que son cabinet gère les urgences 24h/24 ? Travaille-t-il en collaboration avec d’autres vétérinaires ? Ou sont traités les chiens si il n’est pas disponible ou si il n’est pas équipé pour faire face à l’urgence et est ce loin de chez vous ?Il est préférable de connaître ces informations avant de choisir votre vétérinaire.Question de feeling pour choisir votre vétérinaire C’est un critère qui ne servira techniquement pas à grand chose pour votre chien mais qui est beaucoup plus important que l’on ne le pense.Le vétérinaire est souvent votre premier contact en cas de problème, il est important que vous vous sentiez en confiance avec lui. Il faut que vous soyez assez à l’aise pour partager vos angoisses et poser toutes les questions que vous jugez nécessaires.Il faut également que celui-ci prenne le temps de vous répondre.La santé de votre chien est un travail d’équipe entre vous qui côtoyez vôtre chien au quotidien et votre vétérinaire qui sait déceler d’éventuels problèmes de santé. Pour que vous formiez une bonne équipe avec votre vétérinaire vous devez communiquer correctement.Les tarifs des vétérinairesLes tarifs des vétérinaires sont libres, ils dépendent principalement des charges du cabinet (loyer, matériel, salaires, …). Pour choisir votre vétérinaire il peut être intéressant de comparer le prix d’une consultation simple pour un chien.Mais ne donnez pas trop d’importance à ce critère car vous pourriez le regretter un jour. En matière de santé il est toujours préférable de ne pas se poser la question du prix.Plutôt que de choisir le vétérinaire le moins cher je vous recommande de vous libérer l’esprit de ce problème et de prendre une simple assurance pour chien.La visite test de votre vétérinaireC’est le dernier critère qui devra vous permettre de vous décider. Appelez le vétérinaire pour une petite visite (inutile d’emmener votre chien pour le moment).C’est l’occasion de tout vérifier une dernière fois : le temps de transport pour y aller, la propreté et l’odeur des locaux, la fréquentation, l’accueil du personnel, l’accueil du vétérinaire (si il est disponible), le contact facile, les équipements…Bref enregistrez tous les sentiments et informations qui vous permettront de choisir le bon vétérinaire…Les différents types de vétérinaires En cherchant votre vétérinaire vous allez découvrir qu’il existe différents types d’établissements vétérinaires :le cabinet vétérinaire,la clinique vétérinaireet le centre hospitalier vétérinaire.Les différences entre ces trois types d’établissements vétérinaires résident dans le nombre de pièces disponibles, leurs équipements, leur personnel et donc les services qu’ils sont capables d’offrir.Le centre hospitalier vétérinaireUn centre hospitalier vétérinaire doit par exemple compter 6 vétérinaires minimum et un auxiliaire spécialisé pour chaque vétérinaire.Il doit être en mesure d’assurer la gestion des urgences, les soins aux animaux, les interventions médico-chirurgicales et le suivi des animaux hospitalisés, le tout 24h/24 et 7j/7.Les locaux et l’équipement d’un centre hospitalier sont donc plus conséquents puisqu’il doit être en mesure de répondre à tous les cas possibles et imaginables.Le gros avantage d’un centre hospitalier c’est que les vétérinaires peuvent tout faire sur place mais c’est aussi pour ça que les tarifs sont un peu plus élevés.La clinique vétérinaireUne clinique vétérinaire est plus petite qu’un centre hospitalier : moins de personnel, moins de locaux et moins d’équipement.Mais rassurez-vous une clinique vétérinaire reste très bien équipé et sera capable, sauf cas vraiment exceptionnel, de prendre en charge votre chien de A à Z.La grande différence avec un centre hospitalier réside dans le fait qu’une clinique n’est pas obligée de surveiller les animaux hospitalisés, y compris la nuit et le week-end.De même elle n’est pas tenue d’assurer les urgences. Ce sera donc à vous de vérifier avec le personnel avant de les choisir.Le cabinet vétérinaireLe cabinet vétérinaire contient au moins un lieu de réception, une pièce réservée aux examens et aux interventions médico-chirugicales. Comme la clinique, le cabinet n’est pas tenu d’assurer les urgences.Là encore certains cabinets vétérinaire sont parfaitement équipé pour répondre aux soins courants de votre chien, à vous de voir pendant votre visite comment sont gérées les urgences.Enfin il existe également le vétérinaire à domicile qui viendra directement chez vous mais qui évidemment aura une marge de manœuvre limitée.Vous savez tout sur les vétérinaires et vous devriez pouvoir faire votre choix facilement maintenant…N’oubliez pas de garder le numéro d’urgence de votre vétérinaire préféré à portée de main !

Bien comprendre les besoins nutritionnels de votre chien est très important. La nourriture joue un rôle primordial sur sa santé. Le chien est un omnivore, ce qui veut dire qu’il peut manger n’importe quelle nourriture (je ne tiens pas compte des chaussures ou tout autre objet que votre chien a l’habitude de manger ;-).Pour répondre aux besoins nutritionnels de votre chien il faut que son alimentation soit répartie en 6 groupes alimentaires.C’est la clef d’une alimentation équilibrée et d’un chien en pleine forme !

De l’eau pour votre chienDe l’eau, de l’air, la vie ! C’est vrai pour vous et c’est aussi vrai pour votre chien. L’eau représente 60 à 70% du poids d’un chien adulte.Une partie des besoins en eau de votre chien se trouve dans sa nourriture (la nourriture en boite contient environ 78% d’eau et la nourriture sèche environ 10%).Il est donc primordial que votre chien ait accès à de l’eau fraîche (je ne parle pas de température, simplement renouvelez tous les jours la gamelle d’eau de votre chien).Petite précision pour ceux qui sont en train d’apprendre la propreté à leur chiot : vous pouvez surveiller et limiter la quantité d’eau que votre chiot absorbe (donner lui de l’eau à des moments spécifiques comme après la balade par exemple).En cas de forte chaleur ne prenez pas de risques, un chien se déshydrate rapidement (vous pouvez également lui mettre un glaçon à la place de l’eau, il l’absorbera plus lentement). Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! Des protéines pour votre chienLes protéines sont également très importantes pour votre chien. Elles vont lui fournir les acides aminés nécessaires au bon développement de son corps. Les protéines contiennent 23 acides aminés dont 10 sont essentiels pour la bonne santé de votre chien. Les autres sont également importants mais votre chien peut les fabriquer lui même.Généralement, on considère que les protéines animales sont plus intéressantes pour votre chien que les protéines végétales.Des minéraux pour votre chienLes minéraux n’ont aucune valeur énergétique mais ils font partie des besoins alimentaires de votre chien. Ils doivent être présents dans l’alimentation de votre chien car contrairement à certains acides aminés, les chiens ne peuvent pas les produire.Le fer, le magnésium, le zinc, le calcium vont permettre des réactions métaboliques assurant ainsi le bon fonctionnement de l’organisme de votre chien.Par exemple, sans minéraux dans son alimentation votre chien n’aura pas les os solides. Ils participent également à la bonne santé des dents de votre chien qui est un élément crucial pour lui et sa longévité (n’oubliez pas de brosser les dents de votre chien régulièrement et les vôtres aussi ;-).De la graisse pour votre chien Si votre chien n’a pas une belle peau ou une belle fourrure, surveillez ses besoins en graisse. La graisse a non seulement un rôle énergétique mais elle permet aussi à votre chien d’absorber certains vitamines qui se dissolvent dans la graisse.Autre point important, les chiens aiment les graisses. C’est très bien de répondre à ses besoins alimentaires mais il faut aussi prendre du plaisir dans tout ça ! Attention tout de même aux excès.La nourriture industrielle est généralement adaptée aux besoins de vos chiens mais attention aux petites friandises qui sont souvent un peu plus riches.Surtout si vous utilisez la nourriture pour le éduquer votre chien, n’oubliez pas de diminuer les quantités aux repas.Des vitamines pour votre chienVotre chien a besoin de vitamines, tout comme vous. Ils participent au bon fonctionnement de l’organisme ils sont indispensables aux échanges vitaux.Votre chien ne peut pas les synthétiser lui même, mais rassurez-vous si son alimentation est équilibrée, il aura les vitamines dont il a besoin.Inutile de donner des suppléments de vitamine à votre chien sauf si votre chien a une déficience et que votre vétérinaire vous le demande. Contrairement à ce qu’on pourrait croire, trop de vitamines peut être dangereux.Des glucides pour votre chienLes glucides sont le dernier élément des besoins nutritionnels de votre chien. Ils n’ont pas toujours bonne réputation et pourtant ils sont une aide précieuse pour le corps de votre chien.Ils permettent de conserver les intestins de votre chien en bon état et d’éviter des diarrhées ou constipation. Ils fournissent également de l’énergie aux tissus ce qui permet à votre chien de conserver ses protéines et de les utiliser à bon escient.Comme pour les graisses il faut contrôler et gérer les quantités, mise à part ça les glucides font partie intégrante des besoins nutritionnels de votre chien.

TITRE: Tester le QI de son chien
CATÉGORIE: Non catégorisé
CONTENU:
J’adore tester les limites de mes chiens. C’est quelque chose qui m’amuse beaucoup, j’apprends à mieux les connaître, à mieux les comprendre, et je peux ensuite essayer de les faire évoluer dans le bon sens.C’est pour cette raison que tester le QI de son chien peut-être à la fois amusant et utile.Cette série de tests est donc parfaite pour connaître les points forts et les points faibles de son chien. Attention il ne faut pas prendre ces tests trop au sérieux, le but est de vous amuser et de partager un agréable moment avec votre chien. BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! Premier test : Avec ou sans patte ?Pour ce test vous aurez besoin d’un chronomètre, d’un canapé, d’une chaise ou d’un meuble suffisamment bas pour que votre chien ne puisse pas passer en dessous. Le but de ce test est de voir si votre chien va utiliser sa patte pour attraper un objet inaccessible.Placez un jouet sous le sofa, le meuble, la chaise… placez le assez loin pour qu’il ne puisse pas l’attraper avec sa tête et assez près pour qu’il puisse l’attraper avec sa patte. Faîtes en sorte que votre chien vous voit faire. Ensuite encouragez le à aller chercher le jouet.Si votre chien n’a pas de réaction son score est de zéro points.Si votre chien utilise sa tête sans essayer de la tourner ou de s’allonger, il marque 1 points.Si votre chien tourne la tête ou s’allonge pour passer en dessous mais n’utilise pas ses pattes il marque 2 points.Si votre chien utilise sa patte mais ne parvient pas à attraper le jouet, il marque 3 points.Si votre chien utilise sa patte et obtient le jouet en 30 secondes ou plus il marque 4 points.Si votre chien récupère le jouet en moins de 30 secondes il marque 5 points.Le lendemain recommencez l’exercice et si votre chien s’améliore donnez lui un point supplémentaire. Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! Deuxième test : Rien ne l’arrête !Cet exercice a pour but de voir si votre chien aura la présence d’esprit de contourner un obstacle. Pour ce test il vous faut une barrière ou un grillage entre vous et votre chien et il faut que votre chien vous voit à travers. N’importe quelle clôture de jardin peut faire l’affaire mais il faut qu’elle fasse une bonne douzaine de mètres.Pour distraire le chien lancez un jouet perpendiculairement à la barrière. Faîtes le tour sans que le chien ne vous voit. Vous êtes maintenant placé au centre de la barrière et celle-ci vous sépare de votre chien. Il ne vous reste plus qu’à l’appeler. Quand votre chien revient devant la barrière, démarrez le chronomètre. Si il n’a pas fait le tour après une minute faites quelques pas en direction du détour pour l’aider à vous rejoindre.Si votre chien ne fait rien après une minute même en lui indiquant la bonne direction, il marque 0 points.Si votre chien réussit à contourner l’obstacle mais avec votre aide, il marque 1 points.Si votre chien réussit entre 30 sec et 1 minutes, il marque 2 points.Si votre chien vous rejoint dans les 30 secondes, il marque 3 points.Si votre chien vous rejoint aussitôt il marque 4 points.Si votre chien ne l’avait jamais fait avant il marque 5 points.Troisième test : mémoire de chien…Cette fois vous allez tester la mémoire de votre chien. Dans un premier temps, vous allez cacher une friandise dans un endroit insolite (sous un meuble, derrière une porte, sous le paillasson, …), tout simplement un endroit ou votre chien ne s’attendra pas à trouver une friandise. Il faut que votre chien vous voit la cacher, ensuite laisser le renifler puis manger la friandise. Répétez cette première étape jusqu’à ce que votre chien ait bien compris le système Une fois qu’il a assimilé qu’il pouvait manger la friandise, le test va pouvoir commencer.Pour démarrer le test, posez une nouvelle friandise dans un nouvel endroit, là encore, laissez votre chien voir où vous la mettez. En revanche cette fois-ci ne laissez pas votre chien manger la friandise mais sortez le de la maison pour une minute.Une fois la minute passée, rentrez et observez si il va chercher la friandise. Pour marquer des points votre chien doit chercher la friandise des que vous rentrez, ça doit être instantané. Utilisez une nouvelle place à chaque fois et répétez pour 2 minutes, 3, 4 et enfin une heure.Si votre chien ne récupère aucune friandise il marque 0 points. Si après une minute de promenade il se jette sur la friandise il marque 1 points, après 2 minutes de promenade 2 points, après 3 minutes 3 points, 4 minutes 4 points, et enfin après une heure de promenade : 5 points.Quatrième test : Test de déductionPour ce dernier test il vous faut deux bols et des friandises. Demander à votre chien de s’asseoir, si vous n’avez pas encore dressé votre chien à l’ordre assis attachez le pour quelques minutes. Dans un premier temps vous allez frotter la friandise sur les deux bols pour qu’ils s’imprègnent de l’odeur.Ensuite le test se déroule en deux parties : une partie simple et une autre ou vous allez induire en erreur votre chien.Pour la première partie, placez une friandise sous l’un des bols (attendez que votre chien vous regarde, faîtes le manière très visible et n’hésitez pas à exagérer le geste). Ensuite éloignez vous des bols et appelez votre chien (ou détachez le).Si il se jette sur le bon bol relevez le bol et donnez lui la friandise. Si il choisit le mauvais laissez le venir au bon bol et donnez lui ensuite la friandise.Répétez une dizaine de fois en changeant l’emplacement de la friandise régulièrement et n’oubliez pas de noter les résultats de votre chien.Passons maintenant à la deuxième partie qui en général m’amuse beaucoup. Cette fois-ci vous allez simplement placer la friandise dans un des bols discrètement (sans exagération et en soulevant à peine le bol). Votre chien ne doit pas se rendre compte que vous avez placé la friandise dans le bol. Ensuite vous allez faire semblant de mettre une friandise dans l’autre bol (en répétant votre mise en scène du départ et en exagérant bien les mouvements). Libérez votre chien : va-t-il vers le bol vide ou celui contenant la friandise ? Répétez le test 10 fois et enregistrez les résultats.Si votre chien ne fait pas plus de 10/20 au deux tests, il marque 0 points.Si lors de la première partie du test votre chien démarre mal mais s’améliore et qu’il se trompe majoritairement sur la deuxième partie, attribué lui 1 points.Votre chien marque 2 points si il se trompe au début de la première partie et de la deuxième partie mais qu’il s’améliore au fur et à mesure.Si votre chien fait 10/10 à la première partie mais ne réussit pas la deuxième, il marque 3 points.Si votre chien fait 10/10 au premier test et qu’il s’améliore au fur et à mesure de la seconde partie du test, il marque 4 points.Si votre chien fait 10/10 au premier test et qu’il s’améliore au fur et à mesure de la seconde partie du test, il marque 4 points.Résultat: Quel est le QI de votre chien ?16 à 20 votre chien est très intelligent10 à 15 votre chien est un petit malin6 à 9 votre chien est dans la moyenne, à vous de l’aider à s’améliorer0 à 5 votre chien a besoin de plus d’attention, amusez vous et entrainez le plus souventVous connaissez maintenant le QI de votre chien et j’espère que vous et votre chien vous êtes bien amusés.Observer son chien confronté à un problème est souvent très drôle. Mais c’est aussi un très bon moyen de l’entrainer et de lui permettre de s’épanouir.Si votre chien a des problèmes de mémoire, répétez le test le plus souvent possible et vous verrez qu’il s’améliorera.N’oubliez pas, gardez à l’esprit que pour dresser son chien ou tester son QI la règle d’or est de vous amuser et de partager un agréable moment avec votre chien.Alors n’hésitez pas à mettre votre chien face à des situations inattendues et surtout amusez vous bien… Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour !

La graisse a non seulement un rôle énergétique mais elle permet aussi à votre chien d’absorber certains vitamines qui se dissolvent dans la graisse.Autre point important, les chiens aiment les graisses. C’est très bien de répondre à ses besoins alimentaires mais il faut aussi prendre du plaisir dans tout ça ! Attention tout de même aux excès.La nourriture industrielle est généralement adaptée aux besoins de vos chiens mais attention aux petites friandises qui sont souvent un peu plus riches.Surtout si vous utilisez la nourriture pour le éduquer votre chien, n’oubliez pas de diminuer les quantités aux repas.Des vitamines pour votre chienVotre chien a besoin de vitamines, tout comme vous. Ils participent au bon fonctionnement de l’organisme ils sont indispensables aux échanges vitaux.Votre chien ne peut pas les synthétiser lui même, mais rassurez-vous si son alimentation est équilibrée, il aura les vitamines dont il a besoin.Inutile de donner des suppléments de vitamine à votre chien sauf si votre chien a une déficience et que votre vétérinaire vous le demande. Contrairement à ce qu’on pourrait croire, trop de vitamines peut être dangereux.Des glucides pour votre chienLes glucides sont le dernier élément des besoins nutritionnels de votre chien. Ils n’ont pas toujours bonne réputation et pourtant ils sont une aide précieuse pour le corps de votre chien.Ils permettent de conserver les intestins de votre chien en bon état et d’éviter des diarrhées ou constipation. Ils fournissent également de l’énergie aux tissus ce qui permet à votre chien de conserver ses protéines et de les utiliser à bon escient.Comme pour les graisses il faut contrôler et gérer les quantités, mise à part ça les glucides font partie intégrante des besoins nutritionnels de votre chien.

TITRE: 8 mythes sur les chiens
CATÉGORIE: Non catégorisé
CONTENU:
Il y a beaucoup de mythes sur les chiens que l’on entend régulièrement et qui se transmettent de génération en génération. Certains sont vrais et d’autres totalement faux.Certains n’ont pas grande importance et relèvent simplement de la culture générale mais d’autres sont un véritable fléau pour les chiens et leurs maîtres et peuvent même détruire les liens qui les unissent.Alors voici un petit récapitulatif des mythes sur les chiens, en espérant leur tordre le coup une bonne fois pour toute ! BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! Certaines races sont plus agressivesC’est un mythe !Il est vrai que certaines races de chien puissant peuvent être plus dangereuses lorsqu’elles deviennent agressives mais il ne faut pas tout mélanger.Tout les chiens peuvent être agressifs, un labrador peut être plus agressif qu’un pitbull.Ce n’est qu’une question d’éducation et de sociabilisation. C’est un peu le même principe que pour les races de chien faciles à dresser, ce qui fait réellement la différence c’est vous et votre méthode de dressage. Il n’y a pas de race de chien plus agressives que d’autres.Mon chien court dans le jardin : pas besoin de le sortir !C’est un mythe ! Même si votre chien se promène dans le jardin toute la journée, la ballade que vous ferez avec lui est d’une grande importance. A l’état sauvage, les chiens se déplacent sur leur territoire en meute avec un but précis (généralement à la recherche d’eau et de nourriture).Quand votre chien se promène dans votre jardin, il dépense quelques calories mais ça ne répond pas à ses besoins. Au contraire à la longue, la situation peut même rendre votre chien frustré et anxieux.Si vous avez un doute, laissez votre chien dans le jardin toute la journée et proposez lui une ballade. Vous pourrez constater que votre chien a encore beaucoup d’énergie ;-) Dernier point important, promenez votre chien est une occasion de créer du lien avec lui alors ne rater pas cette occasion ! Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! Impossible de dresser un chien âgéEncore un mythe et celui la a la dent dure ! C’est surement vrai concernant les êtres humains en revanche peu importe l’âge de votre chien il est toujours possible de l’éduquer et de le dresser. En réalité l’âge n’a pas d’importance quand il s’agit d’éducation.Apprendre de nouvelles choses à un chien âgé permet de maintenir son esprit en éveil. C’est très important pour que votre chien reste en forme, il ne suffit pas de le stimuler physiquement, un chien a besoin également de stimulation mentale.J’en profite pour tordre le coup à un autre mythe : le bon âge pour démarrer l’éducation de votre chiot. Encore une fois il n’y a pas de bon âge, à partir du moment où votre chiot arrive chez vous, vous pouvez et surtout vous devez démarrer son éducation.Mon chien me fait la fête quand je rentre parce qu’il m’aimeLa encore c’est en partie vrai. Rassurez-vous votre chien vous aime ;-) Mais cette manifestation de joie est le plus souvent le signe d’un chien qui se languit de dépenser son énergie et votre retour est une occasion en or.Votre chien saute partout, tourne en rond, aboie afin de dépenser un trop plein d’énergie et de se calmer. Le problème avec ce mythe c’est qu’il peut engendrer des troubles du comportement.En caressant votre chien parce qu’il vous fait la fête, vous allez renforcer ce comportement ce qui peut engendrer des problèmes d’angoisse de séparation ou avoir un chien qui détruit tout quand vous n’êtes pas là.Quand vous rentrez chez vous il est préférable d’ignorer votre chien quelques minutes (je sais c’est dur ;-) le temps qu’il se calme, ensuite vous pourrez lui faire tout les câlins du monde !Un chien heureux remue la queueC’est en partie vrai. Il y a plusieurs études sur le sujet et tout dépend de la façon dont elle remue.Quand un chien remue la queue vers la droite (donc vers la gauche quand vous êtes face à lui) il est effectivement heureux. En revanche quand il remue la queue vers la gauche (donc la droite quand vous êtes face à lui) c’est un avertissement.Si vous observez bien deux chiens qui se rencontrent soyez attentif et vous verrez que si l’un d’eux remue la queue vers la gauche l’autre chien devient anxieux et à tendance à s’éloigner.L’amplitude a aussi son importance et vous renseigne sur l’énergie et l’humeur du chien.Une queue qui remue de façon large est le signe d’un chien heureux. Une queue qui donne plus l’impression de vibrer sur place est un signe d’avertissement.Mon chien déteste celui du voisinC’est un mythe. Si votre chien aboie contre le chien du voisin ça peut être une question de territoire ou au contraire l’envie de jouer ensemble et sont frustrer de ne pas pouvoir. N’y voyez rien de personnel, les chiens ne fonctionnent pas comme ça et c’est aussi pour ça qu’on les aime !Même si votre chien et celui du voisin se sont déjà battu ensemble, ça ne signifie pas qu’ils sont en mauvais termes. La plupart des hommes fonctionnent comme ça mais pas les chiens.La meilleure solution et d’emmener votre chien en ballade avec votre voisin et son chien. Il faudra faire attention à ne pas dégager d’énergie négative (en réalité c’est souvent le maître qui communique son stress au chien et provoque son anxiété). Vous constaterez que soit vos chiens joueront ensemble soit ils s’ignoreront complètement.Mon chien est impossible à promener !Mythe qui pour de nombreux maîtres devient réalité !Je suis toujours surpris de voir le nombre de maîtres qui se font littéralement promener par le chien. Promener son chien doit être un plaisir pour vous comme pour lui.Dresser son chien à marcher en laisse avec les bonnes techniques est facile, rapide et surtout ça change radicalement les choses. Tout les chiens peuvent apprendre à marcher en laisse correctement c’est à dire soit à coté de vous soit légèrement derrière vous.Ne laissez pas votre chien vous balader, si vraiment vous n’arrivez pas à corriger le tir je vous recommande de lire cet article et de faire les exercices avec votre chien : Mon chien tire en laisse…Je ne peux pas corriger l’angoisse de séparation de mon chienC’est évidemment un mythe ! Certains chiens souffrent plus que d’autres de la séparation c’est vrai, mais ça ne veut pas dire qu’on ne peut pas les aider. Comme bien souvent le comportement du maître a une très grande importance.Votre comportement quand vous partez et quand vous rentrez va conditionner le comportement de votre chien quand vous n’êtes pas là. Vous ne devriez jamais partir en laissant votre chien excité à la maison. L’état d’esprit dans lequel vous laissez votre chien est celui qu’il gardera quand vous serez absent.Pour éviter tout problème, promenez votre chien avant de partir, laissez le se dépenser et en rentrant dirigez le vers son panier (dressez votre chien à l’ordre panier le plus rapidement possible c’est très important et très pratique).

TITRE: Cohabitation entre chien et chat les secrets pour une bonne entente
CATÉGORIE: Non catégorisé
CONTENU:
Vous êtes un amoureux des animaux et vous aimeriez voir votre chien et votre chat vivre en parfaite harmonie ?La cohabitation entre chien et chat peut paraître difficile voir impossible mais il y a quelques techniques à connaître pour faire en sorte que les choses se passent bien.Vous n’êtes pas obligé de vous en remettre au hasard, si vous voulez que votre chien et votre chat cohabitent, vous pouvez les aider en suivant ces conseils… BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! Une cohabitation parfois difficileLes chiens et les chats sont des animaux merveilleux mais très différents.Le chien est un animal sociable tandis que le chat est très indépendant. Quand un chat lève la patte c’est pour menacer tandis que le chien y voit une invitation à jouer.Généralement, quand un chien remue la queue c’est qu’il est content, alors que le chat remue la queue quand il est agacé.Un chat couché sur le flan est détendu alors que le chien y voit un signe de soumission.Bref si la cohabitation entre chien et chat est difficile c’est parce qu’ils ne fonctionnent pas de la même façon.Mais c’est à vous de prendre les choses en main ! Si vous voulez que votre chien et votre chat vivent en paix, vous pourrez les aider de différentes manières.D’abord en préparant le terrain, avant même de ramener votre nouveau chien ou chat à la maison, ensuite en préparant au mieux leur première rencontre pour que ni votre chat, ni votre chien ne soient traumatisés.Enfin pour ceux qui auraient complètement raté ces deux étapes, rassurez-vous il y a toujours des solutions pour rectifier le tir.Mais avant de vous donner toutes ces solutions pour faire cohabiter un chien et un chat, je tiens à préciser une petite chose. Beaucoup de maîtres espèrent voir leurs animaux devenir les meilleurs amis du monde, jouer ensemble, faire des siestes ensemble…Malheureusement, il n’y a pas de méthode de dressage pour ça, ce n’est pas une science exacte. Tout ce que vous pouvez faire c’est éviter que votre chien ne chasse votre chat, qu’il se fasse crever les yeux d’un coup de griffe ou qu’il tue le chat (malheureusement ça arrive plus souvent qu’on ne le croit).Si vous faîtes les choses correctement vous éviterez ce genre de problème et c’est le plus important, c’est ce que j’appelle la cohabitation entre chien et chat. Avec le temps et un peu de chance, il y a de fortes chances pour qu’ils deviennent les meilleurs amis du monde mais ça, c’est du bonus ! Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! Préparer le terrain à la cohabitation entre chien et chatSi vous n’avez pas encore choisi votre nouvel animal, sachez que plus il sera jeune et plus les choses seront faciles. Et plus l’animal que vous avez déjà (chien ou chat) est également jeune plus, les choses seront faciles.Donc si vous pensez adopter un nouvel animal, faîtes-le au plus tôt.Si vous en avez la possibilité, je vous conseille également d’imprégner un jouet ou un tissu avec l’odeur de votre futur chien ou chat et de le ramener chez vous quelques jours avant pour que votre animal actuel s’habitue à son odeur.Ensuite, il va falloir aménager votre maison en conséquence pour faciliter la cohabitation entre chien et chat. Dans un premier temps il vaut mieux séparer les territoires de chacun.Si possible faîtes en sorte qu’il y ait des endroits en hauteur sur le territoire de votre chat pour qu’il puisse se réfugier et se reposer.Séparer également les gamelles et faîtes attention à mettre la litière de votre chat dans un endroit tranquille hors d’accès du chien, qu’il n’est pas à l’esquiver à chaque fois qu’il veut faire ses besoins.Dans l’idéal, je vous recommande une pièce spéciale pour votre chat avec un arbre à chat, ses gamelles, sa litière et une barrière bébé pour empêcher votre chien de rentrer dans cette pièce.Pour finir si vous avez un chien et que vous allez accueillir un chat, je vous recommande de travailler son éducation au plus tôt. Vous aurez besoin des commandes de base : l’ordre assis et le rappel.Si vous avez un chat et que vous allez accueillir un chien, je vous recommanderai bien de travailler son dressage également mais je ne suis pas spécialiste en la matière ;-) en revanche je vous recommande d’avoir sous la main quelques friandises qu’il adore (thon émietté par exemple) vous verrez que vous en aurez besoin pour la suite.Une bonne présentation pour une bonne cohabitation La première impression est très importante pour votre chien et votre chat, il faut y aller en douceur.Les problèmes sont généralement liés aux instincts du chien. Il y a plusieurs solutions, soit votre chien va vouloir jouer avec le chat, soit le considérer comme une proie, soit l’ignorer.Dans les deux premiers cas, le chat va fuir ce qui va renforcer les instincts du chien et l’inciter à continuer. Il faut donc travailler avec votre chien.La première chose à faire avant les présentations est de promener votre chien. Son énergie doit être au plus bas, faîtes-le courir et jouer un bon moment, fatiguez-le.Une fois qu’il aura dépensé son énergie, il sera temps de démarrer les présentations.Gardez votre chien en laisse pour rentrer dans la maison et préparer quelques friandises. Votre chat doit se trouver dans son espace réservé. Emmenez votre chien devant la barrière bébé et laissez-les s’observer.Votre chien doit rester calme, s’il montre des signes d’agressivité ou s’il est un peu trop excité et tire sur la laisse, dîtes non et demandez lui de s’asseoir. Vous devez rediriger son attention sur vous pour le calmer. Le message que doit comprendre votre chien c’est que s’il est calme en présence du chat, il est récompensé.Si votre chat s’enfuit et se réfugie quelque part, c’est qu’il n’est pas encore prêt. Ne forcez surtout pas les choses, n’essayez surtout pas d’attraper le chat et de l’approcher du chien. Vous recommencerez l’opération plus tard.Faîtes également attention à votre énergie. Essayez de rester calme, les animaux ressentent votre stress et vous ne les aiderez pas en étant nerveux. Si vous utilisez une barrière, ils ne risquent rien, donc pas d’inquiétude.Si vous n’avez pas de barrière pour bébé, vous pouvez faire la même chose à deux. Une personne attire le chat avec des friandises et une autre personne s’occupe du chien en laisse pour qu’il reste calme. Là encore le chat doit pouvoir s’enfuir s’il le souhaite.Laissez patiemment les choses se faire, c’est votre chat qui donne le rythme. Si votre chien reste calme, votre chat finira par s’approcher et ils feront connaissance naturellement. Vous pourrez ensuite passer à une pièce plus grande sans barrière mais toujours avec votre chien attaché.Il faudra encore les surveiller quelques semaines. La cohabitation entre chien et chat prend du temps. Les instincts de votre chien peuvent se réveiller à tout moment, surtout si votre chat se met à s’enfuir. Donc pour le moment, ne les laissez pas dans la même pièce sans surveillance. Quand vous êtes là, gardez votre chien en laisse et faîtes en sorte qu’il reste calme en présence du chat.La durée pour qu’un chien et un chat s’apprivoisent peut varier mais je vous conseille de ne pas les laisser seuls sans surveillance pendant un bon mois car il y a parfois des rechutes.Comment rattraper un mauvais départ ?Vous ne vous êtes pas préparé pour l’arrivée d’un nouvel animal et vous avez raté les présentations ? Alors il va falloir tout reprendre à zéro. Les principes restent les mêmes, donner à votre chat un espace sécurisé et travailler avec votre chien.Vous allez pratiquer régulièrement (quelques minutes tous les jours) des exercices avec votre chien devant votre chat. Prenez quelques friandises et travaillez les ordres de bases avec votre chien ou votre chiot.Assis, couché, donner la patte, travaillez ce que vous voulez. Le principal est qu’il s’habitue à la présence du chat et qu’il soit concentré sur vous.Récompensez-le s’il fait bien les choses, au moindre mauvais comportement détournez son attention avec un jouet ou un ordre et récompensez-le.Evidemment si votre chien et votre chat se mettent à interagir récompensez-les (attention à ne pas faire de jaloux).Soyez patient et consistant, avec le temps votre chien et votre chat devrait s’habituer l’un à l’autre et mieux décrypter leur langage respectif. Une fois cette étape passée, la cohabitation entre chien et chat devient plus facile.Avec le temps, ils pourront s’ignorer et vivre en paix ou si vous avez de la chance devenir les meilleurs amis du monde !

TITRE: Tester le QI de son chien
CATÉGORIE: Non catégorisé
CONTENU:
J’adore tester les limites de mes chiens. C’est quelque chose qui m’amuse beaucoup, j’apprends à mieux les connaître, à mieux les comprendre, et je peux ensuite essayer de les faire évoluer dans le bon sens.C’est pour cette raison que tester le QI de son chien peut-être à la fois amusant et utile.Cette série de tests est donc parfaite pour connaître les points forts et les points faibles de son chien. Attention il ne faut pas prendre ces tests trop au sérieux, le but est de vous amuser et de partager un agréable moment avec votre chien. BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! Premier test : Avec ou sans patte ?Pour ce test vous aurez besoin d’un chronomètre, d’un canapé, d’une chaise ou d’un meuble suffisamment bas pour que votre chien ne puisse pas passer en dessous. Le but de ce test est de voir si votre chien va utiliser sa patte pour attraper un objet inaccessible.Placez un jouet sous le sofa, le meuble, la chaise… placez le assez loin pour qu’il ne puisse pas l’attraper avec sa tête et assez près pour qu’il puisse l’attraper avec sa patte. Faîtes en sorte que votre chien vous voit faire. Ensuite encouragez le à aller chercher le jouet.Si votre chien n’a pas de réaction son score est de zéro points.Si votre chien utilise sa tête sans essayer de la tourner ou de s’allonger, il marque 1 points.Si votre chien tourne la tête ou s’allonge pour passer en dessous mais n’utilise pas ses pattes il marque 2 points.Si votre chien utilise sa patte mais ne parvient pas à attraper le jouet, il marque 3 points.Si votre chien utilise sa patte et obtient le jouet en 30 secondes ou plus il marque 4 points.Si votre chien récupère le jouet en moins de 30 secondes il marque 5 points.Le lendemain recommencez l’exercice et si votre chien s’améliore donnez lui un point supplémentaire.

Deuxième test : Rien ne l’arrête !Cet exercice a pour but de voir si votre chien aura la présence d’esprit de contourner un obstacle. Pour ce test il vous faut une barrière ou un grillage entre vous et votre chien et il faut que votre chien vous voit à travers. N’importe quelle clôture de jardin peut faire l’affaire mais il faut qu’elle fasse une bonne douzaine de mètres.Pour distraire le chien lancez un jouet perpendiculairement à la barrière. Faîtes le tour sans que le chien ne vous voit. Vous êtes maintenant placé au centre de la barrière et celle-ci vous sépare de votre chien. Il ne vous reste plus qu’à l’appeler. Quand votre chien revient devant la barrière, démarrez le chronomètre. Si il n’a pas fait le tour après une minute faites quelques pas en direction du détour pour l’aider à vous rejoindre.Si votre chien ne fait rien après une minute même en lui indiquant la bonne direction, il marque 0 points.Si votre chien réussit à contourner l’obstacle mais avec votre aide, il marque 1 points.Si votre chien réussit entre 30 sec et 1 minutes, il marque 2 points.Si votre chien vous rejoint dans les 30 secondes, il marque 3 points.Si votre chien vous rejoint aussitôt il marque 4 points.Si votre chien ne l’avait jamais fait avant il marque 5 points.Troisième test : mémoire de chien…Cette fois vous allez tester la mémoire de votre chien. Dans un premier temps, vous allez cacher une friandise dans un endroit insolite (sous un meuble, derrière une porte, sous le paillasson, …), tout simplement un endroit ou votre chien ne s’attendra pas à trouver une friandise. Il faut que votre chien vous voit la cacher, ensuite laisser le renifler puis manger la friandise. Répétez cette première étape jusqu’à ce que votre chien ait bien compris le système Une fois qu’il a assimilé qu’il pouvait manger la friandise, le test va pouvoir commencer.Pour démarrer le test, posez une nouvelle friandise dans un nouvel endroit, là encore, laissez votre chien voir où vous la mettez. En revanche cette fois-ci ne laissez pas votre chien manger la friandise mais sortez le de la maison pour une minute.Une fois la minute passée, rentrez et observez si il va chercher la friandise. Pour marquer des points votre chien doit chercher la friandise des que vous rentrez, ça doit être instantané. Utilisez une nouvelle place à chaque fois et répétez pour 2 minutes, 3, 4 et enfin une heure.Si votre chien ne récupère aucune friandise il marque 0 points. Si après une minute de promenade il se jette sur la friandise il marque 1 points, après 2 minutes de promenade 2 points, après 3 minutes 3 points, 4 minutes 4 points, et enfin après une heure de promenade : 5 points.Quatrième test : Test de déductionPour ce dernier test il vous faut deux bols et des friandises. Demander à votre chien de s’asseoir, si vous n’avez pas encore dressé votre chien à l’ordre assis attachez le pour quelques minutes. Dans un premier temps vous allez frotter la friandise sur les deux bols pour qu’ils s’imprègnent de l’odeur.Ensuite le test se déroule en deux parties : une partie simple et une autre ou vous allez induire en erreur votre chien.Pour la première partie, placez une friandise sous l’un des bols (attendez que votre chien vous regarde, faîtes le manière très visible et n’hésitez pas à exagérer le geste). Ensuite éloignez vous des bols et appelez votre chien (ou détachez le).Si il se jette sur le bon bol relevez le bol et donnez lui la friandise. Si il choisit le mauvais laissez le venir au bon bol et donnez lui ensuite la friandise.Répétez une dizaine de fois en changeant l’emplacement de la friandise régulièrement et n’oubliez pas de noter les résultats de votre chien.Passons maintenant à la deuxième partie qui en général m’amuse beaucoup. Cette fois-ci vous allez simplement placer la friandise dans un des bols discrètement (sans exagération et en soulevant à peine le bol). Votre chien ne doit pas se rendre compte que vous avez placé la friandise dans le bol. Ensuite vous allez faire semblant de mettre une friandise dans l’autre bol (en répétant votre mise en scène du départ et en exagérant bien les mouvements). Libérez votre chien : va-t-il vers le bol vide ou celui contenant la friandise ? Répétez le test 10 fois et enregistrez les résultats.Si votre chien ne fait pas plus de 10/20 au deux tests, il marque 0 points.Si lors de la première partie du test votre chien démarre mal mais s’améliore et qu’il se trompe majoritairement sur la deuxième partie, attribué lui 1 points.Votre chien marque 2 points si il se trompe au début de la première partie et de la deuxième partie mais qu’il s’améliore au fur et à mesure.Si votre chien fait 10/10 à la première partie mais ne réussit pas la deuxième, il marque 3 points.Si votre chien fait 10/10 au premier test et qu’il s’améliore au fur et à mesure de la seconde partie du test, il marque 4 points.Si votre chien fait 10/10 au premier test et qu’il s’améliore au fur et à mesure de la seconde partie du test, il marque 4 points.Résultat: Quel est le QI de votre chien ?16 à 20 votre chien est très intelligent10 à 15 votre chien est un petit malin6 à 9 votre chien est dans la moyenne, à vous de l’aider à s’améliorer0 à 5 votre chien a besoin de plus d’attention, amusez vous et entrainez le plus souventVous connaissez maintenant le QI de votre chien et j’espère que vous et votre chien vous êtes bien amusés.Observer son chien confronté à un problème est souvent très drôle. Mais c’est aussi un très bon moyen de l’entrainer et de lui permettre de s’épanouir.Si votre chien a des problèmes de mémoire, répétez le test le plus souvent possible et vous verrez qu’il s’améliorera.N’oubliez pas, gardez à l’esprit que pour dresser son chien ou tester son QI la règle d’or est de vous amuser et de partager un agréable moment avec votre chien.Alors n’hésitez pas à mettre votre chien face à des situations inattendues et surtout amusez vous bien… Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour !

TITRE: Les besoins nutritionnels de votre chien
CATÉGORIE: Non catégorisé
CONTENU:
Bien comprendre les besoins nutritionnels de votre chien est très important. La nourriture joue un rôle primordial sur sa santé. Le chien est un omnivore, ce qui veut dire qu’il peut manger n’importe quelle nourriture (je ne tiens pas compte des chaussures ou tout autre objet que votre chien a l’habitude de manger ;-).Pour répondre aux besoins nutritionnels de votre chien il faut que son alimentation soit répartie en 6 groupes alimentaires.C’est la clef d’une alimentation équilibrée et d’un chien en pleine forme ! BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! De l’eau pour votre chienDe l’eau, de l’air, la vie ! C’est vrai pour vous et c’est aussi vrai pour votre chien. L’eau représente 60 à 70% du poids d’un chien adulte.Une partie des besoins en eau de votre chien se trouve dans sa nourriture (la nourriture en boite contient environ 78% d’eau et la nourriture sèche environ 10%).Il est donc primordial que votre chien ait accès à de l’eau fraîche (je ne parle pas de température, simplement renouvelez tous les jours la gamelle d’eau de votre chien).Petite précision pour ceux qui sont en train d’apprendre la propreté à leur chiot : vous pouvez surveiller et limiter la quantité d’eau que votre chiot absorbe (donner lui de l’eau à des moments spécifiques comme après la balade par exemple).En cas de forte chaleur ne prenez pas de risques, un chien se déshydrate rapidement (vous pouvez également lui mettre un glaçon à la place de l’eau, il l’absorbera plus lentement). Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! Des protéines pour votre chienLes protéines sont également très importantes pour votre chien. Elles vont lui fournir les acides aminés nécessaires au bon développement de son corps. Les protéines contiennent 23 acides aminés dont 10 sont essentiels pour la bonne santé de votre chien. Les autres sont également importants mais votre chien peut les fabriquer lui même.Généralement, on considère que les protéines animales sont plus intéressantes pour votre chien que les protéines végétales.Des minéraux pour votre chienLes minéraux n’ont aucune valeur énergétique mais ils font partie des besoins alimentaires de votre chien. Ils doivent être présents dans l’alimentation de votre chien car contrairement à certains acides aminés, les chiens ne peuvent pas les produire.Le fer, le magnésium, le zinc, le calcium vont permettre des réactions métaboliques assurant ainsi le bon fonctionnement de l’organisme de votre chien.Par exemple, sans minéraux dans son alimentation votre chien n’aura pas les os solides. Ils participent également à la bonne santé des dents de votre chien qui est un élément crucial pour lui et sa longévité (n’oubliez pas de brosser les dents de votre chien régulièrement et les vôtres aussi ;-).De la graisse pour votre chien Si votre chien n’a pas une belle peau ou une belle fourrure, surveillez ses besoins en graisse. La graisse a non seulement un rôle énergétique mais elle permet aussi à votre chien d’absorber certains vitamines qui se dissolvent dans la graisse.Autre point important, les chiens aiment les graisses. C’est très bien de répondre à ses besoins alimentaires mais il faut aussi prendre du plaisir dans tout ça ! Attention tout de même aux excès.La nourriture industrielle est généralement adaptée aux besoins de vos chiens mais attention aux petites friandises qui sont souvent un peu plus riches.Surtout si vous utilisez la nourriture pour le éduquer votre chien, n’oubliez pas de diminuer les quantités aux repas.Des vitamines pour votre chienVotre chien a besoin de vitamines, tout comme vous. Ils participent au bon fonctionnement de l’organisme ils sont indispensables aux échanges vitaux.Votre chien ne peut pas les synthétiser lui même, mais rassurez-vous si son alimentation est équilibrée, il aura les vitamines dont il a besoin.Inutile de donner des suppléments de vitamine à votre chien sauf si votre chien a une déficience et que votre vétérinaire vous le demande. Contrairement à ce qu’on pourrait croire, trop de vitamines peut être dangereux.Des glucides pour votre chienLes glucides sont le dernier élément des besoins nutritionnels de votre chien. Ils n’ont pas toujours bonne réputation et pourtant ils sont une aide précieuse pour le corps de votre chien.Ils permettent de conserver les intestins de votre chien en bon état et d’éviter des diarrhées ou constipation. Ils fournissent également de l’énergie aux tissus ce qui permet à votre chien de conserver ses protéines et de les utiliser à bon escient.Comme pour les graisses il faut contrôler et gérer les quantités, mise à part ça les glucides font partie intégrante des besoins nutritionnels de votre chien.

J’ai beau côtoyer des chiens depuis des années, ils ne cesseront jamais de me surprendre !D’après de nombreuses études, le chien pourrait être l’avenir du dépistage du cancer.

Un chien qui détecte le cancerEn 2011 l’armée française avait dressé un berger malinois à détecter le cancer de la prostate. Il suffisait au chien de renifler des échantillons d’urine pour établir le diagnostique.Avec un taux de réussite de 91%, le berger malinois avait surpris la communauté scientifique.En 2014, l’Instituto Clinico Humanitas de Milan a réussi à démontrer que la truffe d’un chien était plus efficace pour dépister le cancer de la prostate que le test médicale utilisé de nos jours.Incroyable d’imaginer qu’un chien bien dressé puisse surpasser la précision de certains tests médicaux ! Alors certains scientifiques ont voulu pousser les recherches un peu plus loin.Les tests ont toujours été réalisés sur des personnes saines ou atteintes d’un cancer. Une nouvelle étude a pour but de savoir si un chien peut différencier des cellules bénignes et des cellules cancéreuses. Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! Une précision diagnostique remarquableCette nouvelle étude de la faculté de médecine de l’Arkansas ont recruté 34 personnes dont 15 atteintes d’un cancer et 19 d’une tumeur bénigne. Ils ont ensuite fait appel à un berger allemand spécialement dressé pour participer à cette étude.Dans 88% des cas le berger allemand a réussi à différencier les cellules bénignes des cellules malignes ! Ce qui veut dire que la truffe d’un chien peut non seulement permettre de détecter la présence de cellules tumorales mais aussi permettre de savoir si le cancer existe déjà ou non.D’autres études doivent encore être réalisées mais il y a fort à parier que très prochainement les chiens faciliteront le dépistages du cancer et permettront limiter le nombre d’interventions chirurgicales inutiles.Jusqu’où ira le dressage du chienLes résultats de ces études montrent à quel point la truffe d’un chien est développée. Elles montrent aussi à quel point le dressage d’un chien peut aller loin.Le dressage d’un chien renifleur prend beaucoup de temps mais les résultats sont vraiment surprenants. Avec des techniques simples et de la patience ont peut dresser un chien à faire des choses incroyables !Je suis sûr qu’il reste encore beaucoup de choses à découvrir sur les chiens et qu’ils n’ont pas fini de nous surprendre.Je suis également sûr que chaque découverte à venir sera une occasion supplémentaire de constater que le chien reste le meilleur ami de l’homme !

Difficile de résister à son chien, difficile de l’ignorer même quand on a des choses à faire. Surtout lorsqu’il vient de débarquer chez vous.On peut très rapidement donner de mauvaises habitudes à son chien. C’est pour cette raison que de nombreux maîtres rencontrent des problèmes d’attention avec leurs chiens lorsqu’ils ont moins de temps à leur consacrer.Pour éviter les futurs problèmes d’attention et dresser votre chien correctement, il y a quelques règles à suivre… BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! Les erreurs face aux demandes d’attention de votre chienGardez le contrôle ! Vous êtes le leader, pas votre chien. C’est l’une des bases pour dresser son chien correctement. C’est donc à vous de choisir le moment ou vous voulez donner de l’attention à votre chien.Quand votre chien vient chercher de l’attention ne lui donnez pas systématiquement. Je sais que c’est difficile et on a tendance à répondre positivement à toutes les demandes de son chien.Mais c’est une erreur et souvenez vous que vous ne lui rendez pas service en le faisant. Donc de temps en temps ne lui donnez pas l’attention qu’il réclame.C’est très facile à faire, il vous suffit de ne pas le regarder, lui parler ou le toucher.Vous pouvez également lui tourner le dos et si il insiste un peu trop n’hésitez pas à quitter la pièce. Votre chien comprendra très bien le message et rassurez vous il reviendra vers vous très bientôt ;-)Evidemment dans la plupart des cas vous lui donnerez l’attention dont il a besoin, mais là encore il y a une manière de le faire qui vous permet de garder le contrôle des choses… Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! La bonne attitude face aux demandes d’attention de votre chienVous avez peut-être tendance à jouer avec votre chien pendant des heures jusqu’à ce qu’il soit fatigué ?De temps en temps faîtes l’inverse. Prenez la décision de mettre fin au jeu. Laissez votre chien seul, ne le regardez pas, et quittez la pièce.Là encore ne vous trompez pas votre chien ne sera pas vexé il comprendra que son maître n’a plus envie de jouer (les chiens sont moins caractériels que les humains ;-).L’un des problèmes que rencontrent certains maîtres est le « vol ». Si votre chien aime prendre des choses qui vous appartiennent pour vous faire courir, alors vous avez un problème d’attention.Quand on souhaite dresser son chien on apprend très vite qu’il fonctionne par association. Si vous lui courez après lorsqu’il vole un de vos objets votre chien apprend qu’il peut gagner votre attention avec cette méthode et donc il continuera à voler des objets.Pour éviter les problèmes de demande d’attention, il est préférable de ne pas laissez votre chien vous suivre à la trace dans la maison. L’idéal est de délimiter l’espace de liberté de votre chien (voir article préparer sa maison pour l’arrivée d’un chien).C’est d’une part très utile pour habituer votre chien à la solitude de temps en temps et c’est également très pratique puisqu’il ne pourra pas vous réclamer de l’attention toute la journée (ça vous évitera surtout de craquer et de lui donner trop d’attention ;-)N’oubliez pas que votre chien fonctionne par association, c’est la base du dressage.Donc si vous avez ignoré votre chien lorsqu’il est venu vous demander de l’attention, attendez patiemment qu’il passe à autre chose avant de retourner jouer avec lui.Attendez qu’il joue seul, ou qu’il soit dans son panier et jetez vous sur lui pour le plus gros câlin de la journée !Soyez fort ! Ne craquez pas même si votre chien vous demande de l’attention Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour !

Le dressage d’un chien n’est pas toujours facile et pour certains les choses peuvent devenir très compliquées.Alors tant qu’à faire autant choisir une race de chien qui sera facile à dresser. Une race qui comprendra rapidement ce qu’il peut et ne peut pas faire.Voici selon moi les races de chien les plus faciles à dresser…Le labrador retriever Le labrador retriever est une race de chien très facile à dresser. Cette race est particulièrement adaptée si vous avez des enfants. Bien dressés, ils font également de très bons chiens de chasse.Le berger allemand Le berger allemand est évidemment dans mon top 10 des chiens les plus faciles à dresser. Un berger allemand sera à la fois un très bon chien de compagnie mais aussi un merveilleux chien de garde.Le golden retriever Comment résister à un Golden Retriever ? Cette race de chien est magnifique et également très facile à dresser. Vous pourrez faire de nombreuses activités avec cette race. Votre chien mérite le meilleur départ !

Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! Facile de dresser son chien Ce classement des races les plus faciles à dresser est évidemment personnel.Je suis sur qu’en lisant cette liste vous avez sûrement pensé à un caniche qui semblait difficile de caractère ou un labrador qui effectivement était parfaitement dressé.Il y a plusieurs raisons à cela. D’abord chaque chien est unique. Il est vrai que sa race influe mais beaucoup plus sur les caractéristiques physiques que sur le dressage.La seconde raison beaucoup plus importante : chaque maître est unique.C’est en effet le maître qui est responsable du dressage d’un chien. Si vous n’avez aucune connaissance sur le comportement d’un chien, si vous ne savez pas comment communiquer avec lui et lui expliquer clairement ce que vous attendez de lui il y a de fortes chances que vous ne puissiez pas l’éduquer correctement.Dans ces conditions, vous pouvez étudier toutes les listes des chiens faciles à dresser et choisir celui qui obtient les meilleures positions, vous aurez toujours beaucoup de mal à l’éduquer.Ce n’est pas le meilleur critère pour choisir un chien, vous devriez plutôt étudier votre mode de vie : le temps que vous pourrez consacrer à votre chien, beaucoup d’activité ou plutôt calme, beaucoup d’espace ou petit appartement en ville…Une fois que vous aurez trouvé un chien qui correspond à votre mode de vie, il ne vous restera plus qu’à apprendre comment l’éduquer avec des bonnes méthodes comme celle-ci : Dresser son chien en 15 minutes par jour Votre chien mérite le meilleur départ !

Je rencontre régulièrement des maîtres transportant leur chien en voiture sans aucune protection.En cas de choc à 50km/h un petit chien de 10 kg qui n’est pas attaché devient un projectile de 250kg qui va traverser l’habitacle de votre voiture !Il existe maintenant des accessoires qui permettent de voyager en voiture avec son chien en toute sécurité.Ne jouez pas avec la sécurité de votre chien ni avec celle de votre entourage, transportez votre chien en voiture de manière sécurisée… BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! Les différentes méthodes pour transporter un chien en voiture La ceinture de sécurité pour chienLa ceinture de sécurité pour chien est le minimum que vous puissiez faire pour transporter votre chien en voiture.En cas de contrôle de police vous éviterez une amende et il peut également éviter les accidents liés à un chien qui deviendrait incontrôlable en voiture.Vous trouverez ce type de ceinture de sécurité en ligne pour seulement quelques euros.Au niveau sécurité, ne vous faîtes aucune illusion, ce type de ceinture n’a aucun intérêt. Il est évident que l’attache coté collier ne supportera pas la pression en cas d’accident et que votre chien finira dans le pare-brise ou dans le siège conducteur ou passager.Le harnais pour transporter son chien en voitureLe harnais de sécurité pour chien est un produit un peu plus performant.Mais comme pour la ceinture de sécurité je ne leur fais pas confiance.Je trouve dommage que ce type de produit n’affiche pas clairement leur performance en cas de choc (et ce n’est surement pas un hasard).Bref je vous conseille avant d’acheter un harnais de bien observer chaque pièce qui le compose et surtout celles qui sont attachées à la ceinture et celles qui font le lien entre le harnais et la ceinture.Si ça ne ressemble pas à un véritable mousqueton passez votre chemin. Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! La caisse de transport pour transporter son chienLa caisse de transport pour chien reste la meilleure méthode pour transporter son chien en toute sécurité dans votre voiture.Attention il ne faut pas la placer sur le siège passager même si vous l’attachez avec la ceinture de sécurité. En cas de choc la caisse va se briser sous la pression de la ceinture et le chien sera expulsé.En revanche si la taille de votre caisse vous le permet vous pouvez la caler entre la banquette et le siège avant.Sinon la meilleure solution pour transporter votre chien : mettre la caisse de transport dans le coffre, bien calé contre un coté.De cette manière votre chien et vos passagers seront en sécurité.Autre point non négligeable, si les pompiers ou des passants viennent à votre secours après un accident, il est préférable que votre chien soit dans une caisse de transport. Un chien en liberté et en état de choc peut-être un sérieux problème.Encore trop de maîtres son réticent à l’idée d’enfermer leur chien dans une caisse de transport mais sachez que pour un chien c’est un espace rassurant, surtout quand on part en voyage. Il suffit de dresser son chien pour l’habituer à la voiture comme à la caisse de transport.Que dit la loi sur les chiens en voiture ? On me pose souvent la question : est-ce obligatoire d’attacher son chien en voiture ?Le code de la route oblige le conducteur ainsi que les passager d’un véhicule à porter une ceinture de sécurité (article R412-1).Il précise également que les possibilités de mouvement et le champ de vision d’un conducteur ne doivent pas être réduit par des passagers ou objets transportés (article R412-6).Donc si en cas de contrôle votre chien est en liberté dans votre voiture, le principe de précaution prévaut, et vous risquez une amende de 2ème classe car votre chien est un risque potentiel d’entrave à la liberté de vos mouvements ou de votre champ de vision.Même le meilleur éducateur canin peut dresser son chien à prendre la voiture mais il ne peut pas garantir à 100% les réactions de son chien.Les forces de l’ordre peuvent également considérer votre chien comme un passager non attaché, auquel cas vous écoperez en plus d’une amende de 4ème classe.Mais peu importe ce que dit la loi, transporter un chien en voiture n’est pas un acte anodin et il faut prendre un maximum de précautions pour vous, vos passagers et votre chien.Transportez votre chien en voiture en toute sécurité… Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour !

Vous cherchez une bonne raison d’arrêter de fumer ? Ou peut-être d’encourager quelqu’un à arrêter de fumer ? Alors en voici une de plus : arrêter de fumer est bon pour votre santé mais aussi pour celle de votre chien !Je sais à quel point il est difficile d’arrêter de fumer (et de ne pas reprendre), je ne tiens pas à lancer la pierre aux fumeurs mais je sais que le moindre argument peut peser dans la balance pour prendre la bonne décision.Les effets du tabac sur un chien sont terribles et je suis sûr que sauver la vie de votre chien pèsera très lourd dans la balance ! BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! Moi et le tabacJe n’aime pas raconter ma vie mais quand il s’agit d’aider certains maîtres fumeurs et leur chien, la pudeur n’a pas sa place.J’ai été fumeur pendant de nombreuses années et j’ai eu beaucoup de mal à arrêter.Arrêter de fumer est une démarche personnelle et personne ne peut prendre la décision à votre place ni vous contraindre à le faire.Ce n’est pas le propos de cet article. Je préfère partager avec vous ce qui m’a aidé à arrêter et qui m’aide encore aujourd’hui à ne pas reprendre.Par exemple, pour arrêter je me suis fait un calendrier avec le jour où j’allai arrêter et les futures dates importantes.J’avais noté par exemple qu’au bout de 24H je n’avais plus de nicotine dans le corps, au bout de 48H mon goût s’améliore, au bout de 2 semaines mon souffle commence à s’améliorer…J’avais également noté des messages d’encouragement personnel pour me rappeler que ma famille était en meilleure forme, que mon chien n’avait plus à subir mon odeur de fumeur, combien j’avais économisé…Si vous souhaitez arrêter de fumer je vous encourage vivement à le faire. Les arguments sont nombreux (santé, économie, hygiène de vie…).C’est le but de cet article vous fournir un argument supplémentaire pour arrêter de fumer, le jour où vous l’aurez enfin décidé (le plus tôt possible sera le mieux ;-).Passons maintenant aux choses concrètes : les effets du tabac sur votre chien. Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! Le tabagisme passif et votre chienLe tabagisme passif est associé à de nombreuses maladies pour les êtres humains.Cancer, arrêts cardiaques, asthme, mort subite… la liste est longue.La fumée contient beaucoup de substances toxiques comme le benzène ou le formaldehyde.Elle reste dangereuse pour tout être humain qui la respire et il paraît logique qu’elle le soit aussi pour nos chiens.En réalité, il semble même que les effets du tabac sur un chien soient encore pire.Le problème c’est qu’un chien va passer une bonne partie de sa journée coincé à la maison dans un air pollué par son maître.Depuis plusieurs années, les vétérinaires et autres experts ont suspecté que les chiens ayant un maître fumeur sont plus souvent touchés par des maladies respiratoires et des cancers. Aujourd’hui, il y a désormais suffisamment de données pour le prouver.Une étude sur les effets du tabac sur votre chienUne étude a prouvé que les chiens vivant avec un fumeur sont plus souvent atteint de cancer des sinus et de tumeurs aux naseaux.Les races de chiens ayant un long museau (berger allemand, golden retriever) sont particulièrement touchées.Malheureusement un chien qui contracte cette maladie ne survivra pas plus d’un an.Mais les races de chiens ayant un petit museau ne sont pas épargnées non plus.Du fait de leur petit museau, les particules cancéreuses vont atteindre plus facilement leurs poumons.Un bulldog ou un boxer aura donc plus de chance de contracter un cancer des poumons.Une autre étude a également constaté qu’un chiot vivant avec un fumeur aura 60% plus de risque de contracter un cancer des poumons.Que faire en attendant d’arrêter de fumer ?Vous n’avez peut-être pas encore prévu d’arrêter de fumer mais en attendant il y a quelques solutions simples qui peuvent aider vos proches et votre chien.La première chose à faire est de fumer dehors ce qui permettra de limiter la quantité de fumée que vous partagerez avec ceux qui ne vous ont rien demandé ;-)Vous pouvez également passez à la cigarette électronique.Il n’y a pas d’étude assez poussée sur le sujet mais personnellement je pense que c’est toujours mieux qu’une cigarette.Il existe beaucoup de marques, de goûts et de puissances différentes, vous trouverez forcément quelque chose qui vous convient. Allez dans un magasin et faîtes des tests, je connais beaucoup de personnes qui ont réussi à arrêter avec ça.Vous pouvez également investir dans un purificateur d’air. Attention ce purificateur d’air est efficace pour les odeurs et une partie des particules nocives du tabac mais il ne peut pas non plus faire des miracles (la fumée de cigarette contient 4700 substances nocives et aucune étude ne prouve qu’un purificateur élimine toutes ces particules).Changer de vêtement le plus régulièrement possible et lavez vous les mains avant de toucher votre chien, surtout si vous venez de fumer.Sachez également que la nicotine est un danger de mort pour votre chien, donc vider votre cendrier et ne le laissez jamais à portée de votre chien.Evidemment la meilleure chose à faire est d’arrêter mais ça c’est à vous de voir. Si vous choisissez de le faire, vous avez tout mon soutien et celui de votre chien !Partagez cet article si vous connaissez quelqu’un qui fume et qui a un chien, ça peut aider !

C’est toujours passionnant qu’en la science nous permet de comprendre certains phénomène de notre quotidien comme par exemple la fréquente ressemblance entre un chien et son maître.Il est maintenant prouvé que cette ressemblance est physique mais aussi psychologique.Encore plus surprenant, avec le temps, le comportement d’un chien et de son maître s’influence mutuellement ce qui accentue les ressemblances… Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! Ressemblances physiques entre un chien et son maîtreCette ressemblance est assez logique : nous sommes attiré par ce qui nous ai familier.Quand nous sommes en face d’une situation familière, nous savons comment réagir ce qui nous rassure et nous réconforte.C’est la même chose pour un chien et plus particulièrement lorsqu’il s’agit de choisir un chien.Un chien avec des traits physiques communs aux nôtres nous donne inconsciemment l’impression qu’il fait déjà parti de la famille.Cette ressemblance va automatiquement nous mettre en confiance, le chien va donc nous paraître plus beau, plus affectueux…Choisir un chien se joue à peu de chose, c’est souvent une affaire de feeling.Ce genre de petit détail peut avoir une grande influence sur le choix final et c’est ce qui explique le grand nombre de chien qui ressemble à leurs maîtres et c’est peut-être ce qui explique pourquoi votre chien vous ressemble ;-)Ressemblances psychologiques entre un chien et son maître Encore plus surprenant : les ressemblances entre un chien et son maître ne se limitent pas qu’au physique. Une étude a été réalisée sur 389 maîtres et 518 chiens pour vérifier dans quelle mesure nous ressemblons psychologiquement à nos chiens.Chaque maître a répondu à un questionnaire permettant d’établir son profil suivant 5 critères psychologiques. Ensuite les maîtres ont remplis un questionnaire équivalent pour leurs chiens. Ils ont donc eux-mêmes évalués la personnalité de leurs chiens.A ce stade de l’étude, les résultats montrent que les 5 critères psychologiques sont identiques entre un chien et son maître. Mais comment être sur que ce ne sont pas tout simplement les maîtres qui projettent leurs personnalités sur leurs chiens ?Pour en avoir le cœur net, les scientifiques ont fait appel à l’entourage des maîtres et leur ont demandé à leur tour d’évaluer le chien. Les résultats montrent que 4 des critères psychologique restent communs au chien et au maître !Là encore le coté familier aurait une influence sur notre choix. Au moment de choisir notre chien, nous nous dirigeons consciemment ou inconsciemment vers un chien ayant des traits de personnalité communs aux nôtres.Influence mutuelle entre un maître et son chienUn dernier élément accentue la ressemblance entre un chien et son maître : le temps. Un chien et son maître passe plusieurs années ensemble et finissent pas s’influencer mutuellement.Si vous dressez votre chien vous allez lui transmettre certains comportements de façon volontaire. Mais ça n’est pas tout, votre chien vous observe, il apprend, enregistre vos humeurs, vos préférences, vos peurs, à votre insu…Avec le temps il finit par les partager et par avoir des réactions similaires aux vôtres.De la même façon un chien a lui aussi son tempérament, ses peurs et ses angoisses et lui aussi il vous transmet une partie de sa personnalité.Cette influence mutuelle entre un maître et son chien peut être un avantage et un inconvénient.Une personne ayant quelques difficultés à s’ouvrir aux autres sera influencée de manière positive par un chien très sociable et elle finira par comprendre qu’aller vers les autres peut aussi être positif.Inversement un chien très calme chez un maître anxieux peut devenir à son tour très nerveux.Maintenant vous savez pourquoi un chien ressemble souvent à son maître… Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour !

Le tabagisme passif et votre chienLe tabagisme passif est associé à de nombreuses maladies pour les êtres humains.Cancer, arrêts cardiaques, asthme, mort subite… la liste est longue.La fumée contient beaucoup de substances toxiques comme le benzène ou le formaldehyde.Elle reste dangereuse pour tout être humain qui la respire et il paraît logique qu’elle le soit aussi pour nos chiens.En réalité, il semble même que les effets du tabac sur un chien soient encore pire.Le problème c’est qu’un chien va passer une bonne partie de sa journée coincé à la maison dans un air pollué par son maître.Depuis plusieurs années, les vétérinaires et autres experts ont suspecté que les chiens ayant un maître fumeur sont plus souvent touchés par des maladies respiratoires et des cancers. Aujourd’hui, il y a désormais suffisamment de données pour le prouver.Une étude sur les effets du tabac sur votre chienUne étude a prouvé que les chiens vivant avec un fumeur sont plus souvent atteint de cancer des sinus et de tumeurs aux naseaux.Les races de chiens ayant un long museau (berger allemand, golden retriever) sont particulièrement touchées.Malheureusement un chien qui contracte cette maladie ne survivra pas plus d’un an.Mais les races de chiens ayant un petit museau ne sont pas épargnées non plus.Du fait de leur petit museau, les particules cancéreuses vont atteindre plus facilement leurs poumons.Un bulldog ou un boxer aura donc plus de chance de contracter un cancer des poumons.Une autre étude a également constaté qu’un chiot vivant avec un fumeur aura 60% plus de risque de contracter un cancer des poumons.Que faire en attendant d’arrêter de fumer ?Vous n’avez peut-être pas encore prévu d’arrêter de fumer mais en attendant il y a quelques solutions simples qui peuvent aider vos proches et votre chien.La première chose à faire est de fumer dehors ce qui permettra de limiter la quantité de fumée que vous partagerez avec ceux qui ne vous ont rien demandé ;-)Vous pouvez également passez à la cigarette électronique.Il n’y a pas d’étude assez poussée sur le sujet mais personnellement je pense que c’est toujours mieux qu’une cigarette.Il existe beaucoup de marques, de goûts et de puissances différentes, vous trouverez forcément quelque chose qui vous convient. Allez dans un magasin et faîtes des tests, je connais beaucoup de personnes qui ont réussi à arrêter avec ça.Vous pouvez également investir dans un purificateur d’air. Attention ce purificateur d’air est efficace pour les odeurs et une partie des particules nocives du tabac mais il ne peut pas non plus faire des miracles (la fumée de cigarette contient 4700 substances nocives et aucune étude ne prouve qu’un purificateur élimine toutes ces particules).Changer de vêtement le plus régulièrement possible et lavez vous les mains avant de toucher votre chien, surtout si vous venez de fumer.Sachez également que la nicotine est un danger de mort pour votre chien, donc vider votre cendrier et ne le laissez jamais à portée de votre chien.Evidemment la meilleure chose à faire est d’arrêter mais ça c’est à vous de voir. Si vous choisissez de le faire, vous avez tout mon soutien et celui de votre chien !Partagez cet article si vous connaissez quelqu’un qui fume et qui a un chien, ça peut aider !

Bien comprendre les besoins nutritionnels de votre chien est très important. La nourriture joue un rôle primordial sur sa santé. Le chien est un omnivore, ce qui veut dire qu’il peut manger n’importe quelle nourriture (je ne tiens pas compte des chaussures ou tout autre objet que votre chien a l’habitude de manger ;-).Pour répondre aux besoins nutritionnels de votre chien il faut que son alimentation soit répartie en 6 groupes alimentaires.C’est la clef d’une alimentation équilibrée et d’un chien en pleine forme ! BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! De l’eau pour votre chienDe l’eau, de l’air, la vie ! C’est vrai pour vous et c’est aussi vrai pour votre chien. L’eau représente 60 à 70% du poids d’un chien adulte.Une partie des besoins en eau de votre chien se trouve dans sa nourriture (la nourriture en boite contient environ 78% d’eau et la nourriture sèche environ 10%).Il est donc primordial que votre chien ait accès à de l’eau fraîche (je ne parle pas de température, simplement renouvelez tous les jours la gamelle d’eau de votre chien).Petite précision pour ceux qui sont en train d’apprendre la propreté à leur chiot : vous pouvez surveiller et limiter la quantité d’eau que votre chiot absorbe (donner lui de l’eau à des moments spécifiques comme après la balade par exemple).En cas de forte chaleur ne prenez pas de risques, un chien se déshydrate rapidement (vous pouvez également lui mettre un glaçon à la place de l’eau, il l’absorbera plus lentement). Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! Des protéines pour votre chienLes protéines sont également très importantes pour votre chien. Elles vont lui fournir les acides aminés nécessaires au bon développement de son corps. Les protéines contiennent 23 acides aminés dont 10 sont essentiels pour la bonne santé de votre chien. Les autres sont également importants mais votre chien peut les fabriquer lui même.Généralement, on considère que les protéines animales sont plus intéressantes pour votre chien que les protéines végétales.Des minéraux pour votre chienLes minéraux n’ont aucune valeur énergétique mais ils font partie des besoins alimentaires de votre chien. Ils doivent être présents dans l’alimentation de votre chien car contrairement à certains acides aminés, les chiens ne peuvent pas les produire.Le fer, le magnésium, le zinc, le calcium vont permettre des réactions métaboliques assurant ainsi le bon fonctionnement de l’organisme de votre chien.Par exemple, sans minéraux dans son alimentation votre chien n’aura pas les os solides. Ils participent également à la bonne santé des dents de votre chien qui est un élément crucial pour lui et sa longévité (n’oubliez pas de brosser les dents de votre chien régulièrement et les vôtres aussi ;-).De la graisse pour votre chien Si votre chien n’a pas une belle peau ou une belle fourrure, surveillez ses besoins en graisse. La graisse a non seulement un rôle énergétique mais elle permet aussi à votre chien d’absorber certains vitamines qui se dissolvent dans la graisse.Autre point important, les chiens aiment les graisses. C’est très bien de répondre à ses besoins alimentaires mais il faut aussi prendre du plaisir dans tout ça ! Attention tout de même aux excès.La nourriture industrielle est généralement adaptée aux besoins de vos chiens mais attention aux petites friandises qui sont souvent un peu plus riches.Surtout si vous utilisez la nourriture pour le éduquer votre chien, n’oubliez pas de diminuer les quantités aux repas.Des vitamines pour votre chienVotre chien a besoin de vitamines, tout comme vous. Ils participent au bon fonctionnement de l’organisme ils sont indispensables aux échanges vitaux.Votre chien ne peut pas les synthétiser lui même, mais rassurez-vous si son alimentation est équilibrée, il aura les vitamines dont il a besoin.Inutile de donner des suppléments de vitamine à votre chien sauf si votre chien a une déficience et que votre vétérinaire vous le demande. Contrairement à ce qu’on pourrait croire, trop de vitamines peut être dangereux.Des glucides pour votre chienLes glucides sont le dernier élément des besoins nutritionnels de votre chien. Ils n’ont pas toujours bonne réputation et pourtant ils sont une aide précieuse pour le corps de votre chien.Ils permettent de conserver les intestins de votre chien en bon état et d’éviter des diarrhées ou constipation. Ils fournissent également de l’énergie aux tissus ce qui permet à votre chien de conserver ses protéines et de les utiliser à bon escient.Comme pour les graisses il faut contrôler et gérer les quantités, mise à part ça les glucides font partie intégrante des besoins nutritionnels de votre chien.

TITRE: Dresser son chien à marcher en laisse
CATÉGORIE: Non catégorisé
CONTENU:
Les promenades sont pour les chiens un moment de joie intense ! Mais pour éviter qu’elles ne deviennent infernales pour leurs maîtres, mieux vaut dresser son chien à marcher en laisse sans tirer.Votre chien a tendance à tirer sur sa laisse, à aller de l’avant et à vous devancer, à tirer à droite à gauche pour aller jouer ou à traîner le nez par terre à la recherche de bonnes odeurs ?Voici quelques astuces pour éviter que ce ne soit votre chien qui vous promène en laisse. BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Harnais anti traction idéal pour apprendre à marcher en laisse. Seulement 22€ ! 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! Avant de commencer l’apprentissage de la marche en laissePour attaquer les exercices qui suivent, il est indispensable que votre chien soit déjà parfaitement habitué à porter un collier et une laisse.En effet, votre chien doit avoir un rapport amical et confiant avec sa laisse le plus rapidement possible. Il ne doit pas la ressentir comme une contrainte. La laisse est en quelque sorte le prolongement de la main du maître.Par conséquent, on ne le rappellera jamais assez, il est interdit de taper le chien avec la laisse (même pour rire), de laisser votre chien jouer avec ou de la ronger (lui laisseriez-vous ronger votre bras ?).Autre point important, il vous faut une laisse basique d’un peu plus d’un mètre. Oubliez les enrouleurs pour le moment. Vous devez sentir votre chien au bout de la laisse et il doit également vous sentir.Le bon endroit pour dresser son chien à marcher en laisseEvitez dès la première fois de sortir votre chien dans des rues très passantes ou bruyantes, ceci afin d’éviter de cumuler toutes les difficultés dès le départ.Votre chien doit pouvoir rester un minimum concentré les premières fois pour suivre vos indications. Les passants qui caressent votre chien, les bruits des voitures, le jeu avec les enfants sont autant de distractions pour le chien.Allez-y progressivement, vous pouvez commencer par votre appartement, dans la cour de l’immeuble, dans votre jardin puis passez à une rue calme, puis une rue agitée, puis une rue en heure de pointe, etc.Pour dresser son chien il faut démarrer en douceur et accentuer la difficulté petit à petit.Le bon positionnement du chien pour la marche en laisse Si vous préférez l’avoir sur le côté gauche, tenez la laisse de la main droite afin de libérer votre main gauche pour caresser le chien quand il exécute correctement l’exercice.Inversement, si vous préférez le côté droit, tenez la laisse de main gauche pour libérer votre main droite pour les caresses.Une fois que vous avez choisi un côté, évitez d’en changer sinon votre chien ne saura plus comment se placer par rapport à vous et vous aurez vite fait d’avoir un chien qui passera d’un côté à l’autre quand vous vous promenez !Eduquer son chien demande de la constance, donc soyez rigoureux et expliquez à toute personne qui promènera votre chien en laisse comment elle doit le faire.A vos marques ! Prêts ? Partez !… Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! Lorsque votre chien et vous êtes prêts, commencez à marcher à votre rythme en tenant la laisse de façon détendue pour avoir du mou entre votre main qui tient la laisse et le point d’attache du collier.La laisse détendue vous permettra d’exercer de petites tractions quand vous souhaitez ramener votre chien vers vous. Lorsque votre chien marche près de votre jambe, n’oubliez pas de le félicitez et le caresser pour le récompenser.Si votre chien traîne derrière, ne vous suit pas ou s’est arrêté appelez-le avec entrain pour capter son attention. Félicitez-le dès qu’il revient à votre niveau.En revanche si votre chien tire sur la laisse je vous recommande de lire et de pratiquer les exercices de cet article : Mon chien tire en laisse que faire ?Persistez et attirez son attention…S’il ne revient toujours pas, tapotez sur votre cuisse pour l’amener vers vous et attirez son attention s’il est trop distrait par les bruits de la rue. Traînez-le doucement s’il le faut mais il est inutile de tirer en permanence sur la laisse.S’il tire sur la laisse pour aller renifler à droite à gauche, donnez quelques coups brefs sur la laisse et l’ordre « Au pied ! ».Faîtes de même si votre chien tourne autour de vous, essaie de vous entortiller dans sa laisse, se retourne sans arrêt ou va de l’avant. S’il persiste, changez de direction. Allez à droite quand il veut aller à gauche. Faîtes demi-tour s’il vous devance.Dans tous les cas de figure dès que votre chien s’éloigne et que la laisse se tend, tirez-la d’un coup sec en lui précisant « Non, au pied !»Encouragez, félicitez-le… Dès que votre chien revient à vos pieds, détendez la laisse et caressez votre chien en n’oubliant pas de le féliciter « Au pied, c’est bien ! ». Le plus dur, gardez la laisse détendue…Votre chien doit comprendre qu’il y a une position confortable pour lui, qu’il doit garder un contact physique avec son maître : épaule du chien contre le genou du maître. Ce qu’il comprendra à chaque fois que vous tirez sur la laisse pour le rappeler à l’ordre.Le plus dur pour dresser son chien à marcher en laisse est de garder la laisse détendue. Sinon, votre chien ne peut pas faire autrement que de marcher à vos pieds puisqu’il sent la traction permanente de sa laisse.Des séances de marche en laisse courtes mais répétées…N’oubliez pas de faire des séances courtes mais répétées, environ quinze minutes deux à quatre fois par jour.Ces exercices ne doivent pas être une corvée pour votre chien mais rester naturels et agréables de sorte que votre chien y prenne plaisir.Vous pouvez par exemple pratiquer cet exercice avec votre chien lorsque vous le sortez pour ses besoins. Les meilleures techniques pour dresser son chien sont basées sur la répétition.Une bonne méthode de dressageSi vous rencontrez quelques problèmes pour dresser votre chien à marcher en laisse, rassurez-vous c’est parfaitement normal.Eduquer son chien n’a rien de naturel. Vous devez avant tout comprendre comment fonctionne votre chien et finalement apprendre à apprendre.Je vous propose d’apprendre tout ce que vous avez besoin de savoir pour avoir un chien parfaitement éduqué avec la formation Dresser son chien en 15 minutes par jour.Cette méthode efficace qui a déjà aider des milliers de maîtres et leurs chiens vous permettra d’acquérir toute la théorie pour bien comprendre comment fonctionne votre chien mais aussi de nombreux jeux/exercices à pratiquer quelques minutes par jour.Non seulement vous apprendrez la marche en laisse à votre chien mais vous apprendrez beaucoup d’autres choses !

TITRE: Offrir un chiot ou un chien à Noël
CATÉGORIE: Non catégorisé
CONTENU:
Avant d’offrir un chiot ou un chien pour Noël, il faut prendre quelques précautions. D’abord être sûr que la personne souhaite réellement avoir un chien et choisir le chien qui correspond à son rythme de vie.Autre point important dont vous êtes responsable : vous devez faire en sorte que le nouveau maître puisse accueillir son chien dans les meilleures conditions et c’est rarement le cas.Mais rassurez-vous, vous êtes entre de bonnes mains ! BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! Le plus beau cadeau de NoëlJe ne suis évidemment pas objectif mais pour moi, un chiot ou un chien, est le plus beau cadeau de Noël que l’on puisse faire. C’est un peu comme offrir une énorme dose d’amour à quelqu’un.L’arrivée d’un chiot ou d’un chien est un événement qui peu révolutionner une vie. Malheureusement chaque année, une bonne partie des chiots et chiens offerts à Noël ou à d’autres occasions finissent par être abandonnés.La raison est simple car un chien peut révolutionner une vie en bien mais il peut aussi créer quelques tracas. C’est donc à vous de faire en sorte que les choses se passent bien.Pour cela, il y a deux points essentiels dont vous devez vous occuper : bien choisir le chien et faire en sorte qu’il soit bien accueilli. Votre chien mérite le meilleur départ ! Ne ratez pas notre ebook essentiel⤹ Prénom * Email * Bien choisir un chienLa première chose à faire est de bien choisir le chien. Il faut être sûr que la personne veuille d’un chien et surtout qu’elle a conscience des responsabilités qui en découlent.Ensuite il faut choisir un chien qui correspond au mode de vie de la personne. Offrir un chien qui demande beaucoup d’activités à une personne ayant des problèmes de mobilité est une énorme bêtise.Choisir un chien est un travail difficile : quelle race, mâle ou femelle, trouver un éleveur ou un refuge… Mais si vous le faîtes correctement il y a de fortes chances que les choses se passent très bien pour le maître comme pour le chien.Si vous n’avez pas encore fait votre choix, nous vous recommandons de lire notre section : choisir son chien. Si vous avez déjà trouvé, il ne vous reste plus qu’à faire en sorte que l’accueil se passe dans les meilleures conditions …Bien accueillir un chiot ou un chienC’est la deuxième étape indispensable dont vous êtes responsable (et oui, offrir un chien c’est beaucoup de travail ;-)Accueillir un chien demande de l’anticipation. Puisque le futur maître n’est pas au courant de ce qui va lui arriver c’est à vous de gérer son accueil. D’une certaine façon, offrir un chien fait de vous son parrain.Vous ne pouvez pas simplement offrir un chien à quelqu’un sans l’aider à bien l’accueillir. Vous allez devoir aider le maître pour cette étape. L’aider à préparer sa maison pour accueillir son chien, lui fournir les accessoires indispensables pour son chien, bref le minimum vital pour un bon départ.Enfin vous pouvez l’aider à se préparer lui-même, en tant que maître. Eduquer un chiot ou un chien n’est pas évident pour tout le monde, loin de là. Si vous avez un peu d’expérience n’hésitez pas à la partager.Enfin puisque vous avez trouvé un blog d’une très grande qualité avec beaucoup d’informations gratuites sur les chiens (oui, à Noël je m’envoie des fleurs ;-), vous devriez en faire profiter le futur maître.Il vous suffit d’inscrire son prénom et son adresse mail pour qu’il reçoive gratuitement notre guide de 70 pages : bien démarrer avec son chien ! (attendez d’avoir offert le chien si vous ne voulez pas gâcher la surprise ;-)4 conditions indispensables avant d’offrir un chien pour NoëlSi vous êtes sûr que la personne souhaite un chien et qu’elle sait ce que ça représente, si vous offrez la bonne race de chien, que vous faîtes en sorte que l’accueil se passe bien, et que vous aidez le futur maître à éduquer son futur chien, les choses se passeront merveilleusement bien pour tout le monde.Il n’y a aucun doute que vous allez faire deux heureux. D’abord le futur maître puisque vous allez lui offrir le plus beau, le plus merveilleux de tous les cadeaux de Noël et le chien puisque vous allez lui offrir un nouveau foyer avec un maître qui sait comment prendre soin de son chien.Profitez bien de cet instant magique et…Joyeux Noël à vous et vos chiens !!!

TITRE: Plaidoyer en faveur de la caisse/cage
CATÉGORIE: Non catégorisé
CONTENU:
Je passe beaucoup de temps à convaincre des maîtres qu’une caisse ou une cage est bénéfique pour leur chien. Ils passent ensuite beaucoup de temps à convaincre leur conjoint, leur famille, leur belle-famille… Malheureusement ils ne retrouvent pas toujours les arguments que je leur ai donnés.Donc, vous trouverez dans cet article tous les avantages de la caisse pour votre chien. Les caisses/cages ont mauvaise réputation mais croyez-moi, ce n’est pas l’avis de votre chien ! La prochaine fois qu’on vous lancera sur le sujet, il vous suffira de relire cet article pour avoir le dernier mot ;-) BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! A l’abri dans ma tanièreUn chien a besoin d’une tanière, c’est un besoin instinctif pour se protéger des prédateurs et des conditions climatiques.La caisse reproduit cette tanière (contrairement à un simple panier) et votre chien y dormira mieux et sera plus en forme.Il y trouvera refuge et réconfort quand vous sortirez votre horrible aspirateur, quand un bruit lui fera peur ou quand vous accueillerez des amis qu’il n’a pas franchement envie de voir.Le simple fait que votre chien ait la possibilité de se réfugier dans sa caisse est un atout énorme pour lui. Il m’est arrivé de rectifier des mauvais comportements chez des chiens simplement grâce à une caisse.Le chien est plus reposé, moins anxieux et beaucoup plus apte à apprendre de nouvelles choses. Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! Ma caisse restera propreLa mère de votre chien lui a appris dès son plus jeune âge, à ne pas faire ses besoins dans la tanière car l’odeur risquerait d’attirer les prédateurs.Les premières semaines, la mère mange les excréments de ses chiots. Ensuite, elle leur montre l’exemple et les accompagne faire leurs besoins dehors.Pendant toute son enfance, la tanière de votre chien est toujours restée propre.C’est pour cette raison que la caisse est le meilleur outil pour apprendre la propreté à votre chien (voir article : propreté du chiot).Votre chien fera tout ce qui est en son pouvoir pour ne pas salir sa tanière, autrement dit sa caisse. Si vous savez l’utiliser, elle reste le meilleur moyen d’aider votre chien à développer les muscles de sa vessie.Partout chez moi !Une caisse se transporte facilement, ce qui veut dire que votre chien sera partout chez lui.Il vous suffira d’installer sa caisse à l’endroit de votre choix et votre chien aura ses repères.Inutile de vous dire que c’est une source de stress en moins pour lui, et un chien qui n’est pas stressé aura beaucoup moins de raisons d’adopter des comportements gênants.La caisse est aussi le meilleur moyen de transporter votre chien en voiture ou même en avion.C’est la manière la plus sécurisée pour vous, vos passagers et votre chien.Pas toujours le choixJe ne vous le souhaite pas, mais il se peut qu’un jour votre chien se retrouve en cage que vous le vouliez ou non.Si un jour vous perdez votre chien, s’il s’enfuit et qu’il fini dans un refuge, il devra patienter dans une cage.Le temps que le chien soit identifié, que le centre vous contacte et que vous veniez le chercher, le temps sera très long pour un chien qui n’est pas habitué à une cage.C’est le même principe pour un chien qui reste en convalescence chez le vétérinaire.L’expérience sera moins traumatisante s’il est habitué aux cages et il pourra éventuellement, guérir plus vite.La caisse n’est pas un objet de tortureOn peut faire de n’importe quel objet, un objet de torture. Un tournevis ou un marteau peut devenir un objet de torture.Ce n’est pas l’objet qu’il faut condamner mais celui qui l’utilise et qui ne sait pas s’en servir.Pourquoi juger la caisse à cause de quelques imbéciles, pourquoi condamner le pitbull à cause de quelques abrutis ?J’utilise des caisses depuis toujours. Tous mes chiens ont toujours aimé leur caisse et c’est très important pour moi car c’est un allié précieux pour avoir un chien bien éduqué et équilibré.En général, sauf cas exceptionnels, une fois l’apprentissage de la propreté passé, mes chiens sont libres d’aller et venir dans leur caisse quand ils veulent.Ils sont totalement libres. Ils sont même plus libres que les chiens sans caisse puisqu’ils ont la liberté de s’isoler s’ils le souhaitent.Vive les caisses !

Si votre compagnon vous répond quand vous l’appelez, tout le reste de son éducation en sera facilité.Pour commencer, installez-vous dans une pièce calme avec quelques friandises à portée de main ou un jouet qui l’enthousiasme. Appelez votre chien et s’il vous regarde, récompensez-le avec un « oui ! Bon chien ». Offrez-lui une friandise et quelques caresses ou jouez avec lui pendant quelques instants. Répétez cet exercice plusieurs fois, en espaçant les sessions.Votre chien devrait rapidement comprendre que son nom est associé à des moments agréables en votre compagnie et qu’il doit vous regarder quand vous l’appelez (ce qui est un excellent début pour l’apprentissage du rappel).N’oubliez pas que l’éducation de votre chien commence dès son arrivée chez vous. Préparez-vous dès maintenant, car vous avez sûrement beaucoup à apprendre pour créer une relation solide et complice avec votre nouveau compagnon.Si vous cherchez des conseils pour être au top dès l’arrivée de votre chien, je vous recommande chaudement ces articles :Préparer son foyer pour l’arrivée de son chienAccueillir un chiot : premier jour et première nuitComment éduquer un chiot de 2 à 5 moisLa propreté du chiot : un guide étape par étapeCes ressources vous seront d’une grande aide pour démarrer du bon pied avec votre compagnon à quatre pattes.

CATÉGORIE: Non catégorisé
CONTENU:
Choisir un nom de chien n’est pas évident, ça peut même devenir un véritable casse tête.C’est l’une des premières responsabilités que vous aurez en tant que maître et il vous faudra faire le bon choix. Votre chien va porter ce nom toute sa vie alors il vaut mieux prendre le temps de bien réfléchir.Voici quelques conseils pour bien choisir le nom de son chien… BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! Sonorité d’un nom de chien Il est primordial que votre chien reconnaisse son nom facilement et que vous puissiez le prononcer sans problème.Le nom de votre chien sera un outil très utile pour dresser votre chien et vous l’utiliserez très souvent.Donc dirigez-vous plutôt sur des prénoms à deux syllabes. Plus facile et plus rapide à identifier et donc à retenir pour votre chien mais également très simple à prononcer pour vous.Pas d’ambiguïté Evitez de choisir un nom de chien aux sonorités proches d’un mot courant ou pire encore d’un ordre classique comme assis, couché…Ce type de prénom de chien peut entrainer des complications quand vous aurez besoin d’éduquer votre chien qui mettra un peu plus de temps à identifier l’ordre.Vous allez me dire que Lassie est très proche de l’ordre assis, et vous avez raison. Mais clairement ce chien avait des compétences hallucinantes pour communiquer avec les humains ;-) Votre chien mérite le meilleur départ ! Ne ratez pas notre ebook essentiel⤹ Prénom * Email * Un nom de chien adéquat Certains maîtres se servent du sexe, de la taille ou bien encore de la personnalité de leur chien pour choisir un nom adéquat. C’est en effet une bonne base qui peut vous aider à réduire progressivement la liste des choix possibles.Vous pouvez par exemple choisir un prénom de chien mâle ou un prénom de chien femelle suivant votre situation. Choisir un prénom de chien évoquant la force ou la douceur suivant la race.L’autre possibilité est de jouer sur les contrastes et au contraire de choisir un nom de chien qui peu surprendre et amuser. Un petit chihuahua qui s’appelle Titan c’est mignon et drôle à la fois. A vous de trouver votre style et celui de votre chien…Nom de chien LOFLe LOF (Livre des Origines Français) vous impose de choisir un nom commençant par une lettre précise. Cette règle ne vous concerne que si vous souhaitez inscrire votre chien au LOF pour qu’il puisse avoir l’appellation « chien de race ». Cette règle permet de connaître rapidement l’année de naissance d’un chien et facilite l’établissement de son pedigree.Chaque année la lettre change, en 2015 ce fut l’année des noms de chien en L, en 2016 les noms de chien en M, en 2017 les noms de chien en N, en 2018 les noms de chien en O … jusqu’à 2023 l’année des noms de chien en U et finalement 2024 pour l’année des noms de chien en V (les lettres K », « Q », « W », « X » et « Y » sont exclus).Cette règle peut faciliter le choix du nom d’un chien pour certains, en revanche elle peut être une contrainte pour d’autres. Mais rassurez-vous il existe des moyens de contourner cette règle et de laisser libre court à votre imagination.Alternative au nom de chien LOFVous ne souhaitez peut-être pas choisir un nom de chien en U, ou peut-être que l’éleveur à déjà choisi un nom de chien qui ne vous convient pas. Rassurez-vous il existe des alternatives.Si votre chien n’est pas encore inscrit au LOF mais que vous pensez le faire plus tard, il vous suffira de rajouter la lettre devant le nom que vous aurez choisi. Pour reprendre notre exemple si vous avez appelé votre chien Titan, il vous suffira de noter Utitan lors de son inscription (s’il est né en 2023).Si l’éleveur l’a déjà inscrit, mais que vous n’aimez pas le nom de chien qu’il a choisi vous aurez la possibilité d’ajouter un nom d’usage sur le LOF. Si l’éleveur de notre chihuahua l’a enregistré sous le nom de Ulysse et que vous rajoutez le nom d’usage Titan, les documents officiels porteront le nom de : Ulysse dit Titan.Bien utiliser le nom de son chien Le nom d’un chien n’est pas un ordre. C’est un réflexe naturel d’utiliser le nom de son chien avec différentes intonations et d’espérer qu’il comprenne ce qu’on veut lui dire.Mais si vous voulez communiquer correctement avec votre chien ce n’est pas la bonne méthode.Son nom ne doit servir qu’à attirer son attention et il doit toujours être suivi d’un ordre pour que votre chien comprenne précisément ce que vous attendez de lui : assis, couché, au pied…Une fois que vous aurez choisi le nom de votre chien, la première chose à faire sera de lui apprendre à le reconnaître. Ce sera la première étape de l’éducation de votre chien et si vous ne savez pas comment faire, je vous recommande cette formation : Dresser votre chien en 15 minutes par jour.

Trouver un nom parfait pour votre chien peut parfois être délicat. Pourquoi ne pas opter pour une approche personnalisée ?Tout d’abord, explorez différents thèmes qui vous plaisent, comme je l’ai fait. Vous avez peut-être une passion, un hobby, ou un intérêt particulier. Parcourez un dictionnaire lié à ce sujet et recherchez les noms commençant par la lettre U.Une autre approche que j’aime beaucoup consiste à détourner un mot que vous aimez. Vous aimez les puzzles ? Appelez votre chien Uzzle. Fan du président Obama ? Ubama vient ici ! Avec cette technique vous créerez facilement des prénoms qui seront très souvent uniques.Vous pouvez également vous inspirer des noms de vos proches. Prenez quelques lettres des prénoms de vos proches, mélangez-les, et commencez par un U pour obtenir un nom unique et chargé de sens !La dernière technique un peu plus longue mais qui donne également des résultats uniques, consiste simplement à chercher lettre par lettre et à choisir quelles sonorités vous plaisent le plus. Commencez par Ub (Uba, Ube, Ubi, Ubo… Uca, Uce, Uci…) et ainsi de suite. Attention, il existe quelques millions de combinaisons possibles donc commencez simplement par les deux premières lettres pour faire un premier tri.Enfin, n’hésitez pas à jouer sur les sonorités car la lettre U peut se prononcer de différentes façon :le son U classique comme dans Uranus,le son You à l’anglaise comme dans Ugood (You good? in english)et enfin le son Eu comme dans Usher ou UffingtonComment bien choisir un nom de chien en U?Il y a des noms de chien faciles à reconnaître et donc à apprendre pour votre chien, et il y a les autres qu’il vaut mieux éviter.Pour être sûr que vous faciliterez la vie de votre chien, préférez un nom court, idéalement de 2 syllabes. Si possible choisissez un nom qui se termine par une voyelle car les sonorités de ces prénoms sont plus identifiables pour les chiens.Choisissez un mot qui ne ressemble pas à un ordre, au nom d’un autre animal ou d’une autre personne, un mot que vous n’utilisez pas fréquemment. L’idée est d’éviter la confusion pour votre chien et qu’il sache rapidement si vous vous adressez à lui.Enfin dernier conseil qui s’adresse plus à vous qu’à votre chien, choisissez un mot que vous pourrez prononcer en public sans gêne. Il est possible que dans certaines situations, vous soyez amené à crier le nom de votre chien dans un lieu publique donc autant vous épargner des situations gênantes.Quelle lettre pour un nom de chien en 2024 ? Pour bénéficier de l’appellation Chien de race, certains pays comme la France, la Belgique ou le Luxembourg imposent la première lettre du nom de chien.Ces règles sont très anciennes et ont été créées pour faciliter l’enregistrement des chiens de race et de leur pédigrée à une époque où l’ordinateur n’existait pas.Elles sont toujours en place aujourd’hui et c’est pour cette raison que si vous souhaitez que votre chien conserve son appellation de chien de race, vous devrez lui donner un nom qui commence par la bonne lettre :Pour la France et le Luxembourg : nom de chien en VPour la Belgique : nom de chien en XA ma connaissance, ce sont les seuls pays avec ce type de réglementation mais si vous nous lisez depuis un pays qui impose une autre lettre n’hésitez pas à me laisser un commentaire.J’en profite pour saluer tous nos lecteurs qui visitent ce site aux quatre coins du monde. C’est toujours un plaisir de voir que la passion des chiens n’a pas de frontière !Voyons maintenant s’il est possible de « contourner » ces obligations et choisir le nom que l’on souhaite car après tout choisir un nom de chien en U n’est pas simple et vous aviez peut-être une autre idée en tête !Peut-on quand même choisir la lettre que l’on veut pour un chien de race ?Si vraiment vous souhaitez choisir un nom commençant par une autre lettre, vous avez deux solutions.D’abord, imaginons que vous souhaitiez appeler votre chien Woufi. Tout ce que vous aurez à faire est d’ajouter la lettre de l’année devant Woufi. Officiellement, votre chien s’appellera Uwoufi mais dans la vie de tous les jours vous pourrez l’appeler Woufi.L’autre technique consiste simplement à lui donner un nom officiel commençant par la bonne lettre et d’ajouter lors de son enregistrement un nom d’usage. L’enregistrement d’un nom d’usage est optionnel mais permet justement une certaine liberté pour ceux qui souhaitent choisir le nom qu’ils veulent.Voyons maintenant comment apprendre son nom à votre chien rapidement…Apprendre à son chien son nom rapidement Pour apprendre son nom à votre adorable compagnon à quatre pattes, suivez ces conseils simples dans une ambiance détendue, armés de quelques friandises ou d’un jouet à portée de main. Commencez par appeler votre chien, et dès qu’il vous regarde, exprimez-lui un joyeux « oui ! bon chien ».Récompensez-le avec une petite gourmandise et quelques caresses, ou accordez-lui un moment de jeu. Patientez quelques instants, puis répétez.Avec quelques séances, votre chien devrait rapidement mémoriser son nom et comprendre l’importance de vous regarder et de venir à vous lorsqu’il est sollicité – un excellent point de départ pour le reste de son éducation.Rappelez-vous que l’éducation de votre fidèle compagnon démarre dès son arrivée chez vous.

TITRE: Les besoins nutritionnels de votre chien
CATÉGORIE: Non catégorisé
CONTENU:
Bien comprendre les besoins nutritionnels de votre chien est très important. La nourriture joue un rôle primordial sur sa santé. Le chien est un omnivore, ce qui veut dire qu’il peut manger n’importe quelle nourriture (je ne tiens pas compte des chaussures ou tout autre objet que votre chien a l’habitude de manger ;-).Pour répondre aux besoins nutritionnels de votre chien il faut que son alimentation soit répartie en 6 groupes alimentaires.C’est la clef d’une alimentation équilibrée et d’un chien en pleine forme ! BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! De l’eau pour votre chienDe l’eau, de l’air, la vie ! C’est vrai pour vous et c’est aussi vrai pour votre chien. L’eau représente 60 à 70% du poids d’un chien adulte.Une partie des besoins en eau de votre chien se trouve dans sa nourriture (la nourriture en boite contient environ 78% d’eau et la nourriture sèche environ 10%).Il est donc primordial que votre chien ait accès à de l’eau fraîche (je ne parle pas de température, simplement renouvelez tous les jours la gamelle d’eau de votre chien).Petite précision pour ceux qui sont en train d’apprendre la propreté à leur chiot : vous pouvez surveiller et limiter la quantité d’eau que votre chiot absorbe (donner lui de l’eau à des moments spécifiques comme après la balade par exemple).En cas de forte chaleur ne prenez pas de risques, un chien se déshydrate rapidement (vous pouvez également lui mettre un glaçon à la place de l’eau, il l’absorbera plus lentement). Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! Des protéines pour votre chienLes protéines sont également très importantes pour votre chien. Elles vont lui fournir les acides aminés nécessaires au bon développement de son corps. Les protéines contiennent 23 acides aminés dont 10 sont essentiels pour la bonne santé de votre chien. Les autres sont également importants mais votre chien peut les fabriquer lui même.Généralement, on considère que les protéines animales sont plus intéressantes pour votre chien que les protéines végétales.Des minéraux pour votre chienLes minéraux n’ont aucune valeur énergétique mais ils font partie des besoins alimentaires de votre chien. Ils doivent être présents dans l’alimentation de votre chien car contrairement à certains acides aminés, les chiens ne peuvent pas les produire.Le fer, le magnésium, le zinc, le calcium vont permettre des réactions métaboliques assurant ainsi le bon fonctionnement de l’organisme de votre chien.Par exemple, sans minéraux dans son alimentation votre chien n’aura pas les os solides. Ils participent également à la bonne santé des dents de votre chien qui est un élément crucial pour lui et sa longévité (n’oubliez pas de brosser les dents de votre chien régulièrement et les vôtres aussi ;-).De la graisse pour votre chien Si votre chien n’a pas une belle peau ou une belle fourrure, surveillez ses besoins en graisse. La graisse a non seulement un rôle énergétique mais elle permet aussi à votre chien d’absorber certains vitamines qui se dissolvent dans la graisse.Autre point important, les chiens aiment les graisses. C’est très bien de répondre à ses besoins alimentaires mais il faut aussi prendre du plaisir dans tout ça ! Attention tout de même aux excès.La nourriture industrielle est généralement adaptée aux besoins de vos chiens mais attention aux petites friandises qui sont souvent un peu plus riches.Surtout si vous utilisez la nourriture pour le éduquer votre chien, n’oubliez pas de diminuer les quantités aux repas.Des vitamines pour votre chienVotre chien a besoin de vitamines, tout comme vous. Ils participent au bon fonctionnement de l’organisme ils sont indispensables aux échanges vitaux.Votre chien ne peut pas les synthétiser lui même, mais rassurez-vous si son alimentation est équilibrée, il aura les vitamines dont il a besoin.Inutile de donner des suppléments de vitamine à votre chien sauf si votre chien a une déficience et que votre vétérinaire vous le demande. Contrairement à ce qu’on pourrait croire, trop de vitamines peut être dangereux.Des glucides pour votre chienLes glucides sont le dernier élément des besoins nutritionnels de votre chien. Ils n’ont pas toujours bonne réputation et pourtant ils sont une aide précieuse pour le corps de votre chien.Ils permettent de conserver les intestins de votre chien en bon état et d’éviter des diarrhées ou constipation.

TITRE: Les besoins nutritionnels de votre chien
CATÉGORIE: Non catégorisé
CONTENU:
Bien comprendre les besoins nutritionnels de votre chien est très important. La nourriture joue un rôle primordial sur sa santé. Le chien est un omnivore, ce qui veut dire qu’il peut manger n’importe quelle nourriture (je ne tiens pas compte des chaussures ou tout autre objet que votre chien a l’habitude de manger ;-).Pour répondre aux besoins nutritionnels de votre chien il faut que son alimentation soit répartie en 6 groupes alimentaires.C’est la clef d’une alimentation équilibrée et d’un chien en pleine forme ! BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! De l’eau pour votre chienDe l’eau, de l’air, la vie ! C’est vrai pour vous et c’est aussi vrai pour votre chien. L’eau représente 60 à 70% du poids d’un chien adulte.Une partie des besoins en eau de votre chien se trouve dans sa nourriture (la nourriture en boite contient environ 78% d’eau et la nourriture sèche environ 10%).Il est donc primordial que votre chien ait accès à de l’eau fraîche (je ne parle pas de température, simplement renouvelez tous les jours la gamelle d’eau de votre chien).Petite précision pour ceux qui sont en train d’apprendre la propreté à leur chiot : vous pouvez surveiller et limiter la quantité d’eau que votre chiot absorbe (donner lui de l’eau à des moments spécifiques comme après la balade par exemple).En cas de forte chaleur ne prenez pas de risques, un chien se déshydrate rapidement (vous pouvez également lui mettre un glaçon à la place de l’eau, il l’absorbera plus lentement). Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! Des protéines pour votre chienLes protéines sont également très importantes pour votre chien. Elles vont lui fournir les acides aminés nécessaires au bon développement de son corps. Les protéines contiennent 23 acides aminés dont 10 sont essentiels pour la bonne santé de votre chien. Les autres sont également importants mais votre chien peut les fabriquer lui même.Généralement, on considère que les protéines animales sont plus intéressantes pour votre chien que les protéines végétales.Des minéraux pour votre chienLes minéraux n’ont aucune valeur énergétique mais ils font partie des besoins alimentaires de votre chien. Ils doivent être présents dans l’alimentation de votre chien car contrairement à certains acides aminés, les chiens ne peuvent pas les produire.Le fer, le magnésium, le zinc, le calcium vont permettre des réactions métaboliques assurant ainsi le bon fonctionnement de l’organisme de votre chien.Par exemple, sans minéraux dans son alimentation votre chien n’aura pas les os solides. Ils participent également à la bonne santé des dents de votre chien qui est un élément crucial pour lui et sa longévité (n’oubliez pas de brosser les dents de votre chien régulièrement et les vôtres aussi ;-).De la graisse pour votre chien Si votre chien n’a pas une belle peau ou une belle fourrure, surveillez ses besoins en graisse. La graisse a non seulement un rôle énergétique mais elle permet aussi à votre chien d’absorber certains vitamines qui se dissolvent dans la graisse.Autre point important, les chiens aiment les graisses. C’est très bien de répondre à ses besoins alimentaires mais il faut aussi prendre du plaisir dans tout ça ! Attention tout de même aux excès.La nourriture industrielle est généralement adaptée aux besoins de vos chiens mais attention aux petites friandises qui sont souvent un peu plus riches.Surtout si vous utilisez la nourriture pour le éduquer votre chien, n’oubliez pas de diminuer les quantités aux repas.Des vitamines pour votre chienVotre chien a besoin de vitamines, tout comme vous. Ils participent au bon fonctionnement de l’organisme ils sont indispensables aux échanges vitaux.Votre chien ne peut pas les synthétiser lui même, mais rassurez-vous si son alimentation est équilibrée, il aura les vitamines dont il a besoin.Inutile de donner des suppléments de vitamine à votre chien sauf si votre chien a une déficience et que votre vétérinaire vous le demande. Contrairement à ce qu’on pourrait croire, trop de vitamines peut être dangereux.Des glucides pour votre chienLes glucides sont le dernier élément des besoins nutritionnels de votre chien. Ils n’ont pas toujours bonne réputation et pourtant ils sont une aide précieuse pour le corps de votre chien.Ils permettent de conserver les intestins de votre chien en bon état et d’éviter des diarrhées ou constipation. Ils fournissent également de l’énergie aux tissus ce qui permet à votre chien de conserver ses protéines et de les utiliser à bon escient.Comme pour les graisses il faut contrôler et gérer les quantités, mise à part ça les glucides font partie intégrante des besoins nutritionnels de votre chien.

J’ai beau côtoyer des chiens depuis des années, ils ne cesseront jamais de me surprendre !D’après de nombreuses études, le chien pourrait être l’avenir du dépistage du cancer. Les résultats sont vraiment impressionnants et d’une précision redoutable !Non seulement le chien peut détecter les tumeurs mais il peut également différencier les cellules bénignes des cellules malignes. BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! Un chien qui détecte le cancerEn 2011 l’armée française avait dressé un berger malinois à détecter le cancer de la prostate. Il suffisait au chien de renifler des échantillons d’urine pour établir le diagnostique.Avec un taux de réussite de 91%, le berger malinois avait surpris la communauté scientifique.En 2014, l’Instituto Clinico Humanitas de Milan a réussi à démontrer que la truffe d’un chien était plus efficace pour dépister le cancer de la prostate que le test médicale utilisé de nos jours.Incroyable d’imaginer qu’un chien bien dressé puisse surpasser la précision de certains tests médicaux ! Alors certains scientifiques ont voulu pousser les recherches un peu plus loin.Les tests ont toujours été réalisés sur des personnes saines ou atteintes d’un cancer. Une nouvelle étude a pour but de savoir si un chien peut différencier des cellules bénignes et des cellules cancéreuses. Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! Une précision diagnostique remarquableCette nouvelle étude de la faculté de médecine de l’Arkansas ont recruté 34 personnes dont 15 atteintes d’un cancer et 19 d’une tumeur bénigne. Ils ont ensuite fait appel à un berger allemand spécialement dressé pour participer à cette étude.Dans 88% des cas le berger allemand a réussi à différencier les cellules bénignes des cellules malignes ! Ce qui veut dire que la truffe d’un chien peut non seulement permettre de détecter la présence de cellules tumorales mais aussi permettre de savoir si le cancer existe déjà ou non.D’autres études doivent encore être réalisées mais il y a fort à parier que très prochainement les chiens faciliteront le dépistages du cancer et permettront limiter le nombre d’interventions chirurgicales inutiles.Jusqu’où ira le dressage du chienLes résultats de ces études montrent à quel point la truffe d’un chien est développée. Elles montrent aussi à quel point le dressage d’un chien peut aller loin.Le dressage d’un chien renifleur prend beaucoup de temps mais les résultats sont vraiment surprenants. Avec des techniques simples et de la patience ont peut dresser un chien à faire des choses incroyables !Je suis sûr qu’il reste encore beaucoup de choses à découvrir sur les chiens et qu’ils n’ont pas fini de nous surprendre.Je suis également sûr que chaque découverte à venir sera une occasion supplémentaire de constater que le chien reste le meilleur ami de l’homme !

TITRE: Propreté du chiot : ma méthode pas à pas
CATÉGORIE: Non catégorisé
CONTENU:
La propreté du chiot est un problème pour de nombreux maîtres, j’ai donc décidé de vous donner ma méthode à suivre pas à pas pour l’apprentissage de la propreté.La propreté du chiot n’est pas difficile à apprendre, en revanche, c’est un sujet complet car chaque détail compte et il suffit d’une erreur pour ralentir ou empêcher votre chiot de devenir propre.C’est assez difficile de traiter le sujet de façon complète en un article donc je préfère vous donner une méthode à suivre pour rendre votre chiot propre le plus rapidement possible (vous verrez que l’article est déjà assez long comme ça mais c’est difficile de faire plus court). BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! Propreté du chiot : ce dont vous aurez besoinUne caisse pour apprendre la propreté à son chiotPour la propreté du chiot, vous aurez besoin de différentes choses.La première est une caisse. La caisse fait partie des accessoires indispensables pour votre chiot.Vous en aurez besoin pour le transporter en sécurité mais son utilité ne s’arrête pas là. Pour beaucoup de maîtres, la caisse est un objet de torture. Mais c’est totalement faux.C’est une idée reçue qui a la dent dure (un peu comme le fait de mettre le museau de son chien dans ses excréments en pensant qu’il va apprendre la propreté).Dans sa caisse, un chiot se sent totalement en sécurité. Il peut s’y reposer, mâchouiller ses jouets tranquillement, faire une sieste et y dormir pendant la nuit. Elle répond à ses besoins instinctifs de protection. Pour beaucoup de maîtres, une caisse est une prison alors que pour leur chien, c’est une maison.Utiliser correctement la caisse peut rapidement devenir le meilleur ami de votre chien (après vous bien sûr ;-). Un dernier point très important, la caisse est un allié précieux pour l’apprentissage de la propreté. Je ne m’étends pas plus sur les avantages d’une caisse, je vous en reparlerai dans un prochain article.Si vraiment vous n’aimez pas l’idée de la caisse, sachez que vous pouvez utiliser un enclos imperméable comme celui-ci. Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! Un mot clef pour la propreté du chiotAvant même de démarrer l’apprentissage de la propreté, je choisis 2 mots clefs, un pour le pipi et un pour le caca. Libre à vous de choisir ce que vous voulez : pipi, caca, fait, va faire, fonce…Le but de ces mots est d’apprendre à votre chiot à faire sur commande.Si un jour, vous êtes un peu plus pressé, si le temps est vraiment mauvais, il vous suffira de sortir et de prononcez le mot clef pour que votre chien fasses ses besoins.Je ne vais pas vous mentir, ça ne marche pas avec tous les chiots. Certains d’entre eux assimilent très bien les deux mots, d’autres un sur deux et d’autres n’en assimilent aucun.Mais ça vaut le coup d’essayer, peut-être que votre chiot fera partie de ceux qui comprennent.N’oubliez pas de donner les mots clefs à tous ceux qui sont impliqués dans l’apprentissage de la propreté de votre chiot. D’ailleurs, n’oubliez pas de leur donner toutes les infos présentes dans cet article.Des friandises pour l’apprentissage de la propretéVous aurez besoin de friandises pour l’apprentissage de la propreté de votre chiot. Le meilleur moyen d’apprendre quelque chose à votre chiot, c’est de l’encourager quand il le fait.Un chiot apprend mieux et plus vite par la récompense que par la punition.Donc à chaque fois que votre chiot fera ses besoins au bon endroit, vous devrez le récompenser largement.Beaucoup de chiots sont dirigés par la nourriture donc, pendant l’apprentissage de la propreté, choisissez des friandises dont votre chiot raffole, vous devez marquer le coup.N’oubliez pas également d’exprimer votre joie verbalement et par les caresses.Enfin, n’oubliez pas également de jouer avec votre chiot une fois qu’il a fait ses besoins, ça fait partie des récompenses pour un chiot propre.Propreté du chiot : tout est dans le timing Maintenant que vous savez ce dont vous avez besoin, passons à la méthode en elle-même.La propreté du chiot demande de la constance et beaucoup de régularité.Vous allez voir que mon emploi du temps, et surtout celui de mon chiot, est très répétitif. C’est le meilleur moyen d’apprendre à votre chiot la propreté car c’est par la répétition qu’il apprendra le mieux et le plus rapidement (et par les encouragements).Voici donc ma journée type, et celle de mon chiot, en période d’apprentissage de la propreté que je vous conseille de répéter, répéter, répéter, répéter,… (vous m’avez compris ;-).La journée type d’un chiot propre6H30 : La première chose que je fais le matin, c’est de sortir mon chiot de sa caisse, je lui mets son collier et sa laisse, et c’est parti pour une balade.J’attends qu’il fasse pipi, et dès qu’il commence, j’utilise mon mot clef et quelques encouragements. Dès qu’il a fini, je l’encourage à nouveau et lui donne 3 friandises d’un seul coup.Ensuite, j’attend qu’il fasse la grosse commission. Dès qu’il démarre, j’utilise le mot clef et quelques encouragements.Quand il a fini, je le félicite comme s’il venait de sortir une pépite d’or et je lui donne à nouveau 3 friandises. Pour finir, je joue avec lui quelques minutes et je fini la promenade.6H45 : Je rentre, je petit-déjeune tout en surveillant mon chiot que je laisse jouer tranquillement.7H15 : Je prépare le repas de mon chiot et j’en profite pour lui faire travailler l’ordre assis, couché et pas bougé. Je lui donne sa gamelle et le laisse petit-déjeuner à son tour pendant 15 minutes.7H30 : Nouvelle balade avec mon chiot. Je reproduis point par point exactement la même procédure qu’à 6H30.7H45 : Je laisse mon chiot jouer sous surveillance et j’attends qu’il commence à fatiguer (en général au bout de 15-20 minutes).8H00 : Si j’ai le temps de le surveiller, je garde mon chien près de moi sous surveillance rapprochée. Si je ne peux pas le surveiller, je l’emmène dans sa caisse et je le laisse avec un jouet à mâchouiller.10H00 : Je laisse mon chiot boire de l’eau et je repars en balade avec lui. Je répète exactement la même procédure point par point. En rentrant, je continue de jouer avec lui à l’intérieur pendant une trentaine de minutes. Ensuite, soit je le garde proche de moi sous surveillance ou je le remets dans sa caisse.12H00 : Nouvelle balade pour moi et mon chiot. Je répète exactement la même procédure point par point. En rentrant, je le garde près de moi et lui prépare son repas. J’en profite pour travailler l’ordre assis, couché et pas bougé. Ensuite, je laisse mon chiot manger pendant 15 minutes.12H30 : Après le repas, je ressorts mon chiot. Je répète exactement la même procédure point par point. En rentrant, je le laisse jouer à l’intérieur sous surveillance pendant 30 minutes. Ensuite, soit je le garde près de moi si je peux le surveiller, sinon je l’emmène dans sa caisse avec un jouet à mâchouiller.14H00 : Je laisse mon chiot boire puis je l’emmène de nouveau en balade. Je répète exactement la même procédure point par point. En rentrant, je le laisse jouer à l’intérieur sous surveillance pendant 30 minutes. Ensuite, soit je le garde près de moi si je peux le surveiller, sinon je l’emmène dans sa caisse avec un jouet à mâchouiller.16H00 : Je laisse mon chiot boire puis je l’emmène de nouveau en balade. Je répète exactement la même procédure point par point. En rentrant je le laisse jouer à l’intérieur sous surveillance pendant 30 minutes. Ensuite, soit je le garde près de moi si je peux le surveiller, sinon je l’emmène dans sa caisse avec un jouet à mâchouiller.18H00 : Je laisse mon chiot boire puis je l’emmène de nouveau en balade. Je répète exactement la même procédure point par point.18H15 : En rentrant, je garde mon chiot près de moi sous surveillance. Je lui prépare son repas et j’en profite pour travailler les ordres assis, couché et pas bougé. Je lui donne son repas dans sa caisse (en général, je lui donne un repas par jour dans sa caisse). Cette technique permet d’apprendre à votre chiot l’ordre caisse très rapidement et permet également de renforcer le coté positif de la caisse.18H45 : Nouvelle balade pour moi et mon chiot. Comme toujours, je suis la procédure à la lettre point par point. En rentrant, je le garde près de moi sous haute surveillance. Je peux jouer avec lui, lui apprendre de nouvelles choses ou simplement rester tranquille avec lui.20H45 : Nouvelle balade pour moi et mon chiot, je suis la procédure à la lettre point par point. En rentrant, je le garde près de moi sous haute surveillance.23H00 : Dernière balade pour moi et mon chiot. Répétez une dernière fois la procédure point par point. En rentrant, j’emmène mon chien dans sa caisse pour la nuit. Suivant l’âge du chiot et sa capacité à se retenir, je ressors la nuit (1 à 2 fois entre 6 et 8 semaines et 1 fois entre 8 et 12 semaines).Adaptez cette méthode à vos besoins et à ceux de votre chiotCette méthode est une base que vous pouvez adapter à vos besoins et surtout à ceux de votre chiot.Si vous avez moins de temps à consacrer à votre chiot, si vous ne souhaitez pas utiliser une caisse, si vous préférez qu’il fasse ses besoins à l’intérieur sur un tapis de propreté, si vous avez un chien âgé…Tout est adaptable, en revanche, chaque changement aura des conséquences et vous aurez sûrement besoin d’adapter d’autres parties de la méthode.Comme je vous l’ai dit, il y a des milliers de possibilités différentes et je ne peux pas toutes les couvrir dans cet article.Sachez que vous avez à disposition cette méthode pour justement proposer une solution à tous les maîtres et tous les chiots ou chiens pour apprendre la propreté en douceur et le plus rapidement possible.Elle est d’autant plus intéressante qu’elle couvre la propreté mais aussi tous les ordres de base, le rappel, la marche en laisse et d’autres problèmes fréquents que vous pourriez rencontrer également comme des problèmes de mordillements, aboiements, sauter sur les invités et bien d’autres encore.Alors n’hésitez-pas, en plus d’avoir un chiot propre, vous aurez en plus un chiot bien éduqué… Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour !

Adopter un chien fait partie de ces décisions qui changent une vie. Accueillir un chien chez soi et dans son coeur, c’est un peu comme recevoir une énorme dose d’amour et je suis sûr que vous êtes prêt pour ça.Mais tout cet amour entraîne aussi des responsabilités, et il faut absolument que vous soyez prêt pour ça aussi.Alors avant de franchir le pas de l’adoption, voici 6 questions que tout futur maître devrait se poser (et si vous avez déjà un chien vous devriez déjà connaître les réponses ;-)… BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! L’adoption c’est pour la vie Chaque année des milliers de chiens sont abandonnés par leurs maîtres qui ne sont plus en capacité ou n’ont plus la volonté de s’en occuper. Certains trouvent une place en refuge et d’autres non.Suivant la race et la taille de votre futur chien, il vivra entre 10 et 20 ans. Adopter un chien est un engagement sur le long terme, beaucoup de choses peuvent évoluer en 10 ou 20 ans.Je sais que vous ne pouvez pas prédire l’avenir, mais pensez-y, à partir du moment ou vous adopterez un chien vous vous engagez à en prendre soin.Il faudra l’inclure dans tous vos projets, toutes vos décisions : changement de carrière, changement de domicile, changement de style de vie, vacances, …Etes vous prêt à faire de l’exercice avec votre chien ? Un chien demande de la stimulation physique et psychologique pour être en forme. Les vétérinaires recommandent au moins 20 minutes d’exercice physique par jour (balade, jogging, agility, frisbee à vous de voir ce que vous préférez).Avant d’adopter un chien pensez à votre journée type et demandez-vous si vous aurez assez de temps pour sortir votre chien ou au moins si vous pensez pouvoir dégager du temps pour ça, si vous serez capable de le faire quand il pleut ou quand il neige.Votre chien aura également besoin de stimulation psychologique et malheureusement on n’oublie trop souvent à quel point c’est important. Votre chien devra être stimulé au moins une heure par jour à travers des jeux, des exercices de dressage ou tout simplement passer du temps avec lui et créer du lien. Votre chien mérite le meilleur départ ! Ne ratez pas notre ebook essentiel⤹ Prénom * Email * Etes-vous prêt à étudier le monde merveilleux des chiens ? Il faut savoir qu’un grand nombre de maîtres abandonnent leurs chiens pour des problèmes de comportement.C’est quelque chose qui me rend complètement dingue !Chaque année des milliers de chiens sont abandonnés parce que leurs maitres sont incompétents et ne prennent pas la peine de se former !Avec les bonnes méthodes de dressage et de socialisation, ces chiens n’auraient aucun problème de comportement et seraient de parfaits compagnons.Eduquer son chien, ça s’apprend. Il faut se documenter, lire des livres, des sites internet pour comprendre son chien et savoir comment communiquer avec lui.Il faut démarrer le dressage de votre chien au plus tôt.Commencez par des choses faciles comme l’ordre assis, couché, pas bougé, travaillé également sur la propreté (voir article : propreté du chiot), le rappel, bref vous avez beaucoup de choses à apprendre, bien plus que votre chien ;-)Avez-vous le budget nécessaire pour votre chien ? Beaucoup de maîtres sont surpris par le coût réel d’un chien. La vérité c’est qu’un chien peut vite devenir un gros investissement.Il vous faudra le nourrir 2 à 3 fois par jour et vous équiper pour répondre à ses besoins.Les gamelles, colliers, laisses, la caisse, les jouets, tous les accessoires pour votre chien ont un coût.Vous pensez peut-être qu’ils ne sont pas tous obligatoires mais ne vous voilez pas la face certains d’entre eux le sont (voir article : les accessoires indispensables pour votre chien).Mais vos dépenses ne s’arrêteront pas là ! Il faudra ajouter à cela les soins quotidien pour votre chien.Il vous faudra une brosse à dent, du dentifrice, des goutes pour nettoyer les yeux de votre chien et lui nettoyer les oreilles, du shampoing spécial chien qui ne lui agresse pas la peau…Il y a également les dépenses de santé, êtes-vous prêt à emmener votre chien chez le vétérinaire une fois par an, lui faire faire ses vaccins ? Etes-vous prêt pour faire face à d’éventuels problèmes de santé.Pour finir, il y a les dépenses liées à votre éducation pour devenir le meilleur des maîtres. Etes- vous prêt à dépenser quelques euros pour vous former, pour apprendre comment éduquer votre chien ?Bref, en règle général on sous-estime le coût réel de l’adoption d’un chien. Je vous rassure ces dépenses seront bien peu de choses comparé à ce que vous apportera votre chien au quotidien. Mais il faut tout de même y penser avant d’adopter.Etes-vous prêt à créer un environnement sain pour votre chien ? Autre réalité d’une grande tristesse, chaque année des milliers de chiens meurent bêtement dans des accidents domestiques.Un chien, et encore plus si vous adoptez un chiot, c’est un peu comme un enfant, si il y a une bêtise à faire, il la fera ! C’est à vous de vous assurer qu’il est en sécurité.Je donne beaucoup d’informations pour sécuriser votre maison dans le livre Bien démarrer avec son chien. C’est aussi pour ça qu’il est gratuit, je me dis qu’il peut éventuellement sauver la vie de quelques chiens.Avant d’adopter un chien préparez-vous à faire quelques modifications de votre petit intérieur pour être sûr que votre chien ne risque rien. Travaillez le dressage de votre chien au plus vite (et surtout le rappel) car il y a des ordres qui peuvent littéralement lui sauver la vie !Qu’arrivera-t-il à votre chien si vous n’êtes plus là ? Là encore c’est important d’y penser, même si ça n’est pas forcément agréable de penser à ces choses là.Mais c’est à vous d’anticiper ce qui arrivera à votre chien si vous n’êtes plus là pour le faire.Tout maître devrait avoir un plan pour son chien, une personne de confiance qui pourra prendre la relève en cas d’urgence, d’accident, de grave maladie, …Parlez-en à votre famille, vos amis ou des personnes en qui vous avez confiance et faîtes leur savoir ce que vous aimeriez qu’ils fassent pour votre chien en cas de besoin.Vous pouvez même le faire par écrit, le faire de façon officielle. Personne ne vous jettera la pierre d’avoir pris les devants et pensé à l’avenir de votre chien.Alors, êtes-vous prêt à adopter un chien ?Si vous avez les réponses à ces questions, vous êtes sûrement prêt à adopter un chien. Vous êtes prêt pour l’amour inconditionnel, la loyauté, et la joie qu’un chien peut vous apporter au quotidien.Si vous avez quelques choses à ajouter à cette liste, n’hésitez pas à le faire, laissez un commentaire, vous aiderez peut-être un futur maître et son chien !

TITRE: Mon chien est-il somnambule ? Une question inattendue, mais fascinante !
CATÉGORIE: Non catégorisé
CONTENU:
Ah, le mystère des comportements canins ! Une fois, j’ai rencontré un Golden Retriever nommé Simba, un amour de chien, mais pas facile à comprendre… surtout la nuit. Ses propriétaires me racontaient, un peu amusés, qu’il semblait se « lever » dans son sommeil, marcher maladroitement, puis retourner se coucher comme si de rien n’était.Étonnant, non ? Mais cela m’a poussé à me pencher sur un phénomène peu commun : le chien somnambule.En tant qu’éducateur canin, j’ai vu de tout, des chiens qui chassent leurs propres ombres à ceux qui aboient en dormant. Mais qu’en est-il du somnambulisme ? Est-ce que cela existe vraiment chez les chiens ? Et surtout, est-ce un signe d’un problème plus profond ?Plongeons dans ce sujet intrigant pour répondre à vos questions. BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! Le somnambulisme chez les chiens : mythe ou réalité ?Avant toute chose, soyons clairs : le chien somnambule, dans le sens où nous l’entendons pour les humains, n’est pas exactement un comportement reconnu chez nos amis à quatre pattes. Contrairement à nous, les chiens ne souffrent pas de véritables épisodes de somnambulisme.Toutefois, ils peuvent afficher des comportements nocturnes intrigants, comme marcher, aboyer, ou même courir dans leur sommeil.Certaines races sont plus sujettes à ce type de comportement que d’autres. Par exemple, les Labradors, connus pour leur énergie débordante, peuvent parfois « réagir » intensément à des rêves. C’est un peu comme si leur énergie diurne débordait dans leur sommeil !À l’inverse, un Bouledogue français plus calme pourrait être moins enclin à ces agitations, mais pourrait tout de même montrer de petits mouvements inconscients, comme des spasmes ou des coups de pattes. Cela dit, tous ces comportements sont généralement normaux et inoffensifs.Pourquoi mon chien bouge-t-il dans son sommeil ?Il est important de comprendre que le sommeil des chiens est constitué de cycles très similaires aux nôtres, avec des phases de sommeil profond et de sommeil paradoxal (la phase des rêves). Pendant le sommeil paradoxal, votre chien peut sembler courir, japper ou bouger.Ce phénomène est particulièrement visible chez certaines races, comme le Berger australien, un chien très actif et réactif, même dans ses rêves !Selon une étude de l’Université d’Helsinki en 2022, les chiens au tempérament plus dynamique sont plus enclins à montrer des mouvements pendant leur sommeil. L’étude, dirigée par le Dr Hannes Lohi, met en lumière la corrélation entre l’activité diurne et les réactions nocturnes chez les chiens de travail.En tant que propriétaire, cela peut être un peu déstabilisant à observer, surtout si vous avez un chien qui bouge beaucoup la nuit. Mais il est essentiel de ne pas le réveiller brusquement. Cela pourrait non seulement le désorienter, mais aussi perturber son cycle de sommeil.Dans le cas des chiots ou des chiens seniors, ces comportements peuvent aussi être plus prononcés en raison de leur système nerveux plus sensible. J’ai vu un chiot Labrador, Rocky, faire de véritables « marathons » dans son sommeil, alors qu’un chien plus âgé comme Max, un Cavalier King Charles de 10 ans, se contentait de petits spasmes légers.Quand s’inquiéter des comportements nocturnes ?Alors, que faire si votre chien semble « somnambule » ? En règle générale, ces mouvements sont normaux et ne posent pas de problème. Cependant, certains signes peuvent nécessiter une attention plus particulière. Si votre chien semble faire des mouvements violents, s’il se réveille en panique, ou s’il montre des signes de détresse (comme pleurer ou haleter), il pourrait s’agir d’autre chose, comme des crises d’épilepsie nocturnes ou des troubles du sommeil.J’ai rencontré un Berger australien qui se réveillait régulièrement en panique après des mouvements brusques dans son sommeil. Après avoir consulté un vétérinaire spécialisé, il s’est avéré qu’il souffrait d’un trouble nerveux, nécessitant un traitement adapté. Heureusement, ces cas sont rares, mais cela souligne l’importance de rester attentif aux comportements inhabituels et de consulter un professionnel si nécessaire.Quelques astuces pour favoriser un bon sommeil à votre chienMaintenant que nous avons démystifié le concept de chien somnambule, il est bon de se rappeler que le sommeil de votre compagnon à quatre pattes est crucial pour sa santé et son bien-être. Voici quelques astuces pour l’aider à mieux dormir :Une routine régulière : Comme pour nous, les chiens profitent d’une routine stable. Assurez-vous que votre chien ait des moments de calme avant le coucher, notamment pour les races énergétiques comme le Labrador ou le Berger australien.Un environnement confortable : Offrez-lui un espace de repos douillet et sans distractions. Un lit adapté à la taille de votre chien est un must, surtout pour les petites races comme les Bouledogues français.Des activités physiques et mentales : Fatiguer son esprit et son corps pendant la journée permet un sommeil plus profond. Un chien stimulé, qu’il soit grand ou petit, aura tendance à mieux dormir la nuit.Conclusion : patience et bienveillance pour un sommeil réparateurEn résumé, bien que le terme chien somnambule soit plus amusant qu’inquiétant, il est toujours important de rester à l’écoute de nos chiens. Leurs comportements nocturnes sont souvent une fenêtre sur leurs émotions et leur bien-être général.Et rappelez-vous, que vous ayez un Labrador plein d’énergie ou un Bouledogue ronfleur, la clé reste toujours la même : patience, observation et bienveillance.Après tout, qui sait ? Peut-être que votre chien rêve simplement de courir après une balle géante… ou de manger un bon steak juteux. Alors, laissez-le rêver en paix !

TITRE: Les besoins nutritionnels de votre chien
CATÉGORIE: Non catégorisé
CONTENU:
Bien comprendre les besoins nutritionnels de votre chien est très important. La nourriture joue un rôle primordial sur sa santé. Le chien est un omnivore, ce qui veut dire qu’il peut manger n’importe quelle nourriture (je ne tiens pas compte des chaussures ou tout autre objet que votre chien a l’habitude de manger ;-).Pour répondre aux besoins nutritionnels de votre chien il faut que son alimentation soit répartie en 6 groupes alimentaires.C’est la clef d’une alimentation équilibrée et d’un chien en pleine forme ! BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! De l’eau pour votre chienDe l’eau, de l’air, la vie ! C’est vrai pour vous et c’est aussi vrai pour votre chien. L’eau représente 60 à 70% du poids d’un chien adulte.Une partie des besoins en eau de votre chien se trouve dans sa nourriture (la nourriture en boite contient environ 78% d’eau et la nourriture sèche environ 10%).Il est donc primordial que votre chien ait accès à de l’eau fraîche (je ne parle pas de température, simplement renouvelez tous les jours la gamelle d’eau de votre chien).Petite précision pour ceux qui sont en train d’apprendre la propreté à leur chiot : vous pouvez surveiller et limiter la quantité d’eau que votre chiot absorbe (donner lui de l’eau à des moments spécifiques comme après la balade par exemple).En cas de forte chaleur ne prenez pas de risques, un chien se déshydrate rapidement (vous pouvez également lui mettre un glaçon à la place de l’eau, il l’absorbera plus lentement). Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! Des protéines pour votre chienLes protéines sont également très importantes pour votre chien. Elles vont lui fournir les acides aminés nécessaires au bon développement de son corps. Les protéines contiennent 23 acides aminés dont 10 sont essentiels pour la bonne santé de votre chien. Les autres sont également importants mais votre chien peut les fabriquer lui même.Généralement, on considère que les protéines animales sont plus intéressantes pour votre chien que les protéines végétales.Des minéraux pour votre chienLes minéraux n’ont aucune valeur énergétique mais ils font partie des besoins alimentaires de votre chien. Ils doivent être présents dans l’alimentation de votre chien car contrairement à certains acides aminés, les chiens ne peuvent pas les produire.Le fer, le magnésium, le zinc, le calcium vont permettre des réactions métaboliques assurant ainsi le bon fonctionnement de l’organisme de votre chien.Par exemple, sans minéraux dans son alimentation votre chien n’aura pas les os solides. Ils participent également à la bonne santé des dents de votre chien qui est un élément crucial pour lui et sa longévité (n’oubliez pas de brosser les dents de votre chien régulièrement et les vôtres aussi ;-).De la graisse pour votre chien Si votre chien n’a pas une belle peau ou une belle fourrure, surveillez ses besoins en graisse. La graisse a non seulement un rôle énergétique mais elle permet aussi à votre chien d’absorber certains vitamines qui se dissolvent dans la graisse.Autre point important, les chiens aiment les graisses. C’est très bien de répondre à ses besoins alimentaires mais il faut aussi prendre du plaisir dans tout ça ! Attention tout de même aux excès.La nourriture industrielle est généralement adaptée aux besoins de vos chiens mais attention aux petites friandises qui sont souvent un peu plus riches.Surtout si vous utilisez la nourriture pour le éduquer votre chien, n’oubliez pas de diminuer les quantités aux repas.Des vitamines pour votre chienVotre chien a besoin de vitamines, tout comme vous. Ils participent au bon fonctionnement de l’organisme ils sont indispensables aux échanges vitaux.Votre chien ne peut pas les synthétiser lui même, mais rassurez-vous si son alimentation est équilibrée, il aura les vitamines dont il a besoin.Inutile de donner des suppléments de vitamine à votre chien sauf si votre chien a une déficience et que votre vétérinaire vous le demande. Contrairement à ce qu’on pourrait croire, trop de vitamines peut être dangereux.Des glucides pour votre chienLes glucides sont le dernier élément des besoins nutritionnels de votre chien. Ils n’ont pas toujours bonne réputation et pourtant ils sont une aide précieuse pour le corps de votre chien.Ils permettent de conserver les intestins de votre chien en bon état et d’éviter des diarrhées ou constipation. Ils fournissent également de l’énergie aux tissus ce qui permet à votre chien de conserver ses protéines et de les utiliser à bon escient.Comme pour les graisses il faut contrôler et gérer les quantités, mise à part ça les glucides font partie intégrante des besoins nutritionnels de votre chien.

Vous vous êtes déjà demandé ce qui se passe dans la tête de votre chien quand il renifle le sol frénétiquement pendant plusieurs minutes ? Moi très souvent. Un célèbre humoriste expliquait dans l’un de ses spectacle qu’il était en train de « lire ses messages » (Jean-marie Bigard).C’est un peu plus compliqué que cela mais c’est surtout fascinant le nombre d’informations qu’un chien peut analyser avec sa truffe. Un chien possède 300 millions de cellules réceptrices olfactives tandis que l’homme n’en possède que 5 millions !Mais plutôt que de vous faire un long discours sur les incroyables capacités de votre chien je préfère partager avec vous une petite vidéo beaucoup amusante et instructive… Cette vidéo provient du site Ted ed. Si vous ne connaissez pas je vous recommande vivement de le visiter, vous y trouverez des centaines de vidéos du même type toutes plus intéressantes les unes que les autres.Vous pouvez également visiter le site Ted.com lui aussi riche en vidéo (ce ne sont pas des animations mais des conférences de spécialistes). Je suis personnellement abonné à leur chaînes Youtube et je suis régulièrement bluffé par leur contenu (même si je trouve qu’on ne parle pas assez des chiens mais je ne suis pas objectif ;-).Mais il faut rendre à césar ce qui appartient à césar, car ce n’est autre qu’Alexandra Horowitz qui est à l’origine de cette vidéo.Ce nom ne vous dit peut-être pas grand chose et pourtant elle est l’auteur du célèbre livre : Inside a dog : what dogs see, smell and know qui fut dans la liste du New york times bestseller pendant 63 semaines.Si vous n’êtes pas bilingue rassurez vous la version française est disponible ici : Dans la peau d’un chien et c’est un livre que je vous recommande vivement.Pour seulement 8 euros vous apprendrez énormément de choses sur votre chien.

C’est ce qui permet à votre chien de savoir si vous êtes triste ou si vous êtes en colère.Une occasion supplémentaire de rappeler à tout ceux qui essayent d’apprendre la propreté à leur chiot qu’il est inutile de crier sur un chien qui a fait ses besoins au mauvaise endroit (à mois que vous ne le preniez sur le fait).Votre chien a l’air de se sentir coupable, mais ce qu’il sent ce sont vos hormones de colère et c’est pour ça qu’il a l’air coupable mais il ne fait pas de lien avec la tâche sur votre moquette ;-)C’est beaucoup plus facile d’éduquer son chien quand on sait comment il fonctionne !La prochaine fois que votre chien renifle quelque chose pendant votre balade et que vous êtes pressé de rentrer, repensez à cette vidéo et laissez lui quelques minutes supplémentaire ;-) Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour !

CONTENU:
Pour le chien comme pour l’homme, l’oreille est un organe très sensible dont il faut prendre soin régulièrement.Les problèmes d’oreilles chez le chien représentent une bonne partie des visites chez le vétérinaire. Pourtant un simple nettoyage régulier peut vous éviter bien des tracas à vous et à votre chien.Alors voici comment nettoyer les oreilles de son chien, pourquoi et à quelle fréquence le faire… BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! La bonne méthode pour nettoyer les oreilles d’un chien ?Une petite vidéo est parfois beaucoup plus explicite qu’un long discours, alors voici comment nettoyer les oreilles de son chien avec le vétérinaire Blavier et son assistante : fusée… Anatomie d’une oreille de chienVoici l’anatomie de l’oreille d’un chien. Il n’est pas utile de la connaître précisément pour nettoyer les oreilles de son chien mais elle sera d’une grande aide pour les maîtres qui sont inquiets à l’idée de le faire.En effet contrairement à l’oreille humaine il n’y a pas de risque de percer le tympan de votre chien. Comme vous pouvez le voir sur cette image, le conduit auditif d’un chien forme un angle à 90 degrés.Donc si vous respectez les consignes pour nettoyer les oreilles de votre chien, il n’y a absolument aucun risque pour lui. Evidemment il faut toujours faire les choses en douceur mais détendez-vous, votre chien ne risque rien. Pourquoi nettoyer les oreilles de son chien ?Le but du nettoyage des oreilles d’un chien est d’éliminer le « cérumen » (cellule morte du conduit auditif plus les graisses des glandes cébacées).L’accumulation de cérumen est un milieu propice aux maladies des oreilles. Les chiens ne sont pas tous égaux fasse à ce problème.Les chiens aux oreilles tombantes ou très poilus sont plus facilement touchés par les maladies (cocker, bichon, caniche…).Le milieu dans lequel évolue votre chien a aussi sont importance (humidité, baignades, courants d’air…).Mais sachez que tous les chiens peuvent être touchés. Il suffit d’un mauvais entretien, d’un parasite, d’un corps étranger (épillets, sable) ou bien encore d’une allergie pour que les oreilles de votre chien s’infectent.Pour certains chiens, il est primordiale de contrôler et de nettoyer régulièrement les oreilles de son chien pour éviter tout problème et agir au plus tôt en cas de besoin.Quand nettoyer les oreilles de son chien ?Question délicate car tout dépend de votre chien. Certains chiens n’auront pas besoin de se faire nettoyer les oreilles et ne contracteront jamais de maladies. D’autres au contraire auront besoin d’un nettoyage journalier ou seulement mensuel.Lors de votre visite annuelle chez le vétérinaire n’hésitez pas à lui poser la question. Après avoir contrôlé les oreilles de votre chien à l’otoscope il saura vous conseiller.Mais que votre chien soit sujet ou non aux maladies des oreilles, n’oubliez pas de l’habituer le plus tôt possible à se faire manipuler. C’est le même principe que pour couper les griffes de son chien, lui brosser les dents, lui nettoyer les yeux et même pour le dressage de votre chien.Plus vous commencez tôt, plus les choses sont faciles. Dès son arrivée chez vous, même si ce n’est encore qu’un chiot et qu’il n’a pas de problème habituez le à se faire manipuler les oreilles en douceur.Si un jour votre chien a les oreilles infectées, il sera beaucoup plus facile de lui appliquer son traitement.

Quand on a la chance d’avoir un chien dans sa famille, on a envie qu’il sache à quel point il est important pour nous et à quel point on l’aime.Mais les chiens et les êtres humains communiquent différemment et sans même vous en rendre compte vous faites sûrement des choses qui dérangent ou agacent votre chien.Si votre chien pouvait parler, il commencerait sûrement par ces 5 choses à faire ou ne pas faire qui l’énervent profondément… BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! Faire un gros câlin à son chienQui n’a jamais serré son chien dans ses bras ? C’est un geste normal pour n’importe quel maître. Mais pour votre chien c’est un concept totalement inconnu.Beaucoup de chiens tolèrent ce geste mais ils ne le considèrent pas comme une preuve d’affection. Dans le monde des chiens ça ressemble plus à une menace qu’autre chose.Evidemment votre chien vous pardonne (un chien pardonne tout à son maître) mais essayez avec un autre chien ou demandez à une autre personne de serrer votre chien dans ses bras et observez-le.Si sa gueule se crispe, s’il baisse la tête ou si ses oreilles pointent vers l’arrière, votre chien n’apprécie pas vraiment ce type de câlin.Mais rassurez-vous, si vous voulez montrer à votre chien que vous l’aimez, vous avez beaucoup d’autres solutions. Il vous suffit de le caresser : la poitrine, le dos, les oreilles à vous de voir ce que votre chien préfère.Si vous voulez lui faire plaisir vous pouvez aussi jouer avec lui. Enfin vous pouvez aussi lui offrir une friandise, c’est l’ultime preuve d’affection pour votre chien ! Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! Parler le langage des chiensJe parle à mon chien régulièrement (et je suis sur que je ne suis pas le seul ;-)Mais je sais très bien qu’il ne me comprend pas. Une fois que vous aurez travaillé le dressage de votre chien il comprendra quelques mots comme assis, couché, pas bougé,.. mais le langage préféré de votre chien c’est le langage corporel.C’est d’ailleurs ce qui fait du chien un compagnon en or, juste en nous en observant ils savent si on est heureux, stressé ou triste. Donc la meilleure façon de communiquer avec votre chien est d’utiliser votre corps.D’ailleurs pour faciliter son dressage je vous recommande de toujours associer un geste à un ordre. Vous verrez qu’il apprendra plus vite et répondra beaucoup plus vite à vos ordres.De votre coté, essayez d’apprendre le langage corporel de votre chien. Comment sont ses oreilles quand il est détendu, quand il est nerveux, comment il remue la queue quand il est heureux…Si vous savez lire le langage corporel de votre chien, vous le comprendrez plus facilement et donc vous pourrez mieux communiquer avec lui.Laisser votre chien explorer Apprendre à son chien à marcher en laisse sans tirer est très important, mais il ne faut pas tomber dans l’excès non plus.Avoir un chien qui marche tranquillement à vos cotés rend les balades plus agréables pour vous mais pas forcément pour votre chien.Après une dure journée de travail, la balade de votre chien peut vite ressembler à une corvée. Mais gardez en tête que votre chien attend votre retour toute la journée et il attend surtout cette balade : le meilleur moment de sa journée !Les chiens voient le monde à travers leur odorat. Lorsque vous passez près d’un simple buisson, votre chien y voit beaucoup plus de chose qu’un simple buisson.Il sent si un autre chien est passé, s’il était en forme ou malade ou en chaleur.Je vous invite à regarder cette petite vidéo pour mieux vous rendre compte à quel point l’odorat de votre chien est magique : L’odorat du chien pour les nuls.Promener votre chien lui permet de faire ses besoins, de se dépenser physiquement mais aussi de le stimuler mentalement. C’est un véritable film qui va se dérouler dans sa tête pendant cette balade, à condition que vous le laissiez explorer un minimum.Il ne s’agit pas de le laisser guider la balade mais plutôt de l’accompagner. Lorsqu’il tire sur la laisse, laissez-le flairer et voir le film jusqu’au bout. Faites cette effort régulièrement pendant vos promenades et votre chien appréciera !Occuper son chienC’est sûrement l’une des choses les plus ennuyeuses pour votre chien : n’avoir rien à faire. Vous devez donner une occupation à votre chien, quelque chose à faire qui le stimule physiquement et mentalement.Vous pouvez travailler son dressage, quelques minutes par jour (si vous n’avez pas encore de méthode pour l’éducation de votre chien je vous recommande : Dresser son chien en 15 minutes par jour).A chaque fois que vous faîtes quelque chose avec votre chien, faîtes le travailler. Avant de lui donner sa gamelle, travaillez l’ordre assis ou couché. Vous pouvez également travailler ces ordres avant de partir en balade devant la porte.Vous pouvez utiliser des jouets pour chien qui distribuent la nourriture comme celui-ci. Ce sera beaucoup plus stimulant pour votre chien que de lui laisser sa gamelle pleine.Vous pouvez également faire du sport avec lui : courir, faire du vélo, du roller, du frisbee…Bref tout les moyens sont bons, du moment que vous demandez à votre chien de bouger, penser, travailler, il sera le plus heureux des chiens !Ne pas récompenser votre chienTout travail mérite salaire et c’est aussi valable pour votre chien. Votre chien n’a pas besoin d’argent, en revanche il adore jouer, se faire caresser et les friandises.La nature humaine a tendance à ignorer les bons comportements et à réprimander les erreurs.Malheureusement c’est la pire méthode pour enseigner et éduquer (et ça ne concerne pas seulement l’éducation des chiens).En réalité si vous voulez un chien bien éduqué, vous devez absolument faire l’inverse !Vous devez absolument récompenser votre chien lorsqu’il a les bons comportements, c’est beaucoup plus important que de prendre votre chien en flagrant délit lorsqu’il fait une erreur.Il est préférable d’éduquer son chien sans jamais le réprimander, uniquement en le récompensant.Si vous surprenez votre chien en train de faire une bêtise, il vous suffit de dire non et de le rediriger vers quelque chose qu’il a le droit de faire. Si vous arrivez après la bêtise, prenez sur vous. Punir votre chien ne servira à rien.S’il y a d’autres choses qui énervent votre chien n’hésitez pas à les partager !

Ils participent au bon fonctionnement de l’organisme ils sont indispensables aux échanges vitaux.Votre chien ne peut pas les synthétiser lui même, mais rassurez-vous si son alimentation est équilibrée, il aura les vitamines dont il a besoin.Inutile de donner des suppléments de vitamine à votre chien sauf si votre chien a une déficience et que votre vétérinaire vous le demande. Contrairement à ce qu’on pourrait croire, trop de vitamines peut être dangereux.Des glucides pour votre chienLes glucides sont le dernier élément des besoins nutritionnels de votre chien. Ils n’ont pas toujours bonne réputation et pourtant ils sont une aide précieuse pour le corps de votre chien.Ils permettent de conserver les intestins de votre chien en bon état et d’éviter des diarrhées ou constipation. Ils fournissent également de l’énergie aux tissus ce qui permet à votre chien de conserver ses protéines et de les utiliser à bon escient.Comme pour les graisses il faut contrôler et gérer les quantités, mise à part ça les glucides font partie intégrante des besoins nutritionnels de votre chien.

CATÉGORIE: Non catégorisé
CONTENU:
Rendre votre chiot propre demande de la patience, de la persévérance et de la rigueur. C’est une épreuve difficile pour de nombreux maîtres et pour leur chiot.Donc, autant utiliser tous les outils qui pourraient vous faciliter la vie ou accélérer l’apprentissage de la propreté de votre chiot !Voici donc la liste des meilleurs outils pour rendre votre chiot propre. La bonne nouvelle, c’est que je suis sûr que vous en avez déjà une bonne partie sous la main ! BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! Caisse / Enclos / BarrièresLimiter l’espace de votre chiot est très utile pour lui apprendre la propreté.C’est également le meilleur moyen d’avoir un chiot en pleine forme. Votre chiot a besoin d’une tanière, d’un coin où il peut se reposer, à l’abri de tout ce qu’il n’aime pas.Un chiot reposé, sera beaucoup plus apte à apprendre de nouvelles choses comme la propreté, le rappel, marcher en laisse…Il fera tout ce qui est en son pouvoir pour ne pas salir son petit coin de paradis. Un enclos Trixie (avec fond imperméabilisé) ou simplement un coin de votre salon bien aménagé sera donc une aide précieuse pour rendre votre chiot propre.Un emploi du tempsUn outil indispensable et totalement gratuit pour l’apprentissage de la propreté : l’emploi du temps de votre chiot.Pour apprendre la propreté à votre chiot, il est préférable d’être le plus routinier possible. Levez-vous à la même heure, sortez votre chiot aux mêmes heures, donnez lui ses repas aux mêmes horaires, ….Plus vous serez routinier, plus votre chiot apprendra rapidement la propreté. Vous pourrez également mieux comprendre et donc anticiper les besoins de votre chiot.Si vous savez quand il a besoin de se soulager, vous pourrez l’emmener au bon endroit au bon moment. Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! Un bon téléphoneVotre téléphone est un précieux assistant pour rendre votre chiot propre.Si vous souhaitez que votre chiot mange et se soulage aux mêmes horaires tous les jours, utilisez l’alarme de votre téléphone ainsi que le minuteur.Nous avons tous des milliers de choses en tête alors autant vous soulager de cette corvée. Ainsi vous serez sûr de ne jamais être en retard pour les repas ou les sorties de votre chiot !C’est le meilleur moyen de ne pas arriver après la bataille et de devoir nettoyer la moquette.Tapis de propreté et/ou litièreUne litière et des tapis de propreté ne sont pas obligatoires pour rendre votre chiot propre. Au contraire, si vous souhaitez que votre chiot fasse ses besoins dehors, inutile de les utiliser.En revanche si vous souhaitez lui apprendre à faire ses besoins à l’intérieur de façon provisoire ou parce que vous êtes absent une bonne partie de la journée et qu’il ne peut pas se retenir indéfiniment, alors ce sont de très bons outils.Ils vous faciliteront le nettoyage et en période d’apprentissage, c’est un gros atout ! N’hésitez pas à jeter un oeil sur notre article complet pour bien utiliser un tapis de propreté.Produits de nettoyage adaptésMauvais nettoyage = nouvel accident. Si votre chiot sent une odeur d’urine, il ne pourra pas s’empêcher de « remettre une couche ». C’est instinctif et il ne peut pas résister !Donc si vous nettoyez mal un accident, votre chiot ne pourra pas s’empêcher de reproduire cet accident encore et encore.N’oubliez pas que l’odorat de votre chiot est mille fois plus développé que celui d’un être humain. Un chiot placé dans un stade de foot peut sentir le parfum d’un spectateur placé dans les tribunes !Donc prenez des produits de nettoyage adaptés qui vont à la fois nettoyer mais aussi tuer toutes les odeurs. C’est d’une importance capitale !Détecteur d’urineIl est parfois difficile de repérer les accidents de votre chiot. Surtout si vous avez utilisé de mauvaises méthodes d’éducation et qu’il commence à se cacher pour faire ses besoins.Heureusement, il existe des lampes qui permettent de détecter les accidents.Le coté série policière peut faire sourire mais croyez-moi, c’est la douche froide pour certains maîtres quand ils se rendent compte de l’état de leur appartement.Le gros avantage, c’est qu’une fois les accidents repérés, il suffit de les nettoyer correctement pour partir sur une base saine. L’apprentissage de la propreté du chiot est ensuite beaucoup plus facile !Sac à excrémentSi votre chiot fait ses excréments dehors, n’oubliez pas de ramasser derrière lui. Un chiot, comme un être humain, préfère faire ses besoins dans un endroit propre.Donc si vous souhaitez que votre chiot fasse toujours au même endroit, vous devez faire en sorte que cet endroit reste propre.Il existe aujourd’hui des petits distributeurs de sacs à excrément que vous pouvez attacher à la laisse de votre chiot. Si vous n’en avez pas, emmenez toujours au moins 2 sacs avec vous. Il arrivera un jour ou votre chiot fera ses besoins en plusieurs fois.Croyez-en mon expérience, vous serez bien embêté si vous n’avez qu’un sac (oui ça m’est arrivé et je vous épargnerai les détails ;-).Une formation pour rendre votre chiot propreEn moyenne et avec les bonnes méthodes, il faut entre une semaine et quinze jours pour qu’un chiot comprenne le principe de la propreté. Il aura encore des accidents occasionnellement mais ils ne ralentiront pas son apprentissage.Pourtant, je vois régulièrement des maîtres passer des mois sur la propreté et c’est peut-être votre cas.Rendre votre chiot propre n’est que la première pierre de l’édifice, vous avez encore énormément de choses à lui apprendre, et des choses vraiment beaucoup plus amusantes ! Alors ne perdez pas votre temps avec ça !Suivez la formation pour dresser son chien en 15 minutes par jour et réglez une bonne fois pour toute les problèmes de propreté de votre chiot. C’est une méthode simple, efficace et douce. Elle vous donnera des premiers résultats en moins de 24H et vous pourrez enfin passer au coté fun de l’éducation de votre chiot… Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour !

TITRE: Les besoins nutritionnels de votre chien
CATÉGORIE: Non catégorisé
CONTENU:
Bien comprendre les besoins nutritionnels de votre chien est très important. La nourriture joue un rôle primordial sur sa santé. Le chien est un omnivore, ce qui veut dire qu’il peut manger n’importe quelle nourriture (je ne tiens pas compte des chaussures ou tout autre objet que votre chien a l’habitude de manger ;-).Pour répondre aux besoins nutritionnels de votre chien il faut que son alimentation soit répartie en 6 groupes alimentaires.C’est la clef d’une alimentation équilibrée et d’un chien en pleine forme ! BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! De l’eau pour votre chienDe l’eau, de l’air, la vie ! C’est vrai pour vous et c’est aussi vrai pour votre chien. L’eau représente 60 à 70% du poids d’un chien adulte.Une partie des besoins en eau de votre chien se trouve dans sa nourriture (la nourriture en boite contient environ 78% d’eau et la nourriture sèche environ 10%).Il est donc primordial que votre chien ait accès à de l’eau fraîche (je ne parle pas de température, simplement renouvelez tous les jours la gamelle d’eau de votre chien).Petite précision pour ceux qui sont en train d’apprendre la propreté à leur chiot : vous pouvez surveiller et limiter la quantité d’eau que votre chiot absorbe (donner lui de l’eau à des moments spécifiques comme après la balade par exemple).En cas de forte chaleur ne prenez pas de risques, un chien se déshydrate rapidement (vous pouvez également lui mettre un glaçon à la place de l’eau, il l’absorbera plus lentement). Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! Des protéines pour votre chienLes protéines sont également très importantes pour votre chien. Elles vont lui fournir les acides aminés nécessaires au bon développement de son corps. Les protéines contiennent 23 acides aminés dont 10 sont essentiels pour la bonne santé de votre chien. Les autres sont également importants mais votre chien peut les fabriquer lui même.Généralement, on considère que les protéines animales sont plus intéressantes pour votre chien que les protéines végétales.Des minéraux pour votre chienLes minéraux n’ont aucune valeur énergétique mais ils font partie des besoins alimentaires de votre chien. Ils doivent être présents dans l’alimentation de votre chien car contrairement à certains acides aminés, les chiens ne peuvent pas les produire.Le fer, le magnésium, le zinc, le calcium vont permettre des réactions métaboliques assurant ainsi le bon fonctionnement de l’organisme de votre chien.Par exemple, sans minéraux dans son alimentation votre chien n’aura pas les os solides. Ils participent également à la bonne santé des dents de votre chien qui est un élément crucial pour lui et sa longévité (n’oubliez pas de brosser les dents de votre chien régulièrement et les vôtres aussi ;-).De la graisse pour votre chien Si votre chien n’a pas une belle peau ou une belle fourrure, surveillez ses besoins en graisse. La graisse a non seulement un rôle énergétique mais elle permet aussi à votre chien d’absorber certains vitamines qui se dissolvent dans la graisse.Autre point important, les chiens aiment les graisses. C’est très bien de répondre à ses besoins alimentaires mais il faut aussi prendre du plaisir dans tout ça ! Attention tout de même aux excès.La nourriture industrielle est généralement adaptée aux besoins de vos chiens mais attention aux petites friandises qui sont souvent un peu plus riches.Surtout si vous utilisez la nourriture pour le éduquer votre chien, n’oubliez pas de diminuer les quantités aux repas.Des vitamines pour votre chienVotre chien a besoin de vitamines, tout comme vous.

Choisissez un nom court ou facilement prononçable.Si vous êtes fan d’histoire, vous pourriez être tenté d’appeler votre chien Napoléon, mais vous ne faciliterez pas la vie de votre chien et de toute façon vous finirez par l’appeler Nana ou Napo.L’autre solution consiste à détourner un mot que vous aimez. Prenons le thème de la pâtisserie et imaginons que vous êtes fan de chouquettes. Remplacez le C par un N et vous obtenez Nouquette ;-) C’est drôle et originale !Vous pouvez également vous servir des noms de vos proches. Il suffit de prendre quelques lettres des prénoms de ceux qui partagent votre vie, de mixer et d’ajouter un N !Prenez votre temps pour bien choisir le nom de votre chien et n’oubliez pas de partager cette article avec vos proches qui pourront eux aussi vous donner de très bonnes idées.J’ai oublié des noms ?

TITRE: Les besoins nutritionnels de votre chien
CATÉGORIE: Non catégorisé
CONTENU:
Bien comprendre les besoins nutritionnels de votre chien est très important. La nourriture joue un rôle primordial sur sa santé. Le chien est un omnivore, ce qui veut dire qu’il peut manger n’importe quelle nourriture (je ne tiens pas compte des chaussures ou tout autre objet que votre chien a l’habitude de manger ;-).Pour répondre aux besoins nutritionnels de votre chien il faut que son alimentation soit répartie en 6 groupes alimentaires.C’est la clef d’une alimentation équilibrée et d’un chien en pleine forme ! BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! De l’eau pour votre chienDe l’eau, de l’air, la vie ! C’est vrai pour vous et c’est aussi vrai pour votre chien. L’eau représente 60 à 70% du poids d’un chien adulte.Une partie des besoins en eau de votre chien se trouve dans sa nourriture (la nourriture en boite contient environ 78% d’eau et la nourriture sèche environ 10%).Il est donc primordial que votre chien ait accès à de l’eau fraîche (je ne parle pas de température, simplement renouvelez tous les jours la gamelle d’eau de votre chien).Petite précision pour ceux qui sont en train d’apprendre la propreté à leur chiot : vous pouvez surveiller et limiter la quantité d’eau que votre chiot absorbe (donner lui de l’eau à des moments spécifiques comme après la balade par exemple).En cas de forte chaleur ne prenez pas de risques, un chien se déshydrate rapidement (vous pouvez également lui mettre un glaçon à la place de l’eau, il l’absorbera plus lentement). Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! Des protéines pour votre chienLes protéines sont également très importantes pour votre chien. Elles vont lui fournir les acides aminés nécessaires au bon développement de son corps. Les protéines contiennent 23 acides aminés dont 10 sont essentiels pour la bonne santé de votre chien. Les autres sont également importants mais votre chien peut les fabriquer lui même.Généralement, on considère que les protéines animales sont plus intéressantes pour votre chien que les protéines végétales.Des minéraux pour votre chienLes minéraux n’ont aucune valeur énergétique mais ils font partie des besoins alimentaires de votre chien. Ils doivent être présents dans l’alimentation de votre chien car contrairement à certains acides aminés, les chiens ne peuvent pas les produire.Le fer, le magnésium, le zinc, le calcium vont permettre des réactions métaboliques assurant ainsi le bon fonctionnement de l’organisme de votre chien.Par exemple, sans minéraux dans son alimentation votre chien n’aura pas les os solides. Ils participent également à la bonne santé des dents de votre chien qui est un élément crucial pour lui et sa longévité (n’oubliez pas de brosser les dents de votre chien régulièrement et les vôtres aussi ;-).De la graisse pour votre chien Si votre chien n’a pas une belle peau ou une belle fourrure, surveillez ses besoins en graisse. La graisse a non seulement un rôle énergétique mais elle permet aussi à votre chien d’absorber certains vitamines qui se dissolvent dans la graisse.Autre point important, les chiens aiment les graisses. C’est très bien de répondre à ses besoins alimentaires mais il faut aussi prendre du plaisir dans tout ça ! Attention tout de même aux excès.La nourriture industrielle est généralement adaptée aux besoins de vos chiens mais attention aux petites friandises qui sont souvent un peu plus riches.Surtout si vous utilisez la nourriture pour le éduquer votre chien, n’oubliez pas de diminuer les quantités aux repas.Des vitamines pour votre chienVotre chien a besoin de vitamines, tout comme vous. Ils participent au bon fonctionnement de l’organisme ils sont indispensables aux échanges vitaux.Votre chien ne peut pas les synthétiser lui même, mais rassurez-vous si son alimentation est équilibrée, il aura les vitamines dont il a besoin.Inutile de donner des suppléments de vitamine à votre chien sauf si votre chien a une déficience et que votre vétérinaire vous le demande. Contrairement à ce qu’on pourrait croire, trop de vitamines peut être dangereux.Des glucides pour votre chienLes glucides sont le dernier élément des besoins nutritionnels de votre chien. Ils n’ont pas toujours bonne réputation et pourtant ils sont une aide précieuse pour le corps de votre chien.Ils permettent de conserver les intestins de votre chien en bon état et d’éviter des diarrhées ou constipation. Ils fournissent également de l’énergie aux tissus ce qui permet à votre chien de conserver ses protéines et de les utiliser à bon escient.Comme pour les graisses il faut contrôler et gérer les quantités, mise à part ça les glucides font partie intégrante des besoins nutritionnels de votre chien.

TITRE: Eviter l’empoisonnement de votre chien
CATÉGORIE: Non catégorisé
CONTENU:
Chien empoisonné à la strychnine, par un appât, par accident… malheureusement l’empoisonnement d’un chien est assez fréquent.Cela fait froid dans le dos et pourtant cette triste réalité existe belle et bien quand on a un chien et il est préférable de prendre quelques précautions pour éviter que son chien se fasse empoisonner ou qu’il s’empoisonne lui-même.Heureusement, il est possible de réduire le risque de voir son chien empoisonné même s’il ne sera jamais nul.Un empoisonnement résulte soit d’un acte de malveillance (appâts déposés sur les chemins ou lancés dans les jardins) soit d’un accident (un chien qui fouille une poubelle, qui lèche un produit toxique, qui avale un rongeur ayant absorbé du raticide).Les chances de sauver le chien sont très faibles et dépendent de sa taille ainsi que de la quantité de poison ingérée.Ainsi, dresser son chien à ne pas accepter sans votre permission la nourriture qu’on lui donne peut lui sauver la vie et lui éviter des désagréments comme la diarrhée. Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! Concrètement, comment faire pour éviter l’empoisonnement du chien?En tenant hors de portée du chien, et surtout d’un chiot, les produits dangereux.En ne le laissant pas fouiller les poubelles. Si vous savez que votre chien est trop gourmand pour résister, tenez-le en laisse dans les zones à risque, il en va de sa survie.En ne lui donnant pas l’habitude de manger des choses qui traînent par terre.En le dressant à l’ordre « Pas Toucher » et à refuser la nourriture jetée par terre : demandez à une personne de jeter un appât par terre. Ne quittez pas le chien du regard et dès que le chien adopte une attitude laissant suspecter qu’il va le manger, dîtes un « Non » ou « Pas Toucher » ferme.Félicitez-le ensuite et récompensez-le pour son bon comportement.En ne l’habituant pas à lui donner de la nourriture à la main. Il sera plus difficile d’apprendre au chien à refuser de la nourriture donnée à la main par un étranger s’il a été habitué à recevoir de la nourriture de cette manière par son maître.En dressant votre chien à l’ordre « Pas Toucher » et à refuser la nourriture donnée à la main par un étranger : demandez à une personne de tendre un appât à votre chien. Dès que le chien s’approche de l’appât pour le manger, dîtes un « Pas toucher » ou « Non » ferme et félicitez-le de vous avoir écouté. Vous pouvez le récompenser par des caresses et des friandises.Existe-t-il des inconvénients ? Oui, lorsque vous avez dressé un chien à n’accepter que la nourriture donnée par son maître, le problème se pose quand le maître ne peut pas donner à manger à son chien : séjour à l’hôpital, vacances, déplacement professionnel, etc.Le chien s’il a un bon refus d’appât va refuser automatiquement la nourriture venant des étrangers.Pour y remédier, il suffit de dresser son chien à autoriser la prise de nourriture venant d’une deuxième personne ou des membres de la famille.Sachez que le refus d’appât efficace à 100% n’existe pas.Vous pouvez surveiller votre chien pour qu’il refuse de la nourriture venant d’étrangers mais quand il est tout seul, une boulette de viande lancée par-dessus un mur dans le jardin ne restera pas longtemps au sol !Le Saviez-vous ?Attention ! L’ail, l’oignon et le chocolat sont des substances mortelles pour les chiens. La dose mortelle est bien entendu fonction de la taille de l’animal, mais le mieux est de ne pas l’habituer à en manger.Le chocolat est également du poison pour les rongeurs et les oiseaux. Bien sûr, tout le monde connait un chien qui a l’habitude de manger du chocolat.Mais avez-vous vraiment envie de tester les capacités de votre chien à supporter un empoisonnement au chocolat ?En bref !Même si le risque zéro n’existe pas, tous ces dangers peuvent être évités par une vigilance sans faille du maître.Ils peuvent également être éviter si vous dresser correctement votre chien. La plupart du temps on commence à dresser son chien pour lui apprendre à être propre ou à ne pas sauter sur les invités.Mais donner une bonne éducation à son chien est également vitale pour lui. Un chien bien éduqué saura éviter le piège de l’empoisonnement.Etre le maître d’un chien, c’est aussi le protéger des dangers dont il n’a pas conscience.C’est l’une des raisons pour lesquelles il est important d’apprendre à dresser son chien.

Garder les troupeaux, tirer les charrettes, et bien sûr, être de fidèles compagnons.Ces poilus robustes ont été créés avec un mélange savant de races locales et de chiens de bouvier importés.

TITRE: Signes et symptômes que votre chien souffre
CATÉGORIE: Non catégorisé
CONTENU:
Généralement, il est assez facile de savoir si quelqu’un est malade ou souffre. D’abord parce que cette personne va s’en plaindre mais aussi parce que son corps va le signaler d’une manière ou d’une autre.Pour les chiens c’est un peu plus compliqué. D’abord parce qu’ils ne peuvent pas communiquer clairement avec nous leurs souffrances. Et même s’ils essayent de nous signaler leur douleur, les symptômes ne sont jamais très clairs.Heureusement il y a quelques indices qui peuvent vous permettre de savoir si votre chien souffre bien plus qu’il ne le laisse paraître. BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! Votre chien s’exprime plus que d’habitudeMême si votre chien joue les durs, il y a de fortes chances pour qu’il s’exprime plus que d’habitude lorsqu’il souffre.Malheureusement à moins que ce ne soit directement lié à quelque chose de physique (lorsqu’il pose sa patte arrière droite par exemple) c’est très difficile de savoir exactement ce qui le fait souffrir.Un chien qui souffre va s’exprimer de différentes manières : gémissements, pleurs, jappements, grognements, aboiements, hurlements…Bref si votre chien s’exprime plus que d’habitude, il est possible qu’une partie de son corps le fasse souffrir. Inspectez votre chien au plus vite et emmenez le chez son vétérinaire si vous ne trouvez rien et que les symptômes persistent.Une toilette excessiveQuand un chien est blessé, son instinct le pousse à nettoyer et soigner la plaie en la léchant. S’il s’agit d’une blessure externe comme une coupure, égratignure ou brulure, il est assez facile de le repérer et d’aider votre chien à guérir.En revanche les chiens vont avoir le même comportement si c’est une douleur interne et même en y regardant de prés vous ne verrez rien. A vous de surveiller et si votre chien insiste il faudra consulter votre vétérinaire.Des différences dans son alimentation ou son sommeil Beaucoup de chien vont changer leurs habitudes d’alimentation ou de sommeil s’ils souffrent.Ils vont par exemple dormir plus souvent et plus longtemps pour essayer de guérir ou parce que bouger réveille la douleur.De la même façon leur appétit peut être modifié. En général un chien qui souffre va perdre de l’appétit mais une augmentation soudaine peut aussi être un signe que votre chien n’est pas bien.Même chose pour l’eau, si votre chien souffre vous pouvez constater des changements d’habitude.Un changement significatif et soudain de ces éléments est souvent le signe que votre chien souffre.Une respiration difficileLa respiration de votre chien est également un bon indice pour savoir s’il souffre. Si votre chien a l’air essoufflé alors qu’il ne fait pas plus d’activité que d’habitude il est possible qu’il soit malade.Si sa respiration vous paraît plus rapide ou moins puissante, votre chien est peut-être malade ou a ingéré quelque chose qui gêne sa respiration.Allez consulter au plus vite !Des yeux différentsUn chien qui plisse des yeux de manière plus fréquente qu’à la normale peut être le signe qu’il a mal aux yeux. Observer sa pupille, une pupille plus petite est le signe d’une douleur aux yeux.A l’inverse une pupille plus large est le signe d’une douleur dans une autre partie de son corps. Sachez également qu’un chien qui se lèche les pattes pour se frotter les yeux a sûrement une douleur provenant des yeux.Commencez par lui nettoyer les yeux et si le problème persiste il vaut mieux consulter.Votre chien a du mal à se « poser »Si votre chien souffre il peut ressentir une douleur lorsqu’il s’assoit ou se couche.Si vous constatez que votre chien s’assoit ou se couche dans des positions étranges vous devriez vérifier si votre chien a une blessure (mais je ne parle pas de ces superbes poses que nos chiens prennent quand ils dorment ;-).Si votre chien essaye de s’assoir ou de se coucher et que quelques secondes après il se lève pour bouger et réessaye c’est un signe (généralement accompagné d’un bruit quand il se lève).Changement de style affectif Certains chiens vont se mettre à fuir leur maître lorsqu’ils souffrent, ils vont essayer de se cacher pour être tranquilles et guérir.D’autres peuvent devenir agressifs, se mettre à grogner quand vous approchez et même mordre par peur que vous ne leur fassiez plus mal encore.C’est leur instinct de protection qui reprend le dessus.Enfin certains chiens vont devenir encore plus affectifs que d’habitude et être en recherche permanente de votre affection.Donc si vous constatez un changement de comportement dans l’affection de votre chien, n’y voyez rien de personnel, il se peut tout simplement qu’il souffre de quelque chose.Détecter quand votre chien souffreMême si ces signes ne sont pas toujours très clairs et ne vous indiquent pas clairement d’où vient le problème, un comportement inhabituel de votre chien peut être le signe qu’il souffre de quelque chose.L’une des choses que vous pouvez faire dans un premier temps est de vérifier si votre chien a une blessure externe. Si il n’y a aucun signe, vous pouvez palper votre chien avec douceur mais fermeté comme le ferez votre vétérinaire pour savoir s’il souffre.Une chose est sûre : plus vous observerez votre chien, plus vous serez proche de lui au quotidien et plus il vous sera facile de détecter rapidement si son comportement est inhabituel. Vous pourrez ainsi être plus réactif dès que votre chien montrera des signes de souffrance.Alors arrêtez de surfer et allez voir si votre chien va bien !

Choisir un nom de chien en B pourrait être impossible en 2024, surtout si vous visez l’enregistrement officiel en tant que « Chien de race ».Certains pays, tels que le Luxembourg, la Belgique et la France, exigent que la première lettre du nom des chiens de race suive une séquence annuelle spécifique.En France et au Luxembourg, la lettre de l’année est le « V » (voir notre liste de noms en V), tandis qu’en Belgique, c’est le « X » (voir notre liste de noms en X). Ces règles ont été instaurées à une époque où l’informatique n’existait pas, compliquant l’enregistrement des chiens et de leurs pedigrees.Cependant, si vraiment vous préférez un nom commençant par un B, vous avez la possibilité d’enregistrer un nom d’usage en plus du nom officiel, offrant ainsi une certaine flexibilité dans le choix du nom quotidien de votre chien.Une autre option consiste à choisir le nom que vous préférez et à ajouter simplement la lettre de l’année devant, même si cela peut parfois donner des noms officiels peu conventionnels.Si vous êtes toujours partant pour un nom de chien en B, c’est parti pour la liste !Noms de chien en B affectueuxBienvenue dans le monde des noms de chien ou chienne en B empreints de tendresse.

Cependant, veillez à ne pas créer un nom trop complexe, assurez-vous que le choix respecte les conseils suivants…Astuces pratiques pour bien choisir le nom de votre chien Voici 3 conseils pour garantir que le nom de votre chien soit pratique pour vous et facile à assimiler pour lui. Tout d’abord, optez pour un nom facile à prononcer, sans connotation négative, insultante ou gênante. Envisagez-vous de crier le nom de votre chien dans un parc public : « Buddy, viens ici ! » par exemple.Ensuite, évitez les prénoms humains pour éviter toute confusion. Même si Boris est un prénom charmant, son utilisation peut être problématique si une personne du même nom entre dans votre vie. Cela pourrait perturber votre chien qui risquerait de ne plus reconnaître son appel distinctif.Enfin, privilégiez un prénom court et facile à prononcer. Des termes tels que « Bella » ou « Balou » sont idéaux, car ils sont succincts et efficaces. Optez de préférence pour un nom court, idéalement avec deux syllabes et terminant par une voyelle, car ces prénoms sont plus facilement identifiables pour votre chien. « Bono » ou « Bella » pourraient ainsi être d’excellents choix.Commencer l’apprentissage du nom de votre chien : une première étape cruciale dans son éducation Choisir le nom de votre chien est crucial, mais l’apprendre correctement l’est tout autant. Lorsque votre chien réagit à son nom, le reste de son éducation devient plus simple.Pour lui enseigner son nom, débutez dans une pièce calme avec des friandises à portée de main ou un jouet. Appelez-le, félicitez-le s’il réagit, offrez-lui une friandise et des caresses. Attendez une minute et répétez.Après quelques sessions, votre chien devrait rapidement comprendre son nom, associant le fait de vous regarder à une expérience positive.L’éducation de votre chien commence dès son arrivée chez vous. Préparez-vous au mieux, car il y a beaucoup à apprendre. Pour vous aider à être prêt, consultez ces articles essentiels :Bien se préparer pour l’arrivée d’un chiotPremier jour et première nuit avec votre chiotLes bases pour éduquer un chiotApprendre la propreté à son chiot rapidementJ’ai oublié un nom de chien en B, vous avez une idée à partager ?

TITRE: La bonne méthode pour nourrir son chien
CATÉGORIE: Non catégorisé
CONTENU:
A l’origine les chiens vivent en meute. Le dominant mange en premier, sous le regard des autres qui attendent respectueusement leur tour.Ce système fait partie des instincts du chien et si vous ne prêtez pas attention à la prise des repas de votre chien vous allez au devant de problèmes comportementaux (chien qui devient dominant et agressif dans la plupart des cas).Voici donc la bonne méthode pour nourrir votre chien. BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! Gardez le contrôle de la nourriture de votre chienGardez ce principe en tête lorsque vous nourrissez votre chien. Vous devez contrôler le temps, le lieu, la quantité…Votre chien doit manger à heure fixe. Le repas de votre chien ne doit pas durer plus de 15 minutes. Passé ce délai, retirez lui sa gamelle. Votre chien ne la reverra qu’à l’heure du repas suivant.Pour les chiots (entre 2 et 5 mois par exemple) le temps de repas doit être un peu plus long (30 minutes max).Attention également dans certains cas (maladie, blessure, …) votre chien aura besoin de plus de temps pour ce nourrir donc soyez attentif aux situations exceptionnelles.Votre chien doit toujours prendre son repas après vous : le chef mange en premier ! Evidemment c’est plus compliqué si vous avez un chiot qui mange plusieurs fois par jour. Mais à partir de 6 mois respectez la règle.Laissez votre chien tranquille lorsqu’il mange, ne le regardez pas prendre son repas. La meilleure solution étant de le laisser seul dans la pièce de votre choix (une pièce différente de celle ou vous manger).Enfin lorsque vous mangez ne laissez pas votre chien s’approcher de la table ni réclamer de la nourriture. Et bien sur ne lui en donnez pas (n’oubliez pas de passer les consignes au reste de la famille ;-) Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! Dresser son chien même pendant les repasLa préparation des repas et la prise des repas sont de formidables occasions de dresser votre chien.Ne laissez pas votre chien vous bousculer quand vous préparez la nourriture et ne le laissez pas se jeter sur sa gamelle. Faîtes de ce moment intense pour votre chien un exercice de dressage.Apprenez lui à rester assis et à vous regarder quand vous préparez son repas. Apprenez lui à attendre votre signal avant de pouvoir commencer à manger. C’est un peu plus dur pour un chiot mais n’hésitez pas à utiliser la laisse si nécessaire.Ne donnez pas de friandises à votre chien si il n’a rien fait pour les recevoir. J’ai vu certains maîtres utiliser les friandises comme un « dessert » après le repas. Votre chien n’a pas besoin de dessert, les friandises doivent vous permettre de dresser votre chien, de le récompenser en cas de bon comportement.Si il ne fait rien pour les mériter, vous aurez plus de mal à lui faire faire quelque chose par la suite. Donc gardez les pour le récompenser si il se tient correctement pendant que vous préparez son repas par exemple.Les chiens sont souvent agressifs lorsque quelqu’un s’approche de leurs gamelles, et chaque année de nombreuses personnes se font mordre inutilement, souvent des enfants malheureusement (et je parle en connaissance de cause).Pourtant il est possible de faire disparaître cette mauvaise habitude et d’éviter ainsi de nombreux accidents bêtes.Pour éviter ce problème gardez un peu de nourriture sous la main (ou une de ses friandises préférées) et pendant que votre chien mange, approchez vous de sa gamelle et rajoutez un peu de nourriture.Faîtes ça quelques temps et votre chien va ainsi associer le fait qu’une personne s’approche de sa gamelle à quelque chose de positif.Dernier conseil pour bien nourrir votre chien… n’oubliez pas de lui souhaiter un bon appétit Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour !

Voici une liste complète de noms de chien en Z pour mâle et femelle. Le « Z » est une lettre intéressante avec des mots qui font de très bons noms de chien.Je vous ai préparé une liste classée par thème ainsi qu’un liste complète classée par ordre alphabétique. Si vous n’aimez pas choisir ni cherchez dans de longues listes je vous ai également préparé le top 35 des noms de chien en Z pour mâle et le top 35 pour femelle.En fin d’article, je vous donnerai quelques techniques pour créer vous-même un nom qui commence par la lettre « Z » vraiment unique et personnalisé. Je vous donnerai également quelques conseils pour être sûr que le nom que vous choisirez sera pratique pour vous mais aussi compréhensible pour votre chien.Mais avant de vous lancer la liste d’idées, commençons par vérifier si un nom de chien en Z est vraiment ce dont vous avez besoin, surtout si vous allez accueillir un chien de race… BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! Peut-on choisir un nom en Z en 2024 pour un chien de race ? Difficile à croire mais vous ne pourrez peut-être pas choisir un nom de chien en Z en 2024 et tout particulièrement si vous souhaitez que votre chien soit enregistré officiellement comme « Chien de race ».En effet, certains pays comme le Luxembourg, la Belgique ou la France, imposent la première lettre du nom des chiens de race. Cette première lettre change chaque année et vous n’aurez d’autres choix que d’enregistrer votre chien avec un nom commençant par la « bonne » lettre :Pour la France et le Luxembourg : nom de chien en VPour la Belgique : nom de chien en XSi vous vous demandez pourquoi ces règles, sachez qu’elles ont été mises en place à une époque ou l’ordinateur n’existait pas et l’enregistrement des chiens et de leur pédigrée devenait compliqué.Sachez tout de même que vous avez la possibilité d’enregistrer un nom d’usage en plus du nom officiel. Ce qui veut dire que votre chien aura un nom officiel commençant par la « bonne » lettre et un nom que vous utiliserez au quotidien et que vous aurez choisi sans aucune restriction.L’autre solution consiste à choisir le nom que vous préférez et simplement ajouter la lettre de l’année devant. Ça donne parfois des noms officiels bizarres mais au moins ça permet de donner le nom qu’on veut à son chien.Si ces deux techniques ne vous conviennent pas, vous devriez sûrement vous rabattre sur la liste des noms de chien correspondant à la « bonne » lettre de votre pays.Sinon, c’est parti pour une liste complète des noms de chien en Z et on commence par les noms originaux et drôles…Noms de chien en Z originaux1234ZADZadocZaferZafirZahiZahimZamanZamilZapperZappingZarbieZarkoZayaZazaZazouZébréZèbreZébulonZekiZéléZelmaZéloteZenZénaZénithZénonZéphirZenkoZéphirinZéphyrZesteurZestZeusZibelineZieuterZiaZigotoZigzagZimbaZimboZimzamZingueurZinzinZinaZionZionoZipetteZipZippoZitaZitroZivaZizanieZoltanZombieZonzonZoomZoomzoomZoreilleZoraZorkaZouaveZoulouZoukyZoupsyZouzaZozoZumbaZumoZuroZygoSur le thème de la nature et de la science1234ZabreZamakZamierZébuZénithZéphyrZirconZincZorilleZygoteZymaseNoms de chien en Z pour les sportifs1234ZébulonZephyrZicoZiggyZinédineZingZionZizouZlatanZonardZverevZumbaSur le thème de la musique1234ZazZazieZazouZebdaZénithZéphirZeppelinZero 7ZhengZiggyZigzagZitherZoomzoomZoukZurnaZwanPour les grands voyageurs1234ZadarZagrebZambieZanziZébuZélandeZénithZermattZihuaZumaZurich Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour !

Ne cherchez plus, il vous faut du sur-mesure ! Je vous recommande ces 3 techniques pour créer vous même un prénom pour votre chien qui sera unique et personnalisé.La première technique consiste simplement à rechercher des mots commençant par Z liés à un thème que vous aimez ou une de vos passions. Je ne peux pas couvrir toutes les passions et je sais que chacune d’entre elle a son vocabulaire propre. N’hésitez pas à vous aider d’un dictionnaire spécialisé, il en existe sur tous les sujets de nos jours.La seconde technique consiste à mélanger les syllabes de prénoms ou noms que vous aimez. Que ce soit des personnes qui vous sont chères, des personnages célèbres ou historiques. Découpez les syllabes, mélangez les et ajoutez un Z au début pour créer un prénom en Z unique.Dernière technique que j’aime beaucoup et qui se prête très bien à la création de noms de chien : choisissez simplement un mot qui vous plaît et ajouter ou remplacer la première lettre par un Z. Vous trouvez votre chienne très jolie ? Allons-y pour Zolie !Avec ces trois techniques, vous devriez rapidement trouver de bonnes idées de noms de chien en Z. Attention, tout de même à ne pas créer un nom compliqué pour vous ou votre chien donc soyez sûr que le nom que vous créerez respecte les conseils suivants…Quelques conseils pour choisir un bon nom de chien en ZVoici 3 conseils à suivre pour être sûr que le nom de chien que vous avez choisi sera pratique pour vous mais aussi facile à intégrer pour votre chien.D’abord choisissez un nom de chien facile à prononcer qui n’a rien de négatif, insultant ou gênant. Imaginez-vous en train de crier le nom de votre chien dans un parc public : « Zezette viens ici ! ».Ensuite, choisissez un nom qui n’est pas un prénom humain. J’adore le prénom Zoé et il ferait un très bon prénom pour votre chienne mais que se passera-t-il si une Zoé vient à faire partie de votre entourage ? Votre chienne risque d’être confuse et de ne plus savoir si vous l’appelez ou pas. C’est pour cette raison que je ne recommande pas les prénoms humains.Enfin, choisissez un prénom court et facile à prononcer. Zigomatique est un mot qui sonne bien mais pas simple pour vous comme pour votre chien.Il est préférable de choisir un nom de chien en Z court (2 syllabes étant le mieux) et si possible finissant par une voyelle car ces prénoms sont plus identifiables par votre chien. Zola ou Zouky sont par exemple deux prénoms idéaux.Démarrer l’éducation de votre chien par l’apprentissage de son nom Dès que vous aurez choisi le nom de votre chien, il vous faudra lui apprendre le plus rapidement possible. En effet, ce doit être le premier mot que vous prononcez quand vous vous adressez à votre chien, quelles que soient les circonstances.« Zola panier » est très clair pour votre chien, beaucoup plus que « Panier Zola ». La différence n’est pas grande pour un être humain mais pour votre chien c’est important. Dès qu’il entendra son prénom, il saura que vous vous adressez à lui.Je vous recommande tout particulièrement de lire notre article sur Les 7 règles d’or pour éduquer son chien pour être sûr de démarrer sur de bonnes bases.Dans tous les cas la première étape de l’éducation de votre chien restera de lui apprendre son nom et surtout de lui faire comprendre que vous avez besoin de son attention quand vous l’appelez.

TITRE: Les besoins nutritionnels de votre chien
CATÉGORIE: Non catégorisé
CONTENU:
Bien comprendre les besoins nutritionnels de votre chien est très important. La nourriture joue un rôle primordial sur sa santé. Le chien est un omnivore, ce qui veut dire qu’il peut manger n’importe quelle nourriture (je ne tiens pas compte des chaussures ou tout autre objet que votre chien a l’habitude de manger ;-).Pour répondre aux besoins nutritionnels de votre chien il faut que son alimentation soit répartie en 6 groupes alimentaires.C’est la clef d’une alimentation équilibrée et d’un chien en pleine forme ! BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! De l’eau pour votre chienDe l’eau, de l’air, la vie ! C’est vrai pour vous et c’est aussi vrai pour votre chien. L’eau représente 60 à 70% du poids d’un chien adulte.Une partie des besoins en eau de votre chien se trouve dans sa nourriture (la nourriture en boite contient environ 78% d’eau et la nourriture sèche environ 10%).Il est donc primordial que votre chien ait accès à de l’eau fraîche (je ne parle pas de température, simplement renouvelez tous les jours la gamelle d’eau de votre chien).Petite précision pour ceux qui sont en train d’apprendre la propreté à leur chiot : vous pouvez surveiller et limiter la quantité d’eau que votre chiot absorbe (donner lui de l’eau à des moments spécifiques comme après la balade par exemple).En cas de forte chaleur ne prenez pas de risques, un chien se déshydrate rapidement (vous pouvez également lui mettre un glaçon à la place de l’eau, il l’absorbera plus lentement). Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! Des protéines pour votre chienLes protéines sont également très importantes pour votre chien. Elles vont lui fournir les acides aminés nécessaires au bon développement de son corps. Les protéines contiennent 23 acides aminés dont 10 sont essentiels pour la bonne santé de votre chien. Les autres sont également importants mais votre chien peut les fabriquer lui même.Généralement, on considère que les protéines animales sont plus intéressantes pour votre chien que les protéines végétales.Des minéraux pour votre chienLes minéraux n’ont aucune valeur énergétique mais ils font partie des besoins alimentaires de votre chien. Ils doivent être présents dans l’alimentation de votre chien car contrairement à certains acides aminés, les chiens ne peuvent pas les produire.Le fer, le magnésium, le zinc, le calcium vont permettre des réactions métaboliques assurant ainsi le bon fonctionnement de l’organisme de votre chien.Par exemple, sans minéraux dans son alimentation votre chien n’aura pas les os solides. Ils participent également à la bonne santé des dents de votre chien qui est un élément crucial pour lui et sa longévité (n’oubliez pas de brosser les dents de votre chien régulièrement et les vôtres aussi ;-).De la graisse pour votre chien Si votre chien n’a pas une belle peau ou une belle fourrure, surveillez ses besoins en graisse. La graisse a non seulement un rôle énergétique mais elle permet aussi à votre chien d’absorber certains vitamines qui se dissolvent dans la graisse.Autre point important, les chiens aiment les graisses. C’est très bien de répondre à ses besoins alimentaires mais il faut aussi prendre du plaisir dans tout ça ! Attention tout de même aux excès.La nourriture industrielle est généralement adaptée aux besoins de vos chiens mais attention aux petites friandises qui sont souvent un peu plus riches.Surtout si vous utilisez la nourriture pour le éduquer votre chien, n’oubliez pas de diminuer les quantités aux repas.Des vitamines pour votre chienVotre chien a besoin de vitamines, tout comme vous. Ils participent au bon fonctionnement de l’organisme ils sont indispensables aux échanges vitaux.Votre chien ne peut pas les synthétiser lui même, mais rassurez-vous si son alimentation est équilibrée, il aura les vitamines dont il a besoin.Inutile de donner des suppléments de vitamine à votre chien sauf si votre chien a une déficience et que votre vétérinaire vous le demande. Contrairement à ce qu’on pourrait croire, trop de vitamines peut être dangereux.Des glucides pour votre chienLes glucides sont le dernier élément des besoins nutritionnels de votre chien. Ils n’ont pas toujours bonne réputation et pourtant ils sont une aide précieuse pour le corps de votre chien.Ils permettent de conserver les intestins de votre chien en bon état et d’éviter des diarrhées ou constipation. Ils fournissent également de l’énergie aux tissus ce qui permet à votre chien de conserver ses protéines et de les utiliser à bon escient.Comme pour les graisses il faut contrôler et gérer les quantités, mise à part ça les glucides font partie intégrante des besoins nutritionnels de votre chien.

Votre chien est-il un gros dormeur ? Ca peut vous paraître excessif, mais dormir est une part importante de la vie d’un chien. En fait un chien passe en moyenne 50% de sa journée à faire la sieste, 30% allonger mais sans dormir et 20% en activité.Le manque de sommeil peut avoir des conséquences graves pour votre chien, tant sur le plan physique que comportementale. Donc voici un peu plus d’informations sur le sommeil de votre chien et ce dont il a vraiment besoin… BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante.

L’âge et la taille de votre chienL’âge et la taille de votre chien vont avoir une influence sur son sommeil. Un chien en moyenne va dormir entre 12 et 14 heures.Un vieux chien va évidemment avoir besoin de plus de repos car il fatigue plus vite. Un chiot va également avoir besoin de beaucoup de repos.Il va passer une partie de sa journée à se dépenser, à découvrir son environnement et il aura donc besoin de 18 à 20 heures de sommeil. Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! La race de votre chienLa race de votre chien a également une influence sur la quantité de sommeil dont il a besoin.Par exemple les races de chiens de travail dorment moins car ils sont conditionnés pour faire face à de grosses demandes tant physiques que mentales.En revanche un chien qui n’est pas d’une race conditionnée pour être très active mais plutôt sédentaire aura tendance à faire ce qu’il veut. Y compris faire de belles siestes sur le sofa ! D’où l’importance de bien choisir son chien.Changement de rythme de vieLes chiens sont des animaux de routines.Ca ne veut pas dire qu’ils n’aiment pas la nouveauté, au contraire, plus vous stimulez votre chien avec de nouvelles ballades par exemple plus il sera heureux.En revanche un déménagement, la mort d’un compagnon ou tout autre gros changement peut fatiguer votre chien.Il dormira un peu plus pour récupérer et recharger ses batteries.SantéDormir est essentiel pour la santé de votre chien. Certains chiens qui dorment mal vont développer des troubles physiques et comportementaux.Donc laissez votre chien dormir s’il le souhaite même si vous avez l’impression que c’est trop.En revanche soyez vigilant si les habitudes de sommeil de votre chien changent.S’il se met à dormir ou à se réveiller à des heures différentes, il est préférable de consulter un vétérinaire rapidement.Sur ce je vous laisse, je vais faire une petite sieste avec mon chien ;-) Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour !

TITRE: Mon chien est-il somnambule ? Une question inattendue, mais fascinante !
CATÉGORIE: Non catégorisé
CONTENU:
Ah, le mystère des comportements canins ! Une fois, j’ai rencontré un Golden Retriever nommé Simba, un amour de chien, mais pas facile à comprendre… surtout la nuit. Ses propriétaires me racontaient, un peu amusés, qu’il semblait se « lever » dans son sommeil, marcher maladroitement, puis retourner se coucher comme si de rien n’était.Étonnant, non ? Mais cela m’a poussé à me pencher sur un phénomène peu commun : le chien somnambule.En tant qu’éducateur canin, j’ai vu de tout, des chiens qui chassent leurs propres ombres à ceux qui aboient en dormant. Mais qu’en est-il du somnambulisme ? Est-ce que cela existe vraiment chez les chiens ? Et surtout, est-ce un signe d’un problème plus profond ?Plongeons dans ce sujet intrigant pour répondre à vos questions. BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! Le somnambulisme chez les chiens : mythe ou réalité ?Avant toute chose, soyons clairs : le chien somnambule, dans le sens où nous l’entendons pour les humains, n’est pas exactement un comportement reconnu chez nos amis à quatre pattes. Contrairement à nous, les chiens ne souffrent pas de véritables épisodes de somnambulisme.Toutefois, ils peuvent afficher des comportements nocturnes intrigants, comme marcher, aboyer, ou même courir dans leur sommeil.Certaines races sont plus sujettes à ce type de comportement que d’autres. Par exemple, les Labradors, connus pour leur énergie débordante, peuvent parfois « réagir » intensément à des rêves. C’est un peu comme si leur énergie diurne débordait dans leur sommeil !À l’inverse, un Bouledogue français plus calme pourrait être moins enclin à ces agitations, mais pourrait tout de même montrer de petits mouvements inconscients, comme des spasmes ou des coups de pattes. Cela dit, tous ces comportements sont généralement normaux et inoffensifs.Pourquoi mon chien bouge-t-il dans son sommeil ?Il est important de comprendre que le sommeil des chiens est constitué de cycles très similaires aux nôtres, avec des phases de sommeil profond et de sommeil paradoxal (la phase des rêves). Pendant le sommeil paradoxal, votre chien peut sembler courir, japper ou bouger.Ce phénomène est particulièrement visible chez certaines races, comme le Berger australien, un chien très actif et réactif, même dans ses rêves !Selon une étude de l’Université d’Helsinki en 2022, les chiens au tempérament plus dynamique sont plus enclins à montrer des mouvements pendant leur sommeil. L’étude, dirigée par le Dr Hannes Lohi, met en lumière la corrélation entre l’activité diurne et les réactions nocturnes chez les chiens de travail.En tant que propriétaire, cela peut être un peu déstabilisant à observer, surtout si vous avez un chien qui bouge beaucoup la nuit. Mais il est essentiel de ne pas le réveiller brusquement. Cela pourrait non seulement le désorienter, mais aussi perturber son cycle de sommeil.Dans le cas des chiots ou des chiens seniors, ces comportements peuvent aussi être plus prononcés en raison de leur système nerveux plus sensible. J’ai vu un chiot Labrador, Rocky, faire de véritables « marathons » dans son sommeil, alors qu’un chien plus âgé comme Max, un Cavalier King Charles de 10 ans, se contentait de petits spasmes légers.Quand s’inquiéter des comportements nocturnes ?Alors, que faire si votre chien semble « somnambule » ? En règle générale, ces mouvements sont normaux et ne posent pas de problème. Cependant, certains signes peuvent nécessiter une attention plus particulière. Si votre chien semble faire des mouvements violents, s’il se réveille en panique, ou s’il montre des signes de détresse (comme pleurer ou haleter), il pourrait s’agir d’autre chose, comme des crises d’épilepsie nocturnes ou des troubles du sommeil.J’ai rencontré un Berger australien qui se réveillait régulièrement en panique après des mouvements brusques dans son sommeil. Après avoir consulté un vétérinaire spécialisé, il s’est avéré qu’il souffrait d’un trouble nerveux, nécessitant un traitement adapté. Heureusement, ces cas sont rares, mais cela souligne l’importance de rester attentif aux comportements inhabituels et de consulter un professionnel si nécessaire.Quelques astuces pour favoriser un bon sommeil à votre chienMaintenant que nous avons démystifié le concept de chien somnambule, il est bon de se rappeler que le sommeil de votre compagnon à quatre pattes est crucial pour sa santé et son bien-être. Voici quelques astuces pour l’aider à mieux dormir :Une routine régulière : Comme pour nous, les chiens profitent d’une routine stable. Assurez-vous que votre chien ait des moments de calme avant le coucher, notamment pour les races énergétiques comme le Labrador ou le Berger australien.Un environnement confortable : Offrez-lui un espace de repos douillet et sans distractions. Un lit adapté à la taille de votre chien est un must, surtout pour les petites races comme les Bouledogues français.Des activités physiques et mentales : Fatiguer son esprit et son corps pendant la journée permet un sommeil plus profond. Un chien stimulé, qu’il soit grand ou petit, aura tendance à mieux dormir la nuit.Conclusion : patience et bienveillance pour un sommeil réparateurEn résumé, bien que le terme chien somnambule soit plus amusant qu’inquiétant, il est toujours important de rester à l’écoute de nos chiens. Leurs comportements nocturnes sont souvent une fenêtre sur leurs émotions et leur bien-être général.Et rappelez-vous, que vous ayez un Labrador plein d’énergie ou un Bouledogue ronfleur, la clé reste toujours la même : patience, observation et bienveillance.Après tout, qui sait ? Peut-être que votre chien rêve simplement de courir après une balle géante… ou de manger un bon steak juteux. Alors, laissez-le rêver en paix !

TITRE: Les besoins nutritionnels de votre chien
CATÉGORIE: Non catégorisé
CONTENU:
Bien comprendre les besoins nutritionnels de votre chien est très important. La nourriture joue un rôle primordial sur sa santé. Le chien est un omnivore, ce qui veut dire qu’il peut manger n’importe quelle nourriture (je ne tiens pas compte des chaussures ou tout autre objet que votre chien a l’habitude de manger ;-).Pour répondre aux besoins nutritionnels de votre chien il faut que son alimentation soit répartie en 6 groupes alimentaires.C’est la clef d’une alimentation équilibrée et d’un chien en pleine forme ! BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! De l’eau pour votre chienDe l’eau, de l’air, la vie ! C’est vrai pour vous et c’est aussi vrai pour votre chien. L’eau représente 60 à 70% du poids d’un chien adulte.Une partie des besoins en eau de votre chien se trouve dans sa nourriture (la nourriture en boite contient environ 78% d’eau et la nourriture sèche environ 10%).Il est donc primordial que votre chien ait accès à de l’eau fraîche (je ne parle pas de température, simplement renouvelez tous les jours la gamelle d’eau de votre chien).Petite précision pour ceux qui sont en train d’apprendre la propreté à leur chiot : vous pouvez surveiller et limiter la quantité d’eau que votre chiot absorbe (donner lui de l’eau à des moments spécifiques comme après la balade par exemple).En cas de forte chaleur ne prenez pas de risques, un chien se déshydrate rapidement (vous pouvez également lui mettre un glaçon à la place de l’eau, il l’absorbera plus lentement). Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! Des protéines pour votre chienLes protéines sont également très importantes pour votre chien. Elles vont lui fournir les acides aminés nécessaires au bon développement de son corps. Les protéines contiennent 23 acides aminés dont 10 sont essentiels pour la bonne santé de votre chien. Les autres sont également importants mais votre chien peut les fabriquer lui même.Généralement, on considère que les protéines animales sont plus intéressantes pour votre chien que les protéines végétales.Des minéraux pour votre chienLes minéraux n’ont aucune valeur énergétique mais ils font partie des besoins alimentaires de votre chien. Ils doivent être présents dans l’alimentation de votre chien car contrairement à certains acides aminés, les chiens ne peuvent pas les produire.Le fer, le magnésium, le zinc, le calcium vont permettre des réactions métaboliques assurant ainsi le bon fonctionnement de l’organisme de votre chien.Par exemple, sans minéraux dans son alimentation votre chien n’aura pas les os solides. Ils participent également à la bonne santé des dents de votre chien qui est un élément crucial pour lui et sa longévité (n’oubliez pas de brosser les dents de votre chien régulièrement et les vôtres aussi ;-).De la graisse pour votre chien Si votre chien n’a pas une belle peau ou une belle fourrure, surveillez ses besoins en graisse. La graisse a non seulement un rôle énergétique mais elle permet aussi à votre chien d’absorber certains vitamines qui se dissolvent dans la graisse.Autre point important, les chiens aiment les graisses. C’est très bien de répondre à ses besoins alimentaires mais il faut aussi prendre du plaisir dans tout ça ! Attention tout de même aux excès.La nourriture industrielle est généralement adaptée aux besoins de vos chiens mais attention aux petites friandises qui sont souvent un peu plus riches.Surtout si vous utilisez la nourriture pour le éduquer votre chien, n’oubliez pas de diminuer les quantités aux repas.Des vitamines pour votre chienVotre chien a besoin de vitamines, tout comme vous. Ils participent au bon fonctionnement de l’organisme ils sont indispensables aux échanges vitaux.Votre chien ne peut pas les synthétiser lui même, mais rassurez-vous si son alimentation est équilibrée, il aura les vitamines dont il a besoin.Inutile de donner des suppléments de vitamine à votre chien sauf si votre chien a une déficience et que votre vétérinaire vous le demande. Contrairement à ce qu’on pourrait croire, trop de vitamines peut être dangereux.Des glucides pour votre chienLes glucides sont le dernier élément des besoins nutritionnels de votre chien. Ils n’ont pas toujours bonne réputation et pourtant ils sont une aide précieuse pour le corps de votre chien.Ils permettent de conserver les intestins de votre chien en bon état et d’éviter des diarrhées ou constipation. Ils fournissent également de l’énergie aux tissus ce qui permet à votre chien de conserver ses protéines et de les utiliser à bon escient.Comme pour les graisses il faut contrôler et gérer les quantités, mise à part ça les glucides font partie intégrante des besoins nutritionnels de votre chien.

Nous avons des lecteurs dans de nombreux pays différents donc vous n’êtes peut-être pas concerné par ces règles. Mais si vous nous lisez depuis la France, la Belgique ou le Luxembourg et que vous souhaitez que votre chien bénéficie de l’appellation « Chien de race », il vous faudra l’enregistrer avec un nom commençant par une lettre bien précise.Ces règles ont permis de faciliter l’enregistrement des chiens de race et de leur pédigrée à une époque où l’ordinateur n’existait pas encore. Elle sont toujours en place aujourd’hui et ces pays imposent donc les lettres suivantes pour l’année 2024 :Pour la France et le Luxembourg : choisissez un nom de chien en VPour la Belgique : c’est l’année des noms de chien en XA ma connaissance, ce sont les seuls pays avec ce type de règle donc si vous lisez cet article depuis un autre pays, vous êtes libre d’appeler votre chien comme bon vous semble (n’hésitez pas à me laisser un commentaire si vous vivez dans un pays qui impose une lettre).Sachez également que vous pouvez « tricher » en appelant votre chien comme bon vous semble et ajouter simplement la lettre de l’année devant son prénom, lors de son enregistrement. C’est une pratique courante.L’autre solution est tout simplement de choisir un nom officiel qui commence par la bonne lettre et d’ajouter un nom d’usage qui sera le nom de votre chien au quotidien.Comment créer vous même un nom de chien en W sur mesure ?Si vous cherchez un prénom complètement unique et plein de sens pour vous, voici quelques techniques qui pourraient vous aider à le créer.L’une des techniques que j’aime beaucoup est de combiner quelques syllabes des prénoms de personnes qui vous sont chères Cela donne souvent des noms de chien sympas et originaux. Il vous suffit d’ajouter un W au début du prénom si vous avez besoin d’un nom en W.L’autre technique consiste à chercher un nom lié à une de vos passions. Je n’ai couvert que quelques domaines, peut-être que vous êtes fan de cyclisme ou d’un certain type de musique. Cherchez simplement des mots liés à vos passions. Vous pouvez également en combiner plusieurs comme pour les prénoms et ajouter un W.La dernière technique que vous pouvez d’ailleurs combiner avec les autres consiste à choisir un mot qui vous plaît, qui sonne bien et qui sera facile à reconnaître pour votre chien. Il ne vous reste plus qu’à ajouter un W ou remplacer la première lettre par un W et Woila !Les noms faciles à reconnaître pour votre chien Si vous créez vous même votre nom de chien, gardez en tête ces quelques règles pour lui faciliter la vie…Choisissez un nom court, de préférence 2 syllabes pas plus. Si possible qui se termine par une voyelle car ces noms ont des sonorités plus simples à « comprendre » pour votre chien.Choisissez des mots que vous utilisez rarement et qui ne ressemblent pas trop à des ordres (assis, couché, panier…) ni aux noms de vos proches ou de vos autres animaux. Donc attention si vous utilisez la technique précédente pour créer un nom de chien à partir des prénoms de personnes qui vous sont chères, le nom de votre chien doit tout de même se distinguer des autres prénoms.Enfin dernier conseil, choisissez un nom que vous pourrez utiliser en public sans gêne. Lorsque vous commencerez à apprendre le rappel à votre chien (ce que je vous recommande de faire au plus tôt), vous apprécierez d’avoir choisi un nom de chien plutôt neutre.Aider votre chien à apprendre son nomDès que vous accueillez votre chien, son éducation démarre et il commencera à apprendre ce qu’il peut et ne peut pas faire. Votre travail sera donc d’apprendre rapidement à communiquer avec lui.La première étape consiste simplement à lui apprendre son nom. L’idée est de capter l’attention de votre chien à chaque fois que vous l’appelez. En effet, toutes vos interactions avec votre chien doivent commencer par son nom.C’est le seul moyen pour lui de savoir que vous vous adressez à lui et que vous attendez quelque chose de sa part. Vous aurez beaucoup de choses à savoir pour éduquer votre chien correctement alors autant vous préparer dès maintenant.Voici donc un article complet pour apprendre à votre chien à reconnaître son nom Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour !

Les différences physiques entre les deux sont principalement liées à l’évolution de la race au fil du temps.En 1926, Roswell Eldridge a spécifié dans un concours que les Blenheim Spaniels devaient avoir un museau long, pas de stop, un crâne plat et ne pas être enclins à être bombés, en se basant sur les images de l’époque de Charles II d’Angleterre.Les Cavaliers actuels ont tendance à avoir un museau plus court et un crâne légèrement plus rond, tandis que les King Charles Spaniels conservent souvent les caractéristiques du crâne plat et du museau plus long.Besoins d’exercice de cette race de chienCes petits compagnons sont très flexibles. Une petite promenade quotidienne, quelques jeux dans le jardin, ou même une séance de câlins sportive feront leur bonheur.Ils sont plus du genre à vous suivre partout, alors pourquoi ne pas les emmener en randonnée ou en balade au parc ? Et pour un peu d’amusement supplémentaire, une séance d’entraînement à quelques tours fera briller leurs yeux de malice.Avec eux, c’est sûr, l’exercice devient une partie de plaisir !La délicate santé du Cavalier King CharlesLe Cavalier King Charles est un compagnon adorable mais avec une santé délicate. On ne va pas se mentir, cette race à quatre pattes peut avoir quelques pépins de santé.Tout d’abord, parlons de l’endocardiose mitrale. Oui, ça sonne sérieux, car c’est un problème cardiaque fréquent chez cette race de chien. Imaginez un peu, une valve cardiaque qui flanche un peu trop tôt. C’est pour ça qu’on fait des échographies régulières, histoire de garder un œil sur ce cœur royal.Ensuite, il y a la syringomyélie. Ça paraît impressionnant dit comme ça, mais en gros, c’est comme si ces toutous avaient des démangeaisons persistantes, des torticolis, bref, pas le top pour faire le beau dans le parc. Mais avec une IRM et une prise en charge adaptée, on peut faire en sorte que la vie de nos Cavaliers soit aussi douce que possible.Et attention, les allergies ne sont pas en reste, ni les luxations de rotules. Sans oublier que nos petits amis à quatre pattes ont parfois une fâcheuse tendance à prendre du poids plus vite que leur ombre. Il faut dire qu’ils sont de grands gourmands !Alors oui, le Cavalier King Charles peut avoir une santé un peu plus fragile que d’autres races. Mais avec une alimentation équilibrée, un suivi régulier chez le vétérinaire et beaucoup d’amour, vous pourrez offrir à votre compagnon une vie aussi heureuse que possible.Entretien au quotidienPour que ce compagnon à quatre pattes reste radieux, il faut un peu d’entretien. Rien de bien méchant, promis !Commençons par le poil. Cette magnifique robe soyeuse nécessite un petit coup de brosse deux à trois fois par semaine pour éviter les nœuds. Une séance de brossage, et hop, votre Cavalier resplendit de nouveau, prêt à charmer tout ce qui bouge !Pour les yeux et les oreilles, c’est du sérieux aussi. Un petit nettoyage régulier avec un peu de sérum physiologique ou une lotion adaptée, et voilà ! Votre chien voit la vie en rose et entend le moindre bruit à des kilomètres à la ronde.Et les dents ! Ne les oublions pas. Un brossage régulier dès son plus jeune âge évite bien des tracas dentaires. Imaginez, des dents aussi brillantes que celles d’une star hollywoodienne, qui résistent à toutes les croquettes !Et que dire des ongles ? Eux aussi ont besoin d’un petit coup de ciseaux de temps en temps. Mais pas de panique, avec un peu de pratique, vous deviendrez le manucure numéro un de votre toutou.Pour finir, les glandes anales. Oui, c’est un sujet un peu moins glamour, mais il faut bien en parler. Un contrôle régulier et une vidange si nécessaire évitent bien des soucis.Voilà, vous savez tout sur l’entretien quotidien d’un Cavalier King Charles. Avec un peu d’amour et quelques gestes simples, votre compagnon à quatre pattes sera au top de sa forme, prêt à vous offrir tout l’amour dont il est capable. Alors, prêt à vivre des moments inoubliables avec votre petite boule de poils ?Combien coûte un Cavalier King Charles ?Pour accueillir un adorable Cavalier King Charles dans votre foyer, prévoyez entre 900 € et 1400 € pour un chiot de qualité, plein de vie et d’amour à partager.Assurez-vous de choisir un bon élevage de Cavalier King Charles pour éviter les mauvaises surprises.

On dit que la patience est une vertu, et c’est d’autant plus vrai quand il s’agit de petits chiots qui ont besoin de ce temps précieux avec leur maman pour apprendre les bases de la vie canine.De plus, les chiots devraient être identifiés, vaccinés, vermifugés et enregistrés au LOF avant de quitter l’élevage.Assurez-vous que l’éleveur effectue des tests de santé appropriés sur les parents. On ne veut pas de surprises désagréables plus tard, n’est-ce pas ?

Tout a commencé au XVIIe siècle, lorsque Charles II d’Angleterre est tombé follement amoureux de ses épagneuls miniatures. Imaginez un roi qui ne se sépare jamais de ses chiens, même au Parlement ! Ils étaient tellement choyés qu’ils ont été nommés King Charles Spaniels en son honneur.Mais voilà, avec le temps, d’autres races de chiens ont voulu voler la vedette, avec leur nez plat et leurs airs exotiques. Les éleveurs ont alors commencé à raccourcir les museaux des King Charles pour répondre à ces nouvelles tendances. C’était comme une guerre des standards canins !Heureusement, un héros américain du nom de Roswell Eldridge est arrivé en 1926 avec un plan audacieux : récompenser les éleveurs capables de ramener à la vie l’ancien modèle des King Charles, avec un museau long. Et ça a marché ! Des éleveurs ont relevé le défi, et le Cavalier King Charles est né !Mais l’histoire ne s’arrête pas là. Il y a eu des disputes, des batailles juridiques, des clubs de race… C’était un vrai feuilleton ! Finalement, en 1945, le Cavalier King Charles a été officiellement reconnu comme une race distincte. Et depuis lors, ces adorables petits compagnons ont conquis le cœur du monde entier avec leur charme et leur histoire captivante.Voilà comment nos amis à quatre pattes ont écrit une page d’histoire, avec un peu de ruse, une touche d’audace et beaucoup d’amour !Quelques idées de noms idéals pour cette race de chienSi vous souhaitez que votre compagnon bénéficie de l’appellation Chien de race vous devrez respecter les lettres de l’année :Pour la France et le Luxembourg : nom de chien en VPour la Belgique : nom de chien en XAlors voici quelques idées de noms intéressantes pour un Cavalier King Charles mâle ou femelle :Pour un Cavalier King Charles mâle :VicomteVirtuoseVaillantVirtusXquisPour une femelle Cavalier King Charles :VeniseVictoireVesperVénusXénaQuelques Cavalier King Charles célèbrent De nombreuses personnalités ont choisi le Cavalier King Charles et notamment : l’ex-président américain Ronald Reagan, Scott Eastwood, Courteney Cox, la princesse Margareth, Kristin Davis, Johnny Depp et Seth Rogen.Rex : le CKC de l’ex-président Ronald Reagan et de sa compagne NancyRowley : le meilleur ami de la princesse Margaret (soeur de la reine Elizabeth II)Harley et Hooper : les 2 compagnons de Courteney CoxElizabeth Taylor : le Cavalier King Charles de Kristin DavisPopularité du Cavalier King CharlesLa popularité du Cavalier King Charles n’est plus à démontré mais voici quelques chiffres du LOF (Livre des Origines Français) qui ne laisse pas de place aux doutes.En 2023, le Cavalier King Charles été encore une fois dans le top 10 des chiens préférés des français, en 7ème position pour être précis avec 6907 inscriptions.Depuis plus de 5 ans, cette race de chien fait partie du top 10 avec un record d’inscription de 7644 en 2021 !On est encore loin du Berger Australien qui reste la race de chien préféré des français avec plus de 17000 inscriptions mais si l’on compare avec des races du même groupe (Chiens d’agrément et de compagnie), ce petit chien élégant reste le champion en titre depuis plusieurs années, loin devant le Bouledogue français, le Chihuahua ou le Shih tzu.Alors, qu’en pensez-vous ?

TITRE: Les besoins nutritionnels de votre chien
CATÉGORIE: Non catégorisé
CONTENU:
Bien comprendre les besoins nutritionnels de votre chien est très important. La nourriture joue un rôle primordial sur sa santé. Le chien est un omnivore, ce qui veut dire qu’il peut manger n’importe quelle nourriture (je ne tiens pas compte des chaussures ou tout autre objet que votre chien a l’habitude de manger ;-).Pour répondre aux besoins nutritionnels de votre chien il faut que son alimentation soit répartie en 6 groupes alimentaires.C’est la clef d’une alimentation équilibrée et d’un chien en pleine forme ! BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! De l’eau pour votre chienDe l’eau, de l’air, la vie ! C’est vrai pour vous et c’est aussi vrai pour votre chien. L’eau représente 60 à 70% du poids d’un chien adulte.Une partie des besoins en eau de votre chien se trouve dans sa nourriture (la nourriture en boite contient environ 78% d’eau et la nourriture sèche environ 10%).Il est donc primordial que votre chien ait accès à de l’eau fraîche (je ne parle pas de température, simplement renouvelez tous les jours la gamelle d’eau de votre chien).Petite précision pour ceux qui sont en train d’apprendre la propreté à leur chiot : vous pouvez surveiller et limiter la quantité d’eau que votre chiot absorbe (donner lui de l’eau à des moments spécifiques comme après la balade par exemple).En cas de forte chaleur ne prenez pas de risques, un chien se déshydrate rapidement (vous pouvez également lui mettre un glaçon à la place de l’eau, il l’absorbera plus lentement). Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! Des protéines pour votre chienLes protéines sont également très importantes pour votre chien. Elles vont lui fournir les acides aminés nécessaires au bon développement de son corps. Les protéines contiennent 23 acides aminés dont 10 sont essentiels pour la bonne santé de votre chien. Les autres sont également importants mais votre chien peut les fabriquer lui même.Généralement, on considère que les protéines animales sont plus intéressantes pour votre chien que les protéines végétales.Des minéraux pour votre chienLes minéraux n’ont aucune valeur énergétique mais ils font partie des besoins alimentaires de votre chien. Ils doivent être présents dans l’alimentation de votre chien car contrairement à certains acides aminés, les chiens ne peuvent pas les produire.Le fer, le magnésium, le zinc, le calcium vont permettre des réactions métaboliques assurant ainsi le bon fonctionnement de l’organisme de votre chien.Par exemple, sans minéraux dans son alimentation votre chien n’aura pas les os solides. Ils participent également à la bonne santé des dents de votre chien qui est un élément crucial pour lui et sa longévité (n’oubliez pas de brosser les dents de votre chien régulièrement et les vôtres aussi ;-).De la graisse pour votre chien Si votre chien n’a pas une belle peau ou une belle fourrure, surveillez ses besoins en graisse. La graisse a non seulement un rôle énergétique mais elle permet aussi à votre chien d’absorber certains vitamines qui se dissolvent dans la graisse.Autre point important, les chiens aiment les graisses. C’est très bien de répondre à ses besoins alimentaires mais il faut aussi prendre du plaisir dans tout ça ! Attention tout de même aux excès.La nourriture industrielle est généralement adaptée aux besoins de vos chiens mais attention aux petites friandises qui sont souvent un peu plus riches.Surtout si vous utilisez la nourriture pour le éduquer votre chien, n’oubliez pas de diminuer les quantités aux repas.Des vitamines pour votre chienVotre chien a besoin de vitamines, tout comme vous. Ils participent au bon fonctionnement de l’organisme ils sont indispensables aux échanges vitaux.Votre chien ne peut pas les synthétiser lui même, mais rassurez-vous si son alimentation est équilibrée, il aura les vitamines dont il a besoin.Inutile de donner des suppléments de vitamine à votre chien sauf si votre chien a une déficience et que votre vétérinaire vous le demande. Contrairement à ce qu’on pourrait croire, trop de vitamines peut être dangereux.Des glucides pour votre chienLes glucides sont le dernier élément des besoins nutritionnels de votre chien. Ils n’ont pas toujours bonne réputation et pourtant ils sont une aide précieuse pour le corps de votre chien.Ils permettent de conserver les intestins de votre chien en bon état et d’éviter des diarrhées ou constipation. Ils fournissent également de l’énergie aux tissus ce qui permet à votre chien de conserver ses protéines et de les utiliser à bon escient.Comme pour les graisses il faut contrôler et gérer les quantités, mise à part ça les glucides font partie intégrante des besoins nutritionnels de votre chien.

Parallèlement, des ouvriers anglais immigrés en France apportent avec eux leurs Bulldogs Anglais. Ces chiens sont croisés avec des ratiers et d’autres races locales pour obtenir le Bouledogue Français tel que nous le connaissons aujourd’hui.À cette époque, les combats de chiens étaient populaires dans les faubourgs parisiens, et le Bouledogue Français n’échappe pas à cette utilisation. Ils étaient alors destinés à être des guerriers féroces plutôt que des compagnons domestiques.En 1880, le premier club amical du Bouledogue Français est créé. Cependant, une querelle de paternité éclate entre Français et Anglais quant à la création de la race. Finalement, la race est officiellement reconnue par la Société Centrale Canine en 1898.Le Bouledogue Français devient rapidement populaire auprès de l’aristocratie et des célébrités de l’époque, mais les guerres mondiales mettent en péril sa survie. La race frôle l’extinction, faute d’éleveurs pour la perpétuer.Heureusement, dans les années 1980, des éleveurs passionnés relèvent le défi de sauver le Bouledogue Français de l’oubli. Grâce à leur dévouement, la race retrouve peu à peu sa popularité et son statut de compagnon apprécié.Aujourd’hui, le Bouledogue Français continue à conquérir les cœurs avec son charme espiègle et son caractère enjoué, tout en rappelant son passé riche en rebondissements et en événements marquants.Quelques Bouledogue Français célèbrent Popularité du Bouledogue FrançaisMême si cette race de chien est dans le top 20 des races préférées des français depuis plus de 5 ans, sa popularité est en baisse.En 2023, elle a perdu 3 places (16ème position) avec seulement 3935 inscriptions au LOF (Livre des Origines Français). C’est quasiment la moitié de son record de 2018 avec 6379 inscriptions !Cependant si l’on compare avec les races de chien du même groupe (chien de compagnie et d’agrément) le Bouledogue Français est en 2ème position juste derrière le Cavalier King Charles (6907 inscriptions en 2023) et juste devant le Chihuahua, le Shih tzu et le Coton de tuléar.Des idées de noms idéals pour cette race de chienSi vous aspirez à inscrire votre compagnon dans la lignée des chiens de race, vous devez respecter la lettre de l’année pour le nommer :[letter-dog-name]Voici donc quelques suggestions de noms intéressants pour un Bouledogue Français, que ce soit un mâle ou une femelle :Pour un Bouledogue Français mâle :VortexVirtuoseVirileVadorXérèsPour une femelle Bouledogue Français :VedetteVictoireVénusVesperXaraAlors, qu’en pensez-vous ?

CONTENU:
Il n’y a pas de bon ou de mauvais chien, l’important est de choisir un chien qui vous convient et surtout qui ne souffrira pas de votre rythme de vie.Beaucoup d’entre nous sont attirés par certaines races en fonction de leur apparence et c’est bien normal.Cependant pour éviter d’éventuelles erreurs qui peuvent être source de problèmes pour vous, votre famille et votre chien il est très important d’étudier de plus prés les caractéristiques de votre futur compagnon.Il existe de nombreuses races de chiens, 330 selon la F.C.I. (Fédération Cynologique Internationnale).Il est parfois difficile de savoir par ou commencer lorsqu’on cherche à choisir un chien ou une race de chien qui nous correspond le mieux.Un bon moyen pour commencer est de s’interesser aux groupes de races de chien.Pour plus de clarté je les ai regroupés en 6 groupes, et vous pourrez voir que leurs caractéristiques, leurs besoins, et leur dressage sont très différents.Ensuite une fois que vous connaîtrez le groupe de chien qui vous interesse je vous faciliterai la vie avec un petit questionnaire qui vous donnera directement les races les plus adaptées à votre situation ;-) BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! Les chiens de travail Ce groupe comprend : rottweiler, doberman, saint-bernard et terre-neuve.Ces chiens sont adaptés à différentes tâches comme le gardiennage, la protection, la recherche, le sauvetage et les activités policières.Très intelligents et puissants, ils ont besoin d’exercices aussi bien physiques que psychologiques. Ils vous demanderont donc beaucoup d’attention.Ces chiens ont un instinct de défense et de territoire très développé, il faudra donc les sociabiliser très jeunes vis-à-vis des humains et des animaux.Si vous savez comment dresser un chien correctement les chiens de travail deviennent très affectueux et parfaitement adaptés à la vie en famille.Les chiens de chasse Ce groupe comprend : pointer, retriever, braques de Weimar, épagneul et labrador.Les chiens de chasse sont très sociables, ils sont également très obéissant – ils sont souvent désireux de plaire et de réagir promptement. Ces qualités en font de très bons animaux de compagnie et de bons choix pour un premier animal (très facile à dresser).Certains chiens de chasse ont été élevés pour travailler plutôt indépendamment de leur maître et des chasseurs, ainsi ils ont un très fort instinct qui les pousse à explorer et vagabonder.Pour cette raison, un entraînement adapté au rappel du chien est important avec les races de chasse avant de les autoriser à évoluer sans laisse, car ils ont facilement l’habitude de ne revenir vers leur maître que quand ils ont fini leur promenade !En règle générale, les chiens de chasse ont besoin de beaucoup d’exercice, ce qui signifie plusieurs sorties chaque jour et autant d’occasions de courir que possible. Votre chien mérite le meilleur départ ! Ne ratez pas notre ebook essentiel⤹ Prénom * Email * Les chiens de berger Ce groupe comprend : berger allemand, border collie, bouvier australien, briard et bobtail.Les chiens de berger ont été élevés pour contrôler des troupeaux de grande taille en liberté et parfois dangereux. Ils sont même parfois destinés à les protéger des prédateurs et des voleurs.Les chiens de berger sont souvent très intelligents, très sportifs et nécessitent beaucoup d’activité physique et mentale pour rester heureux. Ces chiens font généralement de formidables animaux de compagnie.Cependant, leurs instincts de berger, tels que le fait d’« entourer » les membres de la famille ou de mordiller vos talons sont fréquemment visibles, et surtout il peuvent être difficile à gérer voir pour certains d’entre eux impossible à estomper.Les Lévriers Les éclaireursLes éclaireurs comprennent : les afghans, les basenji, les greyhound, les whippets et les salukis.Les lévriers éclaireurs sont élevés pour chasser en meute, ils sont donc généralement très sociables à l’égard des autres chiens.En général, ils sont hauts sur pattes, minces et très rapides. Les lévriers éclaireurs ne doivent pas être libérés de leur laisse avant un travail complet de rappel, car une fois lâchés vous n’avez que très peu de chance de pouvoir les rattraper.Ces chiens demandent une bonne dose de travail quotidien pour rester heureux et en bonne santé, et ils doivent courir – si possible sans laisse – chaque fois que c’est possible.Les lévriers éclaireurs ont tendance à être sensibles par nature, et demandent un entraînement doux, calme et consistant.Ils sont assez indépendants, et peuvent être distants avec les étrangers. Ainsi, un travail de socialisation est nécessaire depuis leur plus jeune âge pour combattre leur timidité.Les pisteursLes pisteurs comprennent : les bassets hound, les saints-huberts, les coxhounds et les coonhounds.Les pisteurs ont été élevés pour pister le gibier, plutôt que de le pourchasser, et sont prédisposés à être perturbés par les odeurs qui les entourent.Pour cette raison, ils ne doivent pas être lâchés avant un travail complet de rappel. Un lévrier qui a senti quelque chose d’attirant va le suivre sans jeter un regard en arrière.Les lévriers pisteurs ont tendance à être bruyants, avec un aboiement et un hurlement caractéristiques qui porte sur des kilomètres.Cependant, ils ne semblent pas très disposés à crier comme le font les chiens de garde – les étrangers peuvent aller et revenir sans réaction du lévrier.Les pisteurs ne demandent pas beaucoup d’exercice, une bonne promenade quotidienne lui suffit. Leur nature gentille et affectueuse en fait d’excellents animaux de compagnie.Les Terriers Les terriers comprennent : les jack russell, les border terriers, les cairn, les airedale, les schnauzer miniatures, les skyes, les bulls et d’autres races comprenant le terme «terrier».Les terriers constituent un groupe très énergique. Leur indépendance et leur autorité peuvent les rendre difficiles à dresser, mais ils compensent ces tendances parfois énervantes en étant enjoués, drôles et affectueux.Les chiens de cette catégorie ont été élevés pour chasser et tuer des animaux rapides (blaireaux, renards, furets…).Pour cette raison, ils ont un instinct de prédateur très affirmé et pourchasseront la plupart des petites créatures qui s’aventureront dans les parages.Ils peuvent également être agressifs vis-à-vis des autres chiens. Les terriers vivent généralement très vieux, avec peu de défauts génétiques.Les chiens de salon Ce groupe comprend : les yorkshires, les maltais, les bichons frisés, les toy poodles, les pugs, les chihuahua et les loulous de Poméranie.Les chiens de salon sont parfois appelés « chiens de compagnie » car ils ont été élevés dans l’unique but de tenir compagnie aux humains.Les chiens de salon sont souvent beaux, amusants et affectueux avec des personnalités très affirmées.Il est généralement déconseillé de détenir ces chiens en compagnie de jeunes enfants, car ils réagissent violemment à la brutalité et à la provocation. De plus, ils sont très fragiles et peuvent être facilement blessés.Choisir un chien, une étape importante Choisir un chien parmi les 330 races qui existent peut-être long et fastidieux. Maintenant que vous connaissez les 6 grands groupes de chien, votre recherche devrait être plus rapide mais je vous conseille malgré tout de développer vos connaissances sur les races du groupe qui vous intéresse le plus.De nombreuses personnes ne prennent pas le temps de se renseigner sur la race de chien qu’ils souhaitent accueillir. Malheureusement les refuges sont remplis de chiens abandonnés par leurs maîtres simplement parce qu’ils n’ont pas fait cette recherche sérieusement. Ils se retrouvent avec un chien chez eux qui souffre de leur mode de vie et donc qui leur crée des problèmes.Si vous cherchez à mieux connaître votre chien je ne peux que vous féliciter et cela devrait être la première étape de toute personne souhaitant adopter un chien. Contrairement à ce qu’on pourrait croire, accueillir un chien chez soi n’est pas un acte banal et cela demande un peu de travail.Mais rassurez-vous ce travail ne sera pas fait en vain. Une fois que vous connaissez les principaux traits de caractère de votre futur chien, il vous sera beaucoup plus facile de le comprendre et de communiquer avec lui. Votre relation avec lui n’en sera que plus forte !Evidemment ça ne vous évitera pas les petits tracas du quotidien et vous devrez malgré tout apprendre à éduquer votre chien avec les bonnes méthodes. Mais votre travail devrait être facilité. Votre chien mérite le meilleur départ ! Ne ratez pas notre ebook essentiel⤹ Prénom * Email *

Ça paraît normal et pourtant ça l’est de moins en moins.Prenez soin de votre chienPrendre soin de son chien, ça ne veut pas dire le shampouiner la veille de votre rendez-vous. C’est quelque chose que vous devez faire au quotidien.Vous devez être attentif à son bien être mental et physique. Un chien épanoui avec des dents propres, un beau pelage, c’est un travail de tous les jours et ça se voit.Pour ce qui est de son bien être mental, promenez-vous régulièrement avec votre chien, faites lui découvrir de nouveaux endroits, de nouvelles odeurs et gardez à l’esprit qu’éduquer votre chien même aux simples ordres de bases est sûrement le meilleur moyen de le stimuler mentalement.

C’est parfois contraignant mais votre chien le mérite bien.Je reçois régulièrement des messages de personnes qui mettent en doute les compétences de leur vétérinaire et me demandent une autre solution.En général, il n’y a pas de meilleure solution que celle que vous a donnée votre vétérinaire et ce n’est sûrement pas moi qui le contredirais sans même avoir examiné votre chien.Une sincère appréciationJe ne parle pas d’un faux compliment sans saveur mais d’un retour sur votre expérience et si possible positif. Vétérinaire est un beau métier, c’est vrai.Mais n’allez pas croire que ça n’est pas dur. Il y a des moments très difficiles et il faut parfois avoir les reins solides.Alors un remerciement sincère, un petit mot pour partager votre gratitude pourra parfois égayer une journée difficile.N’hésitez pas à faire un peu de publicité pour votre vétérinaire, peut-être que celui-ci a un site internet ou une page Facebook où vous pourrez manifester votre sympathie.Respectez ces 5 conseils et vous ferez plaisir à votre vétérinaire !

Par exemple, si vous trouvez votre chienne très jolie, pourquoi ne pas l’appeler « Dolie » ?Avec ces astuces simples, vous devriez rapidement trouver des idées de noms pour votre chien ou chienne en « D ». Assurez-vous simplement de respecter les quelques règles suivantes…Les règles à respecter pour un nom de chien efficace Voici quelques conseils pratiques pour choisir un bon nom de chien commençant par la lettre « D », facile pour vous comme pour votre chien :Tout d’abord, optez pour un nom facile à prononcer, sans connotations négatives ou embarrassantes. Imaginez-vous en train d’appeler votre chien dans un parc public : « Débile, viens ici ! »Ensuite, évitez de choisir un nom qui pourrait être confondu avec un prénom humain. Bien que le prénom « Daniel » puisse vous sembler charmant, cela pourrait prêter à confusion si vous avez un ami du même nom. Il est préférable de choisir un nom distinctif pour votre chien.Enfin, privilégiez un nom court et facile à prononcer. Les noms trop longs comme « Dinosaure » peuvent être difficiles à utiliser au quotidien, tant pour vous que pour votre chien. Optez plutôt pour des noms courts et percutants, comme « Dora » ou « Dico ».En suivant ces conseils, vous trouverez sûrement un nom de chien en « D » parfaitement adapté à votre fidèle compagnon à quatre pattes !Apprendre son nom à votre chien : le premier pas de son éducation Commencer l’éducation de votre chien par l’apprentissage de son nom est une étape cruciale dans sa formation. Voici quelques conseils simples et positifs pour vous aider à réussir cette étape importante :Choisissez un moment calme dans une pièce sans distractions, avec quelques friandises à portée de main et/ou un jouet préféré de votre chien.Appelez votre chien par son nom et, s’il vous regarde, félicitez-le avec un « oui, bon chien ». Récompensez-le ensuite avec une friandise et quelques caresses ou une courte séance de jeu.Répétez cette séquence quelques fois, en espaçant les sessions d’une minute environ. Votre chien devrait rapidement comprendre que son nom est associé à quelque chose de positif et qu’il doit vous regarder et venir vers vous lorsqu’il est appelé.N’oubliez pas que l’éducation de votre chien commence dès son arrivée chez vous. Préparez-vous au mieux dès maintenant, car il y a beaucoup à apprendre !

Dans un premier temps vous allez devoir lui apprendre à reconnaître son nom.Une fois que votre chiot aura compris vous pourrez commencer par les premiers ordres indispensables : assis, couché et pas bougé.L’avantage de ces ordres c’est que vous pouvez faire de petits exercices avec votre chiot n’importe où et n’importe quand (juste avant les repas par exemple).Ensuite il y a trois autres points que vous devez travailler avec votre chien dès son plus jeune âge : le rappel, marcher en laisse et bien entendu, la propreté.Votre chiot mettra un peu de temps à maîtriser ces trois points, c’est tout à fait normal. Alors démarrer au plus vite et surtout soyez patient. Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! Eviter les mauvais comportementsLa plupart des mauvais comportements d’un chien adulte s’acquièrent à cet âge, et ils sont nombreux.Tirer sur sa laisse, sauter sur vous ou vos invités, mâchouiller tout ce qu’il trouve, pleurer ou détruire le mobilier lorsqu’il est seul, vous ignorer totalement, fuguer, la liste est vraiment longue.Vous devez donc faire en sorte que votre chiot ne développe pas ces comportements et lui montrer ce qu’il doit faire à la place.

Dresser son chien doit être une activité amusante pour vous comme pour votre chien.Pour dresser votre chien à reconnaître son nom il faut qu’il l’associe à quelque chose de positif. Donc la première chose à faire est d’avoir à disposition quelques friandises pour votre chien.L’idéal est d’en avoir à disposition dans la plupart des pièces ou votre chien circule, au moins pour quelques temps). Une fois que vous avez vos friandises à portée de main, l’exercice peut commencer…Choisissez d’abord une pièce calme ou votre chien pourra se concentrer uniquement sur vous. Avec une friandise dans la main prononcez le nom de votre chien.Si votre chien réagit et vous regarde encouragez le (« oui bon chien ») et donnez lui une friandise instantanément.Si votre chien ne réagit pas attendez quelques minutes et recommencez l’exercice. Pratiquez par session de 5 minutes, pas plus.Vous pouvez répéter l’exercice plusieurs fois par jour mais toujours dans une pièce calme. Après quelques sessions votre chien devrait réagir systématiquement, il est maintenant dressé à reconnaître son nom.Mais le dressage ne doit pas s’arrêter là, vous allez maintenant corser la difficulté ;-) Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! Vous allez faire le même exercice dans un milieu un peu plus délicat pour votre chien. Commencez dans votre jardin si vous en avez un, ou dans un parc pas trop agité.Votre chien attaché, vos friandises à portée de main, vous allez répéter l’exercice. Là encore encouragez instantanément votre chien si il réagit. Dans le cas contraire laissez le tranquille quelques minutes et recommencez le test. Petit à petit faîtes cet exercice dans des milieu de plus en plus agité.Au fur et à mesure diminuer la fréquence des friandises, encouragez uniquement votre chien oralement et par des caresses.Si au cours d’une balade votre chien réagit correctement malgré la présence d’autres chiens, d’enfant qui jouent, des voitures qui klaxonnent… alors félicitation !Vous avez dressé votre chien à reconnaître son nom et contrairement à ce qu’on pourrait croire ce n’est pas le cas de tous les maîtres.Les erreurs à ne pas commettre pour dresser son chien à reconnaître son nom Ce sont les erreurs classiques qu’il ne faut pas faire quelques soit l’exercice sur lequel vous travaillez avec votre chien.Récompensez votre chien à l’instant même ou il réagit à son nom. Si vous le faîtes trop tard votre chien n’associera pas son nom à quelque chose de positif et vous n’arriverez pas à le dresser.Si votre chien ne réagit pas, inutile d’insister, ne répétez pas son nom jusqu’à ce qu’il vous regarde. Votre chien n’a droit qu’à un seul essai, s’il vous regarde c’est gagné, sinon vous lui donnerez une autre chance plus tard.Votre chien doit comprendre que vos ordres sont importants et qu’il ne gagnera rien à les ignorer. Pratiquez par courte période mais régulièrement.Une fois que votre chien réagit correctement vous devez le tester le plus souvent possible (attention uniquement si vous avez des récompenses à porter de main).Changez de milieu régulièrement pour tester les réactions de votre chien.

CATÉGORIE: Non catégorisé
CONTENU:
Généralement, il est assez facile de savoir si quelqu’un est malade ou souffre. D’abord parce que cette personne va s’en plaindre mais aussi parce que son corps va le signaler d’une manière ou d’une autre.Pour les chiens c’est un peu plus compliqué. D’abord parce qu’ils ne peuvent pas communiquer clairement avec nous leurs souffrances. Et même s’ils essayent de nous signaler leur douleur, les symptômes ne sont jamais très clairs.Heureusement il y a quelques indices qui peuvent vous permettre de savoir si votre chien souffre bien plus qu’il ne le laisse paraître. BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! Votre chien s’exprime plus que d’habitudeMême si votre chien joue les durs, il y a de fortes chances pour qu’il s’exprime plus que d’habitude lorsqu’il souffre.Malheureusement à moins que ce ne soit directement lié à quelque chose de physique (lorsqu’il pose sa patte arrière droite par exemple) c’est très difficile de savoir exactement ce qui le fait souffrir.Un chien qui souffre va s’exprimer de différentes manières : gémissements, pleurs, jappements, grognements, aboiements, hurlements…Bref si votre chien s’exprime plus que d’habitude, il est possible qu’une partie de son corps le fasse souffrir. Inspectez votre chien au plus vite et emmenez le chez son vétérinaire si vous ne trouvez rien et que les symptômes persistent.Une toilette excessiveQuand un chien est blessé, son instinct le pousse à nettoyer et soigner la plaie en la léchant. S’il s’agit d’une blessure externe comme une coupure, égratignure ou brulure, il est assez facile de le repérer et d’aider votre chien à guérir.En revanche les chiens vont avoir le même comportement si c’est une douleur interne et même en y regardant de prés vous ne verrez rien. A vous de surveiller et si votre chien insiste il faudra consulter votre vétérinaire.Des différences dans son alimentation ou son sommeil Beaucoup de chien vont changer leurs habitudes d’alimentation ou de sommeil s’ils souffrent.Ils vont par exemple dormir plus souvent et plus longtemps pour essayer de guérir ou parce que bouger réveille la douleur.De la même façon leur appétit peut être modifié. En général un chien qui souffre va perdre de l’appétit mais une augmentation soudaine peut aussi être un signe que votre chien n’est pas bien.Même chose pour l’eau, si votre chien souffre vous pouvez constater des changements d’habitude.Un changement significatif et soudain de ces éléments est souvent le signe que votre chien souffre.Une respiration difficileLa respiration de votre chien est également un bon indice pour savoir s’il souffre. Si votre chien a l’air essoufflé alors qu’il ne fait pas plus d’activité que d’habitude il est possible qu’il soit malade.Si sa respiration vous paraît plus rapide ou moins puissante, votre chien est peut-être malade ou a ingéré quelque chose qui gêne sa respiration.Allez consulter au plus vite !Des yeux différentsUn chien qui plisse des yeux de manière plus fréquente qu’à la normale peut être le signe qu’il a mal aux yeux. Observer sa pupille, une pupille plus petite est le signe d’une douleur aux yeux.A l’inverse une pupille plus large est le signe d’une douleur dans une autre partie de son corps. Sachez également qu’un chien qui se lèche les pattes pour se frotter les yeux a sûrement une douleur provenant des yeux.Commencez par lui nettoyer les yeux et si le problème persiste il vaut mieux consulter.Votre chien a du mal à se « poser »Si votre chien souffre il peut ressentir une douleur lorsqu’il s’assoit ou se couche.Si vous constatez que votre chien s’assoit ou se couche dans des positions étranges vous devriez vérifier si votre chien a une blessure (mais je ne parle pas de ces superbes poses que nos chiens prennent quand ils dorment ;-).Si votre chien essaye de s’assoir ou de se coucher et que quelques secondes après il se lève pour bouger et réessaye c’est un signe (généralement accompagné d’un bruit quand il se lève).Changement de style affectif Certains chiens vont se mettre à fuir leur maître lorsqu’ils souffrent, ils vont essayer de se cacher pour être tranquilles et guérir.D’autres peuvent devenir agressifs, se mettre à grogner quand vous approchez et même mordre par peur que vous ne leur fassiez plus mal encore.C’est leur instinct de protection qui reprend le dessus.Enfin certains chiens vont devenir encore plus affectifs que d’habitude et être en recherche permanente de votre affection.Donc si vous constatez un changement de comportement dans l’affection de votre chien, n’y voyez rien de personnel, il se peut tout simplement qu’il souffre de quelque chose.Détecter quand votre chien souffreMême si ces signes ne sont pas toujours très clairs et ne vous indiquent pas clairement d’où vient le problème, un comportement inhabituel de votre chien peut être le signe qu’il souffre de quelque chose.L’une des choses que vous pouvez faire dans un premier temps est de vérifier si votre chien a une blessure externe. Si il n’y a aucun signe, vous pouvez palper votre chien avec douceur mais fermeté comme le ferez votre vétérinaire pour savoir s’il souffre.Une chose est sûre : plus vous observerez votre chien, plus vous serez proche de lui au quotidien et plus il vous sera facile de détecter rapidement si son comportement est inhabituel. Vous pourrez ainsi être plus réactif dès que votre chien montrera des signes de souffrance.Alors arrêtez de surfer et allez voir si votre chien va bien !

C’est parfois contraignant mais votre chien le mérite bien.Je reçois régulièrement des messages de personnes qui mettent en doute les compétences de leur vétérinaire et me demandent une autre solution.En général, il n’y a pas de meilleure solution que celle que vous a donnée votre vétérinaire et ce n’est sûrement pas moi qui le contredirais sans même avoir examiné votre chien.Une sincère appréciationJe ne parle pas d’un faux compliment sans saveur mais d’un retour sur votre expérience et si possible positif. Vétérinaire est un beau métier, c’est vrai.Mais n’allez pas croire que ça n’est pas dur. Il y a des moments très difficiles et il faut parfois avoir les reins solides.Alors un remerciement sincère, un petit mot pour partager votre gratitude pourra parfois égayer une journée difficile.N’hésitez pas à faire un peu de publicité pour votre vétérinaire, peut-être que celui-ci a un site internet ou une page Facebook où vous pourrez manifester votre sympathie.Respectez ces 5 conseils et vous ferez plaisir à votre vétérinaire !

TITRE: Signes et symptômes que votre chien souffre
CATÉGORIE: Non catégorisé
CONTENU:
Généralement, il est assez facile de savoir si quelqu’un est malade ou souffre. D’abord parce que cette personne va s’en plaindre mais aussi parce que son corps va le signaler d’une manière ou d’une autre.Pour les chiens c’est un peu plus compliqué. D’abord parce qu’ils ne peuvent pas communiquer clairement avec nous leurs souffrances. Et même s’ils essayent de nous signaler leur douleur, les symptômes ne sont jamais très clairs.Heureusement il y a quelques indices qui peuvent vous permettre de savoir si votre chien souffre bien plus qu’il ne le laisse paraître. BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! Votre chien s’exprime plus que d’habitudeMême si votre chien joue les durs, il y a de fortes chances pour qu’il s’exprime plus que d’habitude lorsqu’il souffre.Malheureusement à moins que ce ne soit directement lié à quelque chose de physique (lorsqu’il pose sa patte arrière droite par exemple) c’est très difficile de savoir exactement ce qui le fait souffrir.Un chien qui souffre va s’exprimer de différentes manières : gémissements, pleurs, jappements, grognements, aboiements, hurlements…Bref si votre chien s’exprime plus que d’habitude, il est possible qu’une partie de son corps le fasse souffrir. Inspectez votre chien au plus vite et emmenez le chez son vétérinaire si vous ne trouvez rien et que les symptômes persistent.Une toilette excessiveQuand un chien est blessé, son instinct le pousse à nettoyer et soigner la plaie en la léchant. S’il s’agit d’une blessure externe comme une coupure, égratignure ou brulure, il est assez facile de le repérer et d’aider votre chien à guérir.En revanche les chiens vont avoir le même comportement si c’est une douleur interne et même en y regardant de prés vous ne verrez rien. A vous de surveiller et si votre chien insiste il faudra consulter votre vétérinaire.Des différences dans son alimentation ou son sommeil Beaucoup de chien vont changer leurs habitudes d’alimentation ou de sommeil s’ils souffrent.Ils vont par exemple dormir plus souvent et plus longtemps pour essayer de guérir ou parce que bouger réveille la douleur.De la même façon leur appétit peut être modifié. En général un chien qui souffre va perdre de l’appétit mais une augmentation soudaine peut aussi être un signe que votre chien n’est pas bien.Même chose pour l’eau, si votre chien souffre vous pouvez constater des changements d’habitude.Un changement significatif et soudain de ces éléments est souvent le signe que votre chien souffre.Une respiration difficileLa respiration de votre chien est également un bon indice pour savoir s’il souffre. Si votre chien a l’air essoufflé alors qu’il ne fait pas plus d’activité que d’habitude il est possible qu’il soit malade.Si sa respiration vous paraît plus rapide ou moins puissante, votre chien est peut-être malade ou a ingéré quelque chose qui gêne sa respiration.Allez consulter au plus vite !Des yeux différentsUn chien qui plisse des yeux de manière plus fréquente qu’à la normale peut être le signe qu’il a mal aux yeux. Observer sa pupille, une pupille plus petite est le signe d’une douleur aux yeux.A l’inverse une pupille plus large est le signe d’une douleur dans une autre partie de son corps. Sachez également qu’un chien qui se lèche les pattes pour se frotter les yeux a sûrement une douleur provenant des yeux.Commencez par lui nettoyer les yeux et si le problème persiste il vaut mieux consulter.Votre chien a du mal à se « poser »Si votre chien souffre il peut ressentir une douleur lorsqu’il s’assoit ou se couche.Si vous constatez que votre chien s’assoit ou se couche dans des positions étranges vous devriez vérifier si votre chien a une blessure (mais je ne parle pas de ces superbes poses que nos chiens prennent quand ils dorment ;-).Si votre chien essaye de s’assoir ou de se coucher et que quelques secondes après il se lève pour bouger et réessaye c’est un signe (généralement accompagné d’un bruit quand il se lève).Changement de style affectif Certains chiens vont se mettre à fuir leur maître lorsqu’ils souffrent, ils vont essayer de se cacher pour être tranquilles et guérir.D’autres peuvent devenir agressifs, se mettre à grogner quand vous approchez et même mordre par peur que vous ne leur fassiez plus mal encore.C’est leur instinct de protection qui reprend le dessus.Enfin certains chiens vont devenir encore plus affectifs que d’habitude et être en recherche permanente de votre affection.Donc si vous constatez un changement de comportement dans l’affection de votre chien, n’y voyez rien de personnel, il se peut tout simplement qu’il souffre de quelque chose.Détecter quand votre chien souffreMême si ces signes ne sont pas toujours très clairs et ne vous indiquent pas clairement d’où vient le problème, un comportement inhabituel de votre chien peut être le signe qu’il souffre de quelque chose.L’une des choses que vous pouvez faire dans un premier temps est de vérifier si votre chien a une blessure externe. Si il n’y a aucun signe, vous pouvez palper votre chien avec douceur mais fermeté comme le ferez votre vétérinaire pour savoir s’il souffre.Une chose est sûre : plus vous observerez votre chien, plus vous serez proche de lui au quotidien et plus il vous sera facile de détecter rapidement si son comportement est inhabituel. Vous pourrez ainsi être plus réactif dès que votre chien montrera des signes de souffrance.Alors arrêtez de surfer et allez voir si votre chien va bien !

CONTENU:
A quel âge débuter l’éducation de son chiot ? Est-ce que mon chiot est trop jeune pour démarrer son éducation ?Voilà des questions que de nombreux maîtres se posent. En règle générale, de nombreux maîtres démarrent l’éducation de leur chiot trop tard. Lorsque les mauvais comportements font leur apparition ils prennent conscience qu’il est temps d’éduquer leur chiot.Même si il n’est jamais trop tard pour le faire c’est beaucoup plus difficile puisqu’il ne s’agit plus simplement d’éduquer son chiot mais bien de le rééduquer. Alors autant commencer au bon âge et voici quelques conseils pour savoir à quel âge démarrer l’éducation de son chiot… BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante.

Trop jeune pour débuter l’éducation de son chiot ?C’est l’argument qui revient le plus souvent : «mon chiot est trop jeune pour être éduquer».Pourtant c’est une erreur de penser cela. En réalité l’éducation de votre chiot a démarré depuis longtemps.Dès sa naissance, sa mère a commencé à l’élever. Ses frères et sœurs ont également participé à son éducation à travers le jeu par exemple.Enfin l’éleveur a lui aussi contribué à son éducation. Les meilleurs éleveurs sociabilisent, apprennent la propreté au chiot et certains vont même jusqu’à les préparer à l’angoisse de la séparation.Donc votre chiot n’est pas trop jeune pour être éduqué, ne perdez pas de temps ! Vous devez démarrer l’éducation de votre chiot dès son arrivée chez vous. Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! Eduquer tôt pour un futur chien équilibréLorsqu’on accueille un chiot on est tenté de le laisser faire ce qu’il veut à travers l’appartement et la maison. Quoi de plus amusant que de voir un petit chiot courir partout et sauter sur tout ce qui bouge !Pourtant trop de liberté n’est pas sain pour le développement de votre chiot. Depuis sa naissance votre chiot a toujours suivi des règles.Les règles peuvent être une privation de liberté pour nous, mais pour un chiot elles sont nécessaires. Elles sont rassurantes, elles donnent des repères à votre chiot, lui permette de se situer au sein d’une meute.Un chiot qui ne suit pas de règles est comme un navire sans gouvernail, dans très peu de temps il n’aura plus de repères et les troubles du comportement vont apparaître.Votre chiot s’éduque avec ou sans vous Les chiots sont très observateurs et ils apprennent par répétition dès le plus jeune âge.Que vous le vouliez ou non votre chiot va apprendre des choses autant faire en sorte que ce soit les bonnes du premier coup.Vous appréciez surement qu’il vous saute dessus pour l’instant et lui donner une caresse quand il le fait.Votre chiot va enregistrer cette information : je saute dessus = caresse. Quand il aura pris 15kg de plus vous risquez de le regretter.L’éducation de votre chiot se fera dans tous les cas, avec vous ou à vos dépend. A vous de voir ce que vous préférez.Comment éduquer son chiot ?Pour éduquer un chiot il faut évidemment commencer en douceur. Vous trouverez de nombreuses informations dans cet article sur l’éducation du chiot entre 2 et 5 mois.Vous avez énormément de choses à apprendre pour comprendre comment fonctionne votre chiot et comment il apprend.Votre chiot lui aussi a énormément de choses à apprendre : son nom et tous les ordres de bases comme assis, couché, le rappel, pas bougé, marcher en laisse… et bien entendu la propreté.Vous devez également apprendre à gérer les mauvais comportement comme le fait qu’il tire en laisse, qu’il saute sur les invités, qu’il morde, qu’il mâchouille vos chaussures…Comme vous pouvez le constater la liste est longue et plus vous démarrer l’éducation de votre chiot tôt, plus ce sera facile.Si vous cherchez une méthode pas à pas pour éduquer votre chiot en douceur, je vous recommande la méthode « Dresser son chien en 15 minutes par jour« .C’est une formation complète et simple à suivre !

TITRE: Problème de demande d’attention du chien
CATÉGORIE: Non catégorisé
CONTENU:
Difficile de résister à son chien, difficile de l’ignorer même quand on a des choses à faire. Surtout lorsqu’il vient de débarquer chez vous.On peut très rapidement donner de mauvaises habitudes à son chien. C’est pour cette raison que de nombreux maîtres rencontrent des problèmes d’attention avec leurs chiens lorsqu’ils ont moins de temps à leur consacrer.Pour éviter les futurs problèmes d’attention et dresser votre chien correctement, il y a quelques règles à suivre… BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! Les erreurs face aux demandes d’attention de votre chienGardez le contrôle ! Vous êtes le leader, pas votre chien. C’est l’une des bases pour dresser son chien correctement. C’est donc à vous de choisir le moment ou vous voulez donner de l’attention à votre chien.Quand votre chien vient chercher de l’attention ne lui donnez pas systématiquement. Je sais que c’est difficile et on a tendance à répondre positivement à toutes les demandes de son chien.Mais c’est une erreur et souvenez vous que vous ne lui rendez pas service en le faisant. Donc de temps en temps ne lui donnez pas l’attention qu’il réclame.C’est très facile à faire, il vous suffit de ne pas le regarder, lui parler ou le toucher.Vous pouvez également lui tourner le dos et si il insiste un peu trop n’hésitez pas à quitter la pièce. Votre chien comprendra très bien le message et rassurez vous il reviendra vers vous très bientôt ;-)Evidemment dans la plupart des cas vous lui donnerez l’attention dont il a besoin, mais là encore il y a une manière de le faire qui vous permet de garder le contrôle des choses… Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour ! La bonne attitude face aux demandes d’attention de votre chienVous avez peut-être tendance à jouer avec votre chien pendant des heures jusqu’à ce qu’il soit fatigué ?De temps en temps faîtes l’inverse. Prenez la décision de mettre fin au jeu. Laissez votre chien seul, ne le regardez pas, et quittez la pièce.Là encore ne vous trompez pas votre chien ne sera pas vexé il comprendra que son maître n’a plus envie de jouer (les chiens sont moins caractériels que les humains ;-).L’un des problèmes que rencontrent certains maîtres est le « vol ». Si votre chien aime prendre des choses qui vous appartiennent pour vous faire courir, alors vous avez un problème d’attention.Quand on souhaite dresser son chien on apprend très vite qu’il fonctionne par association. Si vous lui courez après lorsqu’il vole un de vos objets votre chien apprend qu’il peut gagner votre attention avec cette méthode et donc il continuera à voler des objets.Pour éviter les problèmes de demande d’attention, il est préférable de ne pas laissez votre chien vous suivre à la trace dans la maison. L’idéal est de délimiter l’espace de liberté de votre chien (voir article préparer sa maison pour l’arrivée d’un chien).C’est d’une part très utile pour habituer votre chien à la solitude de temps en temps et c’est également très pratique puisqu’il ne pourra pas vous réclamer de l’attention toute la journée (ça vous évitera surtout de craquer et de lui donner trop d’attention ;-)N’oubliez pas que votre chien fonctionne par association, c’est la base du dressage.Donc si vous avez ignoré votre chien lorsqu’il est venu vous demander de l’attention, attendez patiemment qu’il passe à autre chose avant de retourner jouer avec lui.Attendez qu’il joue seul, ou qu’il soit dans son panier et jetez vous sur lui pour le plus gros câlin de la journée !Soyez fort ! Ne craquez pas même si votre chien vous demande de l’attention Cliquez maintenant pour découvrir la méthode ⤹Eduquer son chien en 15 minutes par jour !

TITRE: Comment choisir son vétérinaire
CATÉGORIE: Non catégorisé
CONTENU:
Choisir un bon vétérinaire est sans aucun doute le plus beau cadeau que vous puissiez lui faire. Après vous et votre famille, le vétérinaire est la personne la plus importante pour votre chien.Voici quelques critères à prendre en compte et quelques vérifications à faire pour choisir le bon vétérinaire. BONS PLANS DU MOMENT Housse de sièges imperméable, antidérapante. Seulement 29,90€ 300 sacs à dejection pour seulement 9,90€ Laisse avec poignée rembourrée seulement 9€ ! Critères pour choisir un vétérinaire Proximité du vétérinaireL’un des critères les plus importants pour choisir son vétérinaire reste la proximité. C’est très pratique, en cas d’urgence, de pouvoir emmener son chien en quelques minutes chez son vétérinaire.L’idéal étant de pouvoir y aller à pied pour éviter un trajet en voiture à votre chien. Pour trouver les vétérinaires près de chez vous rendez vous sur www.veterinaire.fr Votre chien mérite le meilleur départ ! Ne ratez pas notre ebook essentiel⤹ Prénom * Email * Le bouche à oreilleC’est un bon moyen d’obtenir de bonnes adresses et des informations.Mais attention n’écartez pas un vétérinaire de votre liste à cause d’un avis négatif. Certaines personnes ne sont jamais satisfaites et il est préférable de visiter le vétérinaire vous même et de vous faire votre propre opinion.Il serait dommage de ne pas choisir le vétérinaire en bas de chez vous uniquement parce que votre voisin a une dent contre lui.Les horaires de votre vétérinaireDans la mesure du possible il est préférable que les horaires de votre vétérinaire soient adaptées aux vôtres ou au moins à l’un des membres de votre famille qui est en mesure d’emmener votre chien chez le vétérinaire.Services d’urgence de votre vétérinaireIl est intéressant de savoir comment fonctionne votre vétérinaire en cas d’urgence.Est ce que son cabinet gère les urgences 24h/24 ? Travaille-t-il en collaboration avec d’autres vétérinaires ? Ou sont traités les chiens si il n’est pas disponible ou si il n’est pas équipé pour faire face à l’urgence et est ce loin de chez vous ?Il est préférable de connaître ces informations avant de choisir votre vétérinaire.Question de feeling pour choisir votre vétérinaire C’est un critère qui ne servira techniquement pas à grand chose pour votre chien mais qui est beaucoup plus important que l’on ne le pense.Le vétérinaire est souvent votre premier contact en cas de problème, il est important que vous vous sentiez en confiance avec lui. Il faut que vous soyez assez à l’aise pour partager vos angoisses et poser toutes les questions que vous jugez nécessaires.Il faut également que celui-ci prenne le temps de vous répondre.La santé de votre chien est un travail d’équipe entre vous qui côtoyez vôtre chien au quotidien et votre vétérinaire qui sait déceler d’éventuels problèmes de santé. Pour que vous formiez une bonne équipe avec votre vétérinaire vous devez communiquer correctement.Les tarifs des vétérinairesLes tarifs des vétérinaires sont libres, ils dépendent principalement des charges du cabinet (loyer, matériel, salaires, …). Pour choisir votre vétérinaire il peut être intéressant de comparer le prix d’une consultation simple pour un chien.Mais ne donnez pas trop d’importance à ce critère car vous pourriez le regretter un jour. En matière de santé il est toujours préférable de ne pas se poser la question du prix.Plutôt que de choisir le vétérinaire le moins cher je vous recommande de vous libérer l’esprit de ce problème et de prendre une simple assurance pour chien.La visite test de votre vétérinaireC’est le dernier critère qui devra vous permettre de vous décider. Appelez le vétérinaire pour une petite visite (inutile d’emmener votre chien pour le moment).C’est l’occasion de tout vérifier une dernière fois : le temps de transport pour y aller, la propreté et l’odeur des locaux, la fréquentation, l’accueil du personnel, l’accueil du vétérinaire (si il est disponible), le contact facile, les équipements…Bref enregistrez tous les sentiments et informations qui vous permettront de choisir le bon vétérinaire…Les différents types de vétérinaires En cherchant votre vétérinaire vous allez découvrir qu’il existe différents types d’établissements vétérinaires :le cabinet vétérinaire,la clinique vétérinaireet le centre hospitalier vétérinaire.Les différences entre ces trois types d’établissements vétérinaires résident dans le nombre de pièces disponibles, leurs équipements, leur personnel et donc les services qu’ils sont capables d’offrir.Le centre hospitalier vétérinaireUn centre hospitalier vétérinaire doit par exemple compter 6 vétérinaires minimum et un auxiliaire spécialisé pour chaque vétérinaire.Il doit être en mesure d’assurer la gestion des urgences, les soins aux animaux, les interventions médico-chirurgicales et le suivi des animaux hospitalisés, le tout 24h/24 et 7j/7.Les locaux et l’équipement d’un centre hospitalier sont donc plus conséquents puisqu’il doit être en mesure de répondre à tous les cas possibles et imaginables.Le gros avantage d’un centre hospitalier c’est que les vétérinaires peuvent tout faire sur place mais c’est aussi pour ça que les tarifs sont un peu plus élevés.La clinique vétérinaireUne clinique vétérinaire est plus petite qu’un centre hospitalier : moins de personnel, moins de locaux et moins d’équipement.Mais rassurez-vous une clinique vétérinaire reste très bien équipé et sera capable, sauf cas vraiment exceptionnel, de prendre en charge votre chien de A à Z.La grande différence avec un centre hospitalier réside dans le fait qu’une clinique n’est pas obligée de surveiller les animaux hospitalisés, y compris la nuit et le week-end.De même elle n’est pas tenue d’assurer les urgences. Ce sera donc à vous de vérifier avec le personnel avant de les choisir.Le cabinet vétérinaireLe cabinet vétérinaire contient au moins un lieu de réception, une pièce réservée aux examens et aux interventions médico-chirugicales. Comme la clinique, le cabinet n’est pas tenu d’assurer les urgences.Là encore certains cabinets vétérinaire sont parfaitement équipé pour répondre aux soins courants de votre chien, à vous de voir pendant votre visite comment sont gérées les urgences.Enfin il existe également le vétérinaire à domicile qui viendra directement chez vous mais qui évidemment aura une marge de manœuvre limitée.Vous savez tout sur les vétérinaires et vous devriez pouvoir faire votre choix facilement maintenant…N’oubliez pas de garder le numéro d’urgence de votre vétérinaire préféré à portée de main !

TITRE: Signes et symptômes que votre chien souffre
CATÉGORIE: Non catégorisé
CONTENU:
Généralement, il est assez facile de savoir si quelqu’un est malade ou souffre. D’abord parce que cette personne va s’en plaindre mais aussi parce que son corps va le signaler d’une manière ou d’une autre.Pour les chiens c’est un peu plus compliqué. D’abord parce qu’ils ne peuvent pas communiquer clairement avec nous leurs souffrances. Et même s’ils essayent de nous signaler leur douleur, les symptômes ne sont jamais très clairs.Heureusement il y a quelques indices qui peuvent vous permettre de savoir si votre chien souffre bien plus qu’il ne le laisse paraître.

A vous de surveiller et si votre chien insiste il faudra consulter votre vétérinaire.Des différences dans son alimentation ou son sommeil Beaucoup de chien vont changer leurs habitudes d’alimentation ou de sommeil s’ils souffrent.Ils vont par exemple dormir plus souvent et plus longtemps pour essayer de guérir ou parce que bouger réveille la douleur.De la même façon leur appétit peut être modifié. En général un chien qui souffre va perdre de l’appétit mais une augmentation soudaine peut aussi être un signe que votre chien n’est pas bien.Même chose pour l’eau, si votre chien souffre vous pouvez constater des changements d’habitude.Un changement significatif et soudain de ces éléments est souvent le signe que votre chien souffre.Une respiration difficileLa respiration de votre chien est également un bon indice pour savoir s’il souffre. Si votre chien a l’air essoufflé alors qu’il ne fait pas plus d’activité que d’habitude il est possible qu’il soit malade.Si sa respiration vous paraît plus rapide ou moins puissante, votre chien est peut-être malade ou a ingéré quelque chose qui gêne sa respiration.Allez consulter au plus vite !Des yeux différentsUn chien qui plisse des yeux de manière plus fréquente qu’à la normale peut être le signe qu’il a mal aux yeux.
