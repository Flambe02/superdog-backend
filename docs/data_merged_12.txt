What is C.L.A.S.S.™?
C.L.A.S.S.™, or Canine Life And Social Skills™, is an educational and hands-on program to promote training focused on the use of positive reinforcement and to strengthen relationships between humans and their canine companions. Developed in 2010 by the Association of Pet Dog Trainers based on input from dog owners and non-dog owners, shelter workers, and professional dog trainers, C.L.A.S.S.™ is just one of many programs offered by the APDT to promote caring relationships between dogs and their owners through using reward-based training methods. Canine Life And Social Skills™ benefits pet owners, dogs, and those around them!

Who Should Read This Handbook?
This handbook is for anyone interested in learning about the C.L.A.S.S.™ program. This Student Handbook provides an overview of the C.L.A.S.S.™ components, and expounds on the Assessment portion of the program by describing the information that pet owners need to prepare themselves and their dogs for C.L.A.S.S.™

C.L.A.S.S.™ Overview
C.L.A.S.S.™ is an extensive program comprised of several components. The following introduces each of the C.L.A.S.S.™ components, providing insight into the program’s purpose.

C.L.A.S.S.™ Components
Education
At its core, C.L.A.S.S.™ is an educational tool, providing resources and promoting understanding in dog training methods that focus on using positive reinforcement and on building relationships and communication between dog and owner. C.L.A.S.S.™ and the APDT offer these educational resources freely: to pet owners, the veterinary community, the general public, shelters, and dog trainers. Additional educational tools for dog trainers include curriculum ideas for teaching C.L.A.S.S.™ skills.

Understanding Dog Behavior
Dogs are not furry little people, and problems can arise when humans apply human characteristics to explain dog behavior. Dog behavior is often misunderstood, and myths have been perpetuated regarding their behavior. Dogs should be studied and understood as a species. The more we understand dogs, the better relationship we can have with our dog. In order to minimize confusion and strife, it is important to know the facts based on scientific research. For instance, most dogs are not behaving “badly” in a dog sense; they are just using normal dog behaviors to get their needs met or to resolve conflict. They use those behaviors because it’s what they know, and in dog culture, they usually work. Dogs do not feel guilty in the human sense of the word since dogs do not think in terms of right and wrong, but in terms of what works and what does not work for them. Dog behavior is driven by doggy needs, not human emotion or morals. Canine Life And Social Skills™ is not just about training our dogs; it is about training people, too! Through the C.L.A.S.S.™ program, students can find resources for learning about dog behavior, including locating training professionals dedicated to advocating dog-friendly techniques. One of the requirements of the entry-level C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluation is that owners pass a multiple-choice test on basic dog information and responsible pet ownership.

Promote Positive Training
C.L.A.S.S.™, through its evaluation, curriculum, and training resources, advocates the use of reward-based training. Positive, reward-based training minimizes the use of punishment and is fun for you and your dog! C.L.A.S.S.™ promotes relationship-based training, training in which the communication is two-way, the mutual trust is strong, and the student (i.e. dog owner) gets to know the dog as an individual to help him reach his

potential. It is training that is instructive, telling the dog, without anger or force, what we would like the dog to do. The human tendency is to notice and react when a dog (or person!) is doing something we don’t like. Yet we would have much better relationships if we rewarded the dog (and person!) for doing things we do like. Help set the dog up for success by giving feedback and rewards for behavior you like, and by arranging the learning environment so that the behavior you want is easily produced. Positive, reward-based training does not mean that your training is indulgent or without restraint. Clear boundaries and rules still need to be set for our canine companions. For one, dogs feel more secure with clear boundaries, because they know what is expected of them. Two, boundaries are necessary to maintain harmony in the human household. With positive, reward-based training methods, those rules and boundaries can be established without creating a confrontational atmosphere.

Does Positive, Reward-Based Training Work?
Research has shown that positive reinforcement—rewarding a desired behavior—is an effective and reliable method of teaching new behaviors or changing current behaviors in any physically and mentally healthy animal. In other words, dogs are more likely to repeat behaviors that get rewarded, which is why positive reinforcement works. It is a simple rule that behaviors resulting in pleasant consequences will be repeated, and behaviors with no payoff will decrease. Positive consequences can be anything from treats and belly rubs, to going for a walk and sitting next to you. Furthermore, learning occurs readily in a reward-based training program in which the dog feels safe and relaxed. Training that relies on the use of physical and emotional punishment creates stress, hinder the learning process, and can harm the relationship.

Strengthen Dog/Student Relationships
A positive approach develops and safeguards harmonious relationships by maintaining a mutual trust between dog and student. By encouraging positive, rewards-based training, the C.L.A.S.S.™ program strengthens relationships through effective communication, understanding, and quality time spent together. Effective communication is essential to any relationship. Training is communicating to help a dog learn what we want him to do, not forcing him to do it. Dogs and humans are born speaking different languages. When a dog is brought into a human household, it is up to the human to

communicate in a way the dog understands. Similarly, dogs have an expressive and well-developed system of body language for communication. If we expect the dog to listen to us, we should listen to what the dog is telling us. Relationships are further enhanced by understanding the dog as an individual, learning the dog’s personality and the dog’s likes and dislikes. Remember that rewards are specific to each dog. The dog/student relationship is also strengthened through shared activity. With positive, rewards-based training we spend quality time with the dog, resulting in the dog learning so that he has the social skills to spend more time with people. Dogs are living, emotional beings who thrive on social interaction; they require human attention to be well-adjusted, not to mention to learn appropriate social behavior. A dog left out in the yard is not only deprived of required human attention and a sense of belonging but the skills needed to live with humans, as dogs will do whatever works for them if left to their own devices.

Assessment
The C.L.A.S.S.™ assessment program provides students with the opportunity to demonstrate the practical reallife skills of their dogs through an evaluation. During an evaluation, students accompany their dogs through a series of real-life activities so that their training skills may be assessed by a professional trainer who has been approved as a C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluator. Passing a C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluation is a testimony to the life skills that a student and his dog have developed together. There are three C.L.A.S.S.™ assessment levels: The Bachelor’s (B.A.) Level assesses the core life skills of a student/dog team. The Master’s (M.A.) Level assesses the life skills of a student/dog team with distractions. The Doctorate (Ph.D.) Level is the highest level, designed to assess the performance reliability of a dog/student team’s life skills. All students begin in the B.A. Level, and progress to higher levels as they pass each level. Students must pass a written exam testing the student’s understanding of basic dog handling and care as a requirement to begin earning C.L.A.S.S.™ certificates. Successfully completing each C.L.A.S.S.™ level is like earning an academic degree in real-life skills with your dog.

Encouragement of Ongoing Training
With its emphasis on teaching and maintaining reliable life skills as well as advancing to higher levels of training, the C.L.A.S.S.™ program supports continual training and encourages owners to engage in more shared activities with their dogs. Dogs are continually learning with every behavior, so why not use training to be proactive in what your dog does learn?

There are so many reasons to continue training with your dog: • • • • • • Training redirects your dog’s natural behaviors to acceptable outlets Training builds your dog's behavioral repertoire

The more acceptable behaviors a dog learns, the less room there is for undesirable behaviors Training is fun Training increases the odds that a dog will stay in the family for his lifetime rather than be given up due to behavior issues Training makes it possible to engage in many more activities with a well-trained dog, such as: o o o o o o o Earning C.L.A.S.S.™ B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. Certificates Ongoing training classes Dog sports and games Animal-assisted therapy work Outings Vacations Search and Rescue

Expand Opportunities for Well-Behaved Pets
C.L.A.S.S.™ is about teaching and appreciating real-life, practical skills, such as walking nicely on a leash, settle, meeting strangers, table manners, attention, and come when called, just to name a few. Moreover, by using those skills in everyday situations, a dog can become a well-behaved member of your household and a welcome part of society. As responsible pet ownership and real-life training increases, the C.L.A.S.S.™ program will continue to secure benefits for C.L.A.S.S.™ graduates throughout communities by partnering with insurance, hospitality, and realtor associations in order to promote more public access for well-trained dogs and their owners.

Support for Shelters and Rescues
Another component of the C.L.A.S.S.™ program is to support training efforts of animal shelters and rescues. The lack of training or improper training is a primary reason for pets being relinquished to a shelter. C.L.A.S.S.™ can be used to promote adoption through training basic life skills, to provide dogs with mental and physical enrichment, and to reduce kennel stress and behavioral problems. C.L.A.S.S.™ can also provide a framework for a shelter volunteer program. The C.L.A.S.S.™ web site will feature dogs for adoption that have passed at least one level of the C.L.A.S.S.™ assessment, thereby giving adoptable dogs more visibility to

Rewards
By definition, rewards are essential to positive reinforcement training! The C.L.A.S.S.™ program encourages the use of rewards, within guidelines, during the C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluation.

Food Rewards
Food rewards, with correct usage, are a powerful tool in positive, reward-based training and relationship building. Dogs naturally love food, so food rewards can reinforce a behavior, making it more likely to occur again! Food rewards in positive training are given when the dog does a desired behavior, so that the dog will want to repeat the behavior in hopes of getting more food rewards. The dog does not have to see the treat first before doing the behavior; the dog gets the treat after doing the behavior. Here is how food rewards may be used during an Evaluation: • At the B.A. Level, treats may be given after each test item is completed, after each part of a two-part test item, and during pauses between test items. At the M.A. Level, treats may be given after all parts within each test item have been completed, and during pauses between test items. At the Ph.D. Level, treats may only be given before the evaluation starts and after the evaluation ends.

• •

Food treats may be given freely during the Warm-Up Time for all C.L.A.S.S.™ Levels. As per the Evaluation Guidelines, a test item is considered complete after all elements of the test have been performed. For stationary behaviors, (sit, down, and stand) which are in a variety of test items throughout each level, the dog must maintain the behavior for at least 2 to 3 seconds to be considered a complete behavior. For all C.L.A.S.S.™ Levels, food must be concealed in the student’s pocket. Food may not be carried by hand, in a treat pouch, or in the student’s mouth.

Life Rewards
Life rewards can be anything a particular dog finds pleasant and enjoyable. The list of life rewards depends on the dog’s individual personality, the relationship of the dog and student, as well as the context in which the reward is given.

Verbal Praise
Verbal praise is encouraged throughout the test. Students are encouraged to relate and connect verbally in a positive manner with their dogs during the evaluation just as in real-life.

Petting
We love our dogs and want to physically touch them. In a C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluation, students may pet their dogs during the Warm-Up Time and between test items, that is, after completing one test item and before starting another test item. However, since petting can possibly interrupt a dog’s performance or be construed as physical prompting, students may not pet their dog during other test items, except during items that require handling.

Toys/Games
There can be varying types of toys and games that are rewarding to dogs, such as tug, fetch, tennis balls, and flying discs, just to name a few. In a C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluation, students may use toys and games during the WarmUp Time and between test items, that is, after completing one test item and before starting another test item. Toys and games may not be used during other test items, as they could possibly be used to entice a dog to do a behavior or be distracting to the dog.

Equipment Allowed
For safety, compliance with leash laws, and expediency during a C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluation, a student must have their dog on a 6-foot, non-retractable leash. The leash must be held in the student’s hand, except when held by the Evaluator; the student should not drop the leash during stationary test items. The leash should be attached to a properly-fitted flat buckle or snap collar, limited slip (martingale) collar, or standard body harness. In the B.A. Level only, additional equipment allowed includes no-pull harnesses such as front clip harnesses, Easy Walk™ harnesses, and Sporn™ harnesses; these harnesses may only be used in the B.A. Level if the leash remains loose and if the handler can manage the dog in the same fashion as if using a buckle collar or harness. (No-pull harnesses are not acceptable for use in the M.A. and Ph.D. Levels.) All equipment should be in good repair. The student has the option to remove the leash for the following test items, ONLY if the test is performed in a secured area:

Optional Off-Leash Test Items if in Secured Area
(All B.A. Test Items must be performed on leash)
M.A. 4. Come and Leashing Up Manners (part A) M.A. 5. Sit, Down, and Stand M.A. 6. Handling M.A. 8. Stay Ph.D. 4. Come and Leashing Up Manners (part A) Ph.D. 5. Meet and Greet Ph.D. 6. Attention Ph.D. 7. Table Manners Ph.D. 8. Do You Really Know Sit?

What is Not Acceptable
To foster a positive focus, effective training, and pleasant atmosphere, certain activities and equipment are not allowed in a C.L.A.S.S.™ testing environment.

Quick Reference: C.L.A.S.S.™ Rules What is NOT Acceptable / Automatic Incompletes
 Luring or using food rewards when not allowed  Physical Prompting Student Activity  Physical Force  Harsh Corrections  Aggression Toward Dogs or People  Unpreparedness Student/Dog Activity Dog Behavior and Health  Unmanageable Behavior  Inappropriate Elimination  Excessive Stress  Illness  Physical Pain or Injury  Aggression Toward Dogs or People  Slip Lead  Martingale Lead  Head Halters Equipment  No-Pull Harness (M.A. and Ph.D. only)  Muzzle  Choke Chain  Prong Collar  Shock/Electronic Collar The occurrence of any of the following during a C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluation will mandate an Incomplete test score for the overall evaluation, with the exception of excessive stress, during which instance the C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluator may allow the dog extra time and patience to see if the dog will relax in a reasonable amount of time.

Luring or Using Food Rewards at the Incorrect Time
Luring is using food or other desirable object to entice a dog to do a particular behavior. Pretending to use food, tricking a dog into thinking you have food in your hand, or pretending to pull a treat out of your pocket is also considered luring. When a dog is lured into a position, the dog may have learned to follow a treat but not necessarily how to perform the behavior on cue. So luring may be a sign that the dog has not yet learned the desired behavior. A C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluation is intended to assess the skills a dog/student team has already acquired. Therefore, luring a dog is not allowed during a C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluation at any level, including during the bonuses. (Even though bonuses are not scored as Excellent, Needs Work, or Incomplete, the C.L.A.S.S.™ Rules of “What is Not Acceptable – Automatic Incompletes” still apply during bonuses as in any test item.) Food rewards given at the incorrect time will also be scored as an Automatic Incomplete. Though hand signals can be derived from the action of a lure, hand signals are not considered lures, and therefore are acceptable. The Evaluator will use discretion when assessing if a hand signal is intended to try to lure the dog.

Physical Prompting
Physical prompting is touching a dog as a cue to perform a behavior. Some examples include touching a dog’s rear as a cue to sit, blocking (with physical contact) the dog with the student’s body to keep the dog from moving forward, or touching a dog to get his attention. Physical prompting can create pressure or anxiety for dogs, even if no physical pressure is used. C.L.A.S.S.™ tests are for assessing responses to verbal and visual cues, so physical prompting is not allowed. An exception to this rule will be made for students with deaf dogs, where touch can be used for attention.

Physical Force
Students may not use physical force or a taut leash to control a dog’s movements. For example, pushing a dog into a sit or down and pulling a dog’s body with the leash is not allowed. This signifies more training is needed for the dog to choose to do the behavior voluntarily.

Harsh Corrections
The following corrections are not allowed in nor around the evaluation site.

Harsh Tones
Yelling at or intimidating a dog with voice tone is not allowed.

Harsh Startle Corrections
Students may not use startle or fear-based corrections such as squirt bottles or shake cans during a C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluation.

Physical Corrections
Students may not use physical corrections, including, but not limited to, rolling a dog on his back, grabbing, hitting, kicking, slapping, shaking, pinching, muzzle popping, or finger jabs.

Leash Corrections
Students may not use leash corrections (also known as leash jerks, leash checks, or leash pops).

Students Who Exhibit Aggression Toward Other People
A student should not be allowed to test, or be given an Incomplete if testing has already begun, if the Evaluator observes the student exhibiting aggressive or threatening behavior toward other people or dogs in and around the C.L.A.S.S.™ test area, including before and after the evaluation. Threatening or aggressive behavior may include, but is not limited to, shoving, yelling, using foul language, and being argumentative.

Unpreparedness
If the student does not have the required equipment for the evaluation, the student is not allowed to take the evaluation at that time. The required equipment is: o Permissible collar or harness o 6-foot non-retractable leash o Doggy clean-up supplies (waste bags, poop scooper, etc.) While it is preferable that students have their C.L.A.S.S.™ Student ID and Dog ID Numbers on or before the day of the evaluation, and that the dog has been registered for each level of evaluation that will be taken that day, students may also register their dogs for C.L.A.S.S.™ after an Evaluation. Evaluation scores may not be reported to the C.L.A.S.S.™ Office until the student has registered their dog at www.mydoghasclass.com for each evaluation level taken. For the B.A. Level Evaluation, it is also preferable that students have their signed Veterinarian Certificates to present to the Evaluator, since this certificate is part of the requirements for each team to complete the B.A. Level. If the student does not present the Veterinarian Certificate to the Evaluator at some point prior to the Evaluation, the student may still take the evaluation. However, when the Evaluator reports the team’s score, it will be noted that the Veterinarian Certificate requirement, and therefore the B.A. Level, is not yet complete. The student will then need to send the Veterinarian Certificate to the C.L.A.S.S.™ Office in order to get credit for meeting that requirement.

Unmanageable Behavior
In Canine Life And Social Skills™, an overall goal is to teach and encourage students to properly manage socalled “unruly” dog behaviors so that dogs are welcome in more social situations. Jumping up, barking, chewing, mouthing, peeing, pooping, digging, chasing, tugging—these are all normal dog behaviors. Although there could be different reasons why these behaviors may occur, dogs basically engage in these activities

because it is what they naturally know and it works for them. While dogs should be allowed to be dogs, we also need to teach our dogs the rules of living in a human world. Therefore, if, during a dog’s C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluation, the dog engages in unruly activity that cannot be managed by the student, such as excessively and repeatedly jumping up on a person, barking, or mouthing, the team shall receive an Incomplete score for the overall evaluation.

Inappropriate Elimination
Appropriate times and places for eliminating are important in Canine Life And Social Skills™. Urinating, including urine marking, or defecating during any part of a C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluation, except during the Warm-Up time, will result in an Incomplete for the overall evaluation. Students are encouraged to potty their dogs before the C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluation begins, in addition to learning to read their dogs’ physical signs of needing to go potty. An exception to the elimination rule will be made during the Warm-Up Time in each level, during which time dogs are allowed to eliminate in the designated potty area only. In the interest of fairness to all dogs, a designated potty area will be set up for all C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluations whether held indoors or out. For the indoors, the potty area is available just in case stress or nervousness create the need to eliminate. Moreover, the indoor potty area provides for dogs who are not yet housetrained (such as shelter dogs), as long as the student recognizes the signs and directs the dog to the designated potty area. For indoor testing locations, depending on the location, there may be both an indoor and outdoor potty area option, so that owners may choose to take their dogs outside to eliminate if necessary. For the outdoors, the designated potty area again is available in case of stress or nervousness, or if the dog did not potty before the evaluation. Also, by designating a specific potty area outdoors, the outdoors area allocated for the test does not become a potty area which would serve to stimulate more dogs to potty as well as distract dogs with enticing smells. This is realistic as even if dogs are trained not to potty in the house, they also need to be taught appropriate times and places to potty outside, and the student should know how to observe and redirect their dog to an acceptable place to potty if necessary.

Excessive Stress
Testing a dog who is experiencing extreme stress may not reveal information about how the dog will behave when he is relaxed. Responsible students should protect their dog from extremely distressing situations. The C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluator may allow the dog extra time and patience to see if the dog will relax in a reasonable amount of time.

The C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluation will not begin if a dog is exhibiting signs of excessive stress. If a dog becomes excessively stressed during an evaluation, the Evaluator should end the testing at that time. This dog may need more socialization and/or training before retaking the C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluation. Some signs of excessive stress include: shutting down, tail tucked between legs, trembling, whining, excessive barking, cowering, excessive chewing of the leash, pacing, excessive drooling, excessive panting, and trying to escape or hide. There are different intensities of these stress signs, and the Evaluator shall use their best judgment in deciding whether to begin, pause, or continue an evaluation or not if the dog is displaying these signs due to stress.

Illness
A team will not be allowed to go through a C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluation, or be given an Incomplete if already begun testing, if the dog demonstrates illness, such as vomiting, severe diarrhea, or fatigue.

Physical Pain or Injury
A team will not be allowed to test, or be given an Incomplete if already begun testing, if the dog: • • appears to be in pain or discomfort has stitches or bandages from a recent wound

Dogs Who Exhibit Aggression Toward Others
A dog will not be allowed to test, or be given an Incomplete if already begun testing, if the Evaluator observes the dog exhibiting aggressive or threatening behavior inappropriately toward people or dogs in and around the C.L.A.S.S.™ test area, including before and after the evaluation. Threatening or aggressive behavior may include, but is not limited to, snarling, growling, lunging, snapping, or biting toward a person or dog. If, in the Evaluator’s opinion, the dog threatens the safety of any people or dogs in the vicinity of the testing area, the Evaluator shall ask the student to remove the dog from the evaluation site.

Equipment Not Allowed
Equipment not allowed includes slip leads, retractable leashes, muzzles, and any type of clothing that covers the dog’s body (such as Thundershirts™ or Anxiety Wraps™.) This equipment may be helpful and practical for use in some settings; however, a C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluation should be performed without the use of these training aids.

No-pull harnesses, such as front clip harnesses, Easy Walk™ harnesses, and Sporn™ harnesses, are not acceptable in the M.A. and Ph.D. Levels; a dog may wear a no-pull harness in these levels, but ONLY if the leash is attached to the collar or in such a way so that the no-pull functionality is not activated. (No-pull harnesses are acceptable in the B.A. Level only if the leash remains loose and if the handler can manage the dog in the same fashion as if using a buckle collar or harness.) Head halters, such as the Halti™ and the Gentle Leader™, are not allowed at any C.L.A.S.S.™ Level. Equipment and techniques that try to modify behavior through fear, pain, or threats are not allowed in a C.L.A.S.S.™ setting nor are they generally recommended to prepare a dog for C.L.A.S.S, as fear and anxiety are not the basis for building a mutually rewarding relationship. The equipment not allowed includes choke chains, prong collars, and shock/electronic collars. (Vibration-only collars, however, are allowed for use with deaf dogs.)

How Do I Prepare for a C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluation?
The following describes the practical steps for preparing for a C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluation.

Quick Reference Preparing for a C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluation
1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. Take a C.L.A.S.S.™ training course (optional) Register for C.L.A.S.S.™ Complete the Veterinarian Certificate (B.A. only) Pass the Student Knowledge Assessment (B.A. only) Find a C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluator Be Familiar with C.L.A.S.S.™ Rules and Test Items

Training for a C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluation
A great way for students to prepare themselves and their dogs for the C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluation is to take a training course from a dog training instructor offering the C.L.A.S.S.™ curriculum. Find C.L.A.S.S.™ Instructors at www.mydoghasclass.com. Attending an organized class is highly recommended to prepare for the evaluation in a structured manner and to socialize you and your dog in the process. If there are no C.L.A.S.S.™ Instructors in your area, you may search for dog training instructors via the APDT Trainer Search at www.apdt.com/petowners/ts and contact them about a course to prepare for C.L.A.S.S.™ There are also resources available to help students train their dog at home. Remember that training is a team process—the dog and student must work together as a cohesive team for success in C.L.A.S.S.™

It is a good idea to do some practice run-throughs of an evaluation with the help of friends or trainers you have worked with. A complete list of the Evaluation Test Items is included in this handbook for your review and practice. Also, a sample Evaluation form for each level may be downloaded from the C.L.A.S.S.™ web site to use for your practice run-throughs. Since dogs do not generalize well, we recommend that students practice each test item with their dog in different places. Even if a dog can perform the necessary skills in his home, the dog may not be able to perform the skills in another location.

Register for C.L.A.S.S.™
The first step to take for students interested in a C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluation is to register their dog for C.L.A.S.S.™ There are three ways to register: online registration, paper registration form, or by phone. Online registration is the fastest and most efficient method. Students may register up to four dogs from the same household at one time, and may register each dog for one level (B.A., M.A., or Ph.D.) at a time. When the student registers a dog, the registration system automatically identifies which level(s) that dog has already been registered for, and will select the next level in the sequence (starting with the B.A., then the M.A., and finally Ph.D.) for which your dog is eligible to be registered. In this way, students cannot inadvertently register the same dog twice for the same level. Students may login to their Student account at any time to register additional dogs or to register for an additional level for their dog. While it is preferable that students have their C.L.A.S.S.™ Student ID and Dog ID Numbers on or before the day of the evaluation, and that the dog has been registered in advance of each level of evaluation taken, students may also register their dogs for C.L.A.S.S. after an Evaluation. Evaluation scores may not be reported to the C.L.A.S.S. Office until the student has registered their dog at www.mydoghasclass.com for each evaluation level taken. Registration fees are non-refundable.

Online Registration
With online registration, a student visits www.mydoghasclass.com to create a C.L.A.S.S.™ Student account and receive their Student ID. The first time a student registers a particular dog(s), the student will fill out a short registration form for each dog, and submit the registration fee electronically, at which point the dog(s) will be registered for the B.A. Evaluation. (See Registration Fees below.) The student will receive the C.L.A.S.S.™ Dog ID immediately for each dog registered. The Dog ID should be submitted to the C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluator on or before the day of a student/dog team’s evaluation.

If the student already has a C.L.A.S.S.™ account and wishes to register a dog for another level of C.L.A.S.S., they will log in and see a list of dogs registered to their account. The student will select the dog or dogs they wish to register for another level, and submit the registration fee electronically. Students may also register additional dogs and look up Dog ID numbers at any time by logging in to their C.L.A.S.S.™ account.

Registration by Mail, Email, or Fax
C.L.A.S.S.™ Student/Dog Team Registration Forms are available for download from www.mydoghasclass.com, by calling or emailing the C.L.A.S.S.™ Office at 800-PET-DOGS (800-738-3647) or class@apdt.com to request a form be mailed to you, or may be obtained from a C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluator or Instructor. The student will mail, fax, or scan/email the completed Student/Dog Team Registration Form with the appropriate registration fee as per the instructions on the form. Upon processing the form, the C.L.A.S.S.™ Office will email the student with the C.L.A.S.S.™ Student ID and Dog ID numbers for each dog registered. Please note that registration forms without a valid email address cannot be processed. The Dog ID number should be submitted to the C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluator on or before the day of a student/dog team’s evaluation. Students may look up their Student ID and Dog ID numbers at any time by logging in to their C.L.A.S.S.™ account. While registration may be done by mail or phone, the Student Knowledge Assessment, a requirement to qualify the student to begin earning C.L.A.S.S.™ certificates, must be done online.

Registration by Phone
To register by phone, a student should dial the C.L.A.S.S.™ Office at 800-PET-DOGS (800-738-3647) during regular business hours. Students should be prepared to pay the registration fee with a credit or debit card, and have a pen handy to write down their Student ID and Dog ID numbers. Students may look up their Student ID and Dog ID numbers at any time by logging in to their C.L.A.S.S.™ account.

Request for Test Modification
As stated in the eligibility for C.L.A.S.S.™ participants, any student or dog, whether well-bodied or disabled, is welcome to participate in a C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluation. In the event that a student’s or dog’s disabilities or health restricts the team from performing a test item as described, the student shall check the “Request for Test Modification” box during online C.L.A.S.S.™ registration, and provide the reason(s) for the request. All test items must be completed, though items may be modified to accommodate that student’s particular disability or health restriction. If necessary, exceptions in general are allowed for dogs or students with disabilities. For example, food lures and touching prompts may be allowed for blind dogs. The distance of the recalls may be shortened for some disabled dogs. For some test items, students and/or dogs may stand instead of sit, or sit instead of stand, depending on the particular health limitation.

Printed certificates may be ordered at any time from the C.L.A.S.S.™ web site after passing the C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluation (and after the scores have been received by the C.L.A.S.S.™ Office.)

Veterinarian Certificate (B.A. Level only)
Part of responsible dog ownership is providing your dog with regular veterinarian care. A signed Veterinarian Certificate is a requirement for every team to complete the B.A. Level requirements. This certificate affirms that the dog has been examined by a veterinarian within the last year, has been well-cared for, and is free of parasites. The form does not request proof of vaccinations, as the vaccinations appropriate for each dog will vary. Students may download the Veterinarian Certificate from the Resources tab of their online Student Account. This signed certificate can be presented to the C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluator on the day of the B.A. Evaluation (preferred) or mailed to the C.L.A.S.S.™ Office.

Pass the Student Knowledge Assessment (B.A. Level only)
As one of the purposes of C.L.A.S.S.™ is to encourage students to understand their dogs and dogs as a species, all students shall take an exam, the Student Knowledge Assessment, on topics related to dog care and handling. Passing the exam is a requirement to qualify the student to start earning C.L.A.S.S.™ certificates with the student’s dog(s). The test consists of 30 randomly-selected multiple choice questions, based on the information in the Study Guide below. Students must get at least 24 questions correct to pass. If students do not pass the Student Knowledge Assessment, students will be notified of what questions were missed and why. Students may retake the exam after 24 hours. Students may continue to retake the exam until they pass, though they may only take the exam once per 24 hour period. The student has the option to take the Student Knowledge Assessment multiple-choice test at any time by logging into their C.L.A.S.S.™ Student account. The Student Knowledge Assessment is only available in an Internet-based format. Students must retake the Student Knowledge Assessment every three years, in accord with the renewal process for their dogs’ C.L.A.S.S.™ certificates, which are valid for three years.

Study Guide for the Student Knowledge Assessment
The questions in the Student Knowledge Assessment exam are based on the following information, and we recommend that students use this information to prepare for the exam. This Study Guide is in a question and answer format covering basic dog information that every student should know, from Dog Training and Learning, to Communication and Body Language, to Dog Ownership.

Study Guide: Dog Ownership
Where can a student take a young puppy (8 – 12 weeks) who is current on all required vaccinations?
Socialization of young puppies ages 8 to 12 weeks is a very important part of having a well-rounded dog. At this age they should have received a minimum of their first series of vaccines for protection against infectious diseases, and all puppy classes should require this at the very least for admission. The risk of a dog dying from exposure to diseases should be weighed against the risk of a dog being relinquished to a shelter or euthanized because of behavioral issues that develop due to a lack of socialization. This period of puppy learning is a critical period to help influence good behavior of dogs. Places that you can take your puppy include your veterinary clinic, a puppy class that observes proper sanitization and vaccines protocols, and locations where your puppy can meet people and see new things without meeting strange dogs.

Why is picking up after my dog important?
Part of responsible dog ownership is being a good neighbor. Nobody enjoys the chore of picking up after their dogs in our own backyard. Imagine how your neighbors would feel if they had to pick up after dogs they do not even own! Picking up after or “curbing” your dog is a law in many places but perhaps more importantly you should be a good neighbor and good citizen no matter where you are with your dog; always carry waste bags with you.

Do dogs really need to be walked every day?
Dogs need exercise every day just like humans do. Taking a leash walk with your dog is not only great physical exercise for your dog, but it also provides great mental stimulation and helps with ongoing socialization to new places and scents. Taking leash walks with your dog can also contribute toward the two of you building a strong relationship as you walk and (work / explore) together.

What do I do if my dog is uncomfortable greeting another person?
It is common courtesy to have a person ask to pet your dog. As a responsible student you should always be proactive in protecting your dog from situations that may make them uncomfortable. This means that you might need to take the first step to help ensure that approaching people are respectful of your dog’s space. Simply ask them to wait before reaching for your dog. You need to determine when—or if—your dog is comfortable enough for petting from a stranger. There is no need to be embarrassed or to feel rushed. Remember that just as there are some people who are a bit more shy and stand-offish, so are there dogs who may need to take some extra time to get to know a stranger. Some dogs may never enjoy meeting strangers and may need extra time and socialization to get used to a new person before allowing themselves to be touched. Always move at your dog’s pace and comfort level.

How do I keep my dog safe if someone is trying to bring a dog over to greet and my dog is reactive?
Never rely on the actions of another person to keep your dog (and dogs around you) safe. As a responsible dog student you need do whatever it takes to immediately create distance between your dog and the other dog. Do not feel uncomfortable informing the other dog owner to please keep their dog away from yours and explain that your dog does not care for other dogs. If you have not already done so, consider consulting an expert in canine behavior modification to address your dog's reactive issues, too. Visit the APDT Trainer Search at www.apdt.com/petowners/ts to find a trainer near you who can be of assistance.

Why is crate training beneficial?
Having a doggie safe area such as a crate will provide your dog with his own personal space and is essential to many aspects of your training. Your dog’s crate will be used during times when you cannot supervise him or when you just need a break. Dogs are den animals so when they are properly introduced to the crate they usually love them. Crate training can keep your dog out of trouble when you are away from home too. You will not have to worry about him chewing on your furniture, shoes or other valuable items and you will not need to worry about him having an accident in your home. Crates can also be a safe place when traveling. Your dog’s crate can be a safe and fun place to be!

What is the best way to pick out treats or food for my dog?
There is such a variance of products available on the market. Marketing and advertising are very alluring to humans, but that does not mean the ingredients are as good as the package may look. As a responsible pet student you will want to be aware that some ingredients may not be good for your dog. It is important to educate yourself as to what it takes to maintain good health for your pet for a long and healthy life. Talk to your veterinarian about your dog’s nutritional needs and about what ingredients you should look for, and which you should avoid, when selecting a brand of food for your dog.

Do I really need to trim my dog’s nails if my dog does not like it?
Proper nail trims ensure that your dog maintains a healthy, natural gait. There is no need for this to be a stressful event for your dog! By hiring a positive reinforcement-based dog trainer, you can learn humane, lowstress methods that will help your dog to accept nail trims, regardless of whether they are done by a veterinarian, a groomer, or you.

If my dog does not like the leash, is it okay for me to just let him run loose?
Responsible dog ownership includes keeping your dog safe from environmental hazards; many city and state laws also require dogs to be on-leash when in public. Even if you live in a rural area where environmental hazards are minimal or city and state laws do not apply, it is wise to prepare your dog to happily accept a leash. This can be quickly achieved with reward-based, positive reinforcement training.

Why should a student check their dog’s entire body every month?
There are many health issues that may go unnoticed if not checked for regularly. Dogs are also masters at hiding their discomfort or pain. Going over your dog ‘s entire body closely once a month, including looking at his teeth and gums, can potentially help you identify a health issue early in its development which may save you from a large veterinary bill later. Noticing the small things early on in many instances may even save your dog’s life.

How is a dog’s sense of smell and hearing different from a human’s?
Dogs observe the world much differently than humans. We rely mostly on our sense of sight, followed by our sense of hearing. Dogs, on the other hand, have a much keener sense of smell than humans. Therefore, they gather much more information about their surroundings by sniffing. They also have a much greater sense of hearing than humans and can hear sounds from up to a mile away or deep in the ground. Dogs can hear a mole traveling underground and can smell a minute amount of explosives / drugs hidden in an entire warehouse.

Do all dogs of the same breed act the same? Are some breeds of dog inherently vicious and aggressive?
Each breed of dog has their own unique personality, individual quirks and some are genetically predisposed to certain behaviors such as retrieving or tracking. Within any breed, there will be a range of calm to high energy dogs. Contrary to popular opinion there are no inherently “bad” breeds, but there are irresponsible owners that allow antisocial behavior to develop whether due to indifference or actually teaching or allowing the dog to behave in an antisocial manner.

Study Guide: Communication and Body Language
Why do dogs bark and how should I talk to my dog when he is barking?
Barking is as natural to a dog as eating, sleeping, and scratching. There are many different reasons why dogs bark. They bark to alert, out of frustration, because they are frightened, bored or even out of excitement during play. Many people do not realize that they may actually be contributing the barking by yelling or scolding their dog. Your dog may think you are joining in and will take the attention as a sign that you agree with his actions. Barking can be very frustrating to a person. If your dog is barking, it is important to first get his attention to interrupt the behavior. Using a cheerful, happy tone will help to get your dog focused on you rather than what he is barking at. When your dog responds to your cheerful voice, reward him with a high value treat for being quiet. The next step would be to redirect your dog’s attention to an appropriate, quiet behavior, such as fetch, chewing on a bone, or playing with a toy.

Why does my dog turn away when I hug him?
Although humans love hugs, it does not necessarily mean that a dog will be comfortable with one. Dogs do not hug each other; in fact, dogs are very respectful of each other’s space. There are many other ways to show affection to your pet. If your dog turns away when you hug him, your dog is politely letting you know he does not want or enjoy the hug. Hugging can be stressful for dogs to accept as he may feel trapped by the embrace. If you must, keep it short and sweet.

What is the best way to let my dog approach and greet another dog?
In terms of canine social behavior, appropriate greetings are nose-to-tail. Nose-to-nose greetings in the dog world are not only impolite, but they increase the risk of your dog being bitten by a dog who may not love other dogs.

What are the best ways to communicate with my dog and why is understanding dog body language important?
Many people feel their dogs understand every word they are saying and then are frustrated when their dog does not respond to something they are asking them to do. While dogs can learn to associate many words with items or actions, they fall far short of understanding everything people are saying. They are, however, quite good at understanding your tone of voice. For instance, a happy, high pitched, cheery voice indicates that you are pleased or that you want to play. Your tone of voice is important in order to begin good communication with your dog, and to let him know what you expect from him and when. Dogs are also very good at communicating through body language. Once you start to understand your dog’s body language you can start to communicate with your best friend in a way they can understand. The signs dogs use to communicate with each other include facial expressions, body postures and movements. Dogs specifically use their faces, ears, tails and eyes to communicate. Students need to learn how they use different body movements to communicate as they are often misinterpreted. For example, we commonly think a wagging tail means a dog is friendly, but depending on the speed of the wag and the stiffness and posture of the body, it can also mean that a dog is potentially in a defensive or offensive aggressive mode.

What are calming signals and why does my dog use them?
Dogs do not have the ability to use verbal language like humans. They rely on body language to communicate with each other and other species. One aspect of their body language is called calming signals. They use these signals to share their intentions with other dogs and with us. For instance dogs use their tail as a way to communicate their feelings. Just because the tail is wagging does not necessarily mean the dog is happy. Depending on how he is carrying his tail as well as other body language will tell you whether the dog is in the mood to play, nervous or in the mood to fight. When a dog wants to show another dog that he means no harm, he will turn his head and sometimes entire body away from the imposing dog. Dogs may also scratch, yawn or lick their lips as a way to signal they are feeling too much pressure. With humans, dogs will display these same behaviors in an attempt to communicate they are uncomfortable in their current situation. We should “listen” to these behaviors and give our dogs a break from the situation at hand. Just like people, dogs cannot work effectively if they are under too much pressure. Of course, dogs also scratch when they have an itch, and yawn when they are tired or bored, so the signals must be read in context.

How should someone greet a dog?
When greeting a dog try to use slow, casual body movements. You should not be closer than two feet from the dog. If the dog does not approach you, turn your body slightly sideways to the dog, which is a nonthreatening posture, rather than squaring off / directly facing the dog. Always allow the dog to take the first steps to approach you and wait before you reach out to pet the dog. Once the dog feels comfortable enough to approach you, the first physical interaction you should have is to pet the dog under the chin, or along his side rather than reaching over the dog’s head. If the dog does not want to approach you, simply respect the dog’s choice and walk away politely.

How do dogs tell each other that they want to play?
Since dog-dog play can sometimes be confused by people as fighting, it is important to understand their body language so no harm may come to either of them. Dog play is often initiated by a play bow which is tells the other dog that he is doing this for fun. Dogs will often bark and growl a bit while playing. Typically they use a higher-pitched bark than a warning bark. Dogs will also take frequent quick breaks or pauses lasting just a couple of seconds during play. You will also likely see a lot of give and take during play. The dogs will essentially take turns with one dog leading and then the other. It is important to supervise the play sessions in case one dog has had enough, you can intervene if the other dog persists. For instance if one dog is consistently hiding underneath a chair or crying to get away it may be necessary for you to step in to protect the dog who does not want to play anymore.

Study Guide: Training and Learning
What kind of rewards can be used in positive reinforcement training?
There are many types of rewards that will provide the necessary praise and positive reinforcement for your dog. Dogs have varied temperaments and interests. Not all dogs are food motivated in every context or environment. Other types of rewards can include a favorite toy, a game of chase or tug, petting, verbal praise and even teaching the dog a special trick he enjoys making the training fun.

What is clicker training?
Clicker training is a type of positive reinforcement training that is a simple and very effective. The handler uses a clicker, which is typically a small plastic box with a metal strip inside of it that makes a clicking sound when pressed. The clicker is pressed to mark the desired behavior, indicating to the dog that he did the right behavior and that a reward is on its way!

Can my dog be trained positively if he does not like food as a reward?
A reward is quite simply anything that your dog finds intrinsically rewarding. Some examples of rewards include toys, access to the outdoors, a car ride, or attention/affection from people. Food is often used because many dogs are motivated by it and food is also quick and easy to deliver to your dog. However; if your dog just ate his dinner, using a food reward may not be your best option. The key is to know what is rewarding to your dog in that moment! Make a list of 20 things that are rewarding to your dog including food, toys, treats and other life rewards such as belly rubs or playing with another dog!

What is positive reinforcement and why should I use it?
The most effective way of teaching a new behavior is using positive reinforcement. Using positive reinforcement provides a win-win situation for you and your dog. The dog learns that doing what you want gets them what he wants – i.e., food, toys, affection. There are various ways to positively reinforce behavior. You can “lure” your dog into the desired behavior and then reward. You can wait for your dog to offer the desired behavior and then reward. You can use a marker signal, such as a clicker, to “mark” when a dog does something you want and then reward. Whatever behaviors you reward (or positively reinforce) are the behaviors that you will see increase.

How important is consistency in training?
Consistency is one of the most important aspects of training your dog. For instance, you do not want your dog on the couch. When you are home, you are able enforce that rule. While you are not home, other people in the house may tell your dog it is ok to be on the couch. This can lead to obvious confusion for your dog. This also applies to many other behaviors such as barking, pulling on the leash, chewing, jumping, etc. Consistency simply means that everyone uses the same rules for the dog all of the time for clear training results.

If my dog is not able to execute a behavior he has been trained to do reliably, what should I do?
Ideally a dog should respond to a cue asked of him on the first time. If your dog does not respond to your cue within a few seconds of you asking him one of a few things is likely occurring – either he does not know the behavior as well as you may have originally thought, he may not be motivated enough to execute the behaviors or there is something in the environment that is distracting him from executing the behavior successfully. There is also a possibility that there may be some underlying medical condition that is preventing him from completing the behavior. If the problem persists you should consider checking with your veterinarian to rule out any medical issues. Do keep in mind that dogs are not robots and may become distracted or become unmotivated at some point. Keep consistent in your training and remember that occasionally rewarding your dog from time to time will be the best way to keep him motivated for a reliable response.

How do you reward a dog when teaching him a behavior that has multiple steps?
An example of a behavior with multiple steps is fetch. The steps might be chasing after the ball, picking up the ball, and bringing the ball back to you. The trainer would teach each behavior step by step and reward each successful step. Eventually the student can gradually ask for more of the sequence of steps for the dog to achieve the reward. The steps might look something like this: Dog chases after the ball and gets a reward. Dog picks up the ball and gets a reward. Dog brings the ball back and gets a reward. Then, the dog chases the ball and picks the ball up which gets him a reward. Finally, the dog chases the ball, picks up the ball and brings the ball back (the complete behavior) to get the reward.

What should I do if my dog is barking in his crate?
You should first figure out why your dog is barking. There may be a number of reasons why he is barking in his crate including he is trying to get your attention, because he is stressed about his crate or perhaps because he needs to go to the bathroom? The most common answer is that he is barking because he wants your attention. There is a simple solution—ignore your dog. Do not look at him, do not say anything to him, you might even walk away. Once he stops barking wait a few seconds and then give him some attention which will be a reward for being quiet. By ignoring him your dog will quickly learn that being quiet, not barking, is the way to get your attention. If you think your dog needs to go to the bathroom, the answer is obvious. Let your dog out! If you think your dog is barking because he is stressed, speak with your trainer about ways to help him become better acquainted with his crate or what alternatives you can explore for containing your dog.

My dog does not understanding training. Is he just being stubborn or dominant?
Training your dog can sometimes require patience. Dogs learn quickly what works and what does not work. Dogs are often called stubborn or dominant when they seem to ignore our requests. What they are truly displaying is confusion or a lack of not understanding what you’re asking them to do. Perhaps your dog has not generalized the behavior to that situation, or your dog is stressed, distracted or perhaps your dog has not made the connection between your cue and the behavior you are seeking yet.

Do dogs automatically learn to generalize new behaviors they have learned to every person and every situation?
Generalizing new behaviors is something dogs do not do well. You have to send a consistent message to your dog in all circumstances and keep it simple for your dog to avoid confusion. This means that everybody who comes into contact with your dog has to send the same message. For instance to teach your dog not to jump, you ask for and reward a behavior that you want instead, such as sit. To help him generalize the behavior you would ask him to sit when greeting you, family and friends. You would also need to ask him to sit in a variety of places and situations i.e. at the front door, while out for a walk, etc.

What do I do if my puppy is jumping up and scratching me and leaving welts on my arms and legs?
Teaching a puppy how to respect a human’s space is an important life lesson. Lest the puppy think we do not ever want them to come into our space to relate, this life lesson must be taught in a positive fashion. It is helpful to redirect your puppy’s attention to an alternative behavior that he can do instead of using you as a scratching post. Rewarding an alternative behavior such as “sit” instead of jumping all over you is one way to train the puppy to get his paws “off” of you. If the jumping, scratching and space invading is attention-driven, then a student must think about whether or not the puppy is getting meaningful, appropriate attention and exercise throughout the day. It is also important to make sure that your puppy’s nails are well trimmed at all times.

What should I do if my puppy is biting my hands every time we play?
Puppy biting is a natural behavior for puppies. They explore their environment with their mouths. There are a few things you can do to minimize or eliminate puppy biting. During playtime make sure you are playing with a toy and not with your hands. A larger toy is better than a smaller toy and will help teach your dog to use his mouth appropriately during play. If your puppy’s mouth comes into contact with your skin at any time the best reaction you can have is to say “ouch” and remove all of your attention for a few moments – just walk away, turn your back and ignore him. It will not take long before he learns what level of play is and is not acceptable. Consistency will be very important for your success. That means everyone needs to play the same way. Playing rough with your puppy, even if it’s just with one person, will teach him that it’s ok to play that way. It’s also very important to make sure that your puppy is getting enough exercise. Try games like hide and seek with his favorite toy, set up a treat hunt, take him for a short jog in the park or give him a dog puzzle or brain game to wear him out mentally when you cannot wear him out physically.

What does “capturing” a behavior mean?
Capturing a behavior can be one of the fastest ways to train a new behavior. For example if you want to teach your dog to lay down using the capture method you would simply wait for your dog to decide lie down and then reward him the moment he does the behavior. Timing is crucial for capturing a behavior. Think of it as a camera – you want to take a picture of the exact moment your dog does the behavior. You are not asking, commanding or luring him into the action. You are waiting for your dog to offer the behavior on his own. Capturing works best for teaching a behavior that your dog does naturally, such as sit, lying down, barking on cue, sniffing, or holding objects. The primary difference between capturing and other positive reinforcement training techniques is that the dog is making the decision to offer the behavior without being asked or prompted.

Find a C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluator
After registering online, the students will receive a link to the APDT Trainer Search and the Calendar of Evaluations. If a student has not yet located or worked with a C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluator, the next step is for the student to find a C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluator in their area to schedule the live evaluation. Students may locate a C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluator via the APDT Trainer Search at www.apdt.com/petowners/ts. The Calendar of Evaluations is available online any time at www.mydoghasclass.com.

Schedule a C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluation
The student is responsible for contacting a C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluator to schedule the evaluation(s). A C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluator directly oversees all aspects of a C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluation, including scheduling the day of the evaluation.

Be Familiar with C.L.A.S.S.™ Rules and Test Items
The C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluation is designed to assess both the dog and student as a team. Before an evaluation, students should be familiar with the C.L.A.S.S.™ Rules, including what is acceptable and what is not acceptable, as listed in this handbook.

Scoring Guidelines
Students should be aware of the criteria for each test item by studying the Scoring Guidelines, which are specific for each test item, and Test Item Descriptions listed in the “Evaluation Test Items” section. The C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluators may remind students of the expected criteria before each test item during the live evaluation, though it is still the responsibility of the student to understand what is required in each test item.

Scoring Categories
In general, there are three possible scoring categories for each test item: Excellent, Needs Work, and Incomplete. A fourth possible scoring category is an Automatic Incomplete, which is given if the student or dog performs any behavior on the “What is Not Allowed / Automatic Incompletes” section of the C.L.A.S.S.™ Rules; this section describes unacceptable student and dog behavior. If an Evaluator observes an unacceptable behavior at any time during a C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluation, the team should automatically receive an Incomplete score.

Bonuses
There are two Bonus items in each C.L.A.S.S.™ Level. These extra items are intended to make the C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluation more fun and enriching. Some Bonuses aim to showcase tricks that serve a practical purpose. Other Bonuses, such as the “Trick of Student’s Choice” in the B.A. and M.A. levels, give the student the chance to proudly feature their dog’s favorite trick. The Bonus items are completely optional. There is only one scoring guideline for Bonus items—“With Honors.” If the team does not perform the criteria in the “With Honors” scoring category, the team receives no score for that Bonus item. There are no Needs Work or Incomplete scoring guidelines for Bonuses, so that attempting the Bonuses will not affect whether the team passes or not. The Bonus only determines whether or not the team passes “with Honors.” If a passing team scores “With Honors” on both Bonus items in an evaluation, the team passes “with Honors.” The C.L.A.S.S.™ Rules of “What is Not Acceptable – Automatic Incompletes” still apply in Bonuses, so luring, physical prompting, etc. are not allowed.

Cueing and Repeat Cueing
One goal of C.L.A.S.S.™ and positive reinforcement training is reliability of responses, that is, the dog responds to each cue within one to three seconds. If a cue does not result in a reliable response, then the student/dog team needs more work on that particular cue. In the B.A., for most test items, one to two cues are allowed for an Excellent Score, while in the M.A. and Ph.D., dogs must respond to one cue for an Excellent Score. Refer to the Scoring Guidelines in the “Evaluation Test Items” section for exact criteria, including the number of cues allowed for each test item. Cues are words or gestures that prompt a dog to perform a behavior. Repeat cueing is when the student repeats the same cue multiple times (e.g. ‘sit,’ ‘sit,’ ‘sit,’ ‘sit’), often when the dog is not responding. Another form of repeat cueing is a steady visual signal that lasts more than 5 seconds (e.g. a hand held up continuously for a stay cue.) If the dog does not respond with one cue, either the dog has not been taught the behavior reliably, has not been rewarded generously enough to create a habit, or is distracted by something else. Repeating the cue word, like nagging, can also be an undesirable habit of the student. Cues can be verbal (e.g. a spoken word or sound) or visual (e.g. a hand signal, body movement, or body blocking without physical contact). If both the verbal and visual cue are given simultaneously, they are

considered a single cue for C.L.A.S.S.™ scoring purposes. Since cues will vary with each Student, Evaluators shall use discretion as always when assessing cues used. Praise is not considered a cue. Praise is verbal approval given to the dog, and students are encouraged to generously praise their dogs throughout the C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluation. Sometimes the same word used for the cue is used during the praise. For example, after cueing “Come,” a student might praise his dog by saying “Good Boy, Come On, Atta Boy!” etc. The Evaluator shall use discretion in scoring whether a student’s body movements or words are used as cues or as praise, as this can vary among different students, dogs, and situations.

On the day of the C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluation, the student is required to present the following items for the C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluator during the check-in process: o Permissible collar or harness o 6-foot non-retractable leash o Doggy clean-up supplies (waste bags, poop scooper, etc.) The C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluator will not begin the Evaluation if any of these items are unavailable or incomplete. While it is preferable that students have their C.L.A.S.S.™ Student ID and Dog ID Numbers on or before the day of the evaluation, students may also register their dogs for C.L.A.S.S. after an Evaluation. Evaluation scores may not be reported to the C.L.A.S.S. Office until the student has registered their dog at www.mydoghasclass.com for each evaluation level taken.

For the B.A. Level Evaluation, it is also preferable that students have their signed Veterinarian Certificates to present to the Evaluator, since this certificate is part of the requirements for each team to complete the B.A. Level. If the student does not present the Veterinarian Certificate to the Evaluator at some point prior to the Evaluation, the student may still take the evaluation. However, when the Evaluator reports the team’s score, it will be noted that the Veterinarian Certificate requirement, and therefore the B.A. Level, is not yet complete. The student will then need to send the Veterinarian Certificate to the Evaluator or the C.L.A.S.S.™ Office in order to get credit for meeting that requirement.

Junior Handlers
In additional to the required items above, Junior Handlers are required to have:  “Waiver of Liability” form signed by the parent or adult mentor  Parent or adult mentor present during the evaluation

Required and Recommended Supplies Checklist
Here is a checklist of the required and recommended supplies necessary on the day of the C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluation. It is a good idea to prepare these items the day before the test to have everything in one place on the evaluation day.  C.L.A.S.S.™ Student ID and Dog ID Numbers  Signed Veterinarian Certificate (B.A. Level only)  Permissible collar or harness  6-foot leash  Doggy clean-up supplies (waste bags, poop scooper, etc.)  C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluator contact information  Address and directions to evaluation site  Water and water bowl  Training treats  Mat or bed for your dog’s comfort  Toy, chew, and/or stuffed Kong for B.A. Settle and B.A. Give and Take tests  Optional: Crate for B.A. Settle test  Evaluation fee, if applicable  [Junior Handlers only] “Waiver of Liability” form signed by the parent or adult mentor  [Junior Handlers only] Parent or adult mentor present during evaluation

Tips for Success on Evaluation Day
Here are some tips to keep in mind to help make C.L.A.S.S.™ the positive experience it is intended to be:

Potty your dog prior to the evaluation
Even though allowances are made for dogs to potty during the Warm-Up Time, giving your dog ample time to potty beforehand will help everyone feel more comfortable.

Arrive promptly
Allow time so that you and your dog have time to acclimate to the evaluation site without rushing around.

Be prepared
Use the “Required and Recommended Supplies” checklist above so that you arrive prepared.

Maintain a positive attitude
Focus on and appreciate all the good things in your life, and you will reflect the same in others. Leave troubles, grudges, and insults in the past.

Relax with your dog
Worrying about the test will not help and may cause distress in your dog. Breathe and let go of your tensions.

Actively listen
Turn your attentions off of yourself and focus on others. Listening is not only courteous but if we open our ears, we can learn a lot in the process.

Check-In Process
For the check-in process, the Evaluator will request the Student and Dog ID Numbers (if available) for the Evaluation Form. If these ID numbers are unknown or not yet registered, the student will need to provide this information to the Evaluator before the evaluation scores may be reported to the C.L.A.S.S. Office. Next the Evaluator will check that the student has the following items: 1. For a B.A. Level evaluation, the Veterinarian Certificate will be requested (if available, the Evaluator shall keep this certificate with the student’s evaluation; if not available, the student shall be reminded to send the completed certificate to the C.L.A.S.S.™ Office to fulfill this requirement) 2. Required Equipment: o Permissible collar or harness o 6-foot non-retractable leash o Doggy clean-up supplies (waste bags, poop scooper, etc.)

p. 37 of 62

If the handler is a Junior Handler, the “Waiver of Liability” form must be signed by the parent or adult mentor and collected by the Evaluator.

Evaluation Fees
Contact the Evaluator to find out if the Evaluator requires an evaluation fee for each evaluation. Evaluation fees are at the discretion of the C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluator, and help offset the Evaluator’s time, expertise, and other resources used during the evaluation. (Evaluation fees are separate from Dog registration fees, which are paid directly to the APDT to register their dog for each C.L.A.S.S.™ level.) Evaluation fees will be collected by the Evaluator before the evaluation begins, and are non-refundable.

Evaluation Guidelines
Each level is conducted in the order enumerated below for consistency. Exercises are placed in an order that seem to flow best for the student and dog. For each test item, there are “Notes” for the student, which give additional details and tips related to the test description. An Evaluation is considered complete after all test items, and the bonuses if opted, have been performed. A test item is considered complete after all elements of the test have been performed. For stationary behaviors, (sit, down, and stand) which are in a variety of test items throughout each level, the dog must maintain the behavior for at least 2 to 3 seconds to be considered a complete behavior. Otherwise, the behavior is not considered complete as performed. For safety and compliance with leash laws, the dog must be on-leash for C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluations, starting from the time the dog arrives at the testing location. During the test, the student will initiate any attaching and detaching of the leash. The student may use a mat for the dog’s comfort during any part of the evaluation.

Score Results
After completing the evaluation, the Evaluator will tally the score immediately and let the student know the results. The score is computed by adding up the marks for the Needs Work, Incomplete, and Automatic Incomplete scoring categories. (If there are 2 or more Needs Work marks for a single skill in a test item, count that as only one mark for scoring purposes. For example, in the B.A. Stay, if a student gave 3 cues and also reset the dog 1 time, that counts as 1 Needs Work for the Stay test item. Test items with 2 skills parts, such as Loose Leash Walking and Attention, are scored separately, so it is possible that a team could get up to 2 Needs Work counts in one test item if the test has 2 skill parts.)

If a team receives a non-passing score either due to more than one Needs Work, or any Incomplete or Automatic Incomplete marks, the Evaluator will review the evaluation with the student, so the student knows what the team needs to work on. The team is still to be congratulated on test items scored as Excellent. The original Evaluation Form is kept by the Evaluator.

Additional Evaluations
A student may be evaluated in multiple levels (e.g. B.A., M.A., and Ph.D.) in a single day without having to wait until the scores are reported to the C.L.A.S.S.™ Office, if the following is true:

p. 50 of 62

the same Evaluator may be used for each level if a different Evaluator is used, the Evaluators should communicate with each other whether or not the student received a passing score on the previous evaluation

If the student has not yet registered the dog with the C.L.A.S.S.™ Office for the additional level he wishes to take, he may still take the evaluation; however, his evaluation score may not be reported to the C.L.A.S.S. Office until he registers his dog for that level at www.mydoghasclass.com. Students may only register their dogs for one level at a time, so if a student takes more than one level in a single day, the student will have to register for the additional level either before or after that evaluation. A score for a particular evaluation level cannot be reported by the Evaluator until the student has registered their dog for that specific level. Registration may be done online at any time via a smart phone or other computer. Registrations may also be done by paper registration or phone.

Repeat Evaluation
Everyone has times when, for some reason, their performance is not the best it can be. If a team does not pass the C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluation and would like to try again, they will be eligible to retake the evaluation after at least one week. The team must perform the entire evaluation during a repeat evaluation. As for all C.L.A.S.S.™ evaluations, the student is responsible for contacting a C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluator to schedule the evaluation. There is no limit to the number of times a student can schedule a repeat evaluation, although an evaluation cannot be repeated more than once per week.

After the Evaluation
Viewing Scores
Official Score Results from evaluations are posted online. To access their scores, the student will log in with their Student ID and password at www.mydoghasclass.com, select their dog, and view or print their scores. Students should allow 7 to 10 days after an evaluation for the scores to be posted. The Evaluator must report the results of all Evaluations to the C.L.A.S.S.™ Office within 7 days of any C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluation, either by entering the scores online or mailing a copy of the Evaluation Form to the C.L.A.S.S.™ Office.

Certificates
All passing teams will automatically receive an award certificate via email from the C.L.A.S.S.™ Office when their scores have been posted. (One exception is that a certificate will not be sent for the B.A. Level until all the requirements, which include the Student Knowledge Assessment, the evaluation, and the Veterinarian Certificate, have been completed.) This certificate may be printed at any time, and may also be accessed from the student’s C.L.A.S.S.™ account. If a student would like to order a printed certificate, they may do so at any time from the student’s C.L.A.S.S.™ account.

Additional B.A. Level Requirements
If a team passes their first evaluation (the B.A.) but the student has not yet passed the online Student Knowledge Assessment and/or not yet submitted a completed Veterinarian Certificate, the B.A. level will not be considered complete until these items are completed.

Other Congratulatory Items
All passing teams are entitled to: 1. Upload a photo of their dog onto the Gallery of Graduates, a page dedicated to all the dogs who have earned a C.L.A.S.S.™ certificate. 2. Download an icon for Facebook and other social media announcing their dog’s C.L.A.S.S.™ graduate status. 3. Order special items, such as t-shirts, bandannas, and ID tags, announcing that their dog has C.L.A.S.S.™!

Additional Opportunities for Student/Dog Teams
Once a team earns their B.A. in C.L.A.S.S.™, they are eligible to be evaluated at the M.A. level. After earning their M.A., they may enter the Ph.D. level. No matter what C.L.A.S.S.™ level the team is in, there are always activities for further training and relationship building. See the C.L.A.S.S.™ web site resources for more ideas at www.mydoghasclass.com.

Maintaining Graduate Status
Because behavior can change over time and must be maintained through regular training, C.L.A.S.S.™ graduates are required to renew their graduate status every 3 years. For this reason, certificates and Student Knowledge Assessment scores are valid for 3 years after the evaluation date. Students may renew their graduate status by: 1. Renewing their Dog ID Number online at www.mydoghasclass.com by submitting a $5.00 renewal fee for each dog. 2. Passing the evaluation at the highest level already earned by their dog. 3. Passing the online Student Knowledge Assessment.

Appendix
Real-Life Relevance of Test Items
C.L.A.S.S.™ is intended to encourage the teaching of real-life skills to dogs, so that dogs have healthy “Canine Life” and “Social Skills.” Therefore, the test items in each evaluation level purposely reflect every day and important uses. The following is a list of each test item with common real-life correlations and examples.

C.L.A.S.S.™ Student FAQ’s How do I find my Dog ID Number?
You may look up your dog’s Dog ID Number at any time by logging in to www.mydoghasclass.com with your Student ID Number and password.

Do I have to begin with the B.A. Level Evaluation?
Yes, all student/dog teams begin in the B.A. Level. While the higher levels build on some of the skills in the B.A., there are different skills tested in each level. After passing the B.A. Level, teams are eligible to be evaluated at the M.A. level. After earning their M.A., they may enter the Ph.D. level. If a student takes a higher level evaluation without passing the previous level, their score for the higher level will be invalid. For example, if you enter the M.A. before passing the B.A., you will have to re-take the M.A. after you pass the B.A. Level.

Do I need a Veterinary Certificate for the M.A. and Ph.D. Levels?
No, the Veterinary Certificate is only required for the B.A. Level.

What do the letters B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. stand for?
C.L.A.S.S.™ levels are named after human university degree programs. B.A. signifies the first level of C.L.A.S.S.™, the “Bachelor’s” degree. M.A. signifies the second level of C.L.A.S.S.™, the “Master’s” degree. Ph.D. signifies the third level of C.L.A.S.S.™, the “Doctorate” degree.

How do I find out the details of when and where my evaluation is?
Any questions regarding the details specific to the student’s scheduled C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluation should be submitted directly to the Evaluator who arranged the test.

Do I need to register my dog for each level in which I would like to be evaluated?
Yes, a dog must be registered separately for the B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. Though you may only register at www.mydoghasclass.com for one level at a time, you are allowed to take more than one level of an evaluation in a single day if you pass the previous level.

C.L.A.S.S.™ Student Handbook

p. 57 of 62

Do I need to register my dog again to retake the Evaluation?
No. Students only register their dog one time for a particular level, except when renewing their certificate. If a team gets a non-passing score and would like to retake an Evaluation, the student only needs to contact the Evaluator to reschedule an evaluation. They will use same Dog ID assigned when first registered for that level.

Do Award Certificates expire?
Certificates are valid for 3 years.

How do I renew my certificate?
To renew a certificate that has expired, there are three steps: 1) renew your dog’s registration for the highest level of C.L.A.S.S. certificate your dog has earned, 2) pass the C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluation, and 3) pass the online Student Knowledge Assessment.

When my certificate expires, do I need to renew all levels that my dog has earned?
Students only need to renew the highest certificate earned. For example, if a dog has earned his Ph.D., after 3 years, he only needs to take the Ph.D. level to renew.

What do I do if my score posted online is different than the score I received on the day of the evaluation?
In the event of any discrepancies in the online scores, please contact the C.L.A.S.S.™ Office. (See “Contact Us” for contact information.)

I would like to express my opinion about my C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluation experience.
Any student may submit comments and concerns about their C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluation experience or an Evaluator by contacting the C.L.A.S.S.™ Office via email or mail. (See “Contact Us” for contact information.) All comments and concerns received will be reviewed by the C.L.A.S.S.™ Office and explored accordingly.

How do I find C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluation locations and date?
Check the Calendar of Evaluations at www.mydoghasclass.com for upcoming CLASS Evaluation dates and locations, or contact a C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluator (via the APDT Trainer Search at www.apdt.com/petowners/ts) to schedule an evaluation.

How often are C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluations given?
This depends on how often Evaluators are offering the evaluations. Contact a C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluator (via the APDT Trainer Search at www.apdt.com/petowners/ts) to schedule an evaluation.

Can I be evaluated on more than one level in a single day?
Yes, you may be evaluated in the next level as soon as you pass the previous level. For example, after you pass your B.A. Evaluation, you may enter the M.A. Evaluation without having to wait for the Evaluator to report your scores from the B.A. Evaluation to the C.L.A.S.S.™ Office if: 1) the Evaluator is available to evaluate you at the M.A. Level 2) the Evaluator also evaluated you at the B.A. Level or was informed by the B.A. Evaluator that you passed the B.A. Level. Before the evaluation scores can be entered by the Evaluator, the student must register his dog at www.mydoghasclass.com for that additional level(s). Even though a student may register his dog for one level at a time, the student has the option to register more than once in a single day. For instance, if a student plans to take the B.A. and M.A. Evaluations on the same day, the student may register for the B.A., and after receiving confirmation of the B.A. registration, the student may register for the M.A. at any time. When the student logs into his account, the registration system automatically knows which level(s) have already been registered for, so you cannot register a dog twice for the same level.

How long does the evaluation take?
The evaluation process takes about 30 minutes, but may vary depending on each situation. Plan to arrive early to allow yourself and your dog time to acclimate to the testing environment so you are not rushed on the day of the evaluation.

If I don’t pass the evaluation, can I repeat it?
Yes, you may repeat the evaluation after at least one week. A particular C.L.A.S.S.™ level may not be retaken more than once per week. This allows time for the student and dog to work on any test items not passed.

When I register my dog, will I receive a confirmation of my registration?
Yes, you will receive confirmation of each dog registered via email upon completing online registration. You can also print your registration confirmation for any dog you have registered at any time by logging into your student profile at www.mydoghasclass.com.

Do I have to repeat the entire evaluation or can I just retake the test items we missed?
If a team receives a non-passing score and would like to try again, the entire evaluation must be repeated. This ensures validity of the testing process.

Why should I take the C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluation?
Since the C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluation advocates positive reinforcement training, the evaluation is meant to be an enjoyable activity for you and your dog, based on skills that you use in real-life. Furthermore, the C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluation is designed to give students a fair and unbiased assessment of their skills with their dogs.

What can I do with my online C.L.A.S.S.™ student profile?
When you register for a free student profile at www.mydoghasclass.com, you will be able to log in at any time to: • Update your contact information • View and print your Student ID and Dog ID Numbers • View and print your evaluation scores • Order certificates and other items for C.L.A.S.S.™ graduates

Can I register by phone?
Yes, call 800-PET-DOGS (800-738-3647) to register for C.L.A.S.S.™ To register by phone, credit card payment is required.

How can I view my dog’s score after an evaluation?
Scores are posted online within two weeks of the evaluation date. To view and print scores, log in to your online C.L.A.S.S.™ student’s profile and click on your dog’s ID number.

What is a C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluation like?
Watch a short video at www.mydoghasclass.com for a preview of what to expect when you and your dog go through a C.L.A.S.S.™ Evaluation.

How do you define a No-Pull Harness?
No-Pull Harnesses are devices designed to manage a dog’s pulling. They differ from standard harnesses in that standard harnesses are made so that the dog can safely pull without putting pressure on the dog’s neck. There are different styles of No-Pull harnesses—some are made for the leash to clip in front of the dog’s chest and work with the dog’s natural opposition reflex, and some are made for the leash to clip on the back and put tension under the front legs if the dog pulls. These harnesses do not teach the dog not to pull; they are a management tool.

How do you define “body blocking” as listed in the “Cueing and Multiple Cueing” section?
Body blocking is using your body to take up space. Body blocking can be used (and is used) by humans and dogs as a way to control the movement of others. Some examples of body blocking include standing between the dog and an open door to block the dog from going through the doorway, shuffling into the dog so that the dog moves away, and positioning yourself between the dog and the food bowl to block the dog’s access to the bowl. During a C.L.A.S.S. Evaluation, body blocking without physical contact (i.e. not touching the dog with any part of your body) is considered a cue. Body blocking with physical contact, as listed in the physical prompting section, is not allowed and will be scored as an Automatic Incomplete.

BIEN DéMARRER AVEC SON CHIEN


Vous allez accueillir ou vous venez d’accueillir un nouveau membre dans la famille ?


Félicitation ! C’est toujours un grand moment d’émotion pour tout le monde et surtout
pour votre chien. Il va devoir s’habituer à	
   un nouvel environnement et à	
   de nouvelles
personnes. Rassurez-vous les chiens s’adaptent très vite, ils sont très observateurs
et apprennent très rapidement.


D’ailleurs, c’est souvent un problème pour les maîtres qui ne sont pas encore prêts	
  à	
  
endosser leur rôle et à	
  démarrer l’éducation de leur chien. Difficile de résister à	
  une
petite boule de poils, surtout dans les premiers moments où	
   on n’a qu’une envie,
celle de céder à	
  tous ses caprices ;-)


Mais ces premiers moments sont cruciaux, votre chien va rapidement juger vos
talents de maître et trouver petit à	
   petit sa place au sein de votre foyer. Il va acquérir
ses premiers réflexes et il est préférable que ce soient les bons du premier coup.


C’est le but de cet ebook : Bien démarrer avec votre chien !


Avec cet ebook, vous prendrez un bon départ avec votre chien et donc profiterez
pleinement de l’instant présent sans tomber dans les pièges classiques des débuts
qui poseront problème par la suite.


Au programme, je vous expliquerai comment préparer votre maison, comment
transporter votre chien en voiture, comment choisir un vétérinaire, comment gérer le
premier jour et la première nuit, apprendre les premiers ordres à	
   votre chien, les
bases de la propreté, etc.


Mais surtout je vous donnerai toutes les astuces pour être un bon maître et adopter
en toute circonstance le bon comportement avec votre chien.


Bref, vous aurez toutes les informations pour démarrer sur de bonnes bases et
profiter au maximum de l’agrandissement de la famille.
       Pourquoi donner ce livre quand
      d’autres vendent ces informations
                  30 euros ?
                                      Saviez vous que de nombreux chiens sont
                                      abandonnés parce que leur maître n’a pas su
                                      prendre un bon départ avec eux.

                                      Les choses ont dégénérées et ils ne savent plus
                                      comment s’y prendre avec leur chien ?
                                      C’est principalement pour cette raison que mon
                                      ebook est gratuit.
                                      Il a pour vocation d’aider tous les nouveaux
                                      maîtres à bien démarrer y compris ceux qui
                                      pourraient potentiellement abandonner leur
                                      chien.
              L’idée de sauver un seul de ces chiens vaut bien plus
                            que 30 euros à mes yeux.




   Mais comment faîtes vous pour vivre ?
Très bonne question, merci de vous en inquiéter ;-)
Je suis éducateur canin ce qui me permet de gagner ma vie en plus dʼêtre au contact
et dʼaider des chiens et leurs maîtres au quotidien. Je travaille également pour
différentes associations ce qui mʼa poussé à créer Dresser-son-chien.com.

La gestion, lʼhébergement de ce site et surtout la création de son contenu me
prennent beaucoup de temps et engendrent des frais. Jʼapprécie donc toute aide qui
me permette de continuer.

Il y a différents moyens de le faire et la bonne nouvelle cʼest que la plupart dʼentre
eux sont totalement gratuits. Je vous en reparlerai à la fin du livre et si vous lʼavez
apprécié ou que vous aimez le site Dresser-son-chien.com, vous saurez quoi faire ;-)

               Mais pour le moment concentrons nous
                        sur le plus important :
                  Bien démarrer avec votre chien !
                          chapitre 1 :


      préparer sa maison pour
       l’arrivée de son chien

On oublie parfois que notre petit intérieur peut se révéler très dangereux pour un
chien et plus encore pour un chiot.


Chaque année, de nombreux chiens sont malheureusement victimes d’accidents
stupides : chutes, coupures, empoisonnements, étouffements, noyades, ...


Donc, avant d’accueillir votre chiot ou votre chien chez vous, préparez votre
appartement ou votre maison pour être sûr que votre chien pourra évoluer en toute
sécurité.
               Délimiter l’espace pour
             votre chiot ou votre chien
                                                  La première chose à faire est de
                                                  délimiter le périmètre dans lequel votre
                                                  chiot ou votre chien pourra circuler.

                                                  Il est fort probable que vous ayez besoin
                                                  d empêcher votre chien d accéder à
                                                  certains endroits de votre appartement
                                                  ou        de        votre      maison.

                                                  Que ce soit pour sa propre sécurité
                                                  (éviter qu il ne tombe dans les escaliers)
                                                  ou votre propre confort (protéger une
                                                  pièce des dégâts que peut faire un
                                                  chiot), pensez à sécuriser toutes les
                                                  portes et toutes les fenêtres.


Dans certains cas, une barrière comme celle-ci :
Barrière Bettacare peut être un bon
investissement ou  une  bonne  source
d inspiration si vous êtes un peu bricoleur ;-)


Restreindre l'espace disponible pour votre chien
vous permettra également de dresser votre
chien plus facilement.


Une fois le périmètre délimité, il ne vous reste
plus qu à le sécuriser en vous mettant à la place
de votre chien. Tout ce qui sera à sa portée doit
être inoffensif pour lui.
                 Sécuriser l’espace pour
             votre chiot ou votre chien

                                             Commencez par protéger votre chiot
                                             d’éventuels chocs électriques en essayant
                                             de mettre hors de portée tous les fils et les
                                             prises de courant.

                                             L’idéal est d’utiliser des baguettes pour les
                                             fils comme celles-ci : Hama Goulotte et
                                             des caches-prises : Cache-prise - Xtra
                                             Guard.


                                             Protégez également les coins pointus qui
                                             pourraient être dangereux pour votre chiot
                                             (au moins le temps qu'il s’habitue à	
   son
                                             nouvel environnement).


Un simple rouleau anti-choc comme celui-ci : Rouleau Mousse 4 Coins suffit à	
  
protéger plusieurs pièces.


Si certains placards accessibles à	
   votre chien contiennent des produits dangereux,
essayez de les mettre ailleurs ou installez des systèmes d’ouverture sécurisée de ce
type : Tigex Bloque Porte


Attention également à	
   vos plantes d’intérieurs, qu’elles soient toxiques ou pas, faîtes
en sorte qu’elles soient hors de portée de votre chien ainsi que tout objet fragile ou
précieux à	
  vos yeux.

Si vraiment vous êtes dans l'incapacité	
  de mettre certaines plantes ou certains objets
hors de portée de votre chien, sachez qu'il existe des sprays répulsifs qui
permettent de maintenir votre chien à	
  l'écart des zones sensibles.


Mais tres franchement je vous déconseille de jouer avec le feu car ces sprays ne
sont efficaces que temporairement et il faut penser a en remettre régulierement.
       Dernière vérification avant l'arrivée
        de votre chiot ou de votre chien
	
  


                                                 En matière de sécurité, on n’est jamais
                                                 assez prudent !


                                                 D’une manière générale, tout ce qui est
                                                 dangereux pour un bébé	
  est également
                                                 dangereux pour un chiot ou un chien.


                                                 Refaites le tour de votre maison ou de
                                                 votre appartement en gardant cette
                                                 idée à	
  l’esprit.


                                                 Si vous appliquez tous mes conseils,
                                                 votre chiot ou votre chien ne doit pas
                                                 pouvoir sortir sans vous.




Il est à	
  l’abri des électrocutions. Il ne doit pas avoir accès à	
  des produits chimiques,
des objets tranchants ou pointus, des sacs plastiques, des plantes (toxiques ou pas)
et, enfin aux objets précieux pour vous.


         Si votre maison répond à tous ces critères, félicitations !
       Elle est prête pour l’arrivée de votre chiot ou de votre chien.

       les accessoires
indispensables pour l’arrivée
          d’un chien
Il existe énormément de listes d’accessoires indispensables pour préparer l'arrivée
de votre chien.


Elles sont souvent bien plus longues que nécessaires, vous conseillant d’acheter à	
  
peu près tout et n’importe quoi.


Voici donc ma liste d’accessoires indispensables pour préparer l’arrivée de votre
chien sans exploser votre budget.


Libre à	
  vous d’acheter des accessoires supplémentaires mais au moins vous saurez
qu’ils ne sont pas indispensables ;-)
       Enfin une liste des accessoires
         indispensables pour chien !

                                             Contrairement à ce que je lis ou entend
                                             souvent,    il   existe     trois types
                                             d’accessoires pour chiens :

                                             - Les accessoires indispensables pour
                                             l’arrivée d’un chien,

                                             - Les accessoires qui peuvent attendre
                                             un peu pour étaler vos dépenses,

                                             - Les accessoires "fun" "design" ou
                                             "confort" mais pas indispensables.

                                             En gardant ce principe en tête, vous
                                             regarderez les accessoires pour chiens
                                             d’un autre œil. D’un seul coup, les
                                             choses devraient vous paraître un peu
                                             plus simple.


Les accessoires indispensables pour préparer l’arrivée de votre chien sont ceux qui
vous permettent d’accueillir votre chien dans de bonnes conditions. Le minimum vital
pour son confort, sa santé et commencer à lui donner les bons réflexes. C’est tout !


La seconde catégorie d’accessoire est également indispensable mais rien ne presse.
Si vous avez le minimum vital, c’est parfait. Inutile de vouloir acheter tout d’un coup.
Un coupe-ongle pour chien est important mais à l’arrivée de votre chien, vous avez
sûrement mieux à faire qu’une manucure ;-)


La dernière catégorie d’accessoires est souvent la plus attrayante dans les rayons, la
plus drôle, la plus colorée, … Cette catégorie d'accessoires permet de gâter son
chien ou tout simplement de passer de bons moments avec lui mais ils n’ont rien à
faire dans une liste d’accessoires indispensables pour préparer l’arrivée de votre
chien.
          Les véritables accessoires
        indispensables pour préparer
            l’arrivée de votre chien

La caisse de transport

C’est l’un des premiers accessoires indispensables pour l’arrivée de votre chien.

                                                  Vous aurez forcément besoin de
                                                  prendre la voiture avec votre chien
                                                  (pour le ramener de l’éleveur à
                                                  chez vous ou pour aller chez le
                                                  vétérinaire, par exemple).

                                                  Vous aurez donc besoin dès les
                                                  premiers jours de cet accessoire.

                                                  Si vous avez un petit budget ou
                                                  que vous souhaitez étaler les
                                                  dépenses, vous pouvez utiliser la
                                                  caisse de transport comme panier
                                                  chez vous. Il vous suffit d’ajouter
                                                  une couverture ou un coussin.




Choisissez une caisse de transport robuste et adaptée à la taille adulte de votre
chien.
Les gamelles pour votre chien

Votre chien doit avoir ses propres gamelles, il
ne doit pas manger ou boire dans votre
vaisselle. Il vous faut une gamelle pour l’eau et
une pour la nourriture.


Eviter les gamelles plastiques et choisissez de
préférence une gamelle inox avec un fond
antidérapant (résistant, facile d’entretien et
plus confortable pour le chien).


Pour certaines races de chien, il est préférable
de ne pas laisser les gamelles au sol afin de
lui éviter des problèmes de santé : dos,
articulations, digestion.


Dans ce cas, un support pour gamelle devient indispensable (vérifier avec votre
vétérinaire). Vous en trouverez de nombreux modèles comme celui-ci : support
Trixie    et   pour   les    bricoleurs, c’est très   facile  à      imiter  ;-)




La laisse et le collier/harnais pour votre chien

                                              La laisse et le collier font partie des
                                              accessoires       indispensables   pour
                                              l’arrivée de votre chien.


                                              Pour vos débuts je vous recommande
                                              une laisse basique et résistante car
                                              votre chien ne lui fera pas de cadeaux.

                                              Une laisse en nylon, d’1m20 est
                                              préférable à une laisse rétractable car
                                              elle facilite l’éducation.

La bonne nouvelle, c’est que ce type de laisse ne coute quasiment rien et vous en
trouverez de nombreux modèles sur Amazon ou Canincalin.com
                                              Pour le collier, je vous recommande
                                              également un collier ou harnais
                                              basique en nylon.


                                              Si vous le pouvez choisissez en un
                                              avec des surfaces réfléchissantes pour
                                              quelques euros de plus.


                                              Le nombre de chiens percutés par des
                                              voitures est vraiment impressionnant,
                                              ce genre de collier ne remplacera
                                              jamais votre vigilence mais ça peut
                                              aider.


Le médaillon de votre chien

Un médaillon n’est pas obligatoire pourtant je
classe cet accessoire parmi les indispensables. Il
est très facile de perdre son chien (surtout si
c’est le premier et qu’on n’a pas encore les bons
reflexes).


La loi vous oblige à identifier votre chien
(tatouage ou électronique) pour parer à ce genre
d’éventualités. Mais si quelqu’un trouve votre
chien, il est plus facile et rapide de vous appeler
directement que de passer par un vétérinaire ou
la SPA.


Vous épargnerez une longue attente et
beaucoup de stress à votre chien et à
vous même !


Il existe des milliers de solutions adaptées à tous les budgets pour faire un médaillon
à votre chien.


Vous pouvez faire appel à un graveur, attacher une petite capsule contenant vos
coordonnées au collier du chien ou tout simplement écrire au feutre indélébile sur le
collier de votre chien.
Le jouet de votre chien


                                        On pourrait croire qu’un jouet n’est pas un
                                        accessoire indispensable pour votre chien.

                                        En réalité, vous comprendrez rapidement que
                                        vous et votre chien ne pouvez pas vous en
                                        passer.

                                        Le jouet permet au chien de se défouler mais
                                        c’est aussi un outil pour dresser votre chien.

                                        Il doit savoir avec quoi il peut et ne peut pas
                                        jouer. Si votre chien commence à mâchouiller
                                        vos chaussures, vous devez avoir sous la
                                        main un jouet à lui donner qu’il peut
                                        mâchouiller.

                                        Je déconseille de recycler des objets de la
                                        maison en jouet (chaussons, torchons) car
                                        votre chien ne comprendrait pas pourquoi il
                                        peut jouer avec certains objets domestiques
                                        et pas d’autres.

Si vous ne deviez prendre qu’un seul jouet (mais je vous conseille dʼen avoir 2 ou 3
nottament pour lui apprendre à ramener et donner), je vous recommande une corde
à noeud.

Très bon jouet pour votre chien, utile pour son entretien dentaire, solide et lavable en
machine !
       Récapitulatif des accessoires
              indispensables

Donc les accessoires indispensables pour l’arrivée de votre chien sont : une caisse
de transport, les gamelles, la laisse et le collier, un médaillon et quelques jouets.


Pour le moment vous pouvez vous limiter à ces simples accessoires et votre chien
sera le plus heureux du monde. Attention, il vous reste encore à acheter la nourriture
de votre chien.


Assez rapidement, il vous faudra également investir dans l’équipement nécessaire à
l’hygiène de votre chien : shampoing, brosse, …


A vous de voir pour le reste des accessoires au fur et à mesure, selon les besoins de
votre chien (manteau par exemple), selon vos envies et votre budget.


Hormis la caisse de transport, le coût total des accessoires indispensables pour
l’arrivée de votre chien est d’environ 15 euros ! Inutile de vous ruinez et d’acheter
toute une panoplie d’accessoires, ça ne sert à rien !




         L’accessoire préféré de votre chien :
                     c’est vous !!!
                          chapitre 3 :

            choisir un vétérinaire

Choisir un bon vétérinaire est sans aucun doute le plus beau cadeau que vous
puissiez faire à	
  votre chien (même s’il y a peu de chance qu’il vous en remercie ;-)


Après vous et votre famille, le vétérinaire est la personne la plus importante pour
votre chien.


Voici quelques critères à prendre en compte et quelques vérifications à faire pour
choisir le bon vétérinaire.
 Critères pour choisir un vétérinaire

                                  Proximité	
  du vétérinaire
                                  L’un des critères les plus importants pour choisir
                                  son vétérinaire reste la proximité. C’est très
                                  pratique, en cas d’urgence, de pouvoir emmener
                                  son chien en quelques minutes chez son
                                  vétérinaire.


                                  L’idéal étant de pouvoir y aller à pied pour éviter
                                  un trajet en voiture à votre chien. Pour trouver
                                  les vétérinaires près de chez vous, rendez-vous
                                  sur www.veterinaire.fr


                                  Le bouche à	
  oreille
                                  C’est un bon moyen d’obtenir de bonnes
                                  adresses et des informations.


                                  Mais attention n’écartez pas un vétérinaire de
                                  votre liste à cause d’un avis négatif. Certaines
                                  personnes ne sont jamais satisfaites, et il est
                                  préférable de visiter le vétérinaire vous-même et
                                  de vous faire votre propre opinion.


Il serait dommage de ne pas choisir le vétérinaire en bas de chez vous uniquement
parce que votre voisin a une dent contre lui.
Les horaires de votre vétérinaire
Dans la mesure du possible, il est préférable que les horaires de votre vétérinaire
soient adaptées aux vôtres ou au moins à l’un des membres de votre famille qui est
en mesure d’emmener votre chien chez le vétérinaire.



Services d’urgence de votre vétérinaire
Il est intéressant de savoir comment fonctionne votre vétérinaire en cas d’urgence.


Est ce que son cabinet gère les urgences 24h/24 ? Travaille-t-il en collaboration avec
d’autres vétérinaires ? Où sont traités les chiens s'il n’est pas disponible ou s'il n’est
pas équipé pour faire face à l’urgence, et est-ce loin de chez vous ?


Il est préférable de connaître ces informations avant de choisir votre vétérinaire.



Question de feeling pour choisir votre
vétérinaire
C’est un critère qui ne servira techniquement pas à grand chose pour votre chien
mais qui est beaucoup plus important que l’on ne le pense.


Le vétérinaire est souvent votre premier contact en cas de problème, il est important
que vous vous sentiez en confiance avec lui. Il faut que vous soyez assez à l'aise
pour partager vos angoisses et poser toutes les questions que vous jugez
nécessaire.


Il faut également que celui-ci prenne le temps de vous répondre.


La santé de votre chien est un travail d’équipe entre vous qui côtoyez votre chien au
quotidien et votre vétérinaire qui sait déceler d’éventuels problèmes de santé. Pour
que vous formiez une bonne équipe avec votre vétérinaire, vous devez communiquer
correctement.
Les tarifs des vétérinaires
Les tarifs des vétérinaires sont libres, ils dépendent principalement des charges du
cabinet (loyer, matériel, salaires, …). Pour choisir votre vétérinaire, il peut être
intéressant de comparer le prix d’une consultation simple pour un chien.


Mais ne donnez pas trop d’importance à ce critère car vous pourriez le regretter un
jour. En matière de santé, il est toujours préférable de ne pas se poser la question du
prix.


Plutôt que de choisir le vétérinaire le moins cher, je vous recommande de vous
libérer l’esprit de ce problème et de prendre une simple assurance pour chien.




La visite test de votre vétérinaire
C’est le dernier critère qui devra vous permettre de vous décider. Appelez le
vétérinaire pour une petite visite (inutile d’emmener votre chien pour le moment).


C’est l’occasion de tout vérifier une dernière fois : le temps de transport pour y aller,
la propreté et l’odeur des locaux, la fréquentation, l’accueil du personnel, l’accueil du
vétérinaire (sil est disponible), le contact facile, les équipements, …


Bref enregistrez tous les sentiments et informations qui vous permettront de choisir le
bon vétérinaire…
              Les différents types de
                    vétérinaires

                                              En cherchant votre vétérinaire, vous
                                              allez découvrir qu’il existe différents
                                              types d’établissements vétérinaires :


                                              - le cabinet vétérinaire,
                                              - la clinique vétérinaire,
                                              - et le centre hospitalier vétérinaire.


                                              Les différences entre ces trois types
                                              d’établissements vétérinaires résident
                                              dans le nombre de pièces disponibles,
                                              leurs équipements, leur personnel et
                                              donc les services qu’ils sont capables
                                              d’offrir.




Le centre hospitalier vétérinaire
Un centre hospitalier vétérinaire doit, par exemple, compter 6 vétérinaires minimum
et un auxiliaire spécialisé pour chaque vétérinaire.


Il doit être en mesure d’assurer la gestion des urgences, les soins aux animaux, les
interventions médico-chirurgicales et le suivi des animaux hospitalisés, le tout 24h/24
et 7j/7.


Les locaux et l’équipement d’un centre hospitalier sont donc plus conséquents
puisqu’il doit être en mesure de répondre à tous les cas possibles et imaginables.


Le gros avantage d’un centre hospitalier, c’est que les vétérinaires peuvent tout faire
sur place mais c’est aussi pour ça que les tarifs sont un peu plus élevés.
La clinique vétérinaire
Une clinique vétérinaire est plus petite qu’un centre hospitalier : moins de personnel,
moins de locaux et moins d’équipement.


Mais rassurez-vous, une clinique vétérinaire reste très bien équipée et sera capable,
sauf cas vraiment exceptionnels, de prendre en charge votre chien de A à Z.


La grande différence avec un centre hospitalier réside dans le fait qu’une clinique
n’est pas obligée de surveiller les animaux hospitalisés, y compris la nuit et le week-
end.


De même, elle n’est pas tenue d’assurer les urgences. Ce sera donc à vous de
vérifier avec le personnel avant de les choisir.



Le cabinet vétérinaire
Le cabinet vétérinaire contient au moins un lieu de réception, une pièce réservée aux
examens et aux interventions médico-chirurgicales. Comme la clinique, le cabinet
n’est pas tenu d’assurer les urgences.


Là encore, certains cabinets vétérinaire sont parfaitement équipés pour répondre aux
soins courants de votre chien, à vous de voir pendant votre visite comment sont
gérées les urgences.


Enfin, il existe également le vétérinaire à domicile qui viendra directement chez vous
mais qui évidemment aura une marge de manœuvre limitée.


Vous savez tout sur les vétérinaires et vous devriez pouvoir faire votre choix
facilement maintenant…



   N’oubliez pas de garder le numéro d’urgence
           de votre vétérinaire préféré
                à portée de main !!!
                                         	
  




                         chapitre 4 :

         transporter son chien
              en voiture

Je rencontre régulièrement des maîtres transportant leur chien en voiture sans
aucune protection.


En cas de choc à 50km/h, un petit chien de 10 kg qui n’est pas attaché devient un
projectile de 250kg qui va traverser l’habitacle de votre voiture !


Il existe maintenant des accessoires qui permettent de voyager en voiture avec son
chien en toute sécurité.


Ne jouez pas avec la sécurité de votre chien, ni avec celle de votre entourage,
transportez  votre    chien     en    voiture     de    manière     sécurisée…
     Les différentes méthodes pour
     transporter un chien en voiture



La ceinture de sécurité pour chien

                                             La ceinture de sécurité pour chien est
                                             le minimum que vous puissiez faire
                                             pour transporter votre chien en voiture.


                                             En cas de contrôle de police vous
                                             éviterez une amende et il peut
                                             également éviter les accidents liés à un
                                             chien qui deviendrait incontrôlable en
                                             voiture.


                                             Vous trouverez ce type de ceinture de
                                             sécurité sur Canincalin.com ou sur
                                             Amazon.




Attention, il suffit dʼobserver lʼattache de ce type de produit pour se rendre compte
quʼelle ne supportera pas une pression de 250kg.


Vous éviterez une amende en cas de contrôle mais en cas dʼaccident, ni vous, ni
votre chien nʼêtes en sécurité.
Le harnais pour transporter son chien en
voiture


Le harnais de sécurité pour
chien est un produit un peu
plus performant.

Dʼabord il présente lʼavantage
dʼutiliser la ceinture de sécurité,
il est donc plus sécurisé quʼune
simple laisse.

Ensuite en cas dʼaccident, un
bon harnais va répartir la
pression sur le poitrail de votre
chien.

Donc, il y aura moins de dégâts
quʼavec un simple collier.

Cʼest une solution intéressante,
mais pour être tout à fait franc,
jʼai des doutes sur
leurs performances en cas de
choc.


Jʼai du mal à croire quʼils résistent à une pression de 250 kg. Cʼest pour cette raison
que je préfère la dernière solution.
                   La caisse de transport
                 pour transporter son chien


                                              La caisse de transport pour chien
                                              reste la meilleure méthode pour
                                              transporter son chien en toute sécurité
                                              dans votre voiture.


                                              Attention, il ne faut pas la placer sur le
                                              siège passager même si vous
                                              l’attachez avec la ceinture de sécurité.
                                              En cas de choc, la caisse va se briser
                                              sous la pression de la ceinture et le
                                              chien sera expulsé.


                                              En revanche, si la taille de votre
                                              caisse vous le permet, vous pouvez la
                                              caler entre la banquette et le siège
                                              avant. Sinon, la meilleure solution pour
                                              transporter votre chien : mettre la
                                              caisse de transport dans le coffre, bien
                                              calé contre un côté.


De cette manière, votre chien et vos passagers seront en sécurité.


Autre point non négligeable, si les pompiers ou des passants viennent à votre
secours après un accident, il est préférable que votre chien soit dans une caisse de
transport. Un chien en liberté et en état de choc peut être un sérieux problème.


Encore trop de maîtres son réticents à l’idée d’enfermer leur chien dans une caisse
de transport mais sachez que pour un chien, c’est un espace rassurant, surtout
quand on part en voyage. Il suffit de dresser son chien pour l’habituer à la voiture
comme à la caisse de transport.
        Que dit la loi sur les chiens en
                   voiture ?

                                              On me pose souvent la question : est-
                                              ce obligatoire d’attacher son chien en
                                              voiture ?


                                              Le code de la route oblige le
                                              conducteur ainsi que les passagers
                                              d’un véhicule à porter une ceinture de
                                              sécurité (article R412-1).


                                              Il précise également que les possibilités
                                              de mouvement et le champ de vision
                                              d’un conducteur ne doivent pas être
                                              réduits par des passagers ou objets
                                              transportés (article R412-6 du Code de
                                              la route).


Donc si en cas de contrôle votre chien est en liberté dans votre voiture, le principe de
précaution prévaut, et vous risquez une amende de 2ème classe car votre chien est
un risque potentiel d’entrave à la liberté de vos mouvements ou de votre champ de
vision.


Même le meilleur éducateur canin peut dresser son chien à prendre la voiture mais il
ne peut pas garantir à 100% les réactions de son chien. Les forces de l’ordre
peuvent également considérer votre chien comme un passager non-attaché, auquel
cas vous écoperez en plus d’une amende de 4ème classe.


Mais peu importe ce que dit la loi, transporter un chien en voiture n’est pas un acte
anodin et il faut prendre un maximum de précautions pour vous, vos passagers et
votre chien.



          Transportez votre chien en voiture
                 en toute sécurité...

En revanche, pour votre chiot, les choses sont un peu plus difficiles à gérer. Suivez
ces quelques conseils pour faire en sorte que ce moment soit aussi merveilleux pour
vous que pour lui.

L’arrivée de votre chiot va se dérouler en deux étapes et chacune d’entre elles
demande un minimum de préparation : la première journée, et surtout la première
nuit.
             Le premier jour de votre
                 chiot à	
  la maison

                                        Pour votre chiot, ce premier jour est surtout
                                        un grand moment de stress, probablement le
                                        plus grand stress qu’il ait connu.


                                        Votre chiot vient de perdre sa mère, ses
                                        frères et sœurs, et sa maison. Même si vous
                                        êtes évidemment prêt à lui fournir toute
                                        l’affection dont il a besoin, votre chiot aura
                                        besoin d’un petit temps d’adaptation (ce n'est
                                        pas le moment de commencer à dresser son
                                        chien ;-).


                                        Donc laissez le découvrir à son rythme, ne le
                                        bousculez pas, et n’oubliez pas de prévenir
                                        le reste de la famille (surtout les enfants si
                                        vous en avez) qu’il est préférable de le
                                        laisser tranquille pour son premier jour.


Soyez surtout attentif au sommeil de votre chiot. Un chiot a besoin de repos
régulièrement, et il est important qu’il puisse se reposer dans un endroit calme sans
être dérangé.


Mise à part ça, il n’y a pas vraiment d’inquiétude à avoir. Si vous avez sécurisé votre
maison avant l’arrivée de votre chiot, il ne vous reste plus qu’à vous asseoir et
observer votre chiot évoluer dans son nouvel environnement.


Les choses vont se corser quand la nuit va tomber…
      La première nuit de votre chiot
               à	
  la maison

                                                             Votre chiot avait l’habitude
                                                             de se coucher avec sa
                                                             petite famille pour lui tenir
                                                             chaud, et c’est évidemment
                                                             à ça qu’il va penser à
                                                             l’heure d’aller se coucher.


                                                             Il se sentira seul et un peu
                                                             stressé par ce nouvel
                                                             environnement.


Rassurez-vous si vous appliquez l'une de ces méthodes, cela passera très vite et
surtout votre chiot dormira rapidement à l'endroit où vous le souhaitez.




Première nuit "à	
  la dure"

C’est la méthode classique mais parfois difficile à réaliser pour certains d'entre nous.


Il suffit d’installer le panier de votre chiot dans la pièce où vous souhaitez qu’il dorme.
Laissez un tissu avec votre odeur dans son panier, l’idéal étant un tissu provenant de
chez l’éleveur avec l’odeur de sa mère et du reste de sa famille pour qu’il se sente en
confiance.


Si votre éleveur ne vous a rien fourni, sachez qu'il existe des sprays contenant des
phéromones d'apaisement. Une goutte dans le panier de votre chiot et celui-ci se
sentira apaisé et en sécurité.
Avant d’aller se coucher, n’oubliez pas le dîner de votre chiot, la ballade pour faire
ses besoins et même de jouer avec lui pour le fatiguer un peu. Ensuite, emmenez-le
dans son panier et quittez la pièce. Il est fort probable que votre chiot se mette à
pleurer.


C’est la partie difficile de cette méthode. Malheureusement si vous céder et
retournez voir votre chiot pour le consoler, vous lui aurez appris qu’il suffit de pleurer
pour obtenir ce qu’il veut et l'apprentissage risque d’être plus compliqué par la suite.


Donc, vous aurez besoin d’être solide et le reste de votre famille aussi (dresser son
chien est parfois une épreuve). N’oubliez pas non plus de prévenir vos voisins de
l’arrivée de votre chiot et des éventuels bruits la nuit qui ne dureront pas.




Première nuit en douceur

Cette méthode est moins dure psychologiquement. Il s’agit d’installer le panier de
votre chiot dans votre chambre pour la première nuit. Ensuite, au fur et à mesure que
votre chien s'habitue à son nouvel environnement, vous pourrez éloigner son panier.


Commencez près de votre lit, puis dans un coin de votre chambre, puis dans le
couloir, et ainsi de suite jusqu’à ce qu’il finisse dans la pièce dans laquelle vous
souhaitez le faire dormir.


Avec cette méthode, vous éviterez sûrement les pleurs de votre chiot.


En revanche il est parfois difficile d’éloigner le panier de votre chiot même si vous le
faîtes de façon progressive. Au final, certains d’entre vous seront donc obligés
d’appliquer la première méthode.




      Bonne chance et faîtes de beaux rêves
               avec votre chiot...
                           chapitre 6 :

                    le meilleur
                  accessoire pour
                 dresser son chien

Votre voix vous permet de partager vos sentiments avec votre chien.


Tant que vous n’avez pas commencé à dresser votre chien, il ne comprend pas un
mot de ce que vous racontez. Il n’entend que des sons incompréhensibles : BLA BLA
BLA...


En revanche, il distingue parfaitement le volume et le ton que vous utilisez et c’est ça
qui lui permet de vous comprendre.


Vous devez maîtrisez le volume et le ton de votre voix …
                       Maitriser sa voix
                pour dresser son chien

                                        L’un des premiers éléments à maitriser est le
                                        volume. Je rencontre trop souvent des
                                        maîtres qui utilisent exactement le même
                                        volume, que ce soit pour récompenser leur
                                        chien ou pour le réprimander.


                                        En agissant ainsi, ils se privent d’un moyen de
                                        communication très important.


                                        La plupart du temps, vous devez parler à
                                        votre chien de façon normale et utiliser les
                                        variations de volumes uniquement en cas de
                                        besoin, principalement pour dresser son chien
                                        et le récompenser ou l’avertir d’un danger par
                                        exemple.


Un petit conseil pour gagner l’attention de votre chien : chuchotez ! Vous verrez son
expression et vous verrez que vous aurez toute son attention. C’est un bon exercice
pour comprendre l’importance du volume de votre voix.


Le second élément à maitriser est le ton de votre voix. Vous devez jouer avec les
aigus et les graves. Les hommes doivent souvent travailler sur leurs aigus et les
femmes sur leurs graves.


Pour exprimer la joie et le plaisir, utilisez un ton aigu associé à un volume fort. C’est
le ton qui permet de voir votre chien lever la tête, dresser les oreilles et remuer la
queue.


Pour rassurer votre chien, utilisez un ton aigu associé à un volume faible. Votre chien
sentira votre amour et votre intérêt.
La déception s’exprime avec un ton plus grave et un volume faible mais qui reste
amical. Celui-ci devrait réagir en baissant la tête, les oreilles et la queue.


La fermeté s’exprime avec un volume bas et un ton faible mais cette fois-ci, de
manière autoritaire. Utilisez ce ton quand votre chien fait une bêtise. Il doit vous
permettre d’obtenir l’attention de votre chien instantanément.


N’oubliez pas de lui indiquer aussitôt le bon comportement. C’est la base pour
dresser son chien, indiquez à votre chien qu’il fait une erreur et aussitôt lui montrer la
bonne attitude.




Est-ce-que votre chien vous écoute
                ?
                                               Une étude récente publiée dans la revue
                                               Current Biology a prouvé l’importance
                                               de la voix, et plus particulièrement, de
                                               l’intonation de la voix pour les chiens.


                                               Des scientifiques ont dressé des chiens
                                               pour    qu’ils   restent    parfaitement
                                               immobiles afin de leur pratiquer un IRM
                                               de cerveau.


                                               Ils ont ensuite fait écouter à chaque
                                               chien des pleurs, des rires, des cris, …
                                               et observé leurs cerveaux.


                                               Les scientifiques ont découvert que les
                                               chiens ont eux aussi une zone du
                                               cerveau consacrée à la voix.
L’homme et le chien ont certaines similitudes pour traiter les sons chargés
émotionnellement. La principale différence réside dans le langage. L’homme est plus
sensible au langage tandis que le chien est plus sensible à l’intonation.


Votre chien ne comprend pas ce que vous dites, il le ressent. Même si ce n’est pas
une grande surprise pour ceux qui ont déjà essayé de dresser un chien, c’est
toujours intéressant de voir la science confirmer nos sentiments.




  Pour dresser votre chien, donnez de la voix !	
  
                           chapitre 7 :

         maîtriser son language
             corporel pour
           dresser son chien

Le langage du corps est très important dans notre vie de tous les jours.


Vous exprimez beaucoup plus de choses avec votre corps qu’avec vos paroles. Pour
être précis, 70% de votre communication est non-verbale.


Pour votre chien, on passe à 100% puisqu’il ne comprend pas notre langage, mise à
part quelques mots quand vous commencez à le dresser.


Ce qu’il comprend le mieux, c’est l’intonation de votre voix et votre langage corporel.
Il est donc préférable de maîtriser ces deux éléments...
                Votre chien sait lire
               votre langage corporel


                                             Tous les maîtres ont eu à un moment
                                             ou à un autre la sensation que leurs
                                             chiens anticipent leurs actions.


                                             Ils vous attendent devant la porte alors
                                             que vous venez à peine de décider de
                                             le sortir, ou dans la cuisine alors que
                                             vous venez tout juste de penser à
                                             préparer son repas.


                                             Dans la plupart des cas, votre chien a
                                             tout simplement lu le langage de votre
                                             corps.


Les animaux sont très sensibles à ce moyen de communication, encore plus que
l’être humain.


Je vous ai déjà parlé de l’importance de votre voix mais je ne vous ai pas encore
parlé de votre langage corporel.


Si vous avez conscience du langage de votre corps, vous communiquerez encore
plus efficacement avec votre chien et il sera donc beaucoup plus facile pour vous de
le dresser.
         Utiliser son langage corporel
            pour dresser son chien

                                               Votre chien interprète votre langage
                                               corporel pour savoir ce que vous
                                               pensez : si son comportement est
                                               correct, s'il y a un danger, … C’est
                                               donc à vous de l’utiliser à bon escient
                                               et d’éviter les erreurs classiques.


                                               Certaines erreurs sont évidentes
                                               comme le fait de caresser ou
                                               réconforter son chien quand il vient de
                                               faire une bêtise : votre chien
                                               comprendra que ce qu’il vient de faire
                                               est bien.


                                               Mais, dans certains cas, les choses
                                               sont un peu moins évidentes et vous
                                               pouvez exprimer des choses sans en
                                               avoir conscience.


Si, par exemple, vous vous accroupissez et faîtes un câlin à votre chien parce que
vous sentez qu’il a peur, qu’il est nerveux ou tout simplement qu’il pourrait le devenir,
vous faîtes une erreur de langage corporel.


Le message que va recevoir votre chien, c’est que vous êtes aussi effrayé que lui et
que vous cherchez à vous blottir ensemble.


Un autre exemple fréquent est de prendre son chien dans ses bras pendant la
promenade parce qu’un autre chien arrive, et qu’il vous fait peur.
Ce simple geste transmet votre peur à votre chien et peut engendrer des problèmes
de sociabilisation avec ses congénères.


Si votre chien est en train d’aboyer et que vous lui crier dessus pour qu’il arrête, il
comprendra que vous vous joignez à lui et qu’il a raison d’aboyer. Si vous n’avez pas
encore dressé votre chien aux ordres de base pour qu’il arrête d’aboyer, lui crier
dessus ne fera qu’amplifier le problème.


Caresser votre chien avant de saluer les personnes chez vous peut engendrer des
problèmes de hiérarchie, votre chien comprendra qu’il est plus important à vos yeux
que les humains.


Bref, le langage corporel est très important pour communiquer, et donc pour dresser
son chien.


Un mauvais langage corporel peut ruiner tous vos efforts d’éducation. La plus grosse
difficulté vient du fait qu’on n’a pas forcément conscience de son langage corporel.


Mais, si vous gardez en tête cet élément, vous devriez rapidement vous rendre
compte d’éventuelles erreurs. Si vous rencontrez des difficultés à changer le
comportement de votre chien sur un point précis, demandez-vous si votre langage
corporel concorde avec vos ordres.




     N’oubliez pas votre langage corporel pour
                dresser votre chien !
                         chapitre 8 :

            dresser son chien a
            reconnaître son nom

Pour dresser son chien, il faut que celui-ci vous regarde et qu’il soit attentif. La
meilleure méthode pour cela est évidemment de l’appeler.


C’est donc l’une des premières choses à faire : dresser son chien à reconnaître son
nom. Pourtant, je vois souvent des maîtres hurler le nom de leur chien sans que
celui-ci ne réagisse.


Si c’est votre cas, vous devriez commencer par dresser votre chien pour qu’il
reconnaisse son nom. La bonne nouvelle, c’est que c’est très facile et avec les
bonnes méthodes, c’est également très rapide alors ne vous en privez pas !
               Une méthode positive
              pour apprendre son nom
                                           Comme toujours sur notre site et dans ce
                                           livre nous allons utiliser une méthode
                                           positive pour dresser votre chien à
                                           reconnaître son nom.


                                           Le but est avant tout de passer un bon
                                           moment avec votre chien.


                                           Dresser son chien doit être une activité
                                           amusante pour vous comme pour votre
                                           chien.


                                           Pour dresser votre chien à reconnaître
                                           son nom, il faut qu’il l’associe à quelque
                                           chose de positif.



Donc, la première chose à faire est d’avoir à disposition quelques friandises pour
votre chien (l’idéal est d’en avoir à disposition dans la plupart des pièces où votre
chien circule, au moins pour quelques temps).


Une fois que vous avez vos friandises à portée de main, l’exercice peut
commencer… Choisissez d’abord une pièce calme où votre chien pourra se
concentrer uniquement sur vous. Avec une friandise dans la main, prononcez le nom
de votre chien.


Si votre chien réagit et vous regarde, encouragez-le (« oui bon chien ») et donnez lui
une friandise instantanément.


Si votre chien ne réagit pas, attendez quelques minutes et recommencez l’exercice.
Pratiquez par session de 5 minutes, pas plus.
Vous pouvez répéter l’exercice plusieurs fois par jour mais toujours dans une pièce
calme. Après quelques sessions, votre chien devrait réagir systématiquement, il est
maintenant dressé à reconnaître son nom.


Mais le dressage ne doit pas s’arrêter là, vous allez maintenant corser la difficulté ;-)


Vous allez faire le même exercice dans un milieu un peu plus délicat pour votre
chien. Commencez dans votre jardin, si vous en avez un, ou dans un parc pas trop
agité.


Votre chien attaché, vos friandises à portée de main, vous allez répéter l’exercice. Là
encore, encouragez instantanément votre chien s'il réagit. Dans le cas contraire
laissez-le tranquille quelques minutes et recommencez le test. Petit à petit, faîtes cet
exercice dans des milieux de plus en plus agités.


Au fur et à mesure, diminuer la fréquence des friandises, encouragez uniquement
votre chien oralement et par des caresses.


Si, au cours d’une balade, votre chien réagit correctement malgré la présence
d’autres chiens, d’enfants qui jouent, des voitures qui klaxonnent, … alors
félicitations !


Vous avez dressé votre chien à reconnaître son nom, et contrairement à ce qu’on
pourrait croire, ce n’est pas le cas de tous les maîtres.
    Les erreurs à	
  ne pas commettre
        pour dresser son chien à	
  
          reconnaître son nom


                                  Ce sont les erreurs classiques qu’il ne faut pas
                                  faire quelque soit l’exercice sur lequel vous
                                  travaillez avec votre chien.


                                  Récompensez votre chien à l’instant-même où il
                                  réagit à son nom.


                                  Si vous le faîtes trop tard, votre chien n’associera
                                  pas son nom à quelque chose de positif et vous
                                  n’arriverez pas à le dresser.


                                  Si votre chien ne réagit pas, inutile d’insister, ne
                                  répétez pas son nom jusqu’à ce qu’il vous regarde.


Votre chien n’a droit qu’à un seul essai, s'il vous regarde c’est gagné, sinon vous lui
donnerez une autre chance plus tard.


Votre chien doit comprendre que vos ordres sont importants et qu’il ne gagnera rien
à les ignorer.


Pratiquez par courte période mais régulièrement.


Une fois que votre chien réagit correctement, vous devez le tester le plus souvent
possible (attention : uniquement si vous avez des récompenses à porter de main).
Changez de milieu régulièrement pour tester les réactions de votre chien. Bien
souvent, les maîtres ne pratiquent les exercices qu’en milieu calme alors que c’est
en milieu agité qu’on a le plus besoin d’un chien attentif.




           J'espère que vous avez bien choisi
               le nom de votre chien car
           vous n avez pas fini de l entendre...

              comment apprendre
                 l’ordre "non"
                   à	
  son chien
Un bon maître doit donner des repères à son chien, et c’est à ça que sert le mot
NON, à faire comprendre à votre chien ce qui est bien et ce qui est mal.


Suivez ces quelques conseils et, dans quelques temps, lorsque vous direz non à
votre chien, il comprendra qu’il est en train de faire quelque chose de mal et qu’il doit
s’arrêter.


Il comprendra également qu’il doit vous regarder pour savoir ce qu’il doit faire, et être
récompensé.


Le meilleur outil pour dresser votre chien à l’ordre NON reste la laisse. Pour faire
simple, il faut donner un petit coup sur la laisse (et pas sur le chien !) à chaque
mauvais comportement, tout en disant NON à son chien. Cela paraît simple mais
malheureusement, la plupart des maîtres ne savent pas utiliser leur laisse
efficacement.


Rassurez-vous, avec l’exercice suivant, ce ne sera plus votre cas d’ici peu ;-)
           La laisse de votre chien est
               un outil de dressage

                                          Pour utiliser efficacement la laisse de votre
                                          chien, il faut apprendre à donner un coup et
                                          à relâcher de façon très rapide.


                                          Vous ne devez pas forcer, la laisse doit
                                          rester tendue 2 secondes à peine.


                                          Votre chien ne doit pas décoller du sol, sa
                                          tête ne doit même pas bouger.


                                          L’important c’est votre vitesse d’exécution, la
                                          force n’a aucun intérêt. D’ailleurs, la force
                                          n'est d'aucune utilité pour dresser son chien
                                          (même pour les chiens de grande taille).




Voici un petit test et exercice à faire chez vous :

  •    Attachez la boucle de votre laisse au lacet de votre chaussure

  •    Mettez-vous debout avec la boucle de la laisse posée sur votre chaussure

  •    Donnez un coup puis relâchez le plus rapidement possible


Si votre pied reste au sol et que la boucle reste sur la chaussure à sa place alors
vous maitrisez la laisse, et ce sera votre meilleur allié pour dresser votre chien.


Si votre pied bouge alors vous êtes trop violent, si votre lacet s’envole et que la
boucle n'atterrit pas sur la chaussure alors vous ne relâchez pas assez la laisse.


Maintenant que vous faîtes partie des rares maîtres qui maitrisent la laisse, il reste
un dernier point à comprendre pour l’ordre NON : NON ne met pas fin à un mauvais
comportement, il doit entrainer un bon comportement.
            Ne laissez pas votre chien
                          dans le doute
Si vous dressez votre chien à l’ordre NON,
celui-ci comprendra qu’il fait une erreur mais
le dressage ne doit pas s’arrêter la. C’est à
vous de lui montrer le comportement que
vous attendez de lui pour qu’il sache
comment réagir les fois suivantes.


Prenons l’exemple de l’ordre assis. Votre
chien ne veut pas s’asseoir donc vous devez
lui dire : ASSIS… NON… ASSIS… NON…
ASSIS… quand finalement votre chien
s’assoie vous pouvez le récompenser.


Attention également à votre voix qui ne doit
pas être négative, ferme mais pas agressive.
Le mot NON ne doit pas être une punition
pour votre chien mais plutôt une introduction
au bon comportement, et donc à la récompense.


Un dernier conseil, dans les premiers temps évitez d’utiliser l’ordre NON en dehors
du temps d’exercice de dressage.




   Si votre chien fait des bêtises chez vous (et il en fera ;-)
           tapez dans vos mains au lieu de dire NON.

              comment apprendre
                l’ordre "assis"
                  à	
  son chien

L’ordre "assis" fait partie de l’éducation de base du chien qui lui permet de se
sociabiliser.


L'ordre "assis" est donc utile dans la vie de tous les jours, à la maison ou dans la rue,
il est très important pour dresser son chien.


Cela va vous permettre, entre autre, de le rappeler à l’ordre quand il saute sur les
invités, de vous éloigner un moment de lui sans qu’il ne bouge, par exemple de
rester sagement dehors quand vous entrez dans une boulangerie…
        Plusieurs méthodes pour
     dresser son chien à	
  l'ordre assis
                                         Dresser son chien à l'ordre assis est assez
                                         facile et intuitif, ce qui ne gâche rien.


                                         Vous verrez que dès l’âge de 2 mois, votre
                                         chien sera très réceptif à l’ordre "assis" et
                                         vous avez plusieurs méthodes à votre
                                         disposition.


                                         Choisissez celle qui fonctionne le mieux pour
                                         vous et votre chien. Vous pouvez également
                                         utiliser les deux méthodes simultanément.




La méthode passive pour dresser son chien à	
  
l'ordre assis

Cette méthode demande beaucoup d’observation et de synchronisation.


Chaque fois que vous verrez votre chien s’asseoir, dîtes-lui "assis" et félicitez-le pour
le récompenser.


Il faut donc bien anticiper le moment où votre chien va s’asseoir pour pouvoir dire
"assis" au moment même où il est en train de le faire.


Pourquoi ? Pour que votre chien associe le mot "assis" et la récompense à cette
position.
Le chien a une mauvaise notion du temps. Donc si vous dîtes "assis" trop tôt avant
qu’il ne le fasse ou trop tard après qu’il l’ait fait, le chien ne pourra pas associer la
bonne position avec le mot "assis".


On dit que cette méthode est passive parce qu’on attend que le chien s’assoit
naturellement de lui-même pour lui apprendre l’ordre. Cette méthode pour dresser
son chien demande énormément de patience.


Pour éviter d’observer votre chien toute la journée et de regarder à quel moment il va
s’asseoir, il est aussi possible de provoquer la position assise chez votre chien. C’est
la méthode active par opposition à la méthode passive.




La méthode active pour dresser son chien à	
  
l'ordre assis

Vous pouvez faire asseoir votre chien de plusieurs manières naturelles, c’est-à–dire
sans contraintes physiques (appuyer sur la croupe de votre chien est une contrainte).


Vous avez probablement remarqué que votre chien qui lève la tête de plus en plus
en arrière a tendance à s’asseoir de lui-même. C’est une question d’équilibre.


Il vous suffit tout simplement de vous munir d’une friandise et de la tendre au-dessus
du nez de votre chien qui va lever la tête pour la regarder.


Amenez alors la friandise vers la croupe de votre chien. Pour la regarder, votre chien
va devoir lever la tête en arrière et donc s’asseoir. Les chiens s’assoient
instinctivement quand on leur fait cet exercice et n’ont pas l’idée de se retourner.


Il ne vous reste plus qu’à dire "assis" au moment où votre chien s’assoit et à lui
donner la friandise.


Puis passez à l’étape suivante en supprimant la friandise et en levant votre doigt au-
dessus de la tête de votre chien. Quand il s’assoit, dîtes "assis" et félicitez-le.


En dernière phase d’apprentissage, dîtes seulement "assis" sans avoir à faire lever
la tête de votre chien en arrière. Quand il s’assoit, félicitez-le ! Voilà, vous venez de
dresser votre chien à l’ordre "assis" !
Quelques trucs et astuces pour l'ordre assis

Evitez d’appuyer sur sa croupe pour le faire
asseoir. On n'utilise jamais la force pour
dresser son chien.


Le chien résiste et essaie au contraire de se
relever. Même si par la force, vous arrivez à
le faire asseoir, votre chien va le ressentir
comme une contrainte et ne va donc plus la
rechercher naturellement.


Si votre chien a tendance à sauter sur la
friandise plutôt qu’à lever la tête et à
s’asseoir, essayez de faire lever sa tête avec
votre main puis touchez l’articulation de sa
patte arrière (entre la cuisse et la jambe)
pour le faire asseoir.


Dernier conseil : faîtes preuve de patience. Logiquement votre chiot ou votre chien
saura très prochainement s'asseoir lorsque vous lui demanderez.


Dresser son chien à l'ordre assis est souvent la première étape de l'apprentissage
d'un chien (souvent la plus facile). Une fois que votre chien maîtrisera cet ordre vous
pourrez passer a la suite : l’ordre couché.
                          chapitre 11 :

             comment apprendre
               l’ordre "couché"
                  à	
  son chien

Si vous maîtrisez l’ordre "assis" et que votre chien l’a bien assimilé, vous allez
pouvoir passer à l’ordre "couché".


C'est un ordre essentiel dans l’éducation de base de votre chien. Impossible de
dresser son chien sans cet ordre.


L’ordre "couché" renforce les liens entre le chien et son maître et se révèlera très
utile au quotidien et au cours des promenades avec votre chien.
       Plusieurs méthodes pour
   dresser son chien à	
  l'ordre couché

La position couchée est une position d’attente de longue durée chez le chien. ll sera
donc beaucoup plus simple de garder votre chien au même endroit durant votre
absence si celui-ci est couché que s’il est assis ou debout.


C’est aussi une position de soumission pour le chien. Elle est donc utile pour
recadrer ou canaliser un chien qui teste votre autorité, qui est turbulent ou qui adopte
une posture sexuelle.


Cela permet aussi de rassurer les gens au restaurant, dans le bus ou le métro,
devant la sortie d’école tout simplement parce qu’un chien couché est moins
impressionnant que debout.


Bref, dresser son chien à l'ordre couché va vous faciliter la vie et celle de votre
entourage.


Comme l’apprentissage pour l’ordre "assis", il y a plusieurs manières d’apprendre à
son chien à se coucher sur ordre.
     Méthode passive pour dresser son chien
                l'ordre couché

                                                Il s’agit comme pour l’ordre assis de
                                                bien observer votre chien et de
                                                repérer les moments où votre chien
                                                va se coucher.


                                                Lorsque votre chien prend la
                                                position couchée de lui-même,
                                                dîtes "couché" et félicitez-le en le
                                                caressant pour le récompenser.


                                                De la même manière que pour
                                                l’ordre assis, le timing est très
                                                important.


Il est nécessaire de bien synchroniser l’ordre avec le moment où votre chien exécute
la position. Dresser son chien est souvent l'affaire de quelques secondes.


Répétez plusieurs fois cet exercice et vous verrez que votre chien comprendra assez
vite cet ordre.


L’avantage avec cette méthode, c’est que vous pouvez l’utilisez même si votre chien
n’a pas encore parfaitement assimilé l’ordre "assis".


Il y a également des techniques très simples qui permettent de provoquer
naturellement la position couchée chez le chien si vous n’avez pas le temps
d’attendre qu’il le fasse de lui-même.
             Méthode classique pour dresser
                    son chien à	
  l'ordre couché


C’est une méthode qui fonctionne très
bien avec les chiots ou jeunes chiens.


Commencez par demander à votre
chien de s’asseoir.


Lorsque votre chien est en position
assise, dîtes "couché" tout en lui
prenant les pattes avant et en les tirant
doucement vers l’avant afin
d’accompagner votre chien au sol en
position couchée.


Allez-y doucement pour ne pas l’inquiéter. N’oubliez pas que c’est une position de
soumission chez le chien, et il aura besoin d'être en confiance pour se laisser faire.


N’hésitez pas à le rassurer lorsque vous le manipulerez, dresser son chien
demande une certaine complicité donc prenez votre temps. Et surtout, lorsqu’il prend
la position couchée, félicitez-le.
                Autre méthode pour dresser
                    son chien à	
  l'ordre couché


                                           Voici une autre méthode qui marche très
                                           bien avec les chiens de grande taille.


                                           Demandez d’abord à votre chien de
                                           s’asseoir.


                                           Une fois qu’il est assis, prenez une
                                           croquette, un gâteau ou un biscuit que
                                           vous mettrez dans votre main.


Ensuite, placez votre main poing fermé à environ 20cm devant votre chien et
descendez votre main jusqu’au sol.


Votre chien devrait se coucher automatiquement car ses pattes sont plus longues
que sa gueule et il sera plus facile pour lui de se coucher pour atteindre la nourriture
que de se relever.


Si votre chien baisse la tête pour renifler la nourriture dans votre main mais ne s’est
pas couché, essayez d’éloigner votre main, toujours au ras du sol. Le chien va suivre
avec son nez votre main et adopter la position couchée.


Il ne reste plus qu’à joindre le mot « Couché ! » à sa position et félicitez-le vivement
en lui donnant sa récompense et en le caressant.
Essayez ensuite de faire cet exercice sans lui présenter de croquettes. Demandez-lui
de se coucher. Dès qu’il obéit, donnez-lui la croquette pour le récompenser.
Continuez jusqu’à supprimer complètement la croquette.


Félicitez-le à chaque fois qu’il se couche.


Répétez le jeu plusieurs fois pendant plusieurs jours. Au début, ne demandez pas à
votre chien de rester trop longtemps en position couchée. Allongez progressivement
cette durée par la suite.


Ça y’est ! vous avez dressé votre chien à l’ordre "couché". Essayez maintenant de
ne plus demander à votre chien de s’asseoir avant et donnez-lui l’ordre de se
coucher lorsqu’il est debout.




                            A vous de jouer !

N'oubliez pas dresser son chien demande avant tout de la patience et doit être un
moment de plaisir pour vous comme pour votre chien.


Vous pouvez bien entendu utiliser indifféremment une des trois méthodes ci-dessus
ou les trois en même temps ou ne vous en tenir qu’à une seule.


Tout dépendra du caractère, la race, la taille et la sensibilité de votre chien. La
meilleure méthode est toujours celle qui fonctionnera le mieux avec votre chien.


Amusez-vous bien !!!
                          chapitre 12 :

                dresser son chien
               à	
  porter un collier
                     et une laisse
Porter un collier et une laisse n’est absolument pas naturel pour un chien.


Il est préférable de dresser votre chien à porter son collier et sa laisse dès son
arrivée chez vous.


Commencez à l’habituer d’abord à l’intérieur ou dans votre jardin (dans des endroits
clos) avant de le promener pour la première fois dehors.


Ce sera un souci de moins pour lui (et donc pour vous) quand vous l’emmènerez
découvrir le monde ;-)
           Dresser son chien à	
  porter
                   son collier

                                            Il est préférable de commencer par le
                                            collier seul, sans la laisse.


                                            Attendez un moment de la journée où
                                            votre chien sera distrait et ne prêtera
                                            pas attention au collier.


                                            Au moment du repas par exemple, ou
                                            pendant une session de jeu.


                                            Quand vous voyez que votre chien est
                                            attiré par quelque chose et donc qu’il ne
                                            fait pas attention à vous, enfilez-lui son
                                            collier en douceur.


Vérifiez que le collier est à la bonne taille. Vous devez pouvoir passer un doigt ou
deux entre le cou et le collier de votre chien.


Un collier trop court ne sera pas confortable pour votre chien et il sera difficile de
l’habituer à le porter. Un collier trop long ne tiendra pas en place très longtemps et
votre chien aura vite fait de s’en débarrasser (d’où l’intérêt de tester son collier
d’abord à l’intérieur).
Votre chien va sûrement essayer de retirer le collier, de se rouler dans tous les sens
et/ou pleurer. Essayez de le distraire en jouant avec lui, utilisez son jouet favori.


Si le collier est à la bonne taille, votre chien ne risque rien, il a juste besoin de temps
pour s’y habituer. Même si votre chien vous donne la sensation qu’il ne le supporte
pas, ne le retirez pas avant qu’il s’y habitue ou au moins qu’il se calme.


Souvenez-vous dresser son chien est une question d’association, si vous retirez le
collier de votre chien quand il pleure, il comprendra qu’il suffit de pleurer pour s’en
débarrasser.

Rassurez-vous votre chien devrait s’habituer très rapidement à son collier et vous
pourrez bientôt le dresser à la laisse…




          Dresser son chien à	
  la laisse

                                                Quand votre chien est habitué à son
                                                collier, vous allez pouvoir tester votre
                                                laisse. Restez pour le moment à
                                                l’intérieur et choisissez également un
                                                moment où votre chien sera distrait
                                                (une séance de jeu étant l’idéal).

                                                Dans un premier temps, installez la
                                                laisse sur le collier de votre chien sans
                                                qu’il s’en rende compte et laisser la
                                                pendre, votre chien ne doit pas sentir
                                                sa présence. N’oubliez pas de
                                                continuer à jouer avec lui.

                                                Restez mobile, votre chien ne doit pas
                                                arriver en bout de laisse et sentir une
                                                résistance, c’est encore trop tôt. Après
                                                quelques essais, vous allez pouvoir
                                                passez à la vitesse supérieure.
Installez la laisse sur votre chien et baladez-vous à l’intérieur de chez vous.
Encouragez votre chien quand il vous suit et montre le bon comportement.


Evidemment ne le traînez surtout pas à travers l’appartement, donnez-lui un peu de
temps pour apprivoiser sa laisse. Il est possible que votre chien soit méfiant au début
donc ne forcez pas les choses.

Attachez la laisse, laissez-lui quelques secondes puis utilisez n’importe quelle ruse
(jouet, friandise) pour qu’il marche avec vous et encouragez-le.

N’oubliez pas que vous n’êtes pas encore en train de dresser votre chien à marcher
en laisse, pour le moment il s’agit juste de l’habituer à sa laisse donc faîtes en sorte
que votre chien ne sente pas trop de résistance. Faîtes les choses progressivement.

Ne laissez pas votre chien jouer avec sa laisse ou la mordiller. La laisse n’est pas un
jouet et c’est une habitude qu’il ne doit surtout pas prendre. Si votre chien veut jouer
ou mordiller quelque chose donnez-lui son jouet et encouragez-le s'il montre le bon
comportement.

Une fois que votre chien sera habitué à son collier et à sa laisse (et à un peu de
résistance) vous allez pouvoir commencer les choses sérieuses et emmener votre
chien pour sa première promenade…
                         chapitre 13 :


           DéMARRER L éDUCATION
               DE SON CHIEN

Comme je vous le disais au début de ce livre, de nombreux chiens finissent
abandonnés simplement parce que leurs maîtres sont totalement dépassés et ne
savent plus comment rectifier les mauvais comportements.


Vous pensez sûrement que vous êtes à l’abri de ce genre de chose et je l’espère de
tout mon cœur. Mais, croyez-en mon expérience, beaucoup de chiens sont
abandonnés par des maîtres qui étaient plein de bonnes intentions au départ et les
plus heureux du monde d’accueillir un chien chez eux.


Ne paniquez pas non plus, éduquer un chien est vraiment très facile et tout ce dont
vous avez besoin c’est d’avoir les bonnes méthodes.


Ce que nous allons voir tout de suite…
                   Quand démarrer
        l éducation de son chien
                                   De nombreux maîtres considèrent que leur chiot
                                   est trop jeune pour démarrer son éducation.


                                   Lorsque les mauvais comportements font leur
                                   apparition, ils se lancent.


                                   Evidemment,          c’est      une       erreur !
                                   Il est beaucoup plus facile d’apprendre les bons
                                   comportements à son chiot ou chien que de
                                   rectifier les mauvais.


                                   A partir du moment où vous avez accueilli votre
                                   chiot ou chien, son éducation doit démarrer.


                                   Votre chien, quel que soit son âge, va passer son
                                   temps à vous observer et vous étudier.


Que vous le vouliez ou non, son éducation démarre dès qu’il est en votre présence !


Donc, n’attendez pas et prenez les choses en main le plus tôt possible. Plus vous
démarrez tôt, plus les choses seront faciles !


En revanche, vous devez adapter vos méthodes à l’âge de votre chien.


Un chiot de quelques semaines est très impressionnable, il n’a pas forcément
confiance en lui et en vous. Donc les premières semaines devront à la fois l’aider à
vous découvrir ainsi que le monde dans lequel vous évoluez.


Un chien plus âge aura sûrement moins de problèmes de confiance mais sûrement
quelques mauvaises habitudes à rectifier. Il vous faudra donc plus de techniques de
détournement.


Bref commencez tôt mais avec les bonnes méthodes…
            Quelle méthode
         pour éduquer son chien
                                                Aujourd’hui, il y a de nombreuses
                                                méthodes pour éduquer son chien.


                                                Certaines appellations ont un sens
                                                et    d’autres   sont     purement
                                                marketing.


                                                Finalement, il n’est pas toujours
                                                facile de s’y retrouver et de savoir
                                                qui fait quoi.


                                                Pour faire le tri, j’utilise un système
                                                simple que je vous recommande.

                                                Si une méthode d’éducation utilise
                                                la force, l’intimidation, la contrainte,
                                                la soumission, la violence (verbale
                                                ou physique), les théories de
                                                domination ou de chef de meute,

                                                PASSEZ VOTRE CHEMIN !!!


Toutes ces théories sont totalement dépassées ! Elles sont encore utilisées car elles
donnent des résultats rapides à court terme. En revanche à long terme, elles
détruisent la relation entre vous et votre chien.


Votre chien n’aspire qu’à une chose : votre bonheur ! Ainsi que de manger, dormir et
passer du bon temps avec vous ;-)


C’est assez difficile à réaliser pour de simples humains comme vous et moi, mais
c’est pourtant bien la réalité. Votre chien n’est jamais de mauvaise humeur, il ne
connaît pas la méchanceté, la vengeance et autre vice humain.
Donc, si vous souhaitez qu’il fasse quelque chose, ou ne fasse pas quelque
chose, il vous suffit de lui faire comprendre. Une fois qu’il aura compris, il fera
tout ce qui est en son pouvoir pour le faire et donc vous faire plaisir !


C’est aussi simple que ça d’éduquer son chien, il suffit de savoir communiquer avec
lui. Une fois que vous savez faire ça, vous pouvez demander ce que vous voulez à
votre chien !




            La première étape de
     l éducation de votre chien
Votre chien a des milliers de choses à apprendre de vous.


                                        Il y a ce que vous voulez qu’il fasse comme
                                        les ordres de base :


                                        assis, couché, panier, pas bouger, marcher
                                        en laisse, le rappel…


                                        Et il y a tous les comportements gênants
                                        que vous devez éviter :


                                        tirer sur la laisse, faire ses besoins partout,
                                        mordre ou mâchouiller tout ce qu’il trouve,
                                        sauter sur les gens ou les autres chiens, …


                                        La liste est très très longue !


                                        Alors par où commencer l’éducation de
                                        votre chien : par la vôtre !


Avant d’essayez d’apprendre quoi que ce soit à votre chien commencez par vous
former pour communiquer avec votre chien. Si vous avez les bonnes méthodes, vous
n’aurez aucun souci !
Je ne peux évidemment pas traiter toute l’éducation de votre chien dans ce livre.
D’abord parce que ça risque d’être très long et surtout parce que je ne pense pas
que ce soit la meilleure méthode.


Je pense que le meilleur moyen de vous former (mise à part de faire appel à un
éducateur canin) est de suivre une formation en vidéo qui vous donnera un
programme à suivre pas à pas pour éduquer votre chiot ou chien au fur et à mesure
et en fonction de son âge ou de ses besoins.


Vous verrez ainsi ce que vous devez faire et comment le faire. C’est pour moi le
meilleur moyen d’acquérir les bonnes méthodes d’éducation.

ix Acknowledgments I couldn't have written this book so easily if I hadn't made so many mistakes along the road to responsible dog ownership. I'd like to thank my husband, Barry Marcus, for making those mistakes with me, for growing with me, and for being as devoted to our dogs as I am. I'd also like to thank our poodles, Kramer and Scout, who never once held all those mistakes against us and continue to love us unconditionally. The experts I consulted for this book were gracious and generous with their time and information. Thank you. The knowledgeable dog owners willing to share their insights and experiences helped enrich the book and ground it in reality. Thanks go to them, too. And I'd like to express special thanks to my on-line canine family, the good folks and dogs of canine-1. Each one of you contributed to this book, whether or not you're mentioned by name. You all have enriched my life immensely. I wish I could meet each of you in person. Thanks as well to Rachel Livsey, formerly of Lowell House, who assigned this book to me and helped me through the early stages, as well as Lowell House editors Maria Magallanes and Nicole Monastirsky. I'd also like to thank my agent, Mike Snell, for all his good advice and support.

Introduction When my husband and I bought our first dog, a nine-week-old black standard poodle puppy we named Kramer, I knew next to nothing about dogs. Sure, I'd been to the library to check out the appropriate "dog" books. But I had no practical experience with dogs, and I soon discovered that my instincts weren't right on target. They've been sharply honed in the years since. Back in 1992,I had some ill-conceived, preconceived notions of what made sense in dog raising. (Don't ask me where those notions came from.) For example, I didn't like the idea of putting my puppy in a cage, and training with treats seemed like it would result in a dog who loved treats, not me. So I found the training books that matched those ideals (I won't name them here), and, as I followed the advice in those books, I endured a week of puppy hell. I didn't know which way was up, and neither did Kramer. One week into the ordeal, I walked into the kitchen with my 12-pound puppy attached to my pant leg to answer the phone. It was my husband, Barry, calling to check on how we were doing. "You have to do something!" I cried in desperation. "Bring home a squirt gun or something that will give me some control over this little monster!" Barry stopped at the local pet-supply store and earnestly told the clerk, "We don't know what to do about our dog. He bites us, he pees in the house, and he doesn't do anything we ask" The clerk looked concerned. "That sounds serious. How old is your dog?" When Barry told her he was ten weeks old, the clerk burst into laughter and handed him the business card of a local obedience school. "You need puppy kindergarten!" she said. "At ten weeks old, he's supposed to be doing all those things." What a difference a few years makes. Looking back, I'm astounded at how little I knew (though I did know enough to acquire a highly trainable breed), and amazed by how much I've learned since. I'm going to try to help you to keep from making the many mistakes I made.

xii

xii Kramer turned out to be a wel-behaved, if slightly neurotic, adult dog. When he was three, I quit my job at a botanical garden to pursue a dream Kramer created for me: becoming a freelance dog writer. Over the past five years of writing newspaper, magazine, and Web site articles, as well as books, I've had the chance to ask some of the nation's dog experts for the answers to my questions. I'm signed up on some great Internet mailing lists, so I've become acquainted with hundreds of experienced, knowledgeable, responsible dog owners. You know what? Most of them have made at least some of the mistakes this book describes. Rest assured, the information in this book comes from hard experience--my own and that of others. By reading it and implementing the ideas included here, you can benefit from that experience without having to live through the same mistakes. Incidentally, another black standard poodle, Scout, joined our family four years ago. She was three when she came to live with us, and she didn't turn our lives upside down the way young Kramer did. Though the two dogs are the same breed, they have entirely different personalities, and Scout has brought along her own set of challenges. But each is wonderful in his and her own way, and both have taught me so much about dogs (and other things). I truly couldn't have written this book without them. My hope is that 25 Stupid Mistakes Dog Owners Make will help to prevent you from making some big mistakes with your own dog (or potential dog). It sets up an ideal for treating your dog as a thinking, feeling, full-fledged member of your family. That's not a difficult ideal to live up to. And if you do, you're bound to gain a lot.

1

Chapter 1 Do Your Homework If you think you're ready to acquire a canine soul mate, one of the best things you can do for your new pet--and for yourself--is to take the time to ask yourself some serious questions, do some research, and acquire the right dog. As a living creature who will share your life for a dozen years or more, a dog should never be purchased on an impulse. No matter how cute that puppy in the window is, or how badly you feel for your colleague's neighbor--who must find a new home for his dog--don't take on responsibility for a new dog without first examining your life to make sure you're ready, then doing research to figure out the right dog for you.

-DON'T ACQUIRE THE WRONG DOG Before you open your heart and home to a specific dog, examine these questions: Are You Ready? A dog is a lifetime commitment. If you bring a dog into your life, please do so with the determination that yours will be the last home this dog will have. Your dog will love you unconditionally. You should love him in return. He does not deserve to be treated as a disposable commodity.

2

Bearing in mind that you may be responsible for this animal for a dozen or more years, look at your lifestyle to determine whether it can accommodate a dog. -Do you have enough money to take good care of a dog, even if he should become ill or injured? -Are you away from your home for twelve hours or more a day? -Do you travel frequently? -Will you be undergoing any foreseeable transitions in your life, which might be difficult if you have a dog? -Do you have enough space in your home for a dog? If you can respond honestly to questions like these and still feel that your life can accommodate a dog, and that you're ready for the commitment, the next step is to start thinking about the type of dog that would best suit you. Are you attracted to large or small dogs? Each has its attributes. Many people (like me) enjoy the presence of a sizable dog. But small dogs have many advantages, too: You can scoop them up if trouble looms, they can hang out on your lap without crushing you, and you can travel with them more easily. Coat considerations are also important. A golden retriever is luxurious to the touch, but staying on top of the dog hair he sheds becomes a big part of your life. Short-coated dogs also shed a lot. Poodles and other minimally shedding breeds generally require time-consuming or expensive grooming. Finally, think about how you want to spend time with your dog. If you're hoping to take him jogging, you'll want an athletic breed. On the other hand, if you're a couch potato, a dog who needs less exercise might be appropriate, although all dogs need a certain amount of exercise (see chapter 9). All these factors should be considered carefully to ensure that you and your dog are the right "fit." Purebred or Mixed Breed? It's an age-old question. Do you spend a lot of money for a purebred dog, or do you roll the dice and adopt a mixed breed? Both purebreds and mutts have their proponents. Because mixed-breed dogs are not bred with close relatives, they are often more stable in terms of health and temperament. They make fabulous pets.

3

When it came time to buy our first dog, my husband and I chose a purebred so that we could have a good idea of what to expect. We selected a breed, the standard poodle, whose temperament seemed to fit ours and whose appearance and size appealed to us. We also wanted a dog that doesn't shed. As novice dog owners, that predictability was important to us. Buying a Purebred Dog If predictability appeals to you, do your homework about breeds. Read books that describe individual breeds. Be honest about your lifestyle. Are you active? Sedentary? Will you be able to give your dog a lot of exercise? All these factors (and many more) will help you to select an appropriate dog. Once you've narrowed things down, go to dog shows to see the breeds that interest you, suggests Chris Walkowicz, a breeder of bearded collies and the author of The Perfect Match: A Dog Buyer's Guide and coauthor of Successful Dog Breeding: The Complete Handbook of Canine Midwifery. When you see a dog in person, you can touch and feel him, Walkowicz says. You can see how big the breed actually gets. If you're at a dog show, you can also get an idea of the breed's grooming needs, and you can speak with breeders, handlers, and others who are knowledgeable about the breed. If you opt for a purebred puppy, you simply must do your research and find a responsible breeder who has screened her dogs for genetic problems and temperament, and who is breeding to further the quality of the breed. (I use the female pronoun because breeders are predominantly female.) That rules out pet shops. Responsible breeders don't sell to pet shops or puppy brokers because they want to be able to choose the buyers for their puppies. A puppy purchased in a pet shop is likely to have come from a commercial puppy producer who breeds without regard for the health or temperament of the parents or puppies. Pet-shop puppies were likely taken away from their mothers too early. They may have been shipped a great distance under frightening (by puppy standards) conditions, and they've generally been kept in cages, with no attempt at house-training. This makes them difficult for their new owners to housetrain, since they've become accustomed to sitting among their own feces. Because purebred dogs can come from limited genetic stock, you should buy from a breeder who has tested her dogs for genetic diseases that could be passed

along to the puppies. Your average backyard breeder who bred her beloved pet so that her kids could witness the miracle of birth hasn't gone to that trouble. If you buy from someone who doesn't test her dogs--no matter how nice the breeder is or how cute the puppies are--you might end up caring for a dog with a heartbreaking genetic disease down the road. Anaclare Evans of Detroit learned this lesson the hard way. Her Bedlington terrier, Farnsie, has an il ness called copper toxicosis, a potentially fatal, hereditary disease. Evans advises others to investigate the genetic status of the parents of any puppy they're considering buying. "I did not do this with Farnsie, and as a result, I have a dog with an incurable but controllable genetic disorder," she says. Here's something important to keep in mind. "Papers," that is, registration with American Kennel Club (AKC), are not a guarantee of quality. The AKC is the first to admit it: The AKC is a registry--and nothing more. Papers from the AKC signify only that the registered puppy was born to registered parents. The AKC relies on breeders to be honest when filling out forms. Registration does not mean the breeder is responsible or that the parents were tested for genetic faults. Papers allow you to compete with your purebred dog in AKC-sponsored sports and activities, as well as to produce AKC-registered puppies. That's it. Screening the Breeder We're not trying to discourage you from buying a purebred dog. But after you settle on a breed (after careful research and self-examination), keep doing your homework to find a responsible breeder. How do you find a responsible breeder? Start by contacting the American Kennel Club, which has a breeder referral service. (Call 900-407-7877, or check out the AKC's Web site at www.akc.org.) But it's up to you to screen any breeders you identify. How will you know the breeder is responsible? "I think more than anything, you should see a relationship between the person and the dogs," says Walkowicz. Does the breeder treat the puppies like creatures or objects? Walkowicz advises you to keep an eye out for the adoring look the dog gives to the breeder when the breeder isn't even paying attention to her. Watch for the breeder to absentmindedly stroke the dogs while talking with you. "Look for unconscious behavior," Walkowicz says. "Because the conscious behavior can be faked."

5

The breeder should not only love her own dogs, but she should also love her breed as well. And that love should be readily apparent. Walkowicz advises looking for subtle things, like the breeder wearing a sweatshirt or earrings that depict the breed. These little details can indicate that the breeder really loves the breed. Other hallmarks of a reputable breeder include tides on their dogs (initials before and after the registered name--ask the breeder what the initials stand for), health guarantees, and a willingness (or insistence) to take back the dog should you have to find a new home for him. A good breeder will also scrutinize you. Don't be surprised if the breeder interviews you more than you interview her. A good breeder is much more interested in ensuring that her beloved puppies are placed in excellent homes than in making the sale. If you visit the breeder, and the breeder doesn't fit these criteria, or you have any hesitation, don't buy the dog. It's difficult to walk away from an adorable puppy, but you want to buy one with a good temperament, one that comes from healthy genetic stock. You want to buy from a breeder who will be there for you if you have questions or concerns as your dog grows up. So don't be afraid to leave empty-handed. If red flags go up, "turn tail and walk out of there," Walkowicz advises. What About a Mixed Breed? Much of the general public believes that if a dog doesn't have a pedigree, there's something wrong with him, says Walkowicz. Even the word mutt, which is short for "muttonhead," is derogatory. Mixed-breed dogs are the second-class citizens of the dog world, says Karen Derrico, author of Unforgettable Mutts: Pure of Heart,Not of Breed. Derrico is out to polish the image of the mixed-breed dog (she cites a more appropriate acronym for the term: Most Unique Totally Terrific dog). "If you polled a group of veterinarians and asked them which dogs are healthier (pure or mixed breeds), I'm pretty sure the majority would say mutts," she says. That's certainly borne out in Sydney Armstrongs family. Armstrong of Raleigh, North Carolina, has two beagles and two mixed-breed dogs. Her beagles have health concerns like dental problems, allergies, and epilepsy, while her mixes are free of ongoing health problems.

6 One of the joys of having a mutt is that she's a unique specimen. "Each has a ' genuine look all their own, and when you get a puppy, you have no idea what that sweet face will look like when full grown," says Penny Bolton of Colchester, Vermont, the enthusiastic owner of Daisy Mae, a Brittany/English springer spaniel mix. But unique looks can be a two-edged sword, says Derrico. If you fall in love with a particular dog, chances are you won't be able to get another one that looks just like him (as the owner of a purebred dog can). "That's why I take lots and lots of pictures of my mutts," Derrico says. (A wealthy couple in Texas is trying to get around this limitation. They're so crazy about their Border collie/husky mix, Missy, that they put up $2.3 million to fund cloning research so that they could get another one just like her.) Another joy of owning a mixed breed is giving a home to a dog that might not readily get one. "My number one reason for having a mixed-breed dog over a purebred is mat they exist in much too great a quantity. Someone has to love them," says Eileen Reidinger of Columbus, Ohio. "A dog is a dog, and there is no reason that my dog must have a designer label. Love comes with or without a pedigree." Mutts aren't necessarily better than purebreds, says Derrico. But, except for being less predictable, they're just as good as purebred dogs, and they deserve loving homes. "Every dog should have an equal chance for a home because they all deserve a chance," she says. Dogs love us regardless of our hair color or the tilt of our ears, she adds. We should do the same for them. Shelter Dogs If you adopt a dog from a shelter, you get the personal satisfaction of saving a life. We have a serious pet overpopulation problem in this country. Hundreds of thousands of dogs are euthanized each month because they lack homes. Many wonderful, adoptable dogs, both mixed breed and purebred, are waiting at the shelter for the perfect home. The background and ancestry of your shelter dog may be a mystery to you, but your future together can be wonderful. The challenge is in selecting your shelter dog. The shelter environment can be so stressful mat it's difficult for a dog to show her true colors. "You do need to be careful with a shelter dog," says dog trainer Pat Miller, author of The Common Sense Approach: Positive Dog Training, who worked in animal shelters for years.

7

Miller thinks that slightly sensitive dogs make great pets. The problem is that these dogs might not show well in a shelter. They won't be the dogs dashing to the front of the kennel run, saying "take me home." The slightly sensitive dogs are sitting in their kennels, looking intimidated. "These dogs don't look good in shelters," she says. "They may be reasonably well-socialized, just sensitive." A good shelter will have a place where you can take the dog so that you can have some time together in a calmer environment. Ideally, you'll be able to take the dog off-leash to see how he reacts. He may be so bold and confident that he'll want nothing to do with you, says Miller. A more sensitive dog will seek your attention. If you have kids, or if your new dog will be around children, Miller advises you to take a child with you to the shelter, so that you can gauge how the dog will do with kids. Due to prior bad experiences, some shelter dogs are afraid of children. Selecting a progressive shelter can make the adoption process easier. "Although you can find a good dog in any shelter, I would steer people toward the more progressive shelters that are doing puppy testing and trying to match people with the proper dog," says Gina Spadafori, syndicated pet-care columnist and author of Dogs forDummies, "Instead of just telling you to go back to the cages and pick out what you want, these shelters do preinter views; they know the animals they have there, and they're doing their best to make sure that what goes out doesn't come back," she says. Progressive shelters offer counseling afterward and give you follow-up support. A shelter dog should be no more an impulse "buy" than a puppy you get from a breeder. It can be difficult for some people to walk out of a shelter empty-handed. If you are one of those people, be sure you've carefully considered adopting a dog before you head for your local shelter. Know that you are ready, and don't take home a particular dog if you're not sure he's the right one. Listen to both your heart and your head. Purebred Rescue Groups Another source for acquiring a purebred dog, usually an adult, is a purebred rescue group. These comprise breeders and lovers of a particular breed who help homeless dogs of that breed. Many responsible breeders participate in rescue as a way to give back to the breed.

8 Rescue dogs have usually spent some time in a foster home for evaluation, so if you acquire one, you can get some information in advance on what she's like. You'll know, for instance, whether she's good with cats or kids, something that's difficult to learn about a shelter dog until you get her home. Rescue dogs don't usually come with pedigrees, so you run the risk of acquiring a purebred with genetic problems. But you're helping a homeless pet in need. Most rescue and shelter dogs have been neutered (or you'll be required to neuter them), so don't consider rescue a source for a breeding animal. (Before you decide that you want to breed, read chapter 20.) Rescue groups will probably screen you as carefully as would a breeder selling you a puppy. Camille Partridge, a breeder of Scottish terriers under the kennel name Gaelforce, for example, uses the same criteria (and the same contract) for adopters of rescue dogs as she does for puppy buyers. If you're interested in an AKC breed, consult the AKC for the name of the breed club's rescue coordinator. Puppy or Adult? Should you acquire a puppy or an adult dog? There are advantages to both. If you get a puppy, you can control her experiences during her formative weeks and months. You can make sure she's well socialized. (See chapter 7 on the importance of socialization.) You also get to accept the blame for any neuroses she develops. Puppies are cute as the dickens. They're also a whole lot of work. They can turn your life upside down. "Getting a puppy is exactly like having a baby," says author Walkowicz. When we acquired Kramer at the age of nine weeks, I took two weeks off from my job. At the end of the first week, my friend-colleague came over to meet the puppy. She says she's never seen the mother of a newborn baby look more exhausted than I did that day. (For advice on raising a puppy, see chapter 2.) With an adult dog, what you see is what you get, says Walkowicz. You know how big your dog will be, how much he sheds, whether he's shy or outgoing. The dog may well be housetrained already (or, if not, he'll be easier to housetrain than a puppy). But when you acquire an adult dog, there's still that question mark about his background--an older animal will come with his own "baggage."

Scout was three when she joined our family, after having been saved by a vet who didn't comply with her owners' wishes to euthanize her after she was hit by a car. She integrated herself seamlessly into our family. When you get a dog, ideally you will keep him for his entire life. But sometimes life gets in the way. What if circumstances beyond your control dictate that you find your dog a new home? That can happen; and if it does, you owe it to your dog to find the best situation for him you possibly can. Chapter 24 offers advice on what to do if you simply must find a new home for your dog. The biggest mistake people make when it comes to getting a dog is that they either get one when they're not ready for a pet, they get the wrong dog for their lifestyle, or they get a dog from a bad source. "You can make the most intelligent breed selection in the world, but if you don't get it from a reputable source, you might just as well have not bodiered," says pet expert Spadafori. "An AKC golden retriever isn't like a Sony video camera. You can't pick the brand and then go shop for the price." If you're considering getting a dog, take your time, and do the research. It's time well spent on a decision that you'll live with for a dozen years or more.

Chapter 2 Start Off on the Right Foot Puppies are undeniably adorable, which is lucky for them, because sometimes their looks are the only thing that keep us from wanting to kill them! A new puppy can wreak havoc on your life. The constant supervision, the housetraining, the little battles over chewed shoes, destroyed furniture, and anything else he can get his little mouth on--it's all exhausting. It needn't be that way, says veterinarian and animal behaviorist Ian Dunbar, Ph.D., MRCVS, author of How to Teach a New Dog Old Tricks and the director of the SIRIUS Puppy Training program. He says that by using three simple techniques (socialization, confinement, and bite-inhibition training), you can keep your puppy out of trouble and retain your sanity. Most importantly, you can help to mold a puppy into a dog who is a joy to live with. DON'T SQUANDER THE FIRST WEEKS WITH YOUR PUPPY The ideal time to bring a puppy home from her mother is at eight weeks. This gives the puppy adequate time with her mother and littermates to learn how to

12

play and to learn that bites hurt! Puppies who are taken from their mothers too early can become problem dogs. The period between the age of eight weeks and three months is your golden opportunity to expose your puppy to a wide variety of people and experiences so that she won't grow up to be a fearful dog. This is called socialization, and it's so important that an entire chapter in this book is devoted to it. But it bears emphasizing that if you have a puppy, socializing her well should be a priority. "If you will do only one thing for your puppy, early socialization is probably the most important step you can take to save your dog's life," says Pat Miller. "Anything you do later can't compare to the value of early socialization. You miss out on those important early weeks if you wait." Dunbar recommends that between eight and twelve weeks, your puppy meet one hundred people. The interaction with those people must be positive and include training, he says. (See chapter 7 for a detailed description of Dunbar's puppy-socialization program.) Dunbar also recommends puppy kindergarten for socializing your puppy to other dogs but notes that kindergarten should be a continuation, not the beginning, of the socialization process. (Many puppy classes don't accept puppies younger than three months.) "You don't take your puppy to puppy class to socialize him; you take him to puppy class to continue socializing an already socialized puppy," Dunbar says. Housetraining Teaching your puppy to go to the bathroom outside is a priority for all dog owners. It requires your diligence, but it's time well spent. Failure to housetrain can have disastrous results. Many animals have landed in shelters because their owners deemed them impossible to housetrain. In his book, How to Teach a New Dog Old Tricks, Dunbar outlines a house-training method that actually helps the puppy to train himself. The beauty of this method is that it doesn't allow for the puppy to make mistakes in the house. If you follow each step, you'll have a housetrained puppy within a few weeks' time, even if (or especially if) you leave the puppy alone while you go to work.

13

When You're Not Home: Long-Term Confinement When you're not home, Dunbar recommends that you place your puppy in a long-term confinement area, like a bathroom or other room that provides little for the puppy to damage. Remove all chewable items, like the shower curtain, rug, and toilet paper. Place these items in the room: a dog bed, a water dish with fresh water, some chew toys stuffed with the puppy's breakfast, and a doggie toilet. The doggie toilet should be placed as far away from the bed as possible, at the diagonally opposite corner of the room. It should be made of the same material (or substrate, as Dunbar calls it) that you want your animal to eliminate on outside. If you want your dog to go to the bathroom on grass, buy a roll of sod and put down a piece in your long-term confinement area. If you expect your dog to go on the sidewalk or patio, bring in thin concrete slabs. "Puppies quickly develop a strong preference for eliminating on the type of substrate they eliminated on when they were young," Dunbar explains. Why a long-term confinement area and not a crate or cage? Dunbar's method does use a crate (more on that a little later), but a young puppy's bladder has about a seventy-five-minute capacity, he says. If you plan to be away for longer than an hour, put the puppy where he can go to the bathroom. If you force him to soil in his crate, you ruin the crate's usefulness as a house-training tool. So when you're away from home, put the puppy in his long-term confinement zone. "This eradicates any mistakes around the house," says Dunbar. "You have an error-free management system." The puppy will naturally want to use his dog toilet, because he'll want to go to the bathroom as far as possible from his bed. "By locking your puppy up all day while you're at work, he's basical y teaching himself to want to do it on grass." When you come home from work, pick up the feces, and change the sod once a week. Dogs don't like to go where feces are, but the urine smell will attract them to urinate there. Using the Crate: Short-Term Confinement The crate, either a wire cage or a plastic airline crate, is a helpful tool for house-training. Many dogs enjoy their crates and continue to use them well after they've

14

been housetrained (see chapter 11). But here we'll take a look at how Dunbar uses a crate in his housetraining system. When you are at home, the crate comes in handy as a nifty housetraining tool. Keep your puppy in the crate (with a yummy chew toy), and let him out every hour on the hour (remember, he has to pee every hour). He'll either chew or nap in there, but as soon as you let him out, there's every chance in the world that he'll have to pee. So open the door, clip on a leash, hustle him outside to the area in which you want him to go to the bathroom, and wait. Within three minutes, he'll doubtless pee, says Dunbar, and in probably one out of two trips, he'll poop. When he does eliminate, praise him, and give him three liver treats. Your dog will quickly learn that eliminating outside gets him treats. The indoor toilet provides only relief, so your dog will use it only out of necessity, when you're not home. The beauty of using the crate is that you can predict when your dog will have to go to the bathroom. "The crate makes housetraining as easy as falling off a log," says Dunbar, "because all you have to do, every time the big hand hits 12, is to let your puppy out, and run him to his outdoor toilet area." He won't pee in the crate if he can help it--that would be counter to his denning instinct. So if you don't force him to pee in the crate by leaving him there too long, you're guaranteed to have something to praise him about when you take him outside. Once you've waited your three minutes, and you know he's empty, then you can bring him back inside to play, without worrying that he'll have an accident. After you're through playing, pop the pup back in the crate for about a half hour, until the beginning of the next hour, when you should let him out again. As your puppy grows and his bladder gets bigger, he will be able to hold his urine longer. When you get home from work, check his indoor toilet. If there are no feces and a blot with a tissue reveals no urine, you're on the right track. Your puppy figures he's better off waiting for you to come home and take him outside to go to the bathroom--that way he'll get treats! After a month without your puppy using his indoor toilet, you can take it away. You'll also expand your puppy's long-term confinement area, room by room. After an initial two months in one room, add another (or perhaps a hall). Add a room each month, until by the time he's ten or twelve months old, your dog has earned complete freedom in your home.

15

An important note: Dunbar points out that it's essential for you to continue to go outside with your dog to his toilet area and reward him for using it. This strengthens his desire to go to the bathroom outside rather than inside. It also allows you to check his feces to make sure he's healthy--and to clean them up. Fresh feces pose little health risk to humans, says Dunbar, but worms have had a chance to hatch in days-old feces, making them much more dangerous to humans. So for hygienic reasons, clean up immediately. This way you'll also avoid the nasty task of the weekly scooping. The Ex-Pen Ex-pens (short for exercise pens) are 2-foot-wide, 4-foot-tall sections of wire panels that you can connect together to form a circle to create pens. Ex-pens can be used to make a larger long-term confinement area, or they can serve as a smaller pen to use as a short-term confinement area, like a bottomless and topless crate. An ex-pen is a great tool for keeping your puppy with the family but out of trouble, says Deborah Wood, a dog trainer and author of The Tao of BowWow. I interviewed Wood just days after a papillon puppy, Pogo, joined her family. "I cannot imagine having this puppy and not having a crate and an ex-pen," Wood told me. "I don't know how I would housetrain him or keep him from committing suicide." Wood, who also wrote Help for Your Shy Dog, says it's important not to isolate a puppy, particularly a shy one. She uses a crate in the bedroom and an ex-pen in the living room. "I like the idea of an ex-pen, because it is bright and light and part of the world." The puppy can join the family but be safe. On-Leash Supervision Dog trainer Andrea Arden, author of Dog-Friendly Dog Training, adds on-leash supervision to long-term confinement and short-term confinement (the crate) as the tools needed to mold a well-behaved puppy. When your puppy is out of his confinement areas and under your supervision, keep her on-leash, she suggests. On-leash supervision can be used in two ways. You can keep the dog at your side, and step on the leash if you need to control him. Or, you can tether the leash to something stable. Some trainers

16

advocate tying the leash to your waist, like an umbilical cord, but Arden says, she's seen dogs develop separation anxiety with that method. "The dog thinks he has to follow the owner around all the time." When your puppy is tethered to a table--while you sit in the room with him--give him something to chew on to occupy his time. This teaches him that he doesn't always have to be active in the house. By using each of these three methods of confinement, your puppy can't get into trouble. "Part of the reason puppies are so exhausting is that if you don't manage them properly, they're always getting into trouble," Arden says. "So a good 70 percent of the time you're with your puppy, you're upset." If you use long-term confinement, short-term confinement, and on-leash supervision-- along with lots of chew toys--you won't spend your time being angry. (It almost makes me want to get a puppy just to try it!) Make Your Puppy a Kong-aholic-Nip (hewing in the Bud The long-term confinement area takes care of another annoying puppy practice: chewing. Dunbar suggests you stock the room with hollow chew toys stuffed with kibble. Hard, hollow, rubber Kong toys work well for this task, as do hollowed-out, sterilized bones. Kong makes toys that stand up to even the toughest chewers, but be sure to inspect them periodicaly to see that no cracks have developed. If they have, replace the toy so that your dog doesn't break it apart and swallow (or choke on) the pieces when you're not home. After you stuff the toy, you can put a plug of peanut butter on the end to hold in the kibble. Feed your puppy's breakfast to him this way. "As he chews, little bits of kibble fall out, thus rewarding him for playing on his chew toys," explains Dunbar. He'll spend a couple of hours chewing on his toy and eating his kibble. Then he'll promptly fall asleep. The result? "Within three to four days, the dog basically becomes a Kong-aholic." He is so focused on his chew toys he doesn't want to chew anything else. "He never gets treats out of the couch or the remote control, like he does out of the Kong," says Dunbar. If your puppy is enjoying a chew toy, not only is he not chewing the couch, but he's also not barking, running around, or getting all worked up because his

[-POOCH POINTER Following is a four-stage bite-inhibition training process from Dunbar's How to Teach an Old Dog New Tricks: STAGE ONE: Play with your puppy in his long-term confinement area. Let him mouth you in playsessions. Whenever it hurts, let him know by saying "ouch!" Stop playing for one minute. If he comesback and mouths you again, yelp again, and leave him. After a minute, call him to you, and if he mouthsyou again, walk away for three minutes. You've taken away his ultimate reward: your attention. STAGE TWO: Don't wait for it to hurt. Whenever he mouths you, even when it's a soft bite, pretend ithurts, and go through the above procedure. Gradually lower your threshold for a yelp, until you'reyelping without any pressure whatsoever. "This way, the puppy learns to be gentle with humans, "saysDunbar. "You've totally taken the force out of the bite." STAGE THREE: Now you're ready to work on the frequency. You get the puppy to stop when you say so. Teach him this by using the "off" request. Hold a treat in your closed fist, say "off," wait for the puppy tomove his nose away from your hand, and then give him the treat. You can use "off" with the mouthing. Say his name, "off," and have him sit. If he sits, he can start mouthing again. When you tire of the game,give him a stuffed Kong to play with. STAGE FOUR: Teach your dog never to bite you, except when you ask him to. Teach him a sequence ofevents, called a "combination command," which must take place before he can mouth you. (This way,you don't risk someone accidentally asking him to bite.) For example, he must be lying down, hear hisname, then hear a ridiculous command (Dunbar uses "kill me"). You can be fairly certain that no one willaccidentally say "kill me" to your dog. Dunbar periodically checks his adult dogs to make sure their bite inhibition is still low. He takes them through the combination command. If there's any pressure, he says "ouch!" ]

18

parents have left him for the day. He learns to enjoy his own company. It's a great way to prevent your puppy from suffering from separation anxiety when you leave your house. Once you've returned from work, have exercised your puppy, and prepared to crate him for a while, put his supper in a chew toy, and give it to him in his crate, suggests Dunbar. He should settle down nicely. Mouthing: Ouch! If you use the confinement and chew-toy tips just mentioned, you will really only be faced with one more annoying puppy habit: mouthing. Puppies have razor-sharp teeth, so you must teach them how hard they can bite before it hurts you. This is called bite inhibition. Other dogs do a great job of telling one another when they've bitten too hard: They yelp (which is one reason puppy kindergarten is so helpful). But its your job to teach your puppy that tender human hands should not be bitten. You do that not by discouraging mouthing but actual y by encouraging it, says Dunbar. The important thing to remember is that you must teach the puppy to inhibit the force of his bite before you teach him to limit its frequency. Many people discourage a puppy the first time he mouths. He learns not to bite them, but he never learns how to soften his bite. If you inhibit the force of his bite when he's a puppy, if he does bite you later in life (should you slam the door on his tail, for example), he won't bite too hard. Otherwise, he might really do some damage. As you raise your puppy, remember that what you teach now will stick with him for a lifetime. If you don't want your dog to mouth you when he's an adult, don't allow him to do it as a puppy (after you've inhibited the bite). The same goes for jumping up on you and other potentially annoying habits. Puppy hood is fleeting--be sure to take advantage of it.

19

Chapter 3 Be Fair If I were a dog, the one thing I mink I'd really miss (besides thumbs) is the ability to control my life. Dogs have so little say over what they get to do. They have to turn to us for everything. In the absence of a dog door, it's the human who decides when the dog goes out or in. The human also decides when and what the dog will eat. And, let's face it, humans expect dogs to bow to our whims. That's just the nature of the human/dog relationship. We lead them. If we don't, and the dog tries to take control, it upsets the balance. (For more on the importance of leadership, see chapter 12.) We're the leaders--but we must be benevolent leaders and set fair rules for our dogs to live by. -DON'T IGNORE YOUR DOG'S NEED FOR STABILITY AND CONSISTENCY If you're like most people, you work away from home. Your dog is alone from nine to five (or longer). With any luck, she enjoys chew toys, and you've left some fun ones for her. Hopefully, she's had a nice walk before work, so she's tired and will sleep while you're gone. But chances are good that just before the time you usually get home, she will wake up and eagerly await your return.

20

Stick to Routine, with Room for Flexibility Dogs have amazing internal clocks. My dogs eat breakfast around 10:15 A.M., about forty-five minutes after we return from our morning walk in the park I'm lucky enough to work from home, so I just stop what I'm doing at about that time and feed them. But if I'm occupied, or if I lose track of time, I can count on my chowhound, Scout, to remind me. And it's almost always right around 10:15. Her reminder starts with an intense stare and maybe a whimper, and if I don't heed either, it turns into an insistent bark. She doesn't appreciate my messing with her schedule. It will be easier on your dog if you can come home from work at roughly the same time every day so he doesn't spend too much time anticipating your arrival. One of the rules you've probably set for your dog is that he has to wait for you to come home and take him out rather than eliminating in the house. It's not fair if your dog has to hold it several extra hours while you go to happy hour with your coworkers. It's a good idea to give an extra key to a trusted neighbor, friend, or professional dog walker, so that in the event you're detained at work, someone will be able to come in and let your dog out. While they do have finely calibrated internal clocks, dogs are also pretty flexible. "I think dogs are among the most adaptable creatures on earth," says pet-care columnist Gina Spadafori. Most people have two set routines-one on weekdays, the other on weekends. "Dogs go effortlessly and fluently between the two," she says. When I travel with my dogs, and their schedules are messed up, it doesn't seem to bother them--they go with the flow. Still, I think it's nice to stick (more or less) to a routine if one has been established. Consider your dog before making major changes. They have so little control over what happens to them that routine can make life feel more stable. If your dog isn't used to a routine, he can be a lot more flexible. Susan Bemus of Flagstaff, Arizona, a responsible owner of eleven dogs (primarily Bernese mountain dogs and Cardigan Welsh corgis), believes that it's best for you to avoid ingraining a routine into your dog's psyche. She and her husband keep their dogs on a loose schedule--feeding within a two-hour range of times, for example. "The dogs begin telling us at 7:00 A.M. and 5:00 P.M. that they think it's time for walks and meals, but they easily accept it if we switch the timing around."

21

The Bemuses don't have a work regimen, and they don't want the dogs to have a routine simply for the sake of having one. "There really is little that is routine about our lives, and it works best for all of us to teach the dogs to be adaptable rather than to create an artificial routine for their sakes. That would just end up putting additional stress on the humans and make it harder for us to devote as much of ourselves to the dogs as we do," she explains. The dogs are willing to wait to go for their walk--and they know that their walk always precedes their meal. The dogs themselves participate in a variety of activities, including conformation, carting, drill team, and therapy work, so their own lives aren't regimented. "It is convenient for us to juggle the dogs' schedule, and the dogs don't seem to mind a bit," says Bemus. The logic in that is apparent, though most people's work schedules don't have a lot of built-in flexibility. The important thing is not to ask too much of your dog or to put her in a position where she's physically uncomfortable waiting for you to arrive. If your schedule is, by necessity, fairly routine, try not to veer from it too much. When you're with your dog, you're her rock, and she can look to you as a source of stability. But if she's home waiting for you, be considerate. Much of what your dog can handle is a result of what she's used to. In other words, if your dog is accustomed to spending nine hours a day alone, she'll be able to handle ten hours more easily than the dog that's only home alone four hours on a typical day. And, of course, remember that dogs are individuals, so one dog might be more flexible than another, just as some humans are more easygoing than others. Be Consistent About Rules When you teach your dog the rules of the household, try to be consistent in enforcing them. It's not fair, for example, to allow your dog to sleep with you one night and shove him off the bed the next. This is a surefire way to confuse your dog. By constantly changing the rules, you undermine your role as his leader. He might decide to start setting the rules himself. Being inconsistent with rules can damage your relationship. Dog trainer Pat Miller points out that being consistent does not mean being punitive. "Be firm, but not forceful," she advises.

22 Dogs discriminate well. In other words, a three-minute down stay in the living room feels different to your dog from a three-minute down stay in the obedience ring. That's why good obedience competitors practice those down stays in a variety of environments before trying them out in competition. You can use that discrimination skill to your advantage if you want to make consistent exceptions to the rules. For example, Barry and I don't allow Kramer and Scout to sleep in our bed with us at home. Two people, two standard poodles, and a queen-size bed is just too crowded. But when we travel, we allow the dogs in bed (we cover the hotel's bedspread with a sheet brought from home). Frequently, hotel rooms have king-size beds (or more than one bed), so there's plenty of room. In spite of this inconsistency, the dogs have never tried to get on the bed when we're at home. They can tell the difference. The same is true for getting on the furniture: They're not allowed on most of the furniture at home--with the exception of a single couch. They don't have a problem with this distinction. Similarly, if we're visiting friends who allow their dogs on the couch, we'll invite Kramer or Scout up. It doesn't mean they think they can sit on all the couches at home. Treat Dogs as Individuals Another disservice we do to our dogs is to expect them to live up to the standards set by are individuals, just as people are. You're probably very different from your siblings despite having a shared biological heritage and upbringing. Even if your new dog is the same breed as your old one, you can't expect the two to behave in the same way. My two standard poodles couldn't be more different from one another. Kramer is cautious, dignified, and rather high-strung. The slightest noise bothers him. You don't have to tell him no twice (with the exception of a few ingrained behaviors). Scout is a bossy, scrappy gal, always looking out for "number one"-- her. You could drop a dictionary next to her head, and she wouldn't jump. The two make a fabulous pair. But it would be supremely unfair for us to expect Scout to live up to the amazing standards Kramer has set. You could leave a piece of chicken on the dining room table, and Kramer would ignore it. Scout would be all over it in a New York minute.

23

Even littermates can be different from one another. Sally Brown of O'Fallon, Illinois, has a Great Pyrenees/Border collie cross, Otis, the result of an accidental breeding. Her parents own Otis's littermate, Josie. Despite the fact that the two dogs look alike, they're completely different. Otis is much more like his Great Pyrenees mother, sweet but slow moving and not necessarily a great problem solver. The family slogan is "Otis doesn't notice." Josie is as sharp as her Border collie father. She figured out how to open latched doors so that she could let herself out to explore her family's large, fenced farmland. She's always busy. Everything about Otis and Josie is different, says Brown, except they both can take unlimited amounts of affection. If you're living with the memory of a beloved dog, don't delude yourself into thinking that you can replace her. Your new dog will doubtless be a marvelous addition to your family. But if you expect her to act just like your prior pet, you're not being fair to the newcomer. You're potentially setting up the new dog for failure and yourself for disappointment. You may well be preventing yourself from appreciating your new dog for her unique virtues. One of the biggest challenges of dog ownership is living up to the standards our dogs set for us. If we were everything that our dogs seem to think we are, we'd be a much better species. Try to live up to your dog's expectations of you. He expects you to be kind to him, to take care of his needs, and to be there for him. Be a stable presence for your dog. You know he'll return the favor many times over.

Chapter 4 He's a Dog! When we integrate our dogs into our family, we have a tendency to treat them like human family members and to expect that they'll behave accordingly. The trouble is, there are fundamental differences between dogs and humans. We do our dogs a disservice when we think of them as little people in fur coats. I'm as guilty of this as anybody. Kramer and Scout are a large part of our little family. They communicate their needs and desires so well. They seem to understand what we tell them, and I sometimes fall into the trap of expecting them to conform to human standards of behavior. - DON'T PLACE UNREALISTIC EXPECTATIONS ON YOUR PET During the summer garbage season in the park, Scout reminds me on a daily basis that she's a dog. Despite my asking her not to, she persists in picking up and eating chicken bones, soiled napkins, and whatever she can get her mouth on. In most other situations, she drops things when I ask her to, but when it's trash, she gets a determined look in her eye, and we have a battle of wills that typically involves my prying open her mouth and extracting the offending item. I get angry. But then I remind myself that she's a dog, doing what dogs do. I can't expect her not to do things that are hardwired into her.

26

Understand a Dog's Nature In her book The Culture Clash, Jean Donaldson writes about the conflict between human expectations of dogs and what dogs really are. They're out to please themselves, she writes. They're scavengers. They're programmed to chase things that run. A comparison of some of the things Donaldson says dogs are and aren't can be useful in figuring out what makes your dog tick. Since they are more interested in pleasing themselves than pleasing you, for example, it's more efficient to train with food rewards than merely with praise. While Donaldson's perspective is valuable, it seems to boil dogs down to a series of responses, ignoring the fact that they are emotional, thinking creatures. I recognize that my dogs are fully formed beings, but I find it useful to remind myself that they're responding to life as dogs, not as humans. I have to admit that I relate to them so much that sometimes I forget they're not human. Understanding what dogs are (and aren't) helps us to work with them. They are motivated by food and access to fun and games. They seek to please themselves, not the handler. Once we accept that, we can train accordingly. Donaldson asserts (as do most of the trainers I interviewed for this book) that dogs respond better to positive reinforcement than to punishment (see chapter 5). By using positive reinforcement, you work with your dog's natural tendency to do things to please herself rather than asking her to refrain from doing things to avoid punishment. Reward the good behavior and ignore the bad. Rather than expecting mere praise to be sufficient, give your dog a payday for performing the behaviors you want. Not only is positive reinforcement a more effective way to train, but it's also more fun for both of you. [Sidebar: -POOCH POINTERS According to Jean Donaldson, dogs are: - self-interested - predators highly social scavengers - amoral (they don't assign moral value to things) Dogs aren't: - abstract thinkers eager to please moral - spiteful - Lassie]

27

Don't Assume Knowledge Another way we can be unfair to our dogs is when we believe they know something, like a command (or a cue, as positive trainers call it), but are just being stubborn by not doing it. Dogs don't generalize well. If your dog breaks his stay--one that was so solid in the house--when you try it at the park, he isn't being stubborn or willful. A stay in the house just isn't the same to him as a stay at the park. Go back a few steps when you're in the park, and ask for a shorter stay, or one where you're closer to him. Or both. The repetition in a variety of settings helps the dog truly grasp the cue. "If your dog doesn't do it, it's because your dog doesn't know it," says Becky Schultz, a dog trainer in Shorewood, Minnesota. "When in doubt, assume your dog doesn't know the behavior. It takes a lot of repetitions." Schultz says her clients tend to think that if they teach their dog a behavior, the dog will know it after only a few repetitions. "They don't understand that dogs learn differently from the way we do." If your dog refuses a request you think he understands, pause, and think about why he might not really understand. Maybe the context is different, or perhaps you're motivating him differently. My dogs sit readily if I stand in front of them in the living room, with the smell of a treat wafting around me. Usually, they sit before I ask them to. But if they're just standing around in the bedroom, and I ask them to sit for no apparent reason, they might blink at me and pause before actually complying. They're not being stubborn. They're taking the time to think, "What's in it for me?" Holding Dogs to a Higher Standard Sometimes it seems that people expect their dogs to exceed human standards of behavior. When you have a good dog, you expect him to be good 100 percent of the time. That's not fair. Humans certainly aren't good 100 percent of the time. Don't ask your dog to put up with everything. For example, don't let a child get in your dog's face, and don't force your dog to interact with someone she's trying to get away from.

28

"It amazes me that we expect our animals to be more tolerant and have more self-control in life than we have," says dog trainer Sarah Wilson, coauthor with Brian Kilcommons of Good Owners, Great Dogs and Childproofing Your Dog. We leave all sorts of temptations out for the four-legged scavengers who share our lives. "It is not kind to leave things where your dog can get them," says Schultz. She would no sooner leave a tasty tidbit out on the coffee table, where her dogs could get them, than she would leave cookies on the counter with her six-year-old daughter around. "We often expect more of our dogs than we do of a six-year-old," she says. Indeed it seems we forgive a lot more of a small child than we do of dogs. The Dark Side of Treating Dogs Like Humans "One of the major causes of death in dogs is people anthropomorphizing," Schultz says. Dog owners misunderstand canine nature, set impossible standards for dogs, and then have them euthanized because of behavioral problems. "We expect them to understand things that they don't," she says. For example, people expect dogs to immediately grasp the concept that they should go to the bathroom outdoors rather than in the house. "If you put a chicken in your living room, you'd expect it to poop." Dogs need to be taught, with patience, about good manners in human society, which can differ so much from canine society. Among canines, for instance, butt sniffing is expected, and poop eating is acceptable. Dogs chew, bite, bark, and poop. These are innate canine behaviors. Such behaviors also get dogs put to sleep, says Schultz. "Some people like the idea of [-POOCH POINTERS SMALL DOGS ARE STILL DOGS Toy dogs, in particular, says Schultz, are often treated as if they're not actually dogs. But they're notstuffed toys; they are living, breathing dogs, with canine nature and needs. It's not fair to deprive yoursmall dog of exercise, a social life with other canines, and training -- things people tend to routinelyprovide to larger dogs. ]

having a dog, but they don't have tolerance for how their dogs act. They don't understand that they are dogs, and that's what dogs do." If you stop expecting your dog to act like a human, you can start enjoying her as a dog. Canines and humans have lived together for thousands of years, but they're separate and unique species. Give your dog credit for being who she is. After all, she loves you for who you are, flaws and all.

Chapter 5 Reward, Don't Punish Most humans' motivation to go to work every day is the paycheck they receive every other week. So why are so many people opposed to paying their dogs to do the things they want them to do? Traditional training is about telling dogs what not to do rather than rewarding them for doing the right thing. Folks who reject the use of food treats insist that praise is reward enough. They seem to prefer the idea that their dog chooses not to misbehave out of fear of the consequences rather than choosing to behave well because they desire the reward. -DON'T USE PHYSICAL CORRECTIONS WITH YOUR DOG Training by punishment is how dog trainers have worked for generations. Some of the most popular books on dog training still promote the method of "correcting" your dog by jerking on his chain collar; they want you to show him that you're the boss (the "alpha" dog) by physically rolling him onto his back and holding him there until he submits to your will. This is no fun, and I can almost guarantee it's no fun for your dog. Moreover, it's dangerous. If you put your dog in an alpha roll, you're giving him a great opportunity to bite you in the face.

32

Punishment Is Less Effective Than You Think Modern, progressive methods of dog training advise rewarding desirable behavior and ignoring that which is undesirable. Dogs are inherently self-involved. They don't do things to please you, says Jean Donaldson in her book The Culture Clash, they're out to please themselves. If they can get you to reward them for their actions, they're likely to repeat them. Why not work with this inclination rather than trying to tell your dog what not to do? There's nothing wrong with rewarding good behavior. One of the problems with punishment as a training method is that it must be used absolutely consistently in order for it to work, says Ian Dunbar, who also wrote Dog Behavior: An Owner's Guide to a Happy Healthy Pet. That's nearly impossible for people to do. We're only human, after all. An owner will miss punishing a behavior at least once, and that's when the light bulb goes on inside the dog's head, and he realizes that he can sometimes get away with bad behavior. "You need to be a very, very good dog trainer to be able to use punishment," says Dunbar. "It is so difficult, and there are so many screwups." Positive reinforcement, on the other hand, works best when it's on a variable schedule of reinforcement. If you reward only occasionally, it's more exciting to the dog, and the good behavior is strengthened. Trainers liken it to a slot machine. We keep putting our coins in, hoping for a big payoff. Part of the excitement is not knowing when the payoff will come. (This is one reason why it's a good idea to use a variety of rewards with dogs, and to have a jackpot reward for excellent behavior.) Just as we're inconsistent with punishment, we sometimes miss rewarding a desirable behavior. But unlike punishment, that works to our advantage. By natural y being inconsistent, we unwittingly put the behavior on a variable schedule of reinforcement and, thus, strengthen the behavior. This is one case where being fallible actually works in your favor! Punishment Has Side Effects "Even when punishment training has been apparently effective in resolving simple behavioral problems, it invariably shakes the dog's confidence and undermines the trusting relationship between trainer and animal, which ultimately

33

destroys the dog's temperament," writes Andrea Arden in Dog-Friendly Dog Training. Your dog may do what you ask, but he'll probably learn to dislike training, and heaven knows, you don't want him to dislike the trainer. In that case, writes Arden, "the owner has won the battle but lost the war." Arden knows from whence she speaks. Like most trainers, she once used traditional training techniques that relied on physical corrections. She's a convert to positive training, as her book amply illustrates. Any aversive techniques she uses are nonphysical. Dogs that are trained with physical corrections frequently become desensitized to the correction, which makes the trainer resort to increasingly harsh corrections. I experienced this firsthand with Kramer, whose traditional training program involved leash corrections, scruff shakes, and even alpha rolls. I hated every second of it. I watched the corrections become progressively less effective. Since switching to more positive methods, corrections are hardly necessary, and when I do use them, they're not nearly as harsh as they once were. (Of course, it helps that I'm now working with an eight-year-old dog rather than an unruly one-year-old.) Manage Bad Behavior If your dog has some bad habits you're having trouble getting him to stop, you can try to manage, rather than solve, the problem. "If you can't get the behavior you want through training, then you really need management," says Deborah Manheim, a dog trainer in Brooklyn, New York. For example, if your dog is a counter-surfer, don't leave stuff on the counter for him to get. If she steals laundry, put away the laundry. If your dog is aggressive, muzzle him. If she jumps on the bed when you're not home (and you don't want her there), close the bedroom door. These are all management techniques. The idea is to not give the dog a chance to misbehave. If you start this as soon as you get your dog, before he learns the unwanted behavior, you're a step ahead of the game. "If you manage your dog 100 percent, you don't need training," Manheim says. Of course, it's hard to manage anything all the time. So training is a good idea. Sometimes you can combine the two. For example, if your dog chews up your stuff when you're not home, you can manage the problem by crating him,

34

or by putting him in a long-term confinement area. At the same time, you can train him while he's in the crate. If you always give him a delicious chew toy-- something that is safe for him to chew when you're not at home, like a stuffed Kong--you're training him to have a good chewing habit. You're also training him to enjoy quiet time. After a while, you may well be able to leave him loose in the house to chew on sanctioned toys and to enjoy quiet time. That way you won't face the unpleasant experience of discovering chewed-up clothing and furniture. All of us manage our dogs all of the time, whether we realize it or not. When we use a leash, we're managing. Rather than training the dog to walk off-leash at a perfect, reliable heel, we leash him to keep him safe. (I'm not suggesting that it's better to train an off-leash heel--no dog is reliable enough to walk down city streets off-leash.) We're also managing our dog when we put him out in the fenced yard rather than train him to stay in the yard (another good idea). One management tool, which Manheim declares "the most important," is exercise. Use it! (See chapter 9 for more information on the importance of exercise.) By tiring out your dog, you keep him out of all sorts of trouble. Management allows you to keep your dog safe and to prevent her from learning undesirable behaviors. It takes some creativity, but it sure beats constantly yelling at your dog, and it makes training a lot easier. Teach Self-Control "Dogs naturally tend to act in the moment," says Arden. "What we want from pets is for them to take a breath, and think." Trouble is, that's not normal dog [Sidebar: -POOCH POINTERS TECHNIQUES FOR MANAGING BAD BEHAVIOR Sometimes it's easier to manage a problem behavior -- and prevent it from occurring -rather than tosolve the problem. Good management techniques include: - removing temptations -confining your dog -exercising your dog - controlling your dog by using a leash - muzzling your aggressive dog

35

behavior. But some simple exercises can be done with your dog to help him learn some self-control. One Arden described--and she credits dog trainer Leslie Nelson for showing it to her--is to put the dog on-leash. Put something delicious on the ground just out of the dog's reach. When he stops straining at the leash to get it, reward him (either with the stuff that was on the ground, or something from your hand). "The dog learns to relax and to not charge for the food," Arden says. Nelson uses the same exercise to teach a stay. Reward Rather Than Punish When I'm in the park, I frequently see dogs who are driving their owners nuts, yet the owners sometimes refuse my offer of help to get their dog to focus on a treat. One particular man has a sweet pit bull who has the bad habit of jumping up and grabbing her leash, trying for a game of tug-of-war when it's time to leash up and go home. I know this dog is motivated by treats. I always have some with me (and she always tries to mooch one), so sometimes I'll ask if I can offer her a treat in exchange for a sit--this calms her so he can put on her leash and walk home. The owner always refuses, claiming that she shouldn't need a treat to behave correctly. Instead, he physically threatens his dog by putting his fist over her head and shaking it until she sits. It puzzles me why he prefers this method to rewarding her with a treat for sitting. The underlying principle of positive training is to reward good behavior and ignore bad behavior. If your dog is doing something wrong, ask him to do something incompatible with the bad behavior, something you can reward. Then reward him for it. For example, if he jumps on you, silently turn your back to him (withdrawing your attention), then turn around, and ask him to sit (a behavior incompatible with jumping up). Reward him for sitting. People seem to believe that dogs should work to please their humans. Dogs are dogs, and they do things to please themselves. So why not make it easy on yourself, and make good things happen to your dog when she does what you want her to?

Chapter 6 You're the Center of His Universe Like children, dogs thrive on love and attention. Imagine giving birth to a child and then rarely interacting with him. You would end up with a lonely, angry child forced to devise ways to amuse himself. Is that the kind of dog you want? -DON'T LEAVE YOUR DOG ALONE DAY AND NIGHT Most dogs are left alone while their owners go to work. It is a lucky few that go to work with them. Others, like my dogs, are fortunate enough to have a mom or dad who works from home. But most spend their days alone. Your coming home from work is one of the highlights of your dog's day. But if you come home, let your dog out, feed her, and then go right back out again to have fun, you are putting your dog on an emotional roller coaster. What she wants, more than anything, is to spend time with you. The wonderful thing about dogs is that they're content to simply be in the presence of their humans. You can watch TV, pay the bills, even talk on the phone, and as long as you're in the same room, or within earshot, your dog will most

38

likely be happy--if she's getting sufficient exercise. If your pet is insufficiently exercised, she might bug you when you're home with her. She'll bring you her toys, maybe bark at you, even do something naughty in a bid to get your attention. Of course, your dog would prefer some intense interaction with you--play, massages, going somewhere, or just talking. But just having you around fulfills a real need for companionship. Dogs Are Social Creatures Wolves live in packs. To dogs, who evolved from wolves, the pack is still very important. They don't care that their pack is human; they just want to be with it. If your dog spends much of his time outdoors, I encourage you to bring him inside. (See chapter 19 for more information on why your dog should live indoors.) But even if he's inside, your dog won't be happy if he's often alone. If you work long hours, maybe a dog isn't the right pet for you. If you find yourself in a position where you've begun working additional hours, think about some alternate ways for your dog to spend the day. If your dog has a good friend, perhaps you could explore the possibility of their spending the day together. That's ideal if the canine friend happens to have a stay-at-home owner. If staying with a friend isn't a possibility, look into doggie day care. In many cities, dogs are taken to a day-care facility where, under close supervision, they're al owed to play with other canines. For working owners of young, energetic dogs, day care can make a world of difference. Pick up your dog at the end of the day, and he's already tuckered out. You're glad to see one another, but you can enjoy quiet time together. If your dog were home alone all day, he'd spend the day snoozing and be ready for action upon your return. Day care is also helpful for dogs with separation anxiety. When her rescue cocker spaniel, Barney, began whining and barking all day (as reported by intolerant neighbors), Linda Weiss of East Lansing, Michigan, started taking Barney to day care at her vet's office. "Day care has been a godsend in several ways," Weiss says. "It has allowed us to stay in our residence. It has desensitized Barney to our leaving, and it has also helped to socialize him with other people and other dogs. It has been such a relief to know that Barney isn't all alone and miserable, and instead is in a safe, caring environment."

39

In Boston, a day-care service offered by a company called the Common Dog actually sends a school bus around to pick up the dogs (the animals are securely belted into the seats) and take them to day care. At the end of the day, the bus brings them home. Another option is a professional dog walker. Dog walking is a big business in New York City, where people commonly work long hours and have long commutes. The dog walker comes in once or twice during the day to take the pet for a walk or to the dog run. Sometimes walkers walk the dogs in groups, giving them an instant social life. One of the interesting side effects of such arrangements is that your dog ends up with a life you don't know about. A friend who used a dog walker would take her dog for walks and be surprised when people she'd never seen before greeted Kate by name. Occasionally, Kate would drag her up to the front door of houses my friend had never visited before. But You're the Important One All these arrangements can be beneficial to dogs who spend their days alone. But they don't substitute for actually spending time with you, the center of your dog's universe. Every day, you should fit in some quality time with your dog, where the two of you can converse, snuggle, and just enjoy being together. Try to spend a little time focusing your attention on your dog rather than patting her absently while you watch TV. Giving her a gentle rub all over will alert you to any lumps or bumps (see chapter 16). Regular brushing or combing will also bring you together and keep your dog healthier (see chapter 18). My husband, Barry, enjoys daily time with Kramer and Scout, when he just lies on the floor with them (separately), strokes them, and talks quietly to them. I don't know what he's telling them, but they all seem to enjoy it. Get Out and About Together The daily, indoor time is important for building and fostering the bond between you and your dog, but it can also be fun to spend time outside with her. There are many activities in which you can include your dog.

40

If you're able to take your dog with you, he'll need to be well behaved (see chapter 12 for more on the importance of training), and you'll need to be well behaved, too (see chapter 8 for some rules you need to follow to ensure that you and your dog are welcome in public). But if your dog is friendly with people, friendly with dogs, and is not so high-strung that he is stressed out among new people, consider some of the following activities: Car Trips Most dogs love riding in the car, and they can be great company, even if no other humans are present. Scout would be the perfect driving companion if only she had thumbs so she could share the driving. (Kramer is hyper stimulated in the car and is actually somewhat of a trial to drive with, so he doesn't get to take as many car trips.) Sixty-seven percent of pet owners surveyed by the American Animal Hospital Association in 1998 said they've traveled with their pets. Ninety-nine percent of those said they travel by car. It's a fun and easy way to spend time with your animal. You don't have to limit yourself to day trips. Many hotels and motels accept dogs. It's wise to plan ahead, so that you don't find yourself in a situation where you and your dog don't have a place to stay. Leaving your dog in the car is not an option: It's too dangerous. If your car were stolen (and I've heard of this happening to dog owners), you'd never forgive yourself. God forbid your dog should accidentally put the car out of gear, and it rolled away. Besides, parked cars aren't climate-controlled. A number of guides provides information on accommodations for dog lovers seeking to travel with their canine buddies. They include: -Canine Adventures: Fun Things To Do With Your Dog by Cynthia D. Miller -On the Road Again with Man's Best Friend (United States) by Dawn and Robert Hab good.

For confirmed travelers who enjoy canine companionship, the newsletter "Dog Gone" (see Recommended Reading) provides reviews of dog-welcome vacation destinations, as well as travel tips. Activities and Competitions Competitions sponsored by the American Kennel Club (AKC) are open to AKC-registered purebred dogs. AKC activities run the gamut, including field trials and agility skills, obedience, conformation, and more. In addition, individual sports have organizations that offer competitions that are open to both purebred and mixed-breed dogs. For example, the North American Dog Agility Council offers agility competitions in which dogs, directed by their handler, run at high speeds through obstacle courses. Competing with your dog in a dog-related sport is an ideal way to spend time with him. It's dog-focused and designed for dogs. Not all canines enjoy competitions, but there are so many different activities that a motivated owner could doubtless find one that suits both dog and human. Your best bet is to take training classes for most of these events before deciding to compete. (See chapter 9 for more information on various dog activities.) Dog Parks Dog parks--areas where dogs are allowed to run and play off-leash--can be a boon to your dog's social life (and your own). They also provide a marvelous opportunity for exercise. Many dog parks, or "dog runs," are fenced areas. If your dog tends to bolt, you'll want to seek a fenced park. Some parks are unfenced but large. If your dog consistently comes when called, such a park can provide vast, open space in which he can run and play [Sidebar: -POOCH POINTER CANINE SPORTS AND ACTIVITIES agility - camping conformation (dog shows) dog park visits field trials fly ball freestyle Frisbee hiking - herding - obedience competitions ]

with other dogs. We go to a park like this nearly every day--I don't know how we'd survive city life without it. At dog parks, you have the chance to meet other dedicated dog owners, which is great. But your priority should be your dog. Keep your eye on her, know her signals, and call her to you if it looks like she might not be getting along with another dog. Always keep her within sight. Avoid the temptation to get lost in conversation. Instead, be an attentive guardian to your dog. Dog Camps What could be more heavenly for you and your dog than to spend a week together focusing on dog-related activities? That's what you can do at several camps around the country. Each offers athletic activities like agility and flyball, as well as outdoor fun and silly contests. Kramer and I attended Camp Gone to the Dogs in Vermont in 1998 and had a great time. Camp offered an extraordinary environment in which dogs always come first. In addition to fun activities, this camp also offers lectures and other opportunities for dog owners to keep learning about how best to provide stewardship for their dogs. (See chapter 21 for more on the importance of continuing to learn and to broaden your horizons as your dog grows up.) The Resources section offers names and addresses of dog camps around the country. [-POOCH POINTERS SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS When you take your dog places, safety should be your number one priority. Always bring plenty of freshwater. Don't leave your animal unattended in the car, particularly in hot or cold weather. Your dogshould wear an ID tag with your cellular phone number on it (and keep your cell phone with you). Or youcan use a paper key tag and Sharpie permanent marker to make a temporary ID tag that includes thetelephone number of your hotel and an emergency backup number. Keep your dog on-leash in unfamiliarplaces, particularly roadside rest areas. The idea of losing a dog away from home is too awful to thinkabout. ]

43 Hiking Taking your dog along with you when you go hiking and backpacking can enhance your enjoyment of the great outdoors. For longer outings, your dog can even be outfitted with a backpack and carry his own supplies. Make sure that your dog is physically fit enough to handle unfamiliar terrain and potentially longer stretches of exercise than he might be accustomed to. A nature hike will be more strenuous than a walk taken on the city sidewalk. Take along plenty of water for your dog. You can bring a collapsible nylon water bowl, a pet canteen, or you can teach your dog to drink right out of the bottle. Time Together Is Worth the Effort If you participate in activities your dog can also enjoy, you have a win-win situation. You and your dog can be together on weekends, and you can still get out. Don't take your dog along if it means that he'll spend all his time in a car or motel room. As we've noted, leaving your dog in the car isn't safe, and he's more alone in the unfamiliar setting of a motel room without you than he is at home. If you're having trouble settling on an activity to share with your dog, the Web site www.dog-play.com offers detailed information on almost every type of dog-related activity. Browse through it, and you might come up with some new ideas. Cynthia Miller's book Canine Adventures: Fun Things To Do With Your Dog is a marvelous resource. It not only describes a wide variety of activities, but it also discusses in detail getting your dog into good physical condition so that she can safely participate in the activities. Whenever you take your dog with you, remember that you're an ambassador for all dog owners. It's amazing what ill will a single irresponsible dog person can create for all dogs. Always clean up after your dog and leave no indication that the two of you were there. Dogs would be welcome in more places if more dog owners acted responsibly. Do your part to make sure that the places you visit with your dog continue to welcome canine travelers.

Chapter 7 Socialize, Socialize, Socialize You want a happy, well-adjusted dog, one who gets along with not only family members and pets but also with visitors, strangers, and other animals. If your dog gets along well with others, you'll take him with you more places, you can spend more time with him, and his life will be a lot more interesting. It's worth the effort. -DON'T ISOLATE YOUR DOG I'll never forget the day I saw an adorable pit bul puppy on-leash at a grocery store parking lot in St. Louis. The tiny puppy was about three months old and cute as a button. I eagerly asked the owner permission to pet him. To my surprise, the woman said no. "I don't allow anyone to handle him but me. I want him to be a guard dog." I was so dumbfounded and upset by her reply that words failed me. Now I wish I had pointed out to her that allowing her puppy to interact with a variety of people would not make him any less protective. Denying him the opportunity to be comfortable around strangers would not only make him less happy but would also make him more likely to bite someone who was not a threat. A pit bull (or any dog) who bites is not a welcome member of society.

46

"It is an absolute catastrophe if a dog isn't socialized to people," says Ian Dunbar. He counts not socializing their dog among the biggest mistakes a dog owner can make. If a dog is not socialized during his early puppy months, he will never be what he could have been, he says. A poorly socialized dog will live an anxious life, afraid of people. "It's not fair to the dog," Dunbar declares. Socializing Puppies If you're contemplating getting a puppy, or have just brought one home, make socializing her your number one priority. "The earlier you start socialization, the stronger the foundation is," says Pat Miller. Dunbar outlines a program for exposing your puppy to a variety of people during his third month (from the time he's eight weeks old until he is three months). Your puppy should meet at least one hundred people during that month. It's not as hard as it sounds, Dunbar says, and it can do wonders for your social life. Those hundred people should include men, women, and children, and those strangers should actually spend some time training the puppy. Dunbar describes his socialization program in detail in How to Teach a New Dog OldTricks, but the highlights include: Twice a week, invite a group of six men to your house for the purposes of socializing and training your puppy. Offer refreshments, but tell them that the goodies don't arrive until after they've practiced these four behaviors with your little puppy: come, sit, lie down, and roll over. They should hand-feed the puppy his supper, using pieces of food to get him to come when called and to lure him into a sit, down, and even roll over. After your puppy has gotten the hang of it over the course of the month (which he will after all this repetition), your guests should put the food out of sight and use hand signals (pantomiming the lure that your puppy's been watching). When the puppy performs, out comes the reward. When your puppy has that down, use the treats as a distraction. One person should hold the food while another gives him a command. The person with the food then goes over to the puppy with a reward. In addition to two groups of six men per week, invite two groups of six women, and have them perform the same activities with your puppy. You'll also

47

need to involve kids--but only one at a time. After all the practice your puppy has under his belt, it should be easy for him to perform these tricks at a child's request. The beauty of this system is that you're basically getting other people to train your puppy for you, says Dunbar. On top of that, your puppy is being exposed to lots of strangers, all of whom are providing a positive experience. The puppy is willingly sitting, lying down, and rol ing over for these folks, proving that he's comfortable with them. Rolling over is particularly important because it gets the puppy to willingly assume a position of deference, even for a stranger or a child. It's also a handy command to use when you need to examine your dog's undercarriage. If your puppy is exposed to a hundred strangers in this way for that important third month, he will be happy and comfortable--and well behaved-- around strangers for the rest of his life. If the idea of inviting one hundred people into your home is a little daunting, try fifty, or twelve. The more people your puppy is exposed to, the better, but any number is better than none. If circumstances prevent you from bringing people in, you can take your puppy out. Common wisdom suggests that you need to protect your puppy from disease before he's vaccinated, but you can get around that by holding him and not letting his feet touch the ground, says Andrea Arden. Go to the park, hold your puppy in your lap, and look friendly. People are almost guaranteed to flock to the dog. Hand them treats to give your puppy and ask them to gently pet the little dog. Having a puppy party at your home is preferable, says Arden, but at least the dog is becoming accustomed to people and starting to like them even more because they're giving him treats. "Whatever you do, don't keep your dog in social isolation," Arden warns. "Anything you can do to avoid that is a step in the right direction." After this month is up, you must continue the socialization process. Since your puppy is comfortable with the world (and since you have all these friends you've had occasion to spend time with lately), take your puppy out on visits and errands. Keep up his socialization so it doesn't slip. Socializing Adult Dogs What if your dog is no longer a puppy? What if you didn't socialize her as a puppy or if you got her as an adult and she doesn't seem well-socialized?

48

All is not lost. If your dog is generally confident, you may be able to turn her around. If she's timid, you probably won't be able to transform her into a bold and confident dog. But you can try to make her more comfortable with her surroundings. Dunbar's "puppy party" method is especially suited for puppies in their critical formative weeks, when they can't be taken out of the house until their immunity to common diseases is developed. It's easier to get an adult dog out to meet [Sidebar: -POOCH POINTERthe benEfits of owning a well-socialized DOG ARE: -You can take her anywhere. -She's confident and comfortable in all situations. -You're more comfortable when your dog is comfortable. -You don't have to worry that your dog will hurt someone -- human or canine. -You can walk down the street with your dog and encounter anyone. ] people and other dogs. However, pay close attention to her signals, and give her only as much exposure to others as she can handle. If your dog has developed fears of specific things, you can start a program of counter conditioning and desensitization, says Pat Miller, by providing her with a lot of positive exposure to the things that scare her. If your dog is afraid of traffic, for instance, take her to an area where she can be near lots of cars, but not so close that she completely freaks out. As cars pass, give her lots and lots of treats. "Treats should rain from the sky," Miller says. It doesn't matter what your dog's doing. She may be barking and lunging at the cars, but keep giving her the treats. "You are not giving her a single treat, you are flooding her with treats," says Miller. "Giving a single treat is rewarding the undesirable behavior, which can be a big mistake." By flooding her with treats, you're trying to change her association with the object of her fear, in this case passing cars. You want your dog to think of traffic not as something scary but rather as the thing that makes you give her delicious treats. Make sure the treat is something wonderful, and use it for this situation only. This approach is called classical conditioning. You can expect some frowns of disapproval from strangers as they watch you reward what looks like bad behavior. These strangers would probably rather see you yelling at your dog for

49

misbehaving. "Be ready to resist that whole social approval for punishing a behavior," Miller says. If you have a fearful dog on your hands, seek professional help in overcoming his fears. Look for someone who employs classical conditioning or other positive methods. Another great source of information on this method is Jean Donaldson's book The Culture Clash, as well as her follow-up book, Dogs Are from Neptune. In these books, Donaldson refers to "an open bar" rather than "treats raining from the sky." But it's the same concept. Dog-Dog Socialization Ian Dunbar thinks it's important to make sure your puppy is more comfortable around people than other dogs. The consequences for a dog who is nasty to people are more severe than for a dog who is nasty to other dogs. Many dogs do not lead lives where they're exposed to a lot of other dogs. But speaking as someone whose dogs come into contact with a lot of other dogs, life is a lot more pleasant if your dog is socialized to other dogs. Having a dog-friendly dog allows you to take him to more places, and also allows you to participate in doggie events, like dog walks and pet expos. Again, it makes life a lot more pleasant for your dog. If he is fearful and/or aggressive with other dogs, he won't have much of a social life. Being around other dogs can be fun for dogs, so don't let your canine miss out on this part of life. If you have a puppy, once your vet tells you he can be around other dogs without risk of getting any diseases, enroll him in puppy kindergarten. Most puppy classes allow social time for the "youngsters." If puppy kindergarten isn't available (or even if it is), you can arrange some play dates for your puppy. Try to give him the opportunity to play with a variety of gentle dogs--different sizes, ages, colors, builds. When your puppy is playing, try not to be overprotective. Puppies yelp to tell other dogs that they've had enough or that they're frightened. Your puppy probably doesn't need you to run interference for him. Try to give the other dog the opportunity to back off. They'll probably recommence their play. Our dogs are tuned in to us. If you're nervous about another dog, yours will sense it and be nervous and defensive--and perhaps protective of you. Remain

50

calm, relaxed, and friendly when meeting new dogs. "Act the way you want your dog to act," says dog trainer Sarah Wilson. As your puppy grows up and becomes an unruly adolescent, he may be less angelic around other dogs. Don't use that as a reason to isolate him. Kelly Skiptunas of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, did just that when her rottweiler, Ruger, hit the teenage rebellion stage. "When he got to the age of about ten months, he went berserk," she recalls, "growling, lunging, and barking at other dogs." Skiptunas mistakenly thought that if she kept him away from other people and other animals, he would calm down on his own. "It didn't happen," she says. So she started a desensitization program, beginning about a hundred yards away from situations that might set him off. "We put him in down or sit stays with attention for a few seconds, and treats and praise. We worked up to a few minutes at a time as the weeks passed." Eventually, Ruger calmed down when he realized he could also get attention by being good, says Skiptunas. "He began to accept new situations at closer and closer range without lunging." Ruger regained his composure and is now even able to hold his cool at a dog show. Socializing your dog is one of the most important things you can do for him. It will make him more comfortable around people and other dogs, which is more fun for him. It will also make you more comfortable. Every bit of effort you put into this socialization process is repaid many times over.

51 Chapter 8 Make Your Dog Welcome in Public As a dog owner, I hate it when I see a beautiful, fenced-in park with a "No Dogs Allowed" sign attached to the fence. My response is always "my dogs aren't going to do any harm. I clean up after them. Why shouldn't we be able to use the park?" But in my heart, I know the answer. It's because dog owners frequently use parks irresponsibly. They let their dogs trample the landscaping, or they allow them to run up to people and scare them. Of course, they also commit the cardinal sin of dog ownership: not cleaning up after their dogs. -DON'T FORGET YOUR OWN MANNERS Even devoted dog owners are disgusted when they see a pile of dog feces. Or worse, when they step in it. For the life of me, I can't understand why some dog

52

owners feel cleaning up after their dogs is not their responsibility. There must be a "it's biodegradable, it'll go away on its own" mind-set at work. But in most urban landscapes, it's seen by many people before it biodegrades. Such carelessness gives all dog owners a bad name. Not picking up dog feces is just one way in which irresponsible owners practice bad manners and make dogs unwelcome. If more dog owners (and their dogs) behaved properly, dogs would be welcome in more places.Americans who visit Europe often marvel at the access dogs have to public places. I don't know if it's because European dogs are better trained or better tolerated. But I suspect it's a combination of the two. If you'd like to see your dog welcome in more places, you can do your part by practicing good manners. Clean Up After Your Dog There's no excuse not to pick up your dog's poop. It's easy, it's the right thing to do, and it's a public health hazard not to. I use the plastic-bag method. I recycle plastic produce or grocery bags, always making sure to have a supply on hand when I'm out with the dogs. When one of them makes a deposit, I simply put my hand in the bag, grab the poop, turn the bag inside out--so that the poop's inside--and tie the top. Then I put it in a public trash can, or take it home to my own outdoor trash container. Some people prefer to carry a pooper scooper, which (I guess) keeps them farther from the poop. In New York City, many people use newspapers to clean up after their dogs, sometimes sliding the newspaper under their dog's butt to catch the deposit. The dog-supply catalogs have other devices you can try. It doesn't matter how you clean it up, just do it! Remember that diseases are carried in feces, so don't let your dog sniff or (ugh) eat any deposits that canines who have left behind with ill-mannered owners. Teach Your Dog Manners When you're out on the street, don't let your dog run up to strangers. Being greeted by a strange dog can frighten people. Keep your dog at your side when

53

you pass a person on the sidewalk. I use treats to keep my dogs focused on me. If your dog tends to jump up on people, by all means put a stop to that practice. (See chapter 12 for more benefits of training.) Your dog should also know how to sit nicely (and stay put) when asked. If you allow your dog to greet a person, he should do it politely. (While crotch sniffing makes perfect sense to him, most humans find it embarrassing.) In addition to respecting other people, respect other dogs. Don't let your dog rush up to another dog who is on-leash. Leashes can make some dogs defensive, and if they can't run away from the object of their fear, they frequently lash out. Always ask the other dog's owner for permission before allowing your dog to greet another one. Control Your Dog You should have control of your dog when you're out in public together. If you're out on the street, it's unsafe and unwise for her to be off-leash. Chances are, it's also illegal. Even if you feel your dog is perfectly trained, and you trust that she won't run off or bolt into the street, you're taking a big risk by walking her off-leash on a city sidewalk. First of all, other people don't know she's perfectly trained, and they might well be scared. You never know when she might surprise you and run after the ultimate temptation--like a squirrel or cat--and dart into the street. It only takes a moment of weakness on your dog's part to have a truly tragic result. Speaking of leashes, teach your dog to walk on a loose leash. You really can't control her well if she's straining at the end of the leash. Some types of equipment, like a head harness or prong collar, can help stem a pulling habit (see chapter 10 for a discussion of equipment), but it's preferable to train you dog to walk on a loose leash rather than rely on a piece of equipment. A positive dog trainer can teach you methods that use food rewards and perhaps a clicker rather than punishment. It's not always easy (depending on your dog), but it's worth the effort. It can turn a walk into a pleasure rather than a chore. If your dog is legally allowed off-leash, like in an off-leash park or out in the country, he should be under voice control. A dog who doesn't come when called needs more training before he's allowed off-leash. One of the most upsetting

54

sights in our large off-leash (and unfenced) park is the dog owner frantically calling her dog's name, with the dog nowhere in sight. Every time I have my dogs at the off-leash park, we make a game of coming when called. While they're otherwise occupied, I wander perhaps 20 feet away, then call them. They come running, because they know there's a tasty morsel waiting. I realize that some dogs are easier to train than others, but I encourage you to practice calling yours regularly (and rewarding him for coming) rather than just in urgent situations. Be Aware of Your Surroundings No matter how courteous you are with your dogs, other users of the sidewalk and parks are often less courteous. Joggers, bicyclists, and in-line skaters can (and do) race up behind you when you're walking your dog, without announcing their approach. From a dog's perspective, that's an invitation to give chase. If you don't know they're coming, you'll find out when your dog lunges after them, and you feel like your arm's being pulled out of its socket. Worse, your dog could pull the leash out of your hand and actually give chase. When I'm walking Kramer and Scout on the street, particularly when we're near the park, I keep my antennae out for these ill-mannered people, fearing that my dogs will be as startled as I, and lunge in fear. I wouldn't blame my dogs for doing that--but I'm certain that the people they're lunging at would. If you hear joggers, skaters, or any other fast-moving people approaching from the front or behind, step out of the way, and ask your dog to sit. I try to focus my dogs' attention on a treat, which usually takes care of any urge to go after the person. Don't Let Your Dog Roam Free To me, this is a given. Letting a dog wander around outdoors alone is no different from letting a toddler out the door and urging her to go visit the neighbors. I realize some people let their dogs roam because it's an effortless way to let them get some exercise. But it's a mistake, for any number of reasons. First of all, your dog might be hit by a car or be hurt by another animal. Second, your dog will doubtless use your neighbors' yards or property as a

55 toilet. Third, your dog might eat something toxic. Fourth, he might be stolen, or taken in by a concerned citizen who assumes he's a stray. Finally, if your dog isn't neutered (which I hope he is), he could be out creating puppies. If your female's in heat, she could be out getting pregnant. Letting your dog run loose is not fair to him. If you don't have a fenced yard, then walk your dog on-leash. If your dog doesn't walk well on-leash, train him. Construct a dog run in your yard if necessary. Just don't let him roam free. Leave Little Environmental Impact-Outdoors or In In New York, there's an ongoing feud between the Parks Department and dog owners. The Parks Department maintains that dogs cause hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of damage to the city parks. I find that hard to believe--dogs use the park year-round, yet the damage seems to take place in the summer, when the fair-weather park users (like the people who barbeque and those who play soccer and other sports) are out in force. But I concede that dogs can create damage, and, as responsible dog owners, it's up to us to minimize that damage. Don't let your dog dig holes in public places. Those holes can be dangerous--you, your dog, or someone else could step in one and be injured. When you walk your dog in your neighborhood, don't let him urinate on your neighbors' lawns. It can burn the grass. Again, clean up any poop. If you travel with your dog and stay in a hotel or motel that welcomes pets, be sure not to leave evidence that a dog stayed there. Bring along your dog's bed or crate to minimize shed hair. If you allow your dog in the bed, cover the bedspread with a sheet or blanket you bring from home. Bring chew toys so that your dog doesn't chew anything in the hotel room, and don't leave him alone in the room if he is prone to barking.

I dream of a paradise in which dogs are well-behaved and welcome everywhere. Actually, a central Florida planned community is being designed specifically for people with pets (it's called "Petville"). But most of us don't live in paradise. If we want to spend more time with our dogs, it's up to us to mind our manners and make sure that our canines mind theirs. Do your part to make your dog welcome, and you'll be helping to make other dogs welcome as well.

57

Chapter 9 A Tired Dog Is a Happy Dog "Help! My dog is driving me crazy!" Dog trainers and behaviorists often hear this plea from a frantic potential client. If your dog constantly gets herself into mischief, chews up your stuff, and bugs you to play, chances are she's under exercised. It's not a great way to live: She drives you nuts, you yell at her, it doesn't help, and everyone's unhappy. -DON'T NEGLECT YOUR DOG'S EXERCISE NEEDS Fortunately, there's an easy cure for an under exercised dog: Tire him out! If your dog is sleeping (which he'll do if he's well-exercised), he can't get into trouble. Pattie Lawler of Bann, Germany, says that exercise is essential for her young English springer spaniel, Charley. "Charley without exercise is like the Tasmanian devil let out of his cage," she says. When under exercised, he barks, digs, and "attacks" household objects (like boxes, his bed, and anything left on the floor) in an effort to get his owner's attention.

58

On the other hand, when Charley has had sufficient exercise, he occupies himself at home by napping, chewing a bone, or quietly playing with a toy. Fifteen Minutes Every Day "Every dog needs at least fifteen minutes a day of vigorous, playful exercise," says Deborah Wood. How vigorous? The equivalent of enough exercise to make you break out into a sweat. Each of your dog's muscles must be exercised. The amount of that exercise varies for each individual dog, so pay attention to your dog's needs. It takes a lot more exercise to tire out a German wirehaired pointer than a pug, for example. "For a Pekingese, a walk to the corner and back might be that fifteen minutes of vigorous exercise," Wood points out. What will regular exercise do for your dog? It'll keep her healthy, for one thing. Exercise is as important for your dog as it is for you--if not more so. Dee Blanco, D.V.M., a holistic vet in private practice in Santa Fe, New Mexico, says that regular exercise in a clean environment is an important preventive health measure for your dog. It'll also keep your dog's weight in check. Being overweight is a common problem in dogs--an estimated 40 to 60 percent of adult dogs in this country are overweight. If your dog has aggressive tendencies, exercise will help let out pent-up emotions and to calm her. It will also help a nervous dog to be more serene. In The Too of Bow Wow, Wood calls regular exercise "the magic elixir." "One of the main reasons animals are turned into shelters is they are not getting enough exercise," she says. It's no coincidence that the majority of dogs you see in a shelter are young adults of large, active breeds or mixes. Wood, who owns tiny papillons, knows firsthand that toy dogs need exercise, too. "People treat toy dogs like stuffed animals," she says. Fortunately, it is fairly easy to give small dogs the exercise they need. You can play a rousing game of fetch with a little dog in your own living room, while you sit in your easy chair and toss a toy [Sidebar:- POOCH POINTER The benefits of exercise are: - good health (for you and your dog) - weight control -fewer behavioral problems - outlet for pent-up emotions - mental stimulation -fun (for you and your dog) ]

59

Pet-care columnist Gina Spadafori advises dog owners to take a holistic approach to behavioral problems. If your dog is exhibiting problem behavior-- like excessive barking, chewing, or digging--don't look for a quick fix to the particular problem (an anti-bark collar, for instance). Instead, look for the source of the problem. Chances are that source is a lack of exercise. "When people come to me looking for solutions to their dog's problem behavior, I always tell them to increase the dog's aerobic exercise and increase the obedience training so that both mind and body are exercised," Spadafori says. Only after that can you start working on limiting the problem behavior. Safety First If your dog's been a couch potato for a while and has perhaps put on weight, don't launch into a major exercise program for her all at once. Ease her into it. You wouldn't roll off the couch, put on your sweats, and run a marathon, right? Pay attention to your dog, and slow down if she gets tired. You might need to start out walking and work your way up to jogging, for example. What about biking? Be careful! While riding with your dog can provide some great exercise, if you're on a bike and ask your dog to jog next to you, it's easy for her to tire without your noticing. Make sure your dog is in excellent condition before you start taking her on bike rides. If you want to bike with your dog, train her to trot next to you. You can leash her to a special bicycle attachment made for that purpose. If you're simply holding the leash in your hand, you're asking for a crash. Envision yourself biking along and your dog catching sight of a squirrel or another dog. You can't control her easily when you're on a bike. So your choice is to let go of the leash if your dog gives chase (which is dangerous for your dog), or to hold tight and lose control of your bike. Neither is an attractive option. Through proper equipment (a bike-leash attachment) and good training, you can avoid these problems. Don't forget that your dog needs water if he's exercising. This is true no matter the season, but it's vital in the summer. I have a great little collapsible nylon water bowl that folds into its own pouch, which attaches to my belt loop. (I got it from Doggone Good, at www.doggone.com.) I carry a small bottle of water, unless I'm going somewhere where there are drinking fountains.

60

During the summer, use some sense, and don't exercise your dog during the heat of the day. Remember, he's wearing a fur coat and walking barefoot on the hot asphalt. Exercise is important but not when it's dangerously hot (or for that matter, dangerously cold). On hot days, try to exercise in the evenings or early mornings, whenever it's cooler. Mental Gymnastics Mental exercise is important for dogs, too. Getting a long run every day is great, but you should chal enge your dog's mind as well. You can play hide and seek with her, teach her tricks, or play games as simple as putting a treat in one hand, holding out your closed fists, and having your dog indicate which hand holds the treat. (Then give it to her!) Take your dog with you when you go places. Be careful not to leave her in a hot car (see chapter 15), but if it's safe for her to come along, by all means, bring her. Letting your dog go places and do things is a great way to provide mental exercise. "Physical exercise is only half the equation," says Wood. "Mental exercise is the other half." Wood trains her dogs in competitive obedience. Other fun sports that occupy the mind as well as the body include tracking (where dogs, using only their noses, follow trails); agility (in which dogs go through an obstacle course); flyball (a relay race in which dogs run a straight course over jumps to reach a special box that releases a tennis ball when they touch it, then they race back over the jumps so the next dog can have his turn); and freestyle (in which dog-and-handler teams perform choreographed routines set to music). There are lots of other activities and sports. Check out www.dog-play.com for an exhaustive list. Look for training facilities or clubs where you can take classes in your area. There, you and your dog can learn--gradually and safely--how to take part in these sports. Backyard Fun If you have a big backyard, you may not feel that you need to supply your dog with extra exercise. But that's not the case. Dogs need the stimulation of interaction with you, and they like to explore their territory. Dogs love to go on regular

61

walks and sniff lampposts to see who's been there before them. I think of it as reading the newspaper (or checking "pee mail"). And I believe it's a vital part of Kramer and Scout's day. It goes without saying (but I'll say it anyway) that when you're exercising your dog outside of your own property, you should clean up after him. That's not to say you shouldn't use your backyard to have fun with your dog. A good old-fashioned game of fetch can wear out your dog while you relax on the deck. Several new commercial devices allow you to throw a ball farther, with less effort. With some of them, you don't even have to pick up the slime-covered ball; the device does it for you. Look for the Go-Frrr ball; the Cool Kong, which is firmly attached to an 18-inch rope for easy throwing (and it floats!); and the Slinger, a tennis-ball slingshot. As of this writing, all were available at SitStay.com, or check a discount pet-supplies catalog. Remember, if you don't provide an outlet for your dog's energy, she'll find one of her own. That might mean she chews the leg of your antique table, shreds books, or plays tug-of-war with your shoelaces--while you're wearing the shoes. We ask a lot of our dogs when we leave them alone all day. Sure, many (including mine) sleep most of the day. But we owe it to them to make that slumber the deserved sleep of the weary, not just something to do to pass the time. Daily outings are, for many dogs, the highlight of their day. Do your dog a favor--concentrate on stretching her muscles and strengthening her mind.

Chapter 10 All the If Right Stuff Visit any pet-supply superstore and you'll see a dazzling array of options. There are as many types of equipment for dogs as there are breeds. New products are being invented every day. All dog owners need to buy certain categories of equipment: collars, leashes, food and water bowls, grooming equipment, toys, and beds. And there's plenty of nonbasic stuff available, including products to help you when you're traveling with your dog, doggie backpacks, training devices, bags to hold treats, and pouches to hold poop bags. When it comes to equipment, one size doesn't fit al . "What you use varies according to your dog and your own comfort. The equipment left over from your last dog may or may not be appropriate for your current dog. Here's a rundown of some of the equipment options available. If you try something that doesn't seem right for your dog, don't hesitate to replace it with an item that might be more appropriate. Frequently, a trainer can help you to decide on the best equipment for your particular dog. -DON'T USE EQUIPMENT THAT'S INAPPROPRIATE FOR YOUR DOG To ensure that I wasn't skewed by my personal preferences for what works for my dogs, I conducted a short survey among a group of owners with a wide variety of

64

dogs about the equipment they use (and the equipment they no longer use). I received three dozen responses, all from experienced folks. The responses helped to influence what I've included in this guide. Basics: Equipment Every Dog Needs Collars and Harnesses Every dog needs to be identified, and the most visible form of identification are collar tags. When your dog's outside, he should wear a collar with ID tags attached (or with ID information sewn or riveted onto the collar). You may, as I do, choose to attach your leash to that collar. We use a flat, nylon collar, with a quick-snap latch (like the type used on fanny packs), which I find more convenient than a buckle. I've never had a problem with these latches breaking, but strong, energetic dogs have been known to break them. A rolled leather col ar is nice as well, since it has soft edges. Ideally, for safety's sake, the collar with tags should be one that is flat so it won't choke your dog. However, if your dog's head is smaller than his neck, he may back out of his collar. A collar does you no good if it doesn't stay on your dog. For dogs like that, a martingale-type collar is the answer. The martingale has a ring on each end, with a loop of material that connects the two rings. The ring for the leash is attached to that loop. If the martingale fits your dog properly, it won't come off, because pulling on the leash tightens the collar slightly. This makes it difficult for dogs to slip out of it. They provide a certain amount of correction when tugged. Some people find that their dogs pull when wearing a flat collar, so they like to attach the leash to a collar or harness that provides a correction to the dog for pulling. (If you train your dog not to pull, a flat collar is sufficient.) The head halter (sold under the brand names Gende Leader, Haiti, and Snoot Loop) is becoming increasingly popular as a humane piece of training equipment. The head halter has a strap that fits over the dog's nose and another that attaches behind his ears. The leash attaches to a ring under the dog's chin. The premise is that where the head goes, the body follows; the head harness allows you to lead your dog's head. The halter also provides gentle pressure that may simulate the mother dog's correction (on the back of the neck and the snout).

65

Susan Beisecker of Hanover, Maryland, uses a Haiti to walk her 150-pound Great Dane, Venus. "The Haiti is a magic instrument," she says. "Venus is a different dog with it on, and it is humane." Pat Miller points out in an article in the June 2000 issue of The Whole Dog Journal that the head halter is not always magic for all dogs. "The head halter is the perfect tool for the right applications, but it is not the easy answer to every dog's leash-walking needs," she writes. Miller says that some dogs simply can't get used to the halter. She and other dog trainers also worry about potential damage to the spine if the halter is misused. Used properly, it's not an issue. ". . . [B]ut if the owner jerks on the head halter or allows the dog to hit the end of the leash at full charge, the halter can snap the dog's head sideways, risking damage to the spine," she writes. If you're interested in a head harness as a more humane alternative to the choke collar, be sure it is fitted properly, and pair it with positive reinforcement for not pulling. Never jerk on it. Prong collars are medieval-looking devices with blunt-edged prongs all the way around. When the leash is pulled tight, the prongs apply uncomfortable pressure to the dog's neck, which usually stops the dog from pulling. Many dog trainers recommend the prong collar as an alternative to the traditional choke chain. Penny Bolton uses a prong collar for her Brittany/English springer spaniel mix, Daisy Mae, who is a confirmed puller. "The prong stops her from pulling and allows us to both enjoy the walk," she says.

Choke chains, or training collars, as their proponents call them, were once a staple in homes with dogs. When pulled, this collar of choice for the traditional jerk-and-praise training method tightens around the dog's neck. The choke chain isn't harmful if used properly--the handler applies a quick-jerk correction to the collar. Unfortunately, it's rarely used properly. A pulling dog apparently gets used to the choking sensation, since he will just pull and pull while making choking sounds. Bolton's dog, Daisy Mae, used to pull on her choke collar until she vomited. With the prong collar, she doesn't pul . Another option for pulling dogs is the traditional body harness, which won't stop your dog from pulling (sled dogs use harnesses, after all), but it won't hurt your pulling dog. A harness is particularly appropriate for dogs that have damaged their trachea by pulling with a collar. That's why Linda Weiss uses a body harness on her cocker spaniel, Barney, whom she adopted when he was five. Barney always wears a collar with an ID tag, but Weiss hooks Barney's leash to the harness. "We don't use a leash on his collar because he has a weakened trachea from his first five years with his other humans, who kept him on a chain. He apparently hit the end of the chain many times. The harness doesn't put any pressure on his neck." Leashes Leashes come in a variety of sizes and colors, but the most commonly used can be boiled down to two types: (1) the 6-foot-and-shorter traditional leash; and (2) the retractable leash. For city walking, most dogs are tethered to a leather or nylon leash 6 feet or less in length. They're great for maintaining control of your dog. Leather is easier on the hands than nylon, though nylon is less expensive. Nylon also has the advantage of being colorful: you can have collar-and-leash "outfits" for your dog, if you so desire. Holly Kruse of Lexington, Kentucky, prefers a leather lead for walking her Irish setters. "I love a soft, weathered leather leash," she says. "Nylon leashes are too slippery and too hard on my hands when I'm walking three rambunctious setters together for a couple of miles in the city." The downside to the 6-foot leash is that your dog can't get much exercise on it. In an ideal world, you'll use the 6-foot leash to walk your dog to an area where it is safe for him to run around off-leash.

67 The retractable leash (the most popular brand of retractable leash is the German-made Flexi) is the leash of choice for those who want their dogs to be able to get a lot of on-leash exercise. Retractable leashes, for the most part, are actually cords rather than straps. The first 15 inches or so of a Flexi leash (the end nearest the collar) are made of a wider strap, but the rest of the leash is a cord. Constant tension on that cord allows it to wind around itself, like a fishing line, inside the leash's bulky plastic handle. If you don't touch the thumb brake on the handle, your dog can walk any distance from you--to the end of the leash--without any slack leash getting in the way. Flexi leashes come in 16-and 26-foot lengths. I use a retractable leash with Kramer and Scout. If I'd brought them up in New York, I probably wouldn't have gone with this type, but we moved here after both had become accustomed to them in St. Louis, where al their exercise was on-leash. Retractable leads seem to garner strong opinions: You either love them or you hate them. I can see the flaws in the retractable leash: They apply constant pressure to the dog's neck and can encourage pulling. Kramer's almost always at the end of the leash, but he's not pulling. Scout usually lags behind, sniffing, so the tension doesn't seem to affect her. The cord is dangerous if you get it wrapped around your legs. I've had my bare legs ripped to shreds by it. The handle is bulky, and it can be challenging to hold two in one hand. But the freedom retractable leashes allow the dog is great. It's hard to go back to a shorter lead. Plus, not having to deal with stepping around slack lead is also convenient. Bowls I used to use plastic bowls for my dogs' food and water. Then I read in The Whole Dog Journal that plastic bowls can contain cancer-causing substances, like formaldehyde, chlorine, and certain resins. That's particularly problematic if you heat the bowl or add hot water to the food. Ceramic bowls are fine, as long as the glaze is nontoxic. Your safest bet is to buy ceramic bowls that are made in the United States. Stainless-steel bowls are also a good choice, because bacteria doesn't accumulate in them. They clean easily, and you can pop them into the dishwasher.

Grooming Equipment The grooming equipment you'll need depends upon your dog's coat. (See chapter 18 for more information on the importance of grooming.) But at the bare minimum, you'll need a brush of some sort, toenail clippers, and shampoo. Chances are you'll need a lot more than that! Check with your breeder or a professional groomer to find out about the right grooming equipment for your type of dog--and how to use it. Crates and Ex-Pens A crate is a great thing. Nearly every one of the respondents to my survey uses and endorses them. (See chapter 11 for more information on crating your dog.) Whether you get a plastic Vari-Kennel-type crate or a wire one depends upon your dog and your own sensibilities. Whichever you get, make sure it's high quality, since you'll be using it for many years. This is particularly important if you're planning to fly your dog in his crate (in which case, you'll have to use a plastic crate). It's essential that a crate that's flown can withstand lots of handling. Ex-pens (short for exercise pens) are 4-foot-high, 2-foot-wide panels of wire fencing that attach to one another. Ex-pens can be used to create a long-term confinement area when you're housetraining a dog or before he's given freedom of the house. They also make a swell puppy playpen for when you're home with your puppy. "Ex-pens are great," says Andrea Arden. "I don't think enough people know about them." (See chapter 2 for more information on using ex-pens with puppies.) Ex-pens are particularly helpful for people with multiple dogs. You can take more than one dog to a class or the park to train. Use an ex-pen as a holding area for the other dogs, while you work with a particular dog. "I don't know how I lived without my ex-pen!" says Ann Daugherty of Reno, Nevada. "I use an ex-pen at home, when I need to separate my dogs for some reason. I take one to the park to practice obedience: one dog out working, the other waiting in the ex-pen in the shade." This chapter covers the absolute basics. Your dog will also need toys and a bed--and she'll doubdess help you decide about those items. Just be careful

69

when introducing a new toy or bed. Watch your dog with it to make sure she doesn't tear it up, trying to consume small pieces that could choke her or create an obstruction. If you're like me, you'll start collecting dog stuff just for the fun of it. By the time your dog's a senior citizen, you'll have an amazing collection. The Resources section lists some discount catalogs for bargains and specialty Web sites where you can find unusual items.

Chapter 11 Give Him a Den to Gall His Own Though it may look like a cage to you, a crate--either the wire or plastic type airlines use to ship dogs--can be a co2y haven for your dog. A crate has a multitude of uses: It's instrumental in housetraining, it keeps a young dog out of harm's way, and its a place where your dog can go to get away from it all. Dogs--like their wolf and fox cousins--are, after all, den animals. But a crate can also be misused. Leaving a dog in a crate so long that she soils in it is cruel, since a dog's natural instinct is to not soil where she sleeps. Using time in the crate as punishment is unwise--you jeopardize your dog's pleasant associations with the crate. You want your dog to see it as the happy, safe place it can be. -DON'T MISTAKE CONFINEMENT FOR IMPRISONMENT "People totally misunderstand confinement," says Ian Dunbar. "They look on confinement as a prison, and they just don't understand how you use a crate, for example, to housetrain a dog." Used properly, a crate can be a key part of house-

72

training. Dunbar's housetraining method, which uses a crate as well as a long-term confinement area (like a bathroom), is discussed in chapter 2. When we first brought Kramer home as a puppy, I didn't like the idea of a crate. I searched high and low for a book that didn't advocate crating. It took a while, but I found one. (I should have been less bullheaded and considered why the majority of dog-care books advised using crates.) In the first week with our new puppy, we made little progress with house-training--and we had a little monster on our hands. We had to watch him constantly, except when he was asleep. We kept him in a bathroom when we weren't home and, of course, he urinated on the floor. Just as important, we had nowhere to put him when he would go through the puppy crazies and needed a time-out. At the end of that exasperating week, we borrowed a crate. It made a world of difference. We confined Kramer in the crate for short periods during the day, and promptly took him outside when he got out. We were well on our way to having a housetrained puppy by the time we went back to work, three weeks after he joined our family. And I worked close enough from home to be able to stop in during the day to let him out. Andrea Arden likens a crate to a playpen used for children. "It is exactly the same concept as a playpen or crib. The only difference is a lid on the crate," she says. Introducing the Crate Some dogs take to crates like a fish to water. Others don't. In our household, Kramer's always been fine in his crate. Scout, who came to us when she was three, just hates it. Even if your dog doesn't seem to care for being in a crate, it's to your advantage to put in the effort to get her used to it. I wish I had: I wouldn't have to worry about leaving Scout at the vet or the groomer, and I could take both dogs to training class and crate the one who's not being worked. It's up to you to make the crate a pleasant place for your dog. Give her something to do in there, like chewing on a hollow rubber toy stuffed with food and treats. Putting your dog in her crate should be the doggie equivalent of parking a child in front of Nintendo. If your dog puts up a fuss about being in a crate, it's a good idea to feed her inside of it. Ian Dunbar recommends breaking up the meals and serving several a day. Start by tossing a few pieces of kibble into the crate. Your dog will

73

probably go in to get it, and then come right out again. After three or four sessions like this, toss in some kibble, then shut the door when she goes in. Immediately feed her some more kibble through the bars. Let her out, and ignore her for a few minutes. Try it again, and then ignore her for a little longer. Next time, put your dog in the crate with a stuffed Kong. What you've accomplished is teaching your dog that she gets attention, toys, and food when she's in the crate. That should help to make the association pleasant. Some dogs are fine in their crates while they're eating but put up a fuss when they've finished. Others just don't like being alone. Ann Daugherty, who has several Samoyeds, taught her puppy Gracie not to fuss this way: She put Gracie in her crate, then sat on the bed next to the crate. When Gracie was quiet, Daugherty reached for the door. As soon as the puppy barked, whined, or jumped at the door, Daugherty pulled her hand away and moved farther from the crate. She'd leave the room with Gracie in the crate (over her protestations), and reenter when the dog was quiet. As soon as Gracie started to bark, Daugherty left the room again. "Gradually, she was quiet longer, and I could walk across the room to open her door," recalls Daugherty. "It took her a while to get it, but she did figure it out, and now will firmly plant her little white butt and quietly wait for me." The (rate in Housetraining The main benefit of using a crate in housetraining is that as den animals, dogs instinctively don't like to soil where they sleep. So if you crate them, they'll hold it as long as they can. It's up to you to make sure you're not asking them to hold it too long. Dunbar says that an eight-week-old puppy has the capacity to hold his urine for only seventy-five minutes. That's why the long-term confinement area is so important. When you let your dog out of the crate, she'll almost certainly need to pee. Here's your opportunity to hustle her outside and have her pee in the appropriate area. Then you can give her treats. She learns quickly that delicious treats appear when she pees outside. Kelly Graham of Mayfield, Ohio, who has nine greyhounds and a whippet, is a proponent of crate training. She crates certain dogs when she's not home, as well as feeds her dogs in their crates. "Crates keep dogs safe," she says. Not only do they keep dogs safe from one another and from household hazards, but they also keep the household safe from dogs, Graham points out.

74

[-POOCH POINTER CRATE DOS AND DON'TS Do keep the crate in your bedroom. Dogs like to sleep with their human pack members. If you isolateyour dog in another room, she may cry out of loneliness. Do have a household rule that your dog is not to be disturbed in his crate. This provides him with aprecious, safe haven from household stresses, particularly kids and visitors. Do teach your dog to be comfortable in her crate when you are at home. Ginny Debbink of Long Valley,New Jersey, wishes she'd done this. "My dogs will willingly go into their crates, but they're deeply insultedif they are expected to stay there once they realize I'm still in the house, "she says. This becomes an issuewhen you have to let workers who aren't dog-friendly come into the house. Give your dog time in thecrate (with suitable recreation) while you're at home. Don't use the crate as punishment. It should be a happy place for your dog, so don't toss him in there if hemisbehaves. Don't leave your dog in the crate too long. If you plan to be away for more than a couple of hours (ormore than an hour, if you have a tiny puppy), use the long-term confinement area. You ruin the crate as ahousetraining device if you force your dog to eliminate in it. (See chapter 2 for more information.)Don't reinforce your dog's negative behavior in the crate. Ignore her if she's complaining. The worst thingyou can do is to tolerate whining and crying, and then finally give in by paying her some attention. If youdo that, you've taught her that if she carries on long enough, she'll eventually get your attention. ]

75

Traveling If your dog is accustomed to a crate, you can take her wherever you go. If you stay with your dog in a motel and you leave her for short periods of time, you can leave her in her crate without worrying about a hotel worker accidentally letting her loose. If your car can accommodate a crate, your dog will travel more safely than if she is loose. Be sure to tie down the crate so that in the event of an accident it doesn't become a heavy missile. If you take your dog somewhere that requires air travel and your dog is too large to fit in a bag under the seat in front of you, she will have to travel in an airline-approved crate in the cargo hold. As nerve-racking as that surely is for both dog and owner, it must be easier on a dog who is accustomed to spending time in a crate. Feeding In multi dog households, crates can be a great way to separate your dogs while they eat. Feeding dogs too near one another can be asking for trouble. Even if your dogs get along famously, fights can erupt pretty quickly over a dropped morsel. Feeding them separately also prevents one dog from stealing another's food. Crates are an easy way to separate your dogs at feeding time. Doing so also fosters a positive association with the crate. Illness and Injury If your dog needs to spend time at the vet's office without you, it will be easier on her if she's crate-trained. A pet hospital will appreciate a properly crate-trained dog when that dog has to spend several days there. Once your dog is home, she might require crate rest. That was the case with Scout when she joined our family. She came to us with a broken leg, and for safety's sake, and to keep her from getting boisterous with Kramer, we crated her when we weren't at home. She never grew to love the crate (and I wasn't as savvy about ways to get her to enjoy it). My life (and hers) would have been much more pleasant if I'd taken the time to crate-train her.

76

Wire or Plastic? Choosing a plastic airline crate (typically known as a Vari-Kennel for its most prominent manufacturer) or a wire crate is a matter of personal preference. The Vari-Kennel is more den like, while wire allows your dog to be more aware of his surroundings--which can be good or bad, depending on your dog. Wire crates have the advantage of being roomier. Unlike the plastic crates, their interior dimensions are very close to the exterior dimensions. The Vari-Kennel, for example, has a deep lip on the front and a smal er lip around its perimeter, which subtracts inches from the interior. However, plastic crates are much lighter and therefore easier to clean. They're also quieter (though by no means silent) when the dog moves around inside. That crate we were so reluctant to use when Kramer was a puppy has turned into one of his favorite places. We chose the plastic kind, and we've had to remove the door for lack of space. On his own, Kramer goes into his crate to sleep at least once a day. It may not be the most attractive piece of furniture we own (though it does provides a nice surface for storing stuff), but it's one of the most important.

77

Chapter 12 Be the Leader The concept of total equality is a human ideal. People aspire to relationships in which both parties are treated equally, but dogs just aren't like that. Their ancestors, wolves, lived in packs, and within the pack is a strict hierarchy. There's the big kahuna, the leader, and below him, each member of the pack has a position. When there's dissension, it's frequently a struggle over rank. You and your family are your dog's pack. You don't want that kind of struggle occurring in your home. -DON'T SET UP POWER STRUGGLES Your dog expects there to be a leader of the pack. Many dogs are perfectly happy to be led, but if there isn't a clear leader, they may feel the need to pick up the slack. "Dogs need a leader in order to be comfortable," says Myrna Milani, D.V.M., and author of Dog Smart, who has a private consulting practice that deals with bond/behavior issues. "If the owner doesn't communicate that he is in charge, the dog has no choice but to assume leadership." Being your dog's leader doesn't mean you have to buy into the old-fashioned practice of the alpha roll, where you're advised to physically turn your dog over onto his back and pin him there to prove you're the boss. You can be a leader without being forceful, says dog trainer Pat Miller. "I believe in a policy of benevolent leadership, as opposed to intimidating or dictatorial leadership," she says.

78

Miller points out that the old model of physical domination over your dog, which was purportedly based on how wolves interact, is faulty on two counts. First, a pack's true alpha dog does not throw his weight around. He is respected and therefore goes unchallenged by the other dogs. "A good canine pack leader doesn't run around roughing up his pack mates," says Miller. The second misconception about alpha dogs is that they put other dogs down on their backs (which is what the alpha roll is supposed to simulate). In reality, a dog who feels intimidated by another dog willingly rolls on his back to show submission. The intimidator doesn't physically force him into that position. So the role of the benevolent dictator is, in fact, the one that mimics wild canines. If you're the benevolent dictator over your dog--that is, you control his behavior and not the other way around--both of you will be happier. Establishing Hierarchy Through Leadership Exercises Establishing leadership with your dog is not difficult. By performing some simple exercises every day, you can remind your dog that you're the pack leader. The basic idea behind being your dog's leader is that she should look to you for what she needs, and she should earn what you give her. Basic tenets of the program include no free feeding (she should be fed at times you determine), and no free treats. Ask her to sit, or do something else before you reward her. One of Miller's favorite leadership tricks is the "wait-at-the-door" exercise. The doorway provides a useful tool for working with your dog, because he goes in and out of the door so often each day. This offers the opportunity to remind your dog to do what you ask, Miller says. Before you open the door to let your dog outside, have her sit and wait. Or, if you prefer, have her lie down and wait. Open the door, then release your dog. Miller has four dogs, so she'll frequently release them one at a time, in varying order. What does she do if one of her dogs exits the door without waiting? "I invite her back in and have her wait again, and then she's the last one to go out," she says. She doesn't yell, and she doesn't grab or physically restrain her dog. Miller frequently uses food rewards in training, but with the wait-at-the-door exercise, she says, a food reward isn't necessary. Being allowed to run out the door is the reward--it's what Miller calls a "life reward."

79

Your dog doesn't have to wait for you to go through the door first; he just needs to wait for you to tell him it's okay. "For a long time, there's been a myth that leaders always go through the door first," says Miller. "I don't believe that." By waiting at an open door for permission, your dog gets the message that you're the leader. Another exercise is calling your dog frequently when he's out in the yard. If your dog's off playing, call him, and then reward him with a food treat when he comes to you. This constantly reminds him that coming back to you when you ask him to is a good thing, Miller says. I use this recall practice frequently with my dogs when we're at the off-leash park. I always have treats at the ready, and my dogs come reliably--with joy on their faces. It's one of the most rewarding things I've done in training them. A Lack of Leadership (an Result in Aggression The majority of Milani's consulting practice as a veterinary ethologist involves aggressive dogs. In most cases, the aggression results from the relationship between owner and dog. "Hands down, across the board, the biggest mistake owners make is that they, knowingly or unknowingly, relate to their dogs as littermates rather than as a good bitch to a pup," she says. If you act like a good bitch--that is, like a benevolent leader--the question of who is in charge does not come up and there is no reason for a power struggle. If, at the outset of your relationship with your dog, you establish yourself as the benevolent dictator, then you will likely preempt a host of potential behavioral problems. If you're already having some problems with your dog, then starting some of these exercises now may help. Being a dog's leader is more effortless for some people/dog pairs than for others. You might naturally fall into a relationship with your dog in which you are the leader. But if you're not a born leader and your dog has ambitions for leadership, you may be in for some problems. "Depending on the dog, leadership sometimes needs to be a more focused effort," Miller says. If your dog wants to be the leader, he tends to be in greater control of the relationship than is healthy, she says. But even if your dog doesn't really want to be the leader, it can be problematic if you abdicate your leadership role. "Sometimes it just causes confusion in the relationship rather than does real, serious harm,"

80

Miller says. "The dog tends not to be under control but isn't doing things that are dangerous." However, in the absence of your leadership, there's always the chance that even a timid dog will decide that his job is to protect you--which could become dangerous to other people. All he really needs is your reassurance that you're in charge of allowing people into the house. Dogs who really want to be the leader (some people call these dogs "dominant") can indeed be dangerous if they're allowed to take over. If you're experiencing severe behavioral problems with your dog, particularly if he is acting aggressively, or you feel in any way threatened by him, seek professional help. An animal behaviorist or a highly skilled dog trainer should be able to assist you. A dog's behavior is a reflection of the relationship between the dog and the owner, says Milani. "Trying to change the behavior without changing the relationship is like trying to change the mirror because you don't like what you see in it," she says. Finding Help If you feel you must hire a behaviorist or trainer--a smart move if your dog is trying to take over as leader--find one whose methods you are comfortable with. Trust your instincts: If the expert asks you to do something to your dog that doesn't feel right, look elsewhere. If your dog seeks a higher rank than you, then using old-fashioned, force-based leadership methods could truly backfire. For example, you might be bitten if you try to force a dog into an alpha roll. If your dog bites you, many of the experts who recommended the alpha roll in the first place would now recommend that you euthanize your aggressive dog. Miller recalls a client's dog, a five-month-old English setter, that perfectly illustrates the contrast between benevolent leadership and force-based leadership. This young dog is a real gentleman, says Miller. But as a confident, self-contained dog, he objected to the force-based methods that his owner was trying to use in order to get him to behave at the groomer's and the veterinary hospital. On the advice of the groomer, vet, and breeder, the owner was physically placing and holding the dog down on the grooming table in a battle of wills. The animal-care professionals told her that she must physically fight it out with her dog--and that she had to win.

81

The client was considering euthanizing the young setter because people were telling her that he would become dangerous. Miller agreed that if she had continued to use the force-based methods, there was a good chance the dog would indeed bite this owner. But Miller demonstrated that the forceful methods weren't necessary. She began working with the dog, using a clicker (a small box that makes a sharp click when pressed). Here, the trainer rewards behavior by first identifying it with a click, then following up the click with a reward (usually a food treat). Soon, the dog begins to offer behaviors in order to get a click. This dog took to clicker training like a fish to water, as did his owner. In about an hour's time, the dog was willingly jumping onto (and staying on) the grooming table. He was under control. Miller sent the client home with some leadership exercises and instructions on clicker training, and is confident the two will have a great relationship. Another reason to be wary of force-based training or leadership techniques, is that some dogs are branded dominant when their aggression actually stems from fear and self-protection. It's important not to use harsh methods with these dogs, since such practices will only make a fearful dog more frightened. That's why it's so important to follow your gut and to seek professionals who use positive, humane training methods. The Importance of Training and Leadership Training is a critical part of establishing leadership with your dog, Miller says. To let your dog know that you're his leader, you must open the lines of communication. If your dog pays you no mind, you're certainly not leading him. A great way to "communicate" with your dog is through continuous training. (See chapter 12 for more about training.) "If you and your dog know how to communicate with each other, there is a greater level of respect on both sides," says Miller. Training doesn't take place in the classroom alone. "Every time you interact with your dog, it's a training opportunity," she says. "And a training opportunity is a leadership opportunity." When you interact with your dog on a walk, you're training him. You may not be asking him to do specific things, and you may not even be offering food

82

rewards, or clicking your clicker when you get the desired behavior, but you're letting him know what behaviors you like. You're training him for real life. Because many dog owners are forced to spend so much time away from their dog, their relationship is plagued by guilt, says Milani. Like absentee parents who have custody of their children only on weekends, the dog owner doesn't want the time he does get to spend with his dog to be full of training, limit setting, or leadership exercises. Many people want to be a best friend to their dog rather than a parent. This doesn't work any better in human-dog relationships than it does in parent-child relationships. Be your dog's leader. He'll thank you for it.

Chapter 13 Reinforce Good Behavior Dog training. For some people, the phrase conjures up images of dogs and people repetitively practicing boring exercises. Some folks think dog-training classes teach dogs a bunch of skills they'll never need in real life. Others think obedience classes are only for those who want to compete with their dogs in the obedience ring. Training has evolved in recent years. If you find the right trainer, who uses the more modern methods, you'll be using positive reinforcement, food, and other rewards to get your dog to choose to do what you want rather than using force to get him to yield to your wishes. And not only is dog training fun nowadays, it is absolutely essential if you want your dog--large or small--to be a valued member of your family. -DON'T UNDERESTIMATE THE VALUE Of TRAINING "I think that dog training has a bad image," says Andrea Arden. "Part of the reason people avoid training is that they think, with training, the dog becomes a robot and has no will of his own. That's not the truth. Training is actually fun."

84

Training can turn a canine terrorist into a well-mannered dog. It gives you the tools--the common language--to help shape your dog's behavior. Training won't change your dog's personality. But if he's naturally a mischief maker, it might help you to channel that energy a little more productively. What Good Dogs Should Know As we discussed in chapter 4, dogs are dogs. On a daily basis we ask them to go against their hardwired instincts in order to fit into our society. It's important not to deny your dog her doggie nature. So the next time your dog does something that inconveniences you or makes you mad (for instance, rolling in something stinky), remind yourself that she's a dog and what she's doing is natural. You can, however, help to avoid certain problems by teaching your dog basic manners and doing what trainers call "training an incompatible behavior." The more things she'll do when you ask her, the more opportunities you have to keep her out of trouble. The six basic skil s every dog should learn are: -sit -look at me -come when called -down -stay -walk nicely on a leash "Sit" "Sit" will help you to manage your dog in almost any situation. For example, if your dog greets your guests by jumping on them, you can ask her to do something she can't possibly do while jumping up, like sitting. Don't let your guests give her any attention (positive or negative) until she sits. If her excitement level is too high and she just can't contain herself long enough to sit, you can help her by attaching a leash to her collar or head halter; ask her to sit before you answer the door, and then stand on the leash to keep your dog from breaking her sit.

85

"Look at He" How can this command possibly keep a dog out of trouble? If you train your dog to look at your face when you request it (by saying "look at me," "cookie," the dog's name, or whatever word or phrase suits you), you can divert her attention from things--like other dogs--that might cause her to misbehave. "Look at me" also teaches your dog to pay attention to you. At any moment, you might say out of the blue, "look at me" and all your dog has to do is to comply to get a treat. This provides great motivation for your dog to perk up her ears when you speak to her. "It all begins with attention," Arden says, "because if you don't have a dog that gives you any consideration, you can't train any of the other stuff anyway." Your attention word should be something other than your dog's name, she advises. "People tend to wear out the dog's name." I know I say my dogs' names all the time. I wouldn't want to have to reward them each time. The key to this attention game is to associate good things with your attention word or phrase. Say "look at me," or another word or phrase (Arden uses "treat"), and when your dog complies, give her a treat, or a bal , or take her for a walk. "Always associate that word with something good," Arden says. Coming when called (which trainers term a recall) is an important skill all dogs should learn to perform reliably. If you plan to let your dog off-leash, this skill is imperative. I'm not a dog trainer, so I won't attempt to show you how to train your dog in this book. I list some excellent training books in the Recommended Reading section. I'll limit myself to making some observations about training mistakes I see people make. Each day, Kramer, Scout, and I go to Prospect Park here in Brooklyn, where dogs are allowed off-leash during certain hours. Here, I have ample opportunity to watch people interact with their dogs. I think the number one mistake--and I see it all the time--is made by people who call their dogs to them and then yell at them when the dog comes. A friendly white-and-brown pit bull once came running up to Kramer and Scout.

86

The dogs briefly interacted, and then the dog's owner started calling his dog from across the field. He didn't walk over to get his dog, mind you, but just called him angrily. The dog trotted back to his owner, and as I was admiring that recall, the owner bent over and started wagging his finger at the dog, admonishing him for having left him to greet my dogs. The pit bull cowered, then slunk past his owner. Not ten minutes later, the dog was back visiting us, and the routine was repeated. The owner gave him the same (obviously ineffective) scolding. Rather than shout at his dog, I think the man should have praised his dog to high heaven for coming when called. I'm blessed that my dogs don't wander too far from me; but thanks to the treats I keep in my pocket, my dogs come running when I call! They're always rewarded, never yelled at! If your dog wanders away from you, and you feel you need to admonish him, it's a better idea to go to him, tell him "no" if you absolutely must, and then clip on his leash and take him away from the forbidden area. Why in the world would your dog want to leave somewhere fun to come to you if he knows when he gets there that he will be in trouble? "Down" and "Stay" A solid recall can be a lifesaver, since it allows you to call your dog away from a dangerous situation. But that assumes it's safe for your dog to run to you. "I see a lot of emergencies where it's actually better not to call your dog; it's better to say 'down!' " says Arden. If you're on the other side of the street from your dog, for example, you don't want him to run into the street to come when called. If your dog will perform a down, with you at a distance, or if he'll hold a rock-solid stay, you can protect him even more. It's worth training and practicing these skills even if you don't find you need them on a daily basis. Walking Nicely On-Leash I'm not asking you to have your dog heel precisely at your left side all of the time, but walking him is more pleasant if he has been trained to walk nicely on a loose leash. With proper, positive training, you can teach your dog not to pull without choke chains or prong collars. If your dog is trained to walk nicely, walks become

87

more pleasant for both of you and, consequently, you take more of them. You and your dog get more exercise, spend more time together, and your dog is exposed to more interesting things. It's a win-win situation. That's why it's such an important skill to teach your dog. Again, the books in the Recommended Reading section will show you how, as could a good, positive class. The "New Wave" in Dog Training "I get chills when I think about the ways dog training is changing," Arden says. If you had visited the average dog-training class only a decade ago, you would have seen dogs with choke chains around their necks walking in a large circle with their owners, and being yanked into position when they wandered from their owner's left knee. You might have seen the instructor advise an owner to grab the dog by the scruff of the neck and shake him in order to show him who's boss. You might have seen the teacher turn a dog over onto his back (the infamous alpha roll)--and you might have seen that dog scream in submission. You might even have seen the instructor grab a dog's leash out of the owners hand, jerk the chain so that the dog's front feet were lifted off the floor, and yell at the dog. In fact, I saw every one of these things in Kramers traditional-style obedience classes in 1992. Fast forward to 2000. If you visit a dog-training class now--at least any class that I'd recommend you take--you're likely to see some dogs in flat collars and others wearing head halters (like a horse). You might see box-shaped clickers in the owners' hands. Using the principles of operant conditioning, the owners click when their dog performs a behavior they like. The dog gets a tasty treat after the click. (The click allows the owner to tell the dog precisely what behavior he is being rewarded for.) You might see an owner turn her back on her misbehaving dog, completely ignoring the bad behavior until it stops. You'll likely see lots of happy recalls. Dog training is a lot more fun than it used to be, plain and simple. If you visit a class and it doesn't look fun, keep looking. Should You Take a Class? There are several ways to go about training your dog. You can try to do it yourself, using books like those listed in the Recommended Reading section. You can take a group class, or you can take private lessons.

88

I'd advise going with an expert rather than trying to do it yourself. No book can substitute for the personal attention of your instructor, though books can be great for backup. Group or private? It depends on your dog. If your dog has specialized needs (a specific behavioral problem or a particular fear, for example) that might not be addressed in a group class, it probably makes sense to take private lessons, at least until you get the special circumstance under control. But if you're interested in basic training, and your dog doesn't have a violent reaction to other dogs, group classes have the advantage of exposing your dog to lots of other dogs. You also make friends with the other dog owners. You can show off your dog's skills to others, and when those skills are a little lacking, you can commiserate with empathetic classmates. What I don't recommend you do is send your dog off to be trained at another location. It sounds attractive: Your unruly pooch leaves home for a week or two and comes back a saint. I just don't see it happening. Sure, by the time he was sent home, your dog was probably obeying the person who was training him. But that might not translate to his obeying you. A big part of [-POOCH POINTER HOW TO FIND A TRAINER Finding a trainer in your community can be challenging. Some ways to start your search are listed below. No matter how you locate one, observe the trainer in action before hiring her or enrolling in a class. Make sure you're comfortable with her training techniques. -word of mouth -asking people you see with well-behaved dogs -the Association of Pet Dog Trainers' Web site (www.apdt.org) -the clicker teachers' listing Web site (www.wazoo.coml-marge/Clicker_ Trainers/Clicker_ Trainers.html) -ads or articles in community dog-related newsletters and magazines -dog-related community events ]

89

taking classes with your dog is learning how to work with her. In fact, most instructors concentrate on training people to train their dogs, not training the actual canine students. What to Look for in a Trainer Ask to visit a class before you enroll. A reputable trainer will allow you to sit in on his class. "Always visit, no matter what," Arden advises. When you're there, make sure you're comfortable with how the instructor interacts with the students. Observe methods, and make sure they're ones you'd be comfortable performing with your dog. I encourage you to look for the more modern methods mentioned above. They're not only more fun, they're also easier on your dog. They don't have the undesirable side effects that correction-based training can have. Trust your instincts. If you enroll in a class that you end up being uncomfortable in, there's no shame in quitting. I dropped out of a therapy-dog class that Scout and I were enrolled in. The methods were too harsh, and I felt terrible complying with them. I hated to be a quitter, but I was flooded with feelings of relief when I withdrew from that hated class. I'm sure Scout was relieved, too. Wendy Hudson of Minneapolis-St. Paul had a similar experience. She and her Labrador retriever, Brenna, were enrolled in a class with a big-name trainer in her area. "The trainer was militaristic, not fun," recalls Hudson. "Brenna just shut down after a while and would dribble urine from the stress." Hudson has found a more positive, informal club and plans to enroll Brenna. "Maybe I can have the dream of a CD yet." (A CD, which stands for Companion Dog, is an AKC obedience tide.) Training provides you and your dog with a common language. If you master the aforementioned six commands, the two of you should be able to enjoy a relatively trouble-free life together. These commands can form the basis for sports and activities you can do together (like agility, herding, obedience, or therapy work, to name just a few). A trained dog is welcome in more places, so you'll spend more time with your dog. And, if you ask me, that kind of companionship is what having a dog is all about.

Chapter 14 Talk--and Listen to Your Dog If you have any kind of relationship with your dog, you know that he is constantly communicating with you. You may not even be aware of how closely tuned in you are to his body language. You also have an emotional connection with your animal; don't you have an idea of what he is feeling, at least some of the time? Communicating with your dog--and it's a two-way street, as communication occurs in both directions--is an important aspect of your relationship with him. If you pay attention, you can pick up important clues as to how your dog feels about you, others, and certain situations. It's up to you to open yourself up to receive that communication. -DON'T MISTAKE THE ABSENCE OF LANGUAGE FOR A LACK OF COMMUNICATION Just because your dog doesn't speak to you in words doesn't mean he isn't communicating. We communicate with our dogs (and they with us) through a variety of

92

channels. Body language is surely well known (though not always easy for the average person to interpret). Norwegian dog trainer and enthusiast Turid Rugaas's groundbreaking book, On Talking Terms with Dogs:Calming Signals, reveals that dogs try to avoid altercations, and communicate their peaceful intentions through a series of signals they send to one another, which Rugaas has dubbed calming signals. Once you become aware of these signals, you see dogs use them all the time, and you can use them on your dog. I firmly believe that dogs can understand us when we speak out loud to them. The more verbal we are with them, the more attuned they are to our language. You don't have to limit yourself to one-word commands when you're communicating with your dog. Many dog owners who are emotionally connected with their dogs speak in complete sentences, and many dogs understand. Dogs and humans also have a telepathic connection. In 1999,1 wrote a book about telepathic communication with animals, called You Can Talk to Your [-POOCH POINTER HOW HUMANS AND DOGS COMMUNICATE BODY LANGUAGE:Dogs communicate with one another -- and with us -- through body language. Forexample, a tucked tail signals fear or submission. A stiff stance, with erect ears and tail, communicatesdominance. Pay attention to your dog's body language, and you'll have a window to his feelings. VERBAL LANGUAGE:Dogs who live with us understand more spoken language than you might think. Speak in full sentences to your canine; you might well see him respond to what you say. TELEPATHIC COMMUNICATION:Dogs and humans communicate mind-to-mind all the time. Open your mind to the possibility that the dog-related words and feelings that pop into your head are actually coming from your dog. Try sending your dog mental images and silent words. You'll be surprised at how this practice strengthens your bond.]

93

Animals: Animal Communicators Tell You How. Through my research, I concluded that the telepathic connection is real, and that humans simply need to open themselves to it in order to enjoy a fuller relationship with their animals. Body Language Most of us are aware of the common stances dogs take to communicate with other canines. For example, dogs who stand stiffly, with ears and tail up, are communicating dominance. A crouching dog, with ears flat and tail tucked under, is communicating submission. It's much more complicated than that, of course. While it's important (and fun) to watch your dog's body language with other dogs, it's his body language with you that will be really revealing. As we discussed in chapter 12, hierarchy is important to dogs, and if your dog doesn't see you as his leader, he has no choice but to take on the role himself, says Myrna Milani. Part of the confusion about who's in charge relates to body language. Your dog may be communicating his role as the leader without your really knowing it. If he jumps on you, for example, you might find that endearing. But it may be his way of displaying dominance. If your dog demands that you pet him, you may be more than happy to oblige. But in doing so, you're feeding into his leadership role. If the dog's behavior escalates into aggression--as many of Milani's cases do--you'll likely be advised to become your dog's leader and turn that body language around. When she consults with a new client, Milani asks about body language displays, and what those displays mean to the client. Then she asks them, "Based on what we know about normal canine body language, is your interpretation valid?" Frequently, the answer is "no." "I don't care if your dog wears your underwear," she says, "as long as he is healthy and not biting anyone." In other words, if your leadership position is not in question (and, as pointed out in chapter 12, your dog needs you to be a benevolent leader, so it's not necessarily a conscious effort on your part if you naturally fall into the role), interpreting your dog's body language can be left to you. But if you're encountering behavioral problems with your dog, you might want to consult an expert trainer or behaviorist to help you sort it out.

94

The body language we share with our dogs can be highly individual. "Each one of us has our own specific method of communicating with our pets," says Milani. "It is like a secret language." It's a language that goes both ways. Our body language can communicate fear to our dog; it can communicate positive things as well. Try to be consistent with your body language, as well as your interpretation of your dog's body language. If your dog's language threatens you in any way, seek professional assistance. Calming Signals When Rugaas observed dogs interacting with one another, she identified twenty-seven different signals they use to avoid conflict and to maintain peace and quiet. She described these signals in her book, On Talking Termswith Dogs: Calming Signals, and video, Calming Signals: What Your Dog Tells You. Once you're familiar with these communication signals, you'll spot them whenever you see dogs interact. A calm dog will use them with a fearful dog to let him know he means no harm. Two comfortable dogs might use them with one another to keep the peace. The next time you see two canines meeting for the first time, watch for some of these signals: -looking away -turning the head away from the other (which is done when looking away doesn't do the trick) -yawning -licking -slow movements -sitting and lying down, or freezing in place -sniffing the ground -approaching the other dog at a curve instead of straight on -crouching in a play bow -marking Your dog might be using these signals on you, too! Once you're familiar with them, you can use them on your dog. If he is restless in the house, for example, try repeatedly yawning at him. He may let out a big yawn himself and lie down.

95

Turning away from a fearful dog should make him more comfortable. Curving in your approach rather than walking straight toward a dog will be more acceptable to a nervous dog. Using calming signals is a way to communicate with your dog in universal dog language. "Go out and get yourself skilled at observing dogs, and you will see the next time your dog is telling you something--and you can do something about it," says Rugaas at the conclusion of her video. Speaking Out Loud to Your Dog I talk to my dogs all of the time--and not just baby talk and nonsense (though there's a little of that sometimes). I explain why I'm doing what I'm doing. When Kramer wants to go one direction on a walk, I'll tell him "we need to go this way because I need to mail a letter." He readily complies, and I believe he understands what I'm saying. People who believe that their dogs understand only rudimentary commands, and therefore limit their verbal communication with their dogs to words they've been taught, are missing out. If you're verbal around your dog--and if you have an emotional connection to him--he's listening and comprehending a lot more than you think. Susan McCullough of Vienna, Virginia, has long had a barking problem with her Shetland sheepdog, Cory. She's handled it through training, and putting him in a down stay, for example, when she was about to do something to trigger a barking fest, like opening or shutting the windows. After learning more about animal communication and opening her mind to the possibility that dogs might understand more of what we tell them than she originally thought, McCullough tried her hand at explaining things to Cory. She got immediate results. For example, Cory gets revved up when his owner takes the tablecloth off the dining room table (he's hoping for a game of "bullfight"). Recently, McCullough was clearing off the table, when Cory grew excited. She turned to him and said, "Cory, all I'm going to do is take off the newspapers and put away the placemats. Nothing else." To McCullogh's delight, he ceased and desisted immediately. That's a single example from many where Cory calmed down and didn't bark when McCullough simply informed him of what's going on, explaining

96

why it would be best for him not to bark. "I've been amazed at how well Cory seems to understand my explanations," says McCullough. "Doing this is making a big difference in our relationship: It's less stressful and more loving than it was before." You might want to give it a try. It can't hurt. Even if your dog doesn't understand you, he probably enjoys your talking to him, and you may end up being surprised by the results. Telepathic Communication When I first learned that people were making money communicating telepathically with animals and relating what the animals said to their owners, I couldn't believe it. There's a sucker born every minute, I thought. But then, a few years later, at the urging of friends who'd had some remarkable experiences with animal communication, I tried it. I paid a professional animal communicator $35 for a half-hour session talking to Kramer and Scout. It was probably the most fun that $35 has ever bought me. I wrote a magazine article about telepathic animal communication and took a couple of workshops on how to do it myself. When I was asked to write a book on the topic, I rolled up my sleeves and started talking with communicators and their clients. I'm now a believer. Animals communicate telepathically with humans all of the time. As children, humans were told by their parents to close off that avenue of communication. ("It's just your imagination.") But if you open yourself to it, you can communicate without speaking to your dog (and receive communication from him). Do you ever have a hunch that your dog wants something specific? Perhaps he sent you a message. Does your dog ever come up to you and just stare? I bet you find yourself getting up and getting something for him. You've probably just communicated with him telepathically. My book You Can Talk to Your Animals: Animal Communicators Tell You How details many stories about animal communication and relates information from professional communicators about how to do it yourself. For now, I ask you to be open to the possibility. When you have a feeling that your dog is saying something (if you're like me, you're always putting words in your

97

dog's mouth), consider the possibility that you're receiving a telepathic message. The people I've spoken with who have opened their minds to this idea are thrilled with the results. It's a wonderful way to strengthen your bond with your dog. If you're curious enough to try to communicate with your dog through a professional communicator, you can find one at the Web site of Penelope Smith, one of the pioneers in telepathic animal communication ( www.animaltalk.net ). Animal communicators primarily work over the telephone (using the phone to speak with you while they speak telepathically with the animal), so geographic proximity isn't important. One of the great things about dogs is how they make their wishes known without language. Pay attention to your dog. Open your mind to everything he might be trying to tell you. Talk to him. He has a lot to say--if you listen with your eyes, ears, mind, and heart.

Chapter 15 Safety First Our dogs depend on us for everything. We control their food, water, exercise, even their elimination opportunities. We're also responsible for keeping them safe. There are a lot of hazards out there, and some are less obvious than others. -DON'T PUT YOUR DOG IN DANGER When Rucey Myers of Seattle bought a smooth rubber ball for her three-month-old Labrador/Newfoundland mix, Jessie, the ball was just the right size for the puppy. But as the puppy grew (and the ball didn't), Myers discovered in a terrifying moment that the ball was dangerously small. When she tossed it to Jessie, she caught it, then tried to swallow it. The ball became stuck in the dog's throat. "I could see it, but since it was smooth and by then covered in spit, I couldn't get it out," recal s Myers. Luckily, the ball did not obstruct Jessie's airway, and Myers was able to rush her to the vet, who managed to extract it. Inappropriate toys are among the many everyday objects and events that can pose a threat to your dog. It's not always possible to avoid all of life's hazards, but you can certainly take some precautionary measures to prevent placing your dog in danger.

100

Toys Toys, as important as they are to dogs, can be dangerous. To avoid living the nightmare Myers experienced with Jessie, make sure any ball your dog plays with isn't small enough to choke him. If your dog is an aggressive chewer, be sure the toy can't be torn up into pieces that could be lodged in his throat, or be consumed and block his intestines. Supervise your dog after you introduce any new toy to make sure he doesn't play with it in a dangerous way. If he does, take it away. Regularly inspect any heavy-duty chew toys you leave your dog alone with to find any cracks or damage early on. Collars and Tags Worn Around-the-Clock When yellow Labrador retriever Harley was a puppy, a trainer told his owner, Susan Lennon of Rocky Hil , Connecticut, to leave his chain collar on him all the time. One day, Susan and Harley were in the bathroom together, and Harley was playing behind the toilet. Lennon heard a high-pitched squeal followed by a thump and discovered that her four-month-old puppy had hung himself by the collar on a fixture below the toilet. The collar was wrapped tightly around the metal fixture; Lennon's efforts at freeing him were futile. When she called 911, the dispatcher agreed to send an emergency unit only after Lennon threatened to kill herself if her dog died. Fifteen long minutes later, emergency personnel showed up and dismantled the toilet. Lennon had never been comfortable putting a choke chain on her dog, and that was the last day Harley ever wore one. As this incident illustrates, it's not safe to leave a chain collar on a dog. If you use one for training, take it off as soon as you finish the session. Tags can be dangerous, too. One day Susan Bemus looked out her kitchen window to see her golden/Lab mix, Digger, lying in a strange position, with her chin pinned to the deck. Digger's bone-shaped ID tag had slipped in the crack between two wooden slats, then turned 90 degrees. Digger was effectively tied with her neck to the ground. Luckily, Digger is a calm dog and didn't panic, so Bemus was able to rescue her easily. Bemus's dogs no longer wear collars when at home.

101

Paper Shredder It may sound far-fetched, but paper shredders can also pose a real hazard for dogs. The type that automatically turn on when a piece of paper is inserted may also turn on when a dog licks it. Last spring, a Border collie named Recce licked a paper shredder and his tongue was pulled into the machine. Luckily, his owner was home and was able to rush him to the veterinary hospital. He survived despite an immense loss of blood and is learning to live with a partial tongue. If you have a paper shredder, keep it unplugged when you're not using it. Toxic Substances Cleaning solutions, fertilizers, and toxic chemicals should be kept out of reach of inquisitive dogs. Dog-proof your home as you would childproof it for a toddler. Some things that won't poison people can hurt dogs. The most notable example is chocolate, which contains a substance called the obromine; this can actually kill a dog. Don't leave chocolate out where your dog can get it. An unexpected place your dog might encounter chocolate is mulch. Be sure that the mulch you buy for your garden isn't made from cocoa hulls. Some houseplants can be toxic if eaten. If you have a dog who likes to munch on your plants, you'd better find a new home for plants like Boston ivy, philodendron, and amaryllis. An illustrated list of dangerous plants is available on the Internet at cal.vet.upenn.edu/poison/index.html. Another dangerous substance for dogs is antifreeze, which can put your dog into kidney failure after he ingests even a trace amount. If you see a telltale green puddle, steer your dog clear of it, and be careful if you change your car's antifreeze. Look for pet-safe antifreeze, which is now available.

102 Tying a Dog Out My pet peeve is something I see on a daily basis here in New York City. People take their dogs on errands, then tie them to a parking meter or fence when they go into a store. I don't get it. It's like leaving a baby in a stroller on the sidewalk. (Some European parents did just that in Manhattan a couple of years ago and were arrested for child abuse.) So many bad things could happen to your dog while he's waiting for you. Someone could steal him. He could get loose and run off. Another dog could come along and attack him. A child could approach your dog and poke him. Without you there to intervene, your dog might bite the child (and guess who would be blamed?). To me, it's not worth the risk. If I need to walk somewhere where the dogs aren't welcome, I leave them at home. Another dangerous practice is tying your dog out in the yard. When you do this, particularly if he's unsupervised, you leave him vulnerable. Tying up a dog thwarts his flight instinct--when he feels threatened, there's nowhere for him to go. This can make many dogs behave aggressively toward perceived dangers, like people walking by, other animals entering the yard, or taunting children. It can do a number on your dog emotionally. Not Identifying Your Dog Letting your dog outside without an identification tag is courting danger. If he should escape from the yard or get away from you on a walk, his tag could be his ticket home rather than to a shelter. When you travel with your dog, put a temporary ID tag on his collar, with the number where you can be reached, your cell phone number, and/or an emergency number. You can use a paper key tag, write on it with waterproof ink, and just tie it to your dog's collar. Collars and tags do fall off. Other, less visible but more permanent means of identification are also available. A microchip the size of a grain of rice can be implanted between your dog's shoulder blades. When your dog is scanned at a shelter or vet's office, a number comes up. The person who scans it calls the chip's registry and is given your name. If you microchip your dog (which can be done at many vets' offices and shelters), be sure to register with a national database.

103

Keep your data at the registry up-to-date. It does your dog no good if the person who finds him can't reach you. Another permanent identification method is tattooing. This is usually done on the dog's inner thigh, where there is less fur to cover it. A unique identification number is tattooed on the dog and, as with microchips, that number is registered with a national registry. Car Travel Dangers Think twice before taking your dog in the car with you on errands. The weather really should be cool, and not sunny, since cars can heat up quickly. By leaving your dog in the parked car, you also risk his escaping. This happened to a friend whose small dog wriggled out the crack he'd left in the window for ventilation. (He got his dog back.) Another possible danger is your car being stolen with your dog in it. Imagine how frantic that would leave you. Take measures to secure your dog while you're driving. If you had an accident, your dog would be thrown. He might not only be hurt, but he could also become a canine missile and hurt the human passengers of the car. I use car-safety harnesses, which have a loop on the back through which my car's shoulder belt goes. If my car were large enough, I'd probably use crates instead. Under no circumstances should you ever let your dog ride in the open bed of a pickup. An unsecured dog might fall out. One that is secured by a leash in the bed of a pickup might also fall out--and be left hanging from the leash. Another common but dangerous practice is letting your dog stick his head out the open window while you're driving. Sure he loves it, but if you're traveling fast (and even if you're not), a piece of gravel could fly up and hit your dog in the face. He could be badly injured, even blinded. Would you let your child hang his head out the window of a moving car? Another possible danger is that if the window is open wide enough, your dog might actually fall out. This happened to the dog of another friend. A final caution about car travel: If your car has passenger-side air bags, don't let your dog travel in the front seat. It's been well publicized that air bags, when inflated, are dangerous to children and small adults. Logic dictates that dogs would also be in danger of suffocation should the air bag be deployed.

104

Letting Your Dog Run Free Some people let their dogs run loose in their neighborhoods. This happens more in suburbia and rural areas, but we have a neighbor in Brooklyn who does it. If you let your dog roam the neighborhood, you're exposing him to all sorts of dangers: being hit by a car, eating a poisonous substance, or being hurt by another animal. You're also alienating your neighbors by allowing your dog to eliminate indiscriminately on their property. Caring dog owners don't do it. Other people take their dogs for walks on city streets but don't bother to leash them. They are confident that their dogs will not wander into the street. But dogs will be dogs, and most can't resist chasing small animals. It's a hardwired behavior. If a squirrel or cat should wander across the path of even the most well-trained canine, chances are good that the dog will give chase. That chase might take him in front of a car. Another argument for not walking your dog off-leash on the sidewalk is that you might scare pedestrians who are afraid of dogs. Or you might encounter a dog-aggressive dog. Remember, your dog depends upon you to keep her safe. Yard Dangers Leaving your dog unattended in the yard all day can be dangerous. If your dog is an escape artist, he could be running around the neighborhood while you're at work. He could be stolen. Depending on your fence, another animal could enter your yard, where he could get into a scrap, or barrel into the fence by chasing a cat or squirrel. Assuming you dog-proof your house, your dog will be safer indoors when unattended. Your yard offers dangers even when your dog is supervised. Yard work can be dangerous to her, since lawn mowers and string trimmers can cause pebbles and sticks to fly at high velocity. Your dog could sit or walk in the path of these flying objects and be hurt. You could prune a branch off a tree, and it could land on your dog. When you're paying attention to your work and not where your dog is, you're putting him in peril. Keep your dog in the house when you're using power equipment in the yard.

105

We owe it to our dogs to do everything we can to keep them safe. Before you decide to take your dog with you, think hard about whether he'll be safe. I'm not suggesting you be paranoid, but I do think it's worth thinking about the worst-case scenario and balancing the risks with the benefits of any situation in which you place your dog. Bad stuff happens, and if something bad should happen to your dog, you don't want to live with the guilt of knowing that it was you who put him in peril.

Chapter 16 An Ounce of Prevention Our dogs depend upon us to keep them healthy. They don't have the language skills to tell us when they feel bad, although if we observe them carefully enough, they can tell us in other ways. It's up to us to pay close attention, and touch our dogs regularly so that we can detect as early as possible when something's gone awry in their bodies. -DON'T TAKE YOUR DOG'S HEALTH FOR GRANTED As with our own health, early detection is the name of the game with canine illness. "I tell people that if their dog doesn't feel well and isn't better within twenty-four hours, they should go to the vet," says Patrick Tate, D.V.M., a veterinarian in private practice in Webster Groves, Missouri. Tate points out that young puppies and elderly dogs--older than ten years--have fewer reserves, and so less time to spare. They should probably go to the vet as soon as they start feeling ill.

108

Even if your dog just doesn't seem right, call your vet. Tate describes a client who recently brought in her dog, saying that he hadn't been feeling right for a day. Tests revealed that the dog was suffering from autoimmune hemolytic anemia, an ailment that, if caught too late, is potentially life threatening. Detected early, it is easily treatable. Tate applauds the client's initiative in bringing in her dog so soon. "She knew her dog and knew to bring him in," he says. Of course most of your dog's ailments won't be as dire, but little things can lead to real discomfort. The Vaccination Debate Annual vaccinations would, on the surface, appear to be the king of preventive care. But the notion that all animals should be vaccinated every year is starting to change. In the holistic community, vaccinations are generally seen as doing more harm than good. Even some conventional veterinarians now advocate less frequent vaccinations. The Colorado State University College of Veterinary Medicine and Biological Sciences, for example, recommends a protocol of puppy or kitten shots, followed by a booster shot at age one year, then routine vaccinations only every three years after that. On its Web site (www.cvmbs.colostate.edu/vth/ savp2.html), the school states that its rationale for this recommendation (as opposed to the traditional annual revaccination) "is based on the lack of scientific evidence to support the current practice of annual vaccination, and increasing documentation showing that over vaccinating has been associated with harmful side effects." The holistic veterinarians I've consulted have blamed annual vaccinations, coupled with a genetic predisposition to a sensitivity to them, for the autoimmune disease that my eight-year-old Kramer has developed. I've been advised never to vaccinate him again. Holistic vet Dee Blanco says that a single shot of a modified-live vaccine, given after the age of fourteen weeks, provides a lifetime of protection from illness. Continuing to jolt the immune system with more shots, she says, is not only unnecessary but counterproductive. "They don't do any good," she says. "They keep trying to stimulate, and just cause a confusion and an overload. This is often why there is autoimmune disease."

109

If you choose not to give your dog annual shots, don't forego his annual exam. Your dog needs to be given a thorough exam by a vet once a year. This provides the opportunity to ask questions, to do blood tests if your vet thinks they're necessary, and to have an expert eye observe your dog's health. The next time you visit your vet, ask about not giving shots this year. In this transition time, when recommendations are slowly changing, it might be something your vet agrees with but doesn't bring up unless you mention it. Instead of vaccinating against a specific disease, you can ask your vet to draw blood for a special test called a titer, which measures the antibodies in the blood and indicates whether your dog is protected. The trouble with titers is that they may tell you your dog is not protected even if he is. The antibodies don't have to be circulating in the blood in order for them to be present and kick in when exposed to the disease. However, if you decide not to vaccinate, a titer that tells you your dog is protected can give you great peace of mind. If you feel you must vaccinate, consider getting separate vaccinations, spaced at least a couple of weeks (or even a year) apart, for each of the diseases you're trying to protect your dog from. This will mean a smaller jolt to the immune system than the big 5- or 7-in-l combination shot that is typically given. Jean Dodds, D.V.M., a noted immunologist, hematologist, and researcher on the effects of vaccines, says that the only "clinically significant" diseases that adult dogs should be vaccinated against are distemper, parvo, and rabies. The other diseases--covered by what she cal s the "combowombo" shot--are either too mild, if contracted, to merit vaccinating against, are rarely seen today, or the vaccine is relatively ineffectual (the leptospirosis shots, for example, cover only a few of the many strains of lepto). The efficacy and side effects of the Lyme disease vaccines are a matter of controversy. Conventional Versus Holistic After Kramer became ill with autoimmune disease, I discovered that there are two different mind-sets within the veterinary community about how best to treat a pet. Kramer happened to come down with something that conventional veterinarians have no real treatment for (besides suppressing the immune system). Autoimmune disease, in which the body's immune system mistakes its own tissue for a foreign substance and attacks it, is something conventional vets cannot

110

cure; rather, they can control the symptoms through immunosuppressive drugs, to keep the immune system from attacking the body. When Kramer was diagnosed, my conventional vet suggested that I look into alternative veterinary approaches, for example, homeopathy, herbs, acupuncture, and traditional Chinese medicine, to see if I could find help for him. I am forever [-POOCH POINTER DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CONVENTIONAL AND HOLISTIC VETERINARY MEDICINE In general, the differing approaches of conventional and holistic veterinarians can be characterized thisway: A holistic veterinarian: - looks at the whole animal, not simply symptoms -seeks to find the cause of the illness and cure it, even if symptoms temporarily grow worse - takes longer in treating -tends to avoid vaccination -tends to avoid the use of antibiotics -frequently advises feeding a fresh-foods diet -is more likely to charge by the hour A conventional veterinarian: -treats individual symptoms -tends to see different symptoms as separate conditions rather than part of the same illness -provides more immediate relief of symptoms -tends to encourage vaccination (though some conventional vets are starting to recommend less frequentvaccination) - prescribes antibiotics more readily -usually encourages feeding commercial diets -is more likely to charge for the services rendered ]

111

grateful to her for that, since one year later, Kramer's health has substantially improved through homeopathy and nutritional therapy. I'm a convert. A big difference between holistic and conventional veterinary medicine is that holistic practitioners tend to look at the whole animal, try to ascertain the cause of the ailment, and then treat the cause. Conventional vets tend first to address symptoms. As a pet owner, the conventional approach can be attractive, because it means that your animal is provided quicker relief. Holistic vets argue that by suppressing symptoms, you're pushing the illness deeper into the animal, and more serious illness could result. Our homeopathic veterinarian, Dee Blanco, stresses that treating all symptoms of an illness as soon as they appear isn't healthy. "Health is never about never getting ill," she says. "You should go through an illness, purge your system, and feel better." A healthy immune system can fight illness, so the best preventive medicine, she says, is that which builds and fortifies your dog's immune system. Blanco feels that annual vaccinations, monthly parasite preventives, and commercial dog foods do the opposite. The best way to maintain good health in your dogs is to: -feed her a fresh, whole diet -serve her fresh, filtered water -minimize exposure to assaults on the immune system, like vaccinations, chemical-parasite preventives, lawn chemicals, and cigarette smoke -give your dog plenty of appropriate exercise in a clean environment If you choose, as I have, to treat your dog holistically, that doesn't mean ignoring your dog's symptoms, though chances are good that your dog will become ill less frequently. It's still your responsibility to pay close attention to how he's feeling, and to consult your veterinarian when you fear a problem. Your holistic vet may well choose not to immediately alleviate the symptoms. But as the symptoms might point to a larger illness, it's important to talk to your vet about them. If you consult with your holistic veterinarian by phone, you're well-advised to have a local vet to whom you can take your dog in an emergency. This vet can be the eyes and ears for your remote vet. My local vet is happy to explain, slowly and clearly, what she's seeing as she examines my dogs, so that I can relay the information accurately to my homeopathic vet.

112

Parasite Prevention Ticks and fleas are the bane of your dog's existence. They can make you and your dog miserable. Before the 1990s, dog owners typically dealt with fleas only after they had an infestation on their hands. They employed flea baths, flea dips, flea collars, and even flea bombs for the house. These involved a lot of chemicals, which didn't even work that well. Ticks were dispatched manually. There's a new generation of flea and tick preventives available, all of which are more effective. "We are at the best point we have ever been on in preventing fleas," says Tate. Topicals like Advantage and Frontline, applied between a dog's shoulder blades monthly, actually kill the parasite. (Advantage works for fleas only, while Frontline works for fleas and ticks.) An oral flea preventive, Program, interrupts the flea's reproductive cycle, though it doesn't kill the flea. Another monthly oral product, Sentinel, combines Program and Interceptor, a heart-worm preventive that also fights other worms. Revolution, a megacombination product introduced in 1999, prevents fleas, ticks, heartworm, and other parasites, like ear mites. Heartworm preventives are typically given monthly (though daily heart-worm preventives are available) to prevent your dog from contracting heart-worm, a potentially fatal disease transmitted by mosquitoes in which worms take up residence in the heart and pulmonary arteries. The treatment for heartworm disease used to employ arsenic and was hard on the dog. Milder treatments are now available. Are these products really necessary? It depends on where you live and even on your dog's attractiveness to parasites. If fleas aren't a problem for your dog, then you probably don't need to load him up on chemicals. "I tell people if you don't need it, don't use it," says Tate. But, he adds, if you've never been through a real flea or tick infestation, you can't appreciate how awful it can be. If fleas are a problem in your area, you'll avoid an infestation if you give the preventive during flea season. Holistic practitioners generally caution you to avoid giving any unnecessary chemicals to your dog. We stopped using monthly flea and tick preventive after Kramer was diagnosed with lupus in 1999. His immune system was compromised, so I avoided (and continue to avoid) all possible insults to it. At the same time, we switched to a fresh-foods diet. So far, no fleas and only

113

one tick in the last eighteen months. I credit that as much to Kramer and Scout's diet as anything else--though they're city dogs, they're exposed to fleas and ticks on a daily basis in the tall grasses of the vast city park they run around in every day. Keep Those Teeth Clean Dental disease is prevalent among dogs. Studies indicate that by the age of three, 80 percent of dogs show some signs of oral disease. You can do much to prevent dental disease. If you do a good enough job, you can avoid anesthetizing your dog for teeth cleaning. Just as you brush your own teeth, you can also brush your dog's teeth to help keep her mouth healthy. Buy some toothpaste made especially for dogs-- it comes in such appetizing flavors as poultry and liver. My dogs think it tastes great. Remember, don't use human toothpaste; the foaming agents might upset your dog's stomach. It can get tricky getting your dog accustomed to tooth brushing, but every little bit helps. The inside of the teeth (the tongue side) are difficult to brush, but don't worry about them--food doesn't tend to stick there. If brushing seems too daunting, there's a simpler solution: bones. Give your dog a fresh, raw bone (like a marrow bone) to chew on, suggests Tate. Bones are healthy for dogs, and they do a great job of cleaning their teeth. The bone should be the appropriate size for your dog. Don't feed her a bone she could easily swallow whole. The idea is for her to spend some time chewing. I always supervise my dogs when they're chewing bones, because I wouldn't want them to break off a little piece and choke. What about rawhide? Fresh bones are safer, since rawhide may have been preserved and cured with toxic chemicals. I know from experience that rawhide can be swallowed in large pieces--in past years, Kramer swallowed some frighteningly large pieces. The danger is that the rawhide could choke your dog or cause an intestinal blockage. Another fear is the source of the rawhide: if you buy beef bones intended for human consumption, you don't have to worry that they're from a source that might carry mad cow disease. (See chapter 17 for more information on feeding bones as part of your dog's diet.)

114

Check Those Ears! Veterinarian Tate sees many dogs who come in with uncomfortable ear infections. Many infections can be prevented by proper care of the ears. "The best way I know to prevent ear infections is to look at the ear on a regular basis," Tate says. Examine your dog's ears regularly, and look for discharge, swelling, or redness. Get into the habit of sniffing your dog's ears. Know what a normal ear smell is, and let your vet know if you detect a yeasty or otherwise abnormal odor. Your vet can describe the best way to clean your dog's ears. My holistic vet recommends olive oil (just to clean the earflap, not inside the ear canal). Some vets recommend commercial preparations. If your dog is constantly scratching at her ears, she might have an allergy. Talk to your vet about detecting what she might be allergic to so you can make her more comfortable. It's always better to find a solution to the source of a problem rather than to treat only the symptoms. Lumps and Bumps Part of your regular examination of your dog should include rubbing his body and detecting any lumps or bumps that might have sprouted. If you find one, contact your vet. "Lumps and bumps are not to be ignored," says Tate. Your vet will probably want to aspirate the lump, which means sticking a needle into it and examining the material he draws out. There's a good chance that the lump will turn out to be nothing. But if it is something serious, like cancer, you'll want to have it removed right away. The earlier you catch a malignant lump, the better the chance it can be surgically removed before the cancer has spread. Sometimes what at first touch feels like a bump is actually a tick. It's important to catch ticks as soon as possible after they land on your dog. Tick-borne diseases, like Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever, are transmitted only after the tick has been attached for some hours. If you examine your dog every day and remove any ticks you find, you help to eliminate the chance that the nasty insect will transmit disease to your dog. Be sure to protect your hand with gloves or a tissue before grabbing a tick.

115 No matter how you treat your animals--and you may change your thinking about this over the course of your dog's life--your dog is better off if you detect any problems early. By examining his body regularly and paying close attention to any signals he's sending you, you do more than simply keep him healthier: You also promote a stronger bond between the two of you. I'm no longer embarrassed to tell my vet that my dog is just "a little off." I don't care if it turns out that there's nothing wrong with him--in fact, I hope they'll find nothing wrong, and that whatever ails him will pass swiftly. But if there is something wrong, I want to know right away so that I can begin treatment.

Chapter 17 Food: You Get What You Pay For Remember that expression "You are what you eat"? The basis of good health, for dogs, humans, you name the species, is good nutrition. The commercial dog foods marketed today all say that they are "complete and balanced," but that doesn't mean they're all alike. There are real differences between the various foods. Better ingredients tend to cost more, so a good rule of thumb is that the more expensive the food is, the better it is. More and more dog owners are feeding their animals a home-prepared diet rather than relying on commercial food for good nutrition. They're educating themselves and providing fresh, nutritious, and balanced food for their dogs. For the dog owner who is willing to put in some extra time and effort to promote her dog's health, a fresh-foods diet can really pay off. -DON'T UNDERMINE YOUR DOG'S HEALTH WITH POOR NUTRITION If you choose to feed your dog a commercially prepared diet, buy the best food you can afford. Bear in mind that higher-quality ingredients are more digestible,

118

which means that your dog's body uses more of the nutrients. While the premium foods might be more expensive, your dog will get more out of them, and you'll be able to feed him less food. The suggested feeding portion on the dog food's label is the amount of food your dog must eat to meet his nutritional requirements. That's why less expensive foods suggest such large portions. Commercial Dog-Food Brands How do you know a food is good? Read labels. First, identify the food's primary source of protein. Grains are a cheap source of protein found in most dog foods. The trouble is, dogs are built to eat and digest meat, not grains. Yes, there are some predigested grains in the stomachs of the killed animals wolves eat. But it's hard to imagine a wolf out in a field gorging himself on corn or wheat. Meat is a better, more natural (and more expensive) source of protein for dogs. Look at the label. Meat should be the protein source. Ingredients are listed in descending order, by weight. Look for meat to be prominently featured among the first few ingredients. Second, look for ingredients you can understand. Just as with the packaged foods you buy for yourself, you don't want dog food that's loaded with sugar, dyes, and preservatives. "Stick to foods that have few nonfood things in them," advises Patrick Tate. "The fewer number of ingredients, the better." Third, familiarize yourself with what some of the meat-related terms on the label mean. Whole-meat products are listed by just the name of the meat ("chicken," "lamb," or "beef," for instance). By-products are derived from the rest of the animal after the meat has been taken away (not including hair, horns, teeth, or hooves). With poultry by-products, the law requires that they not include feces or foreign matter, "except in unavoidable trace amounts." Meat meals are rendered animal tissue. The Animal Protection Institute, an animal advocacy group, advises against buying food that relies on meat meals and by-products. Now that you know what to look for, you might be surprised when you read the label on your package of dog food. To make it easier for you to comparison-shop, visit the "Dog Foods Comparison Chart" Web site, compiled by Earl Wolfe, at home.hawaii.rr.com/wolfepack/. It lists the ingredients of more than one hundred types of dog foods, including well-known and readily available commercial brands, as well as independent and special-order brands. You may

119

find some brands you've never heard of. Web site links, where available, are provided for each manufacturer, and offer a wealth of information. I've found that this site's URL sometimes changes, but if I do a search under "dog foods comparison chart," it always pops up. What's Actually in Dog Food? The label doesn't tell the whole story. Even if you select a food whose label lists the best ingredients you can find, it will still lack optimal nutrition. Vitamins and enzymes are lost in the heat processing of the food, which is why the companies have to add vitamins (they're listed on the label) to make the food nutritionally complete. The big question is the source of the meats. When you look at exactly what goes into your dog's commercial food, you might become squeamish. For example, in her book, The Consumer's Guide to Dog Food, author Liz Palika writes: "In the majority of states, it is legal (and common) practice for pet-food manufacturers to use what are known as '4-D' meat sources: animals that are dead, dying, diseased, or disabled when they arrive at the slaughterhouse." I know that when I served commercial food to my dogs, I didn't want to think about what was in it. But if your curiosity gets the better of you, or if you're thinking about switching to a fresh diet, consider reading the investigative report from the Animal Protection Institute, called "What's Really in Pet Food." You can find it on the [-POOCH POINTER WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN A DOG-FOOD LABEL If you are feeding your dog a commercial diet, here's what to look for (and to avoid) on the label:Look for: -meat sources listed as two of the first few ingredients -wh ole-food ingredients, like vegetables and meats -human-grade meat (with USDA in front of the type of meat) - fewer ingredients Avoid: - grains as the main source of protein -meat meals and by-products -ingredients you don't understand -artificial preservatives, like BHA, BHT, and ethoxyquin - added sugar - dyes ]

World Wide Web, or ask for a free copy by mail. See the Resources section for the URL and contact information. Another expose on what goes into pet food is Ann Martin's book, Foods Pets Die For, which reveals, among other things, that the pet-food industry has turned our companion animals into cannibals: Pet food routinely contains meats from dogs and cats. Preparing Homemade Food for Your Dog Commercial dog food is certainly easy. So is pouring a bowl of cereal for yourself and calling it a meal. But while most of us aren't willing to subsist on a diet of breakfast cereal whose added vitamins and minerals meet the daily requirements, many are willing to ask our dogs to spend a lifetime eating the equivalent. Picture, if you can, a child who has eaten nothing but breakfast cereal. Now contrast that mental image with a child who eats a variety of fresh vegetables and protein sources every day. Which do you think would be more healthy, more vibrant? That same contrast exists between dogs who eat nothing but commercial food and those who are fed a fresh, raw diet. Dogs who are fed fresh, whole foods don't merely survive, says Dee Blanco, but"they flourish. It is the difference between health and subsistence." Blanco lists good nutrition as the cornerstone of preventive veterinary medicine. When Kramer became ill with autoimmune disease and I sought holistic care for him, I began to realize that what I really needed to do was to change his diet to provide him with optimal nutrition. I was feeding him a top-of-the-line commercial food, but because he had a delicate digestive system, any variation of his diet resulted in a flare-up of the inflammatory bowel disease he'd been diagnosed with. He would suffer from diarrhea and vomiting, and be a very sick dog. Then I switched to a fresh-foods diet. I initially cooked the food and then gradually switched to an all-raw diet. (I do cook sweet potatoes for him, so that I can mash them, and on the infrequent occasions I include grains, I cook those, too.) The difference in Kramer is astounding. Yes, he is also being treated by homeopathy and with a synthetic thyroid hormone. I think it's the synergy between the three things (homeopathy, medicine, and good nutrition) that has done the trick. He's a vibrant dog now, has lots of energy, and looks great. A year ago, at the age of seven, Kramer looked like an old dog. Today, at eight, he seems like a young dog.

121

Gina Barnett of San Francisco, who feeds a raw diet to her Great Dane/ Labrador mix, Fred, has never had to deal with major illness with him. But she has clearly seen improvements in his health since putting him on a raw diet. When Barnett adopted Fred from a shelter as a young adult dog, he had a history of ear infections and the ubiquitous skin problems so many canines experience. Those problems disappeared completely through feeding him a raw diet. "His coat is thick and glossy, and he no longer has itchy paws, dry flaky skin, or a waxy discharge in his ears," Barnett says. Moreover, Fred rarely gets sick. His owner takes him to see her homeopathic vet for his annual well-dog checkup and estimates that she's spent four hundred dollars in veterinary bills on Fred in the last four years. "I do not mean to imply that a raw diet is a panacea for every canine ailment," she says. "But, as with human health, optimum nutrition is the foundation for any successful treatment, whether conventional or holistic." The Basics of Home-Prepared Diets Entire books are devoted to home-prepared diets, but basically, here's how I feed my dogs: Their current diet consists of raw ground meat, ground fresh vegetables, cottage or ricotta cheese, sometimes some extras like mashed sweet potatoes or some kind of grain or pasta, and several nutritional supplements suggested by our holistic vet to address specific health problems. Twice a week, they eat raw, meaty bones, like turkey necks or chicken backs. It's not complicated or difficult. It is, apparently, delicious. Dry kibble doesn't begin to compare, judging by Kramer's reaction to the fresh food. (Scout will enthusiastically eat anything.) I buy organic vegetables at the health-food store, which doesn't sell meat. I buy the meat at the grocery store. I know organic meat would be better, but I take comfort in the fact that I'm feeding them meat sold for human consumption, unlike the meat that goes into kibble. I enjoy the control I have over what my dogs eat. Risks When I tell people that I feed my pets a raw diet, they invariably ask about the risks of raw meat. I explain what's been explained to me: The dog's digestive tract is shorter, and food spends much less time going through. In addition, their

122

system is more acidic, so bacteria doesn't have a chance to flourish. "Your pet's digestive system has evolved over two million years to eat raw meat," writes Kymythy Schultze in her book Natural Nutrition for Dogs andCats: The Ultimate Diet. She points out that the best defense against bacteria is a healthy immune system, which a raw diet promotes. When I tell folks that I feed my dogs raw poultry bones, they blanch. I explain that raw bones, which are healthy for the dogs, are soft, and can be chewed up without event. "Remember the species of animal you are feeding," writes Schultze. "Its entire digestive system is designed to eat raw meat and bones, including bird bones." I've never had a problem on either count. That's not to say that no one has. I know this may be a risk, but it's one I'm willing to take because the health benefits are so great. Before feeding your dog a raw diet, educate yourself. Weigh the benefits and the risks. It's a decision only you can make. Will I Do it Right? The commercial pet-food manufacturers have done a pretty good job convincing pet owners that they couldn't possibly know enough to feed their dogs properly. Yet, we're trusted to feed ourselves and our children. Sure, dogs have different nutritional needs from people. But all it takes is some research to learn about your dog's nutritional needs. Then you can apply that knowledge to a fresh diet, just as you do to your own. I would not advocate starting a home-prepared diet without first doing research. After all, you're trying to help your dog. The Internet is also a great source of information, though, of course, you should weigh everything you read on it against established sources of information. If nothing else, Internet mailing lists can put you in touch with people who are feeding their dogs a home-prepared diet, so you won't feel alone. That really boosted my confidence. Who Has Time? The idea of taking the time to prepare your dog's food fresh every day is daunting. But it's not as time-consuming as it may sound. "For me, the raw diet is

"I no longer worry about running out of kibble or making trips to a specialty pet store to buy food. I shop for Fred's meat, fruit, and vegetables at the farmers' markets and grocers where I buy my own food." Barnett feeds Fred one meal a day, and says that it takes her ten minutes or less to chop his raw veggies in the food processor, add supplements, and dish it up with the raw meat portion of his meal. Another option is to work in advance. Susan Lennon feeds two meals a day to her Labrador retriever, Harley. One meal comprises turkey necks or chicken wings. The other is a mixture of pulped vegetables, raw meat, and eggs, which she makes ahead of time and freezes. Lennon says it takes her a couple of hours every two weeks to make these patties, and no time at all to thaw and serve. Feeding a fresh-food diet takes a little more planning on my part, and I find it a bit more time-consuming than scooping kibble out of a bag, but the benefits to my dogs' health and the enthusiasm with which the meal is received make it worth it to me. Deciding what to feed your dog has long-term implications for his health. If you have the time and inclination to feed him a fresh diet, you'll doubdess see a

124

difference in your dog. "The benefits are so many," says Blanco. "The joy that you see in your dog. The joy that you feel in your heart. The fact that you, not some big corporation, are controlling the ingredients." If you're not ready to feed a home-prepared diet, Blanco recommends supplementing kibble with a portion of what you're eating for dinner (assuming that you eat healthfully). "Cook a little extra for your dog," she suggests. Your dog will enjoy the variation in his diet (eating the same thing every single day is torture for him, Blanco asserts). Since the kibble is already balanced, don't let his diet be more than 25 to 50 percent fresh, or you'll risk throwing the diet out of balance. When you select kibble, read the label judiciously, and find the highest quality you can get for your dog. He'll thank you for it.

Chapter 18 Good Grooming Grooming your dog is about more than good looks. Sure, a well-groomed dog is more enjoyable to look at, but regular grooming is also important to your dog's comfort and health. Mats pull at the skin and hurt. Dirty dogs feel itchy and uncomfortable. Different dogs have different grooming needs, depending on their coat. But even if your dog is a sleek greyhound, you should give him a regular once-over with your eyes and fingers to keep tabs on his coat and skin condition. At a minimum, all dogs need regular toenail trimming (unless the city sidewalks take care of that), and should have their ears and teeth checked regularly. -DON'T LET GROOMING TURN INTO A CHORE If your dog is a non shedding dog with a continuously growing coat, you know the importance of regular, professional grooming. But no matter how much money you shell out at the groomer, you must spend a certain amount of time brushing your dog and ensuring that she's mat-free and comfortable. Grooming shouldn't be a chore. If you do it regularly, it should be a pleasure for you and your dog, because you're not doing anything to her that should be painful. If you seldom groom your dog, or if she is only groomed when she's sent

to the groomer, she'll dread grooming sessions, since they'll take a long time and consist of lots of hair-pulling. If you're like me, you remember your mother combing out tangled hair. It hurt! You don't want that to be a part of your dog's relationship with you or your groomer. One of the most important grooming decisions should be made before you acquire your dog: If you can't stand a lot of dog hair around the house, you might be interested in a non shedding breed. But there's a trade-off to having a dog that doesn't shed: that dog's hair grows continuously (like human hair), and must be cared for properly. This means on top of professional grooming, he'll need

127 in-home grooming. If you don't have time for this kind of coat hair, maybe a shorter-haired breed is right for you. If you already own a longhaired dog, be realistic about the amount of hair you're willing to take care of, suggests Laura Watts, a professional dog groomer in Charlotte, North Carolina. If you don't want to do a lot of grooming, don't keep your dog in a show cut. I shudder to think about how much work it takes to maintain a standard poodle in a full show cut, for example (although I admire people who can do it). Kramer and Scout are kept in a short kennel clip. Watts explains that some coated breeds (like a cocker spaniel) have been bred to have increasingly profuse coats in order to be more impressive in the show ring. If you buy such a breed from show lines, be prepared for a profuse coat. Have your breeder show you how to properly care for that coat, including proper brushing. Start Early You'll do yourself, your dog, and your groomer a favor if, from the moment you get him, you condition your dog to having his body touched. If you acquire your dog as a puppy, and you start showing him that having his body touched is a pleasant feeling, he won't develop a fear of being handled. A dog that is not opposed to being touched has a much better time at the groomer (and being groomed at home). Start slowly: Have some treats handy, and lift up your dog's foot. Then give her a treat. Next, lift up her foot, and spread her toes; then give her a treat. Pick up her foot, spread her toes, and gently pull on her toenails. Then give her another treat. Keep this routine upbeat and brief. Similarly, condition her to let you look in her ears, look at her teeth (including the back teeth), and touch every part of her body. "You are teaching your dog to enjoy being handled," Watts explains. Besides helping you to groom your dog more easily, this conditioning helps your dog whenever she has to be handled by a dog-care professional. Even dogs who never go to a professional groomer must be seen at the vet's office. Use the Right Equipment There's a dizzying array of grooming equipment out there. One of my favorite sources for grooming supplies is the "New England Serum" catalog. It's important

128

that you buy the right equipment for your dog, and it's also important for you to know how to use it. If you bought your dog from a breeder, she can teach you how to groom your dog. Otherwise, ask a professional groomer for at-home grooming advice. They're wise to supply it, since it will make their job all the easier. At the least, you'll need an appropriate brush and comb, shampoo, toenail clippers, and perhaps a mat-breaker, conditioner, and nail file. Before we brought Kramer home, I went to the pet-supply store and bought him a brush. The rubber currycomb I purchased was completely wrong for a poodle (a slicker brush is more appropriate). I should have sought some professional advice before heading to the store, because the unknowledgeable store clerk wasn't able to help me. Without the right type of brush, grooming efforts can be ineffective. The Importance of Toenail Care Most dogs must have their toenails clipped to keep them from growing so long that they interfere with how the dog's foot touches the ground. Active dogs who walk on concrete or asphalt may not need such regular trimming, since the nails can be worn down. It's such a pleasure not to hear toenails clicking on the floor. Again, early intervention is the best way to get your dog accustomed to having his nails trimmed. Make it as happy an experience as possible. Some dogs just hate it, and will put up a fight. Many owners leave the job to a professional (a groomer or veterinarian). If you choose this route, make sure you take your dog in often enough to keep her nails short. The thing that's tricky about nail trimming is that the quick, which is inside dogs' toenails, grows with the nail. On humans, it's easy to cut long nails, because the quick always ends at the top of our fingers. We can also see the quick. But if you cut your dog's long toenail short, you will surely cut into the quick. This is not only painful for your dog, but it also fosters a bad association with the toenail trimmer. If your dog has light-colored nails, you can see the quick. If your dog's nails are black, you must cut just a little at a time. If you look carefully, you can see a little white spot when the quick is near. When you trim your dog's nails, the quick recedes. So if your dog's nails have become long, you'll need to trim them regularly just a little bit at a time. Eventually, you'll have a short nail you can keep short.

129

Some dog owners use a grinder, or Dremel, to grind rather than trim their dogs' nails. This can be effective but should only be done by a professional or by a dedicated dog owner who has been carefully trained by a professional, says groomer Watts. Grinding your dogs' nails too short can do more damage than clipping them too short, she says. Don't forget the dewclaws! Some dogs have them, the extra toenails up near the dew pad partly up their legs. They're the doggie equivalent of thumbs. Some breeds are born without dewclaws, and some breed standards call for the dew-claws to be removed when the puppy is young. Some breeds, like the briard and beauceron, even have double dewclaws on their hind legs. If your dog has dewclaws, it's important to keep them trimmed short. Since dewclaws don't come into contact with the ground, they won't be worn down naturally. Long dewclaws can catch on grass or brush and rip, which can be painful. Worse, neglected dewclaws can grow so long that they curl around and dig back into the flesh. If your canine has dewclaws, keep a close eye on them, and don't let them get long. They should be a part of your dog's weekly examination. Checking Other Parts of the Body Your weekly grooming/examination session should include looking inside the ears. Look for redness, inflammation, or excessive discharge. Smell them regularly so that you can detect any early signs of infection. Talk to your vet about the best way to clean your dog's ears, as well as how regularly they should be cleaned. You should also keep an eye on your dog's teeth. Gum disease is rampant among canines. If you're not giving your dogs fresh bones to chew on (see chapters 16 and 17), you should be brushing your dog's teeth regularly to keep them clean. Gum infections can be particularly dangerous for older dogs, so pay close attention to the color of your dog's gums; look for redness or puffiness. Catching Problems One of the main benefits of regularly handling your dog through grooming is that you will pick up slight changes in his body. Brushing and rubbing your dog allows you to examine his coat and his skin. You'll feel lumps and bumps before

130

they grow large. Discuss anything that worries you with your veterinarian. Coat and skin changes can indicate serious problems within your dog's body (like thyroid problems), so it's important to monitor them. Watts had a melanoma removed from her Doberman while it was still a spot on his skin. She was so familiar with every inch of his body that, as she was examining his skin, she picked up on it even before it was a lump. Early detection can be vital in treating cancer, so this grooming process is also an important preventive health measure. Regularly examining your dog can also help you to catch nasty ticks. If you're not using a tick preventive, you should examine your dog daily for ticks during tick season, since the insect must be attached for at least twenty-four hours before it transmits Lyme disease. Bathing How often should you bathe your dog? "When she starts to smell bad," Watts says. If you find that your dog needs a bath more often than she used to, mention it to your vet. Bathing doesn't have to be a traumatic experience. We bathe our poodles in the bathtub, using a special hose purchased for the purpose. It attaches to the shower. Its nozzle lies flat against the dog's coat, which allows a thorough rinsing. Doggie bathtubs are now available to make bathing less of a chore. The Booster Bath, made by Paws for Thought, is a portable plastic tub on a pedestal, which gets an enthusiastic thumbs-up from Ann Daugherty. She bathes three Samoyeds in it. "I love it!" she says. Selecting a Professional Groomer "It is a leap of faith when you take your dog to the groomer," admits Watts. It can be scary to leave your dog somewhere without being able to witness what happens to her there. Most grooming shops prefer that you drop off your dog in the morning and pick her up in the afternoon--owners aren't usually welcome to watch, since it can interfere with the groomer's work. Watts says that of the dogs whose owners have stayed with them, one or two have behaved better in the owner's presence, but most are better behaved without their owners on hand.

131

Watts advises interviewing potential groomers in advance. Ask to see the facility, and inquire about sanitizing procedures. Ask what would happen if the dog were to become ill or injured on the grooming table. ("In order to cut hair, you have to use sharp scissors and clippers; sometimes accidents happen," says Watts. "Even the best groomer in the world occasionally has accidents.") See how the groomer interacts with the dogs in his care. Trust your instincts. Even if the groomer has immaculate facilities and says all the right things, if you're not comfortable with him, don't leave your dog there. "Always trust your gut," Watts says. If you take your dog in for a second grooming at a shop, and your dog is resistant to going in, pay attention to that signal; ask the groomer about how your dog behaved the last time he was groomed. The groomers answer can reveal a lot about her attitude toward your dog. Again, follow your gut. Even if you use a professional groomer, your dog still needs you to check her regularly. "A really big owner responsibility is to put their hands on their dog on a regular basis," says Watts. "Thoroughly check her out." Building Your Bond Like bathing, grooming your dog doesn't have to be a chore. If you do it regularly, it can be a pleasant time. Handling your dog in a loving manner feels good to both of you. Just ask Daugherty, who grooms her three double-coated dogs once a week: "In addition to keeping my dogs looking and feeling great, the time I spend grooming them affords me some intimate, one-on-one time with each dog. When I set up my grooming table, my three Samoyeds all start doing the 'pick me' dance, each hoping he or she will be the first one chosen for some special table time with Mom." Here's your chance to spend some quality time focusing on your dog. For both of you, it can be a loving oasis in a busy week.

132

133 Chapter 19 Dogs Belong with Their Families Dogs are pack animals. Their ancestors, wolves, traveled in packs. When we acquire a dog, we become his pack. Dogs need time with us--it's part of their genetic makeup. When you force your dog to live away from his pack, you're not only making him miserable (and asking him to find his own ways to entertain himself), but you're also missing out on the wonderful companionship a dog can provide. -DON'T BANISH YOUR DOG TO AN OUTDOOR LIFE Whenever I see a dog who lives outdoors all of the time--in summer or winter, rain or shine--I wonder why the owner even bothers to have a dog. Dogs excel at keeping us company. When you're in the presence of a canine, you're not alone. They enjoy our company as much (if not more) than we enjoy theirs. So why

134 exile a dog to his yard? If you want to spend time with your outdoor dog, you have to make a special effort. When your dog lives in the house, you can spend time together just by living. In the U.S. penal system, an inmates worst punishment (aside from death) is solitary confinement. Yet, that's just what we subject our dogs to when they're kept alone in the yard. "Solitary confinement makes people crazy, why wouldn't it make a dog insane?" asks pet-care columnist Gina Spadafori. Why do people leave their dogs in the yard? Some people were brought up to believe that dogs belong outdoors. For them, it's inconceivable to think of a dog in their house. Others banish their dog because he's not fully housetrained, or perhaps he's destructive. Through the use of humane confinement indoors, however, a canine can be easily housetrained and taught to chew only on appropriate items. When you leave your dog alone all day in the yard (or even with a canine companion) you're asking for trouble. "It's not fair to ask an intelligent pack animal to live alone in a backyard and do nothing all day. It's not possible for him to do that," Spadafori says. Your dog will have to entertain himself somehow to relieve the sheer boredom. The result? Barking, digging, fence jumping, or destruction. "He's just got to get the ya-yas out," Spadafori believes. "It's what he has to do to maintain his sanity." Indoor-Outdoor Dogs Even if your dog spends time indoors with you when you're home, he's better off inside the house when you're away from home. If he's not completely trustworthy, confine him. (See chapters 2 and 10 for more information on confining and crating.) But if he's indoors, he's less likely to bother neighbors with his barking and, in general, he's safer. (See chapter 15 for information on backyard hazards.) Dog trainer Sue Sternberg of Accord, New York, feels that leaving dogs in the yard gives them too much freedom. "I think that when I leave my dogs out, I'm just allowing them to run amok, which can lead to behavioral problems. They're like wild animals on their own out there. They're making up their own rules." Indoors, it's quieter, and there are plenty of distractions, she notes, so there's less to bark at. "Indoors means sleep rather than play and bark."

135

Spadafori's dogs have what she considers an ideal situation: a dog door. They can go in and out as they please. They're not barkers, so she doesn't worry that they'll disturb the neighbors when she's not home. We have a yard, but Kramer and Scout are never in it unsupervised. Its fence is wrought-iron and quite short--only 4 feet high. If they wanted to, the dogs could jump it (though they've never shown an inclination). I'm more worried about someone either opening the gate or actually stealing them. So our dogs--confirmed indoor pets--stay in the yard only for a few minutes at a time, and always have a human watching them. Most of their outdoor time is spent on their walks. If you have a yard but no fence, be judicious about tying your dog out. While this practice is better than letting him go un tethered, it's not a good idea to leave a dog tied out unsupervised. When a dog is tied out without a fence to protect him, he's vulnerable to anyone or anything that enters the yard. If a dog is tied, he knows he can't run. If he is frightened and can't run away from the object of his fear, he has no choice but to lash out. (It's the old "fight or flight" rule.) Tying your dog out is a good way to get her hurt, and make her aggressive. It's safer for dog owners without a fenced yard to put their dog on-leash and walk him. If you're outside with your dog and can protect him, a tie out can be a good way to let your dog keep you company as you garden (assuming you're not using power tools, which can be dangerous). Dogs Who Prefer the Outdoors I realize that some dogs love being outside. Northern breeds, in particular, just love the great outdoors, especially when it's cold. Chugach, an Alaskan malamute owned by Stephen Peters of Marquette, Michigan, made his preference for sleeping outdoors clear to his owner. Chugach recently succumbed after a long fight with cancer, and Peters kept him indoors as he was healing from surgery. When he was healthy enough, Chugach spent a good deal of his time outdoors; Peters joined him if the weather was nice. He'd ask to come inside every night about 9:15, and then the two would go for a walk. Chugach would get his bedtime biscuit, and then head outside. The malamute also stayed outside during the day while Peters was at work. He was in a secure 25- by 8-foot run that had a doghouse on one end and a shade over the first 8 feet, so that he could get out of the sun without going into the doghouse.

136

This preference for being outdoors is not uncommon among Northern breeds, says Peters, who lives in a very cool climate. "The Northern breeds like to be as cool as possible at any time of the year. Malamutes have special'circuitry' to keep them warm in cold weather, but it does not kick in until temperatures get to about 35 degrees below zero. Anything warmer than that, and their normal coat will do quite nicely," Peters explains. Chugach would ask to come in when it was raining ("he seemed to think that malamutes would melt in the rain") and, of course, for meals. The crucial difference between dogs like Chugach and those who always live outdoors is that Chugach was a true member of the family. He was invited indoors whenever his owner was home. He was kept outside during the day, because Peters felt he was happier there. The two spent quality time together. Chugach's outdoor time was his choice. If you have a dog you feel prefers the great outdoors, spend ample time with him, either indoors or outdoors. You need to make sure he gets his exercise, and that you take him for walks. This way, his territory can expand beyond his borders. Dogs are territorial, but they like their territory to grow, says Spadafori. They like to see new things. So it's important that you don't limit your dog to your yard. "Certain breeds are quite happy outdoors," Spadafori says, "but that's no excuse for ignoring their need for family." Watchdogs If you keep your dog in the yard in order to deter unwanted visitors, think how much safer you'd be if your dog were in the house with you. If you're worried about intruders, keep a large dog-food bowl in the yard. Such a practice provides a warning that a dog is around. But if someone were able to get into your house, you'd feel a lot better with your dog standing between you and the intruder than you would if he were out in the yard. "What good is a protection dog if he's out in the yard?" asks Spadafori. Bringing the Outdoor Dog Inside If you've been keeping your dog outdoors and have a change of heart about it, rest assured that you can transform him into an indoor dog. Many formerly outdoor

137

dogs are adopted to new homes as adults and successfully make the transition into indoor life. If your dog isn't completely housetrained, consult chapter 2 for information on that process. If you're worried he'll be destructive, chapters 2 and 11 provide information on crate training and confinement. They also discuss chew-toy training, which can keep your dog from chewing up your belongings. Chloe, an Irish setter (a breed not known for its watchdog abilities), spent at least three years tied up outside a vacant home in Norman, Oklahoma. Her owners had moved without selling the home, and left Chloe behind to guard the house. Concerned neighbors took the setter away from this lonely existence and, with the permission of her former owners, Chloe was adopted by Lavinia Kay Frank. This onetime outdoor-only dog immediately became a convert to the wonders of living inside. She joined Frank's two other dogs and seamlessly made the transition to indoor life. The only remnant of her past is her occasional reluctance to venture out in the yard alone. Frank has to put Chloe on-leash and walk her out to the patio to pee before she leaves for work in the morning. "When I put the lead on her, she knows we'll both be coming back inside," Frank suspects. Just imagine how desirable a warm house full of people must be to an outdoor dog on a cold winter's day. When I see dogs that are kept outside, I think about how much they must yearn for a little snuggle time on the couch with their owner. Your dog will be happier and safer indoors, and he'll provide you with what he's best at: great companionship. If you're not enjoying that now, you don't know what you're missing.

138

139 Chapter 20 Spay or Neuter Your Dog If you're considering the possibility of breeding your dog (or profiting from your male dog's stud services), please consider a few facts. Thousands of dogs are killed every day in animal shelters simply because nobody wants them. In our society, it seems puppies are brought into this world only to be killed. It's a national tragedy you contribute to if you breed your dog outside of an established, responsible program. Even if you find homes for your dog's puppies, you're contributing to the problem, because the homes you find are those that could go to other animals. -DON'T LET YOUR DOG BREED (EXCEPT UNDER IDEAL CIRCUMSTANCES) I can hear your objection: "But I have a purebred dog. She has papers." Even owners of purebred dogs shouldn't breed their pets unless it is part of a carefully planned program to further the breed.

140

Breeding your sweet golden retriever with the neighbor's golden simply won't do, given the current pet overpopulation crisis. If you want to breed your animal, you should run a series of genetic tests to make sure that your dog won't pass any health problems on to her puppies. A Breeder's Responsibilities If you want to become a breeder, you should satisfy the requirements mentioned in chapter 1. Everything said there about a good breeder should apply to you-- which isn't easy. Genetic tests are just the tip of the iceberg. A good breeder has done research and carefully selected the breeding partner for the dog in order to create a litter that exemplifies the breed's best and healthiest traits. "A good breeder breeds only the best to the best," says Gina Spadafori. Responsible breeders make a serious commitment to the puppies they breed. "They have to be responsible for these lives that they bring into the world," says Chris Walkowicz, a longtime breeder first of German shepherds, and now bearded collies. As a responsible breeder, you promise to take into your home any puppy you've bred for any reason, any time. "You have to understand that eight years from now, somebody might get a divorce and call you and say 'I have no home for Buster, will you take him back?'" The answer to that question must be yes, says Walkowicz. It's part of the commitment you make when you decide to breed. You can ensure that your dog is worthy of breeding--that is, exemplifies what is best about the breed--by showing your dog and having her win titles. Knowledgeable puppy buyers know that this is the hallmark of a good breeder. If you compete in conformation shows, where your dog is judged solely on the basis of how she conforms to the breed standard, she can earn the title Champion. Most pedigrees of well-bred dogs are littered with the initials Ch. before the dog's ancestors' names. Finishing a championship isn't a prerequisite for breeding, says Walkowicz, but any dog you consider breeding should prove herself in the competitive arena that interests you. That might be obedience, herding, lure coursing, or any one

141

of a number of activities. The point is, the dog should excel in something, as well as being a good, healthy example of the breed. Breeders should be dedicated to the breed, not to their individual dog, Walkowicz says. Rescue Many breeders also participate in purebred rescue groups, whose members help individual dogs of their favorite breed. If a purebred dog shows up at a shelter, the purebred rescue group for that breed takes the animal out of the shelter, evaluates the dog, and provides foster care while looking for a good home for him. This is a way for breeders to give back to their breed. Breeding Is Expensive! Some people get dollar signs in their eyes when they think about breeding their dog. But the truth of the matter is, when breeding is done right, there's little money to be made, despite the fact that responsible breeders can and should get top dollar for their puppies. A good breeder is lucky to break even, Walkowicz points out. Mary Lynn D'Aubin of Scottsdale, Arizona, has two Labrador retrievers, Ike and Babs. D'Aubin was considering breeding Babs and so hadn't spayed her. Her husband was reluctant to neuter Ike (a reluctance not uncommon in human males). They went to great effort to keep the two dogs apart during Babs's heat cycle. But there's little stronger than the will of an intact male dog when he's around a bitch in heat. D'Aubin came home one day to find that Ike had broken out of his crate and through a sliding glass door in order to join Babs in the backyard. Babs gave birth to nine puppies, two of whom were stillborn. D'Aubin calculates that, with Babs's prenatal veterinary visits, shipping the last puppy to his new home, and everything in between, she spent $ 1,400 on routine expenses every breeder would doubtless incur, and another $2,100 in transportation and medical expenses. She earned $1,850 on the sale of the puppies.

142

"I lost about $1,650 on this litter," D'Aubin says. "Granted, there were a number of unusual expenses, and I covered costs that most [breeders] wouldn't have, but some of the costs I absorbed are not out of line for ethical breeders." The costs go beyond the monetary--to the emotional. "One cannot factor in time, caring, sleeplessness, heartache over sick/dead puppies, anxiety, and working full-time and caretaking the rest of the time," she says. The messy puppies also put a strain on her marriage. However, puppies also bring a lot of happiness. "The pure unadulterated joy in those little lives is so awesome, it hides the costs somewhat." D'Aubin spayed Babs after her litter was born, but she says she would consider breeding again-- but only after more careful planning. "No more accidental breedings!" Spaying and Neutering Are Good for Your Dog If after reading this chapter you don't feel you're up to the commitment or expense of breeding, you can take great comfort in knowing that spaying or neutering is actually good for your dog. It's not only the right thing to do (under almost all circumstances), but it's also the healthy thing to do. Consider this: A female dog that is spayed before her first heat greatly reduces her chances of getting mammary (breast) cancer. If you spay your dog before her [-POOCH POINTER THE BENEFITS OF SPAYING OR NEUTERING YOUR DOG -Your dog won't contribute to pet overpopulation. -Neutered dogs tend to be less aggressive. -Territorial marking is reduced. -Chances of testicular and ovarian cancers are eliminated. -Chances of prostate and mammary cancers are reduced. -The urge to mate is eliminated, and the inclination to roam is reduced. -No need to fend off suitors when a female is in heat. -No staining from a female in heat. ]

first heat, her relative risk of breast cancer is .05 percent. If she goes through one heat cycle, that risk is 8 percent. Let her have two or more heat cycles, and she has a 26 percent chance of getting breast cancer, according to data supplied by the AKC's Canine Health Foundation. Spaying, during which the uterus is removed, also eliminates the risk of uterine cancer, as well as the chances of uterine infection, which is not uncommon in intact females. Neutering your male eliminates the chance that he'l get testicular cancer; it reduces the possibility of prostate cancer and prostate enlargement. A neutered male is likely to have fewer fights, which is also better for his health. Behavioral Advantages Frankly, I have a hard time imagining living with an unaltered dog. A neutered male is much less likely to be the target of negative attention from other dogs. In the off-leash park we visit, it's common for an unneutered male to be greeted with a snarl when he joins a group of dogs. Unneutered males are more likely to act aggressively in general. Most fatal dog attacks involve unneutered adolescent males, says pet expert Spadafori. A neutered male won't go on the single-minded quest for the bitch in heat. As the D'Aubins' Labrador, Ike, illustrates, that inclination is difficult to thwart. Intact males can become amazing escape artists. Neutered males mark less (though certainly neutered males and even females do mark their territory--but not as often in the house), and they don't spend their time being sexually frustrated. If it's the look of a neutered male that troubles you, you're in luck. You can now buy Neuticles, testicular implants that your vet can insert to make your neutered male look completely intact. Un spayed female dogs are more aloof and moody, says Spadafori. "They go through PMS just like we do," she says. When Spadafori put an end to the show career of her flat-coated retriever, Heather, and had her spayed, she was amazed at the change in her dog's disposition. "She's a lot sweeter, a little bit clingier, and a little bit more loving." While it's never too late to neuter your dog (I know people who had to have their fifteen-year-old Lab neutered due to testicular cancer), the earlier it's done, the easier it is on the dog. Vets have been neutering puppies as young as eight

144

weeks old for more than a decade, and have not discovered negative effects later in the dog's life. Such early spay and neuter is one way shelters can release puppies and kittens to new homes and know that they won't be receiving their offspring a year later. Estimates vary on the number of dogs annually euthanized in our country. I've seen figures as low as 1.5 million and as high as 15 million. Whatever the exact number, it's too many. Be a part of the solution, and do the right thing: Spay or neuter your dog.

145

Chapter 21 Keep Up with the Times It can be challenging to raise a dog. If you're a caring dog owner, you want the best for your dog. You know she's depending on you for everything. Part of the challenge is that the current thinking--the most acceptable way to do things with and for your dog--keeps changing. Don't let the evolving philosophies frustrate you. View them as an opportunity. Dogs are being treated more gently than ever. They're being recognized as thinking, feeling creatures. They're truly becoming part of the family. We owe it to our dogs to keep abreast of current thinking and not be satisfied to do things the way our parents did, just because it's familiar. Dog training and veterinary care are evolving. Stay on top of the changes. It's easier now than ever before to do that. -DON'T STOP LEARNING In 1992, when Kramer joined our family as a puppy, I read books, talked to experts (the vet, trainer, and knowledgeable dog owners), and did the best for him that I could. Eight years later, I do almost everything differently from what I did in 1992. The one constant has been my abiding love and concern for his wel -being.

146

Back then, I vaccinated him every year, fed him dry kibble, walked him with a choke chain, gave him antibiotics at the drop of a hat, even tried doing an alpha rol (where I would roll him on his back to show him I was the boss), and scruff shake (where I would grab him by the scruff of the neck and growl in his face) when he misbehaved. I was following advice I'd been given. Most of it felt bad to me. Now, I feed him a healthy home-prepared diet with nutritional supplements; no longer vaccinate except where required by law (after years of annual vaccinations, he has a lifetime of immunity, my holistic vet assures me); use a flat collar; train him with a clicker and treats; care for his health homeopathically; and hardly ever yell at him, let alone physically punish him. What happened? Did I change? I think of it as evolving. I have my own research and the Internet to thank for my evolution. I subscribe to a number of Internet mailing lists, populated by knowledgeable dog people and professionals. These lists have allowed me to keep up with current thinking in health care and training for my dogs. I have a place where I can ask questions and learn from others' experiences. The result is that I'm treating my dogs more gently and spend much less time being frustrated with them. They're happier, I'm happier, everybody wins. If I were stuck in my 1992 mentality, I'm convinced, I'd have less healthy, more neurotic dogs. How to Stay Abreast Where can you keep up with the ever-changing thinking on dog training, behavior, and health? Reading books like this is a start. As is subscribing to and reading dog magazines and newsletters (see Resources). But it's the twenty-first century, and the Internet is king. It's the place to go for up-to-the-minute information and to "meet" people who have been through the various situations you seek help on. The Internet First, a warning about the Internet. Be discerning about the information you gather here. Unlike books and magazine articles, which usually go through several layers of review before publication, the Internet is full of information that

147

may have little basis in fact. Read everything with a grain of salt, and look for supporting information. One of the nice things about Internet mailing lists is that after you subscribe for a while, you can get to know the people a little who post messages and judge whether they're knowledgeable. After some time, you develop a trust with these "virtual friends" (and actual strangers, since you probably have never met). Then it's like taking advice from a trusted ally. Internet mailing lists are a kind of electronic bul etin board. Each individual list is set up to bring together people with a common interest. Send a note to the list, and everyone who subscribes to it receives your note in their Email (or posted to a Web site if that's how they prefer to read it). It's a great, immediate way to receive lots of information, as well as a wonderful way to belong to a virtual community. Mailing lists exist for most dog breeds, and they're frequently specific in the interest addressed. For example, there's a list for setter owners who feed raw diets to their dogs. There's a list for owners of shy dogs. There are any number of lists for owners interested in natural health care for their animals. I'm on a list for dogs with immune problems. There are also some wonderful, more general lists, like canine-1 or critter-chat, which simply supply a means for people who love dogs to talk about them. They address more general interests or a wider variety of topics. There are several ways to find an Internet mailing list that suits your needs. One is to go to e-groups at www.egroups.com. Do a general or specific search (for example, "epileptic dogs"), and the appropriate lists come up. With a couple of clicks of the mouse, you can subscribe. Other dog-related mailing lists can be found at www.k9web.com/dog-faqs/lists/email-list.htm. Once you subscribe to a list, you'll receive a welcome message from the list owner and probably be urged to introduce yourself. You sometimes have to send a message confirming that you want to subscribe (to prevent people from subscribing you to a list you're not interested in). A mailing list is what you make it. Some people, "lurkers," read but don't post to the list. That's fine. Others are frequent posters. I post on some lists and lurk on others (depending upon whether I have anything useful to say). The mailing lists I stay on don't allow "flame wars," whereby people get into nasty E-mail arguments. When flaming begins, the list owner usually comes down on the offenders.

148 Be forewarned: These lists can be very time-consuming. Depending on the volume (and number) of the lists to which you subscribe, you might receive hundreds of messages a day. In my E-mail program, I set up folders for each list I'm on, and ask the program to automatically sort the incoming messages into the folders. That helps to keep the messages from becoming unmanageable. Internet newsgroups, which are accessed via a newsreader, are open to the public and tend to be more of a free-for-all. Anyone can access a newsgroup and post there. My attempts at getting dog-related information from newsgroups haven't been terribly successful. The information I've found has tended to be general and oriented toward the new dog owner. But I'm sure others have had much more success. To use newsgroups, go to your newsreader and search for the topic you're interested in. Like mailing lists, there are general, as well as specific newsgroups. Anyone with Internet access can put up a Web site. Thousands of dog-related sites are available to peruse. The trick to finding good sites is using a good search engine (my two favorites are www.google.com and www.askjeeves.com). Subscribers to mailing lists also frequently post the addresses for good sites they've found. Again, bear in mind that most Web sites have not gone through a review process, so be sure to verify the information you find on them. Web sites that are put together by reputable organizations carry more weight, in my opinion, than those put up by individuals. In the anonymous world of the Internet, a Web site with an authoritative-sounding name could actually be written and run by a thirteen-year-old. Conferences As wonderful as the Internet is, it's no substitute for face-to-face contact with people. Several dog-related conferences bring together experts and allow interaction with the dog-owning participants. Several groups sponsor such conferences. Check out the following Web sites to see if there's a conference near you: Puppy works (www.puppyworks.com). The single most valuable conference I think I've attended was Puppyworks's "Holistic Healthy Dog Conference," in 1999. It changed the lives of my dogs and me. The Association of Pet Dog Trainers (www.adpt.com), an organization that promotes positive training methods, holds a national conference every year for

149

trainers. The public can attend (for a fee). In conjunction with the conference, the organization puts on a terrific trade show--open to the public--which features training equipment. The conference moves around from year to year. APDT's Web site also lists events sponsored by other organizations. Legacy by Mail (www.legacy-by-mail.com), trainer Terry Ryan's organization, offers a variety of workshops, as well as a behavior and training camp. Dog Camps Dog camps are springing up around the country. These camps, where you can vacation with your dog, are not only a great way to bond with your dog, but they can also present a lot of valuable information. Your time spent at dog camp is a rare week where al the attention is focused on the dogs, their needs, and enjoyment. Each camp offers athletic events, such as agility and flyball, training, and, frequently, lectures on dog care. Here are just a few: Camp Gone to the Dogs in Vermont; the Dog's Camp in North Carolina; Camp Winnaribbun in Nevada; Dog Scout Camp in Michigan; and Dog Days of Wisconsin in, where else, Wisconsin. I have a special reason for mentioning dog camps as a source of information. Kramer and I attended Camp Gone to the Dogs in 1998, and had a great time. I've often written about that camp and have spoken with many people who said that what they learned at camp changed the way they treat their dogs' training and health care. And what a fun way to learn! Thanks to the Internet, staying on top of the latest information on what's best for your dog isn't hard. There's no reason to make decisions for your dog based on decades-old information, nor do you have to take advice from your hairdresser whose neighbor "raises" dogs. Keep your eyes open for new sources of information, and don't stop learning. You and your dog have so much to gain.

Chapter 22 The More the Merrier? Acquiring a canine companion for your dog can be a wonderful idea. Dogs are pack animals, and if you have to leave them alone all day, the company of a canine pal might make the time pass more quickly and pleasantly. But it's not a situation to enter into lightly. Two dogs can be more than twice the work of one. And if you're getting a dog in the hopes of fixing behavioral problems you're having with your current dog, you might just end up with two ill-behaved dogs on your hands. -DON'T ADD ANOTHER DOG WITHOUT SERIOUS PREPARATION Before you add a dog to your household, make sure you've thought about the extra work and expense. You'll have twice the training and grooming, twice the food and supplies, and twice the veterinary and boarding costs. Make sure you are strong enough to handle both dogs on-leash, and that your bank account is strong enough to handle the added expenses.

152

Be sure you're adding the dog for the right reasons, which include having extra love to pass around. In our household, two dogs and two humans is the perfect ratio. There's always a free hand available to scratch a canine head or belly. There are also a lot of wrong reasons to add a dog. Don't get a second dog because you don't have time for the first. If you don't have time for one, you certainly won't have time for two. Don't add a second dog just because you feel guilty about leaving your pet alone. Don't add a dog so you won't have to exercise the dog you already own. "A second dog is not a substitute for sufficient outdoor exercise," says Robin Kovary, a New York City-based dog trainer and behaviorist, and director of the American Dog Trainers Network. "A second dog might make a great playmate, but both dogs will require daily outdoor exercise to keep them happy, healthy, and well behaved." (See chapter 9 for more information about the importance of exercise.) Don't bring a new dog into your home if you are having behavioral problems with your existing dog. "Your first dog should be obedience-trained and fully housebroken before you bring in another dog," Kovary says. Take the time to modify any problem behavior before you bring in another dog. Adding a second won't solve behavioral problems; in fact, it might double them. "You wouldn't want your dog teaching a puppy a behavior that drives you nuts," says Char Bebiak, head trainer/behaviorist for Ralston Purina Co. "Then you have two dogs doing it." Before bringing home another dog, make sure your dog is emotionally ready for a permanent playmate. Look closely at his behavior. How does he interact with other dogs? Does he like to play? Is he properly socialized? Is he accepting of dogs in his own home? Invite some of his playmates over to make sure he's comfortable with having other dogs around. If you can answer "yes" to the above questions, then your dog might well be a good candidate for a new brother or sister. If you tend to spoil and pamper your dog, and he sometimes challenges you, adding another one to the mix might be courting trouble. Your dog will likely be threatened by the newcomer and be unwilling to share you. Get your relationship with your dog squared away before adding another.

153

Choosing the Second Dog Choosing a second dog is much like choosing your first. The same considerations of time, breed preferences, and lifestyle apply. Look at chapter 1 to help you consider some of your options. If possible, your dogs should meet before adopting the new dog. Carefully watch their reactions to one another. The big difference in adding a second dog is that you're making decisions relative to your first one. Gender Should you add a dog of the same or opposite sex of your resident dog? As a general rule, dogs of opposite sex--provided that they are neutered--are the best match. The worst match is two unneutered males. Size The two dogs shouldn't be so different in size as to cause possible injury to one another. For example, a Yorkie might have a hard time with the addition of a mastiff. Age Should you get a puppy or an adult dog? Your resident dog might be more accepting of a puppy, but he also might become exhausted by a youngster. You know your dog best; try to imagine whether a puppy would breathe new life into him or turn him into a crabby old dog. If you decide to get a puppy, remember that they tend to be more work for the human family members than adult dogs. An adult dog might seem like a greater threat to your dog, but if you bring them together gradually and work hard to avert jealousy by paying a great deal of attention to your first dog, your transition should be smooth. While adult dogs can have the disadvantage of your not knowing their background, many seem so grateful to find themselves in a good home that they bond instantly and make great pets. This was certainly the case with Scout.

154

If your dog is elderly--that is, more than nine years old--you might reconsider adding a dog, says Bebiak. Turning his life upside down could be detrimental to him. Introducing the New Dog When it's time to bring your new dog home, introduce the two on neutral ground if possible. This reduces the chance for territorial behavior on the part of your dog ("this is my yard!"). Then, walk home together. Bebiak favors keeping your resident dog off-leash during the introduction period. If you can't find any neutral territory, where your dog can be safely off-leash, she recommends introducing the dogs in your fenced yard. If you don't have one, use your imagination. Perhaps you could borrow a friend's yard or an apartment. Have your resident dog off-leash in the yard (or other location), and bring the new dog in on-leash. Let them sniff and greet, and praise them both like crazy. As leader of the pack, you should set the tone for the meeting. By keeping the encounter upbeat, you can reassure your first dog that the newcomer is a good thing. Once the initial greeting and explorations are over, bring the second dog into the house, and put her into her crate. Let your resident dog come in, see, and smel her so she'll be safe in the knowledge that the new dog isn't taking over the house. [-POOCH POINTER BE PREPARED Each dog should have his own food bowl, water bowl, and toys (including chew toys and plush toys). Your new dog will also need his own collar and leash. Each should also have a crate, which is an essentialtool for helping separate the dogs. It gives them their own space, and the first dog some time to be alone,by himself, or with you. Before bringing your new dog home, put away all the toys, so that there's nothing for either dog to bepossessive about, Kovary suggests. ]

155

Over the course of the next two to four weeks, bring the dogs together slowly, under supervision. This is tough advice to follow, because it's hard to muster the patience to keep the dogs apart. When you bring them together, read the dogs' signals, and separate them if there's any tension or aggression. "They will have a whole lifetime together, so why rush them?" Bebiak asks. Living with Two Dogs When you add a dog, your primary dog should maintain his primary status. He needs reassuring that his relationship with you hasn't changed. Feed him first, pet him first, give him treats first. Share some time alone together. Kovary suggests that when visitors come to your home or greet you on a walk, ask them to pet your primary dog first, which helps to keep him from feeling displaced. The second dog should earn privileges, Bebiak says. Don't give her all the fringe benefits that the resident dog has earned. Make her earn them herself. While you should initially maintain your first dog's primary status, if the second dog emerges as the dominant personality, don't try to change the natural order of things by favoring the first dog, or by reprimanding nonviolent dominant behavior. "Intervening only disturbs the natural balance," Kovary says. "You cannot make a dominant dog subordinate to a subordinate dog." If you try, you'll end up with two unhappy dogs, as well as the potential for fighting. Watch for any sign of hostility, and pay close attention to body language. Be careful not to put the dogs in situations that can spark an altercation over food, toys, or even human family members. Feed the dogs separately, each with his own food bowl and water bowl. They should also have separate beds, crates, and toys. After the transition is complete and the two dogs are getting along famously, they may care to share toys, which is fine. My dogs share a water bowl as well, but I always supervise them when they're eating--Scout steals Kramer's food if she thinks she can get away with it. When you can't watch them together during those first few weeks--even if you just leave the room to answer the phone--keep them apart by using baby gates, exercise pens, or crates. You don't want an unexpected altercation.

156

New Problems Even with these precautions, you might see some brand-new behavioral problems in your first dog. If he's feeling ignored, he may misbehave in order to get your attention. "He may act out as a way to say, 'are you still paying attention to me?'" Bebiak says. In this situation, soiling the house is not unusual for even the most faithfully housetrained dog. The jealousy is natural, and should dissipate with time, if you remember to give both dogs plenty of love and each some special time alone with you. Watching your dogs become accustomed to one another and turn into fast friends is a thrill. It's worth the effort to do it right. The decision to add a dog to your household has a long-term impact on your family dynamics and your pocketbook. Plan ahead, make sure you're ready (and that your dog is ready as well), and give both dogs the time and space they need to get to know one another. Two dogs are twice the love and twice the fun as one. They're also twice the trouble. There are eight muddy paws to wipe instead of four; two dogs' worth of poop to scoop instead of one; twice the toenails to clip; and two leashes to untangle. But two dogs also mean two tongues to kiss you, four eyes to gaze at you lovingly, and two bellies to rub. That can definitely be worth the extra effort.

157

Chapter 23 Kids and Dogs Dogs and kids make a great combination. Many of us have fond memories of growing up with a loving childhood dog. Whether you're adding a baby to a family that already includes a dog, or adding a dog to a family with kids, you need to take steps to ensure that the kids and dogs live together happily--and safely. -DON'T FORGET TO PREPARE YOUR DOG FOR YOUR NEW BABY If your dog has long been a member of your family, she's used to your constant attention, and playing adult-type games with you, like wrestling on the floor and tug-of-war. When a new baby joins the family, the rules change. Behaviors that were allowable when your dog did them to you--like jumping up, mouthing, and licking--may seem inappropriate after the baby arrives. That's why you need to prepare your dog ahead of time. "The notion of the baby coming home and the dog instantly loving it is what we all hope for, but if you don't inform the dog ahead of time, it can be a confusing time," says dog trainer Sarah Wilson. "Making some changes ahead of time can make it so much smoother for all concerned."

158

Wilson recommends, for example, that you change your praise words if you, like many people, call your dog"good boy" or "good girl." Start telling him he's a "good dog" instead. Otherwise, when you tell your baby, "Oh, you're such a smart boy!" the dog might well come running over and stick his head in between you and your infant. If you scold him, he'll be completely confused. "I think a lot of things that people sometimes label as jealousy are actually confusion and stress on the dog's part," Wilson says. If your dog jumps up on you, leaps into your lap, climbs up on the couch without being invited, or grabs items out of your hands, you'll need to change the rules before the baby arrives, Wilson says. "It doesn't have to be an unpleasant process. It can be positive." When your dog understands the new rules, you won't experience these difficulties after the baby arrives. You can imagine, for example, how unpleasant it would be for you, your dog, and your baby if your dog were to jump into your lap with the infant already there. Introducing the New Baby I've always heard that prior to bringing home the baby, new parents should bring home a hospital blanket the baby's been sleeping on, so that the baby's scent will be familiar to the dog. I asked Wilson whether that was good advice. "I don't see how it could hurt," she replied. "But I also don't see any particular plus." Instead, Wilson says, it is a better idea for the mother or father to sleep with a baby blanket one night, and then wrap the baby in that blanket when she is brought home from the hospital and introduced to the dog. The canine will then recognize that the new little bundle has a familiar scent and is therefore part of the family. When you introduce the dog and baby, Wilson advises having one adult handle the dog, on-leash, while the other parent holds the baby. Your dog will probably be curious about the new baby. He'll want to look and sniff her. "Stay relaxed and sound relaxed, but be ready in case the dog gets too curious and wants to stuff his nose down the diaper," Wilson says. You can then say "leave it," and call the dog away. (This assumes that you've taught your dog the leave it command, which is usually part of any training class.) What you don't want to do, says Wilson, is stand next to the dog, hold your breatli, and chant rapidly, "It's okay, it's just a baby; it's okay, it's just a baby."

159

Since dogs take their cues from us, such nervous chanting tells your dog that this is something you're concerned about. "You want to be relaxed and happy, praise the dog, let him know that this is a wonderful addition to all of your lives, that this is nothing to be worried about." How Will You (are for Your Dog? Before the baby arrives, make plans to ensure that your dog will still get the exercise she needs. You'll be exhausted and sleep-deprived, but it won't do you (or your dog) any good to have an under exercised dog underfoot. Arrange for a friend or neighbor to walk your dog, or have someone sit with the baby while you and the dog take a walk and share some quality time. A friend could stroll with you and hold your dog's leash while you walk with the baby. Depending on your dog and your baby, you may be able to walk both at the same time, but don't count on it. When Barbara O'Rourke of Lakeport, California, gave birth to twin girls nine years ago, she wished she'd prepared herself and her boxers, Archie and Beau. "I was overwhelmed with fatigue, poopy diapers, and nonstop feedings," recalls O'Rourke. "I am sure my dogs felt excluded, confused, and hurt during those first few months." Friends and neighbors offered to help out the new mother, and, looking back, O'Rourke wishes she'd accepted their aid and arranged for them to walk the dogs with her while she walked the babies. (She found walking the two dogs with the twins' stroller unwieldy and impossible.) But after the babies arrived, "I couldn't even begin to think about anything but getting through the day." O'Rourke advises other dog-owning couples to plan--before the baby arrives--for how the dog's needs will be met during the first few hectic months after bringing home baby. "You would never forsake your human children when you brought home a puppy," she says. "Don't forsake the pups because you brought home a baby." Childproofing Your Dog A crate is an essential tool for any dog living with a child. It's imperative that you not leave your dog and baby or toddler alone together, so you'll need to separate them. You'll doubtless have a playpen for your child, and the crate serves as a playpen for your dog. You'll not only be able to crate your dog when necessary,

160

but your dog will also be able to crate herself when she needs to take a time-out. Teach your child that the dog's crate is off-limits. Your child must not enter it, and he must leave the dog alone when she's inside. If your dog isn't crate-trained, see chapter 10 for some advice on acclimating her to one. Do so before the baby arrives. You'll be glad you did. An exercise you can do in anticipation of having a creeper or toddler who might bug your dog while she's eating is to practice a simple food-safety exercise. Brian Kilcommons and Sarah Wilson outline this in Child-proofingYour Dog. The idea is that you teach the dog to enjoy someone approaching her bowl. Start by feeding your dog one short helping of her food at a time. When she finishes the small amount you give her, add another small portion, repeating this until her ration of food is gone. Next, start adding food while she is actually eating, until she is completely relaxed with your being around her food bowl. Then, put down her whole meal at once, but go to her bowl a few times during the meal to add a delicious tidbit, like a piece of cheese or meat. Speak to her kindly as you do this. For the next few days, stroke her gently while you add die tidbits. The next step (and we're almost finished) is to pick up her bowl while she's eating, take it away, and add the delicious tidbit. Immediately put it back down, and stay to stroke her for a while. Once she is relaxed while you're doing this, put your hand in her bowl while she's eating. You're imitating what just might happen (despite your best efforts) with a little one around. You're also creating a dog that can handle such an intrusion. Dog-Proofing Your Child As your baby grows, he needs to be taught some ground rules about how to behave around dogs. "One of the rules I set is that if the dog moves away from the child, the child is not allowed to pursue it," says author Wilson. The dog knows that she has to do no more than get up and move if she wants to be left alone. If you al ow your child to pursue the dog, she points out, then the dog has no recourse except to growl or snarl. If that happens, says Wilson, "it falls 100 percent on your shoulders." Anodier important rule Wilson recommends is not to allow your child to do to a dog what you wouldn't allow him to do to another child. Your dog will likely be upset if your child provokes her, so your child must be taught to respect the dog just as he should respect another member of the family.

161

Adding a Dog to Your Family If you have kids but want to make the family complete by adding a dog, be sure you're ready. Reread chapter 1, and search your soul. No matter how much they beg for one, don't get a dog for the kids, Wilson says. Get the dog for the family. "Mom has to want the dog, because Mom's going to be the one to care for the dog," says "Wilson. If you're the mother, don't let yourself be talked into a dog if you don't want one. "A canine can bring a great deal of joy into your life," Wilson says, "and a great deal of complication, depending on your perspective." Mother and dog owner Barbara O'Rourke agrees. Her twins, Erin and Kathleen, now nine, are dog-crazy and help with the dogs' care. But O'Rourke doesn't expect that they won't have to be reminded to take care of the dogs. If you let your kids talk you into getting a dog and try to hold them to their promises to take care of him, you're asking for trouble. If the kids don't come through (which they probably won't), they're being set up for failure, the dogs suffer, and family tensions mount. "Go ahead and get yourself a dog," says O'Rourke, "but don't expect that calling it the kids' dog will make it their responsibility." How old should your children be before you add a dog to the family? Your child should have motor skills, Wilson says, lest a friendly pat turns into a whack on the dog's head. You should also wait until your child exhibits some ability for self-control. "That can be four or six; it depends on the child," Wilson says. A child can't follow the rules of behavior around dogs unless he has self-control. While the dog shouldn't be made the kids' sole responsibility, they can certainly help with the dog's care, Wilson points out. Even little ones can be asked to monitor the dog's water dish and let you know when it needs filling. When they are a little older, they can do the filling themselves. Kids can also help with training by giving the dogs commands and having you do the follow-through. The children can help with grooming by participating in a weekly check of the dog to detect mats in the coat, ears that need cleaning, or toenails that need trimming. Wilson warns against giving the kids all the lousy chores. "That's a great way to get them to resent stuff," she says. Share the less pleasant tasks, like scooping the yard. "If you want to teach your kids responsibility, then get out there and scoop the yard, too."

One job you shouldn't let your kids perform is walking the dog. There are too many unknowns out there, and if a dog saw something that made him lunge and pulled the leash from your child's hand, disaster could ensue. My sister-in-law, Linda Brotsky, went to the animal shelter with her family when she was six years old to select a new dog. "I will never forget," says Brotsky, who now lives in Akron, Ohio, "we picked out this little black-and-white dog, and I begged my dad to let me hold the leash and walk him." The family was still in front of the animal shelter when the dog pulled the leash out of the little girl's hand and ran into the street and was killed by a car. It's not easy for a child to get over a trauma like that. "No child should ever have to experience that nightmare," Brotsky says. "I blamed myself for a long time." If your child wants to walk the dog, then put two leashes on the dog, Wilson advises. Each of you can hold one. Your child gets the satisfaction of holding the leash, while you make sure that everyone stays safe. If you have a fenced yard, you can leash the dog and let your child hold it, provided you keep an eye on them to make sure neither is pulling the other too much. Safety is the most important consideration when it comes to having kids and dogs in the same household. Because canines can inflict harm, and because kids don't necessarily have the sensibilities to prevent them from provoking the dog, it's up to you to be sure that all are kept safe. If not, it wil be hard to live with the consequences.

163

Chapter 24 It's a Lifetime Commitment It's a big deal to bring a dog into your life. That's why chapter 1 urges you to carefully consider whether you're ready for a dog and exactly what type best suits you. No matter what age the dog is you bring into your life, she's almost guaranteed to bond with you--and love you unconditionally. It's one of the many endearing qualities about dogs that makes us enjoy them so much. If you sever the tie between you and your dog, you're letting her down, and you're adding to the homeless pet problem. (Even if you find a new home for your dog, it's a home that could potentially go to another animal.) When you acquire a dog, make a lifetime commitment to her, and try to keep it! -DON'T GIVE UP ON YOUR DOG The sad truth is that, for many people, dogs are disposable commodities. But they're so much more than commodities. They're living, breathing, feeling creatures that become attached to the people they live with. Dogs are remarkably resilient, and many do well in more than one home. Our dog, Scout, was three when she joined our family and she bonded with us instantly. But many, many dogs who find themselves homeless either end up dying on the

164

streets or are humanely euthanized in shelters. If more people tried to solve problems with their dogs rather than just give them up, fewer animals would suffer. This is one reason I admire people who work in dog rescue. These folks-- usually volunteers--foster, and help to place dogs who are homeless. Some people work specifically with one breed or type of dog. Others work with any breed, or a mix of breeds. Rescue people--as well as the folks who work in animal shelters--have one-on-one contact with people who give up their animals. It must be difficult not to express disappointment in the decisions people make. Moving with Dogs According to the National Council on Pet Population Study and Policy, the number one reason people turn their dogs (or their cats, for that matter) over to shelters is relocation. It can be difficult to find a rental house or apartment that will take pets (thanks to irresponsible pet owners who let their pets destroy rental property). But that's no reason to give up your dog. If you find yourself faced with a move, try to show your dog off in the best possible light. Impress the potential landlord with your dog's titles. Every canine, purebred or otherwise, is eligible to take the Canine Good Citizen test, which is offered by the American Kennel Club. Passing that test, which demonstrates mat the dog has basic manners and can comport himself properly in public, might help to convince a landlord to take a chance on you and your dog. The AKC sends you a certificate you can photocopy and attach to your rental application. If you've put any titles on your dog, be sure to brag about them. It will also reflect well if you and your dog do any therapy work, for example, visiting nursing homes, hospitals, or similar facilities. The San Francisco SPCA has an Open Door program that lists pet-friendly rentals in San Francisco, as well as advises pet owners on finding housing. The group recommends that you create for your dog a resume that summarizes her best qualities and shows off your responsible care for her. The SFSPCA also recommends attaching letters of reference for your dog from current and previous landlords and/or neighbors; certificates of completion of any training classes; and references from your pet's trainer, groomer, or vet. You can even attach a picture, if you think it will work to your best advantage. The SFSPCA has sample pet resumes on its Web site, www.sfspca.org .

165

It can be a challenge for pet owners to find rental housing, but it's not impossible. Don't let this be a reason for giving up your dog. Training and Behavioral Problems If you're thinking of giving up your pet because of training or behavioral problems, seek professional assistance. A good trainer or behaviorist may be able to help. It could be as simple as providing your dog with more exercise (see chapter 8) or sending him to doggie day care (see chapter 6). If your dog is acting aggressively, think twice before finding him a new home. It's not fair to pass along a dangerous dog to someone else. Get an assessment of your dog's temperament from a qualified behaviorist. If your dog is deemed so aggressive that there's nothing you can do for him, the best thing is probably to euthanize him. If the assessment indicates that there are measures you can take to alleviate the problem, it may not be necessary to give him up. When the Dog Takes a Back Seat to Your Kids Nothing breaks my heart more than the senior dog, once the treasured "four-legged child" of a couple, who is now ignored after a baby is born. The withdrawal of attention frequently leads to the animal's bad behavior, which leads to fear for the child's safety, which leads to getting rid of the dog. If you're a dog owner who is expecting a first child, prepare yourselves and your dog for your new arrival. Make arrangements for your dog's care, and don't ignore her. Your child has a wonderful opportunity to grow up with a loving dog. It may take some effort on your part--during a time when you have fewer hours than ever and are sleep-deprived to boot--but please remember the love and devotion your dog has given you before you decide to give up on him. (See chapter 23 for more information on integrating children into a family that already includes dogs.) Your Dog Becomes Disabled or Terminally III If your dog is injured or ill, and, as a result, loses a sense (like vision or hearing) or a limb, don't despair. Many disabled dogs lead happy lives. If you're confronted with this situation and need advice, contact Dogs With Disabilities (see the

166

Resources section), an organization that provides support for people with disabled dogs. If your dog is deaf, check out the book Living with a Deaf Dog by Susan Cope Becker, and the Deaf Dog Education Action Fund Web site at www.deafdogs.org. There's also plenty of information available for owners of blind dogs. A good place to start is www.blinddogs.com. If your dog becomes paralyzed or terminally ill, and his needs are beyond those you can handle--assuming that his quality of life is still high--there may be an alternative to euthanasia. Angel's Gate Hospice and Rehabilitation Center for Companion Animals in Fort Salonga, New York, takes in paralyzed and dying animals. Owner Susan Marino provides holistic rehabilitative care for paralyzed animals, and keeps the terminally ill animals comfortable and happy for their remaining time. If you are faced with this scenario, contact Angel's Gate to see if the group can help. Sometimes It Can't Be Avoided Sue Sternberg, who also owns Rond out Valley Animals for Adoption, a small animal shelter in Accord, New York, has learned not to judge the person who gives up her dog. "Things happen," she says. "Sometimes it is a generous decision to give animals up." Most people have legitimate reasons for not keeping their animal, she says, and most people are devastated by that decision. If finding another home for your dog is the most generous thing you can do for her, then take the time to find the new home yourself. Don't dump your animal. A neighbor left his rottweiler mix, George, tied up to a fence in Prospect Park, confident that a warm-hearted dog lover would take him in. He did not leave the dog water or any other comfort. It turns out he was right: Warm-hearted dog lovers did take his dog in and, after a great deal of effort and a couple of false tries, they found a new home for George. My neighbor's actions were cruel and callous--cruel to the abandoned dog and cruel to the people who discovered him and could not leave him in the park. Their lives were turned upside down by this unanticipated rescue. On top of it all, my neighbor has to live with the uncertainty of not knowing what happened to the dog he once loved. If you must give up your dog, don't take him to the shelter. Animal shelters that euthanize when they run out of space are kept busy enough by stray animals.

167

By taking your animal there, you might be hastening the death of another. If you take your dog to a no-kill shelter, then a golden spot is taken from a stray. No-kill shelters, which do not euthanize because they lack space, are frequently full, and can take no more animals. Instead, find a responsible, loving home for your dog. If your dog is purebred, your first call should be to his breeder. If the breeder doesn't come through, find a good home yourself. When Janine Latus Musick, of Columbia, Missouri, came to the difficult decision to find a new home for her two yellow Labs, Cody and Claire, she herself set out to find them their new home. She was determined that the two- and three-year-old dogs would be kept together. Musick consulted the Web site of a local nonprofit animal-welfare organization, Miller-Roth ( www.geocities.com/-miller-roth ), and followed its guidelines for finding a new home for her pets. Miller-Roth recommends prescreening potential adopters on the phone by asking detailed questions about their pet-owning history, as well as taking down their vet and landlord's names as references. Be critical, and check references before allowing the potential adopters to see the dog. Follow your instincts, and don't adopt your dog to anyone you don't feel comfortable with. When you make a selection, insist upon delivering the dog so that you can see firsthand where she will be living. If you can't find a good home for your dog, you may have to consider having her euthanized. "A bad home is not better than no home at all," declares the Miller-Roth guidelines. While Musick initially had some difficulty finding one home where both dogs could dwell, she followed the Miller-Roth guidelines and found a loving family in the country. "They now live on 50 acres with a duck-filled pond. Their primary jobs are to love their elderly but energetic owners and to chase off varmints," Musick says. She has even visited the dogs to see how well they're doing. If you must give up your dog, do the right thing: Find a carefully screened, loving home for her. It's the least you can do. Extending Your Commitment Your commitment to your dog might extend beyond your own lifetime. We're accustomed to thinking that we'll outlive our pets, but we should make

168

arrangements for our animals, in advance, should they outlive us. It's an important thing to do, even if it's difficult to think about our own mortality. Select someone to care for your dog in the event you die or become incapacitated. It's a big commitment for someone to make to your pet, and you're placing much trust in this person. When a friend asked us to care for her miniature poodle should she pass away, Barry and I gave the request the same careful consideration we did when a relative asked us to be the guardians of her son should she and her husband die. It's probably a good idea to establish a backup person in the event that life circumstances change for your first choice. Once you've decided who will care for your dog, it should be written into your will. Under the law, animals are personal property, which means you can't leave your estate to your pet. But you can leave money for your animal's care. Laws vary by state. In most, you cannot leave money in trust for the care of an animal. You may end up leaving money to an individual whom you've selected

[-POOCH POINTER PLACES YOU CAN TURN TO WHEN YOU HAVE A CRISIS WITH YOUR PET (See the Resources section for contact information) -your dog's breeder (a good breeder will take back one of her puppies at any time) -a dog behaviorist (if you have a behavioral problem) -the San Francisco SPCA (for tips on finding housing when you have a dog) - breed rescue (if your dog is an American Kennel Club breed, check withthe AKC for the nationalrescue coordinator) - Dogs with Disabilities (to seek advice if your dog is disabled) -Angel's Gate Hospice and Rehabilitation Center for Companion Animals (if your pet is terminally ill orparalyzed) -Animals At Risk Care Sanctuary (a retirement home for animals when their owners have died) ]

169

to care for your dog. You and that friend should understand that the money you've left is to care for your canine friend. (Obviously, this is someone you trust!) You can certainly leave your animal to someone, without attaching money to your bequest. Then it becomes a gift of personal property. Another option is to leave money to an organization to take care of your pet. Check with your local SPCA or humane society. The SPCA of Texas, for example, has established Life Care Cottages, where animals are cared for if a minimum amount of money is bequeathed to the group. For a smaller gift, the organization will place your dog with a loving foster family, and monitor her care for life. A group in your community may have a similar program. You could bequeath your pet to a facility specifically designed to care for animals after their owners have died. The Animals At Risk Care Sanctuary, in Modesto, California, is an example of an organization that provides a lifetime refuge for pets. Animals left to the sanctuary, a nonprofit group staffed by volunteers, live out their lives in a permanent, homelike setting. The group refers to itself as a "retirement home." Your animal's stay there is funded by fees associated with the bequest. See the Resources section for contact information. You might also plan for the care of your pets in the event that you become seriously ill or disabled and are unable to care for them. Alpha Affiliates, Inc., a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting the bonds between people and animals, provides an "advance directive for pet care" for the purpose of stipulating who will care for your pets in the event that you are incapacitated. When you take in a dog, make your commitment to him a commitment for the rest of his life--even if he outlives you.

170

171

Chapter 25 When It's Time to Say Good-Bye Hands down, the single worst thing about dogs is that they don't live long enough. The healthiest canine hardly lives twenty years, and many don't make it half that long. As hard as it is to contemplate our dog's death, we'll do them--and ourselves--a favor by preparing ourselves while our dogs are still healthy. -DON'T HANG ON TOO LONG Deciding to euthanize (or "put to sleep") a beloved animal friend is agonizing. You worry, are you doing the right thing? Is it really time for him to die? "I've always found that if you have a critically il or injured animal, and you wait long enough [to euthanize] so that there is absolutely no doubt in your mind, then you've probably waited too long," says Myrna Milani, who also wrote Preparing for the Loss of Your Pet.

172

That said, Milani asserts, you must make a decision that is right for you. If you allow someone else to pressure you or guilt you into putting your animal down, you will have a more difficult time coping with the loss. You and your family members are doubtless closer to your dog than anyone else. Who better than you would be able to sense if your animal is ready? Trust yourself and your instincts. Listen to what your dog is telling you. Phyllis DeGioia of Madison, Wisconsin, had to euthanize her beloved fifteen-year-old mixed-breed, Berkeley, during the time I was writing this book. Berkeley had suffered two strokes in five days. "After the second one, I found her in the morning, cowering, confused, and sick; I held up her head and looked at her face closely," DeGioia recalls. "She clearly gave me a look that said she didn't want to do this anymore. It was the clearest communication I've ever seen from her." That certainty gave DeGioia the strength to euthanize her beloved dog--and it also helped her with the grieving process. Preparing Yourself The single best thing you can do to help yourself when you're faced with a decision about how to care for your ill or injured animal is to prepare yourself now. With a clear head, not one clouded by panic or guilt, think about the criteria that would have a bearing on your animal's quality of life. It's a highly individual decision, specific to you and your beliefs, as well as to the type of life your dog enjoys. For example, if your dog's whole life has been about retrieving, you might consider mobility to be an important quality-of-life issue. People tend to be prepared for two outcomes if their dog is injured or falls ill: Either the dog will die, they imagine, or he'll recover. But sometimes the outcome falls into the gray area: There's potential for recovery but with a great deal of expensive treatment, or partial recovery with a lifestyle change for dog and owner. Then it becomes more difficult. Thinking about this in advance can help. It's when you don't plan and end up making your decision during a time of panic, that you make choices you regret later. Milani says that when she was practicing traditional veterinary medicine (she now has a bond/behavior consulting practice), she was devastated by the number of pet owners whose years of happy memories were overshadowed by two terrible weeks at the end of the pet's life as they tried fruidessly to save the animal.

173

DeGioia had given a good deal of thought about the criteria she would use in deciding whether to euthanize Berkeley. Planning ahead and letting go at the right time helped her to ease any potential guilt. "I can't imagine how much worse it would be if I were second-guessing my decision, wondering if I'd done it too early, or possibly done it too late. I would be angry with myself if I let her suffer, because I selfishly wanted her around me longer than she wanted to be," DeGioia says. Talk to Your Vet in Advance Milani encourages veterinarians to discuss euthanasia during routine geriatric exams. This allows you to learn your vet's beliefs about euthanasia and how he copes with it; to find out what the options are for dealing with the corpse; and to make your wishes known to your vet. Do you want heroic efforts to be made in order to save your animal? If something should happen to your dog while you are at work, or while your dog was under someone else's care, you would want your vet to know your wishes. You can even prepare an advanced directive--like the living will you might have for yourself--so that your wishes are presented in writing. When you're talking with your veterinarian about the eventuality that your dog will die, discuss whether you would be allowed to stay in the room with her during the euthanasia procedure. Most veterinarians will allow this request. Many people want to be with their dog when his last breath is taken. DeGioia, for one, was glad she was there. "I stayed composed, talked to her calmly, and didn't cry. It was the only time in her life that she was well behaved at the vet's office. She knew it would make all the pain and suffering go away." Other people find it too difficult to be present during the procedure. You should do what feels right for you. "If you don't want to be there, you are not going to help the animal by being there," says Milani. "The animal will pick up on your anxiety." Some people prefer not to be present during the euthanasia but want to spend some time with the body afterward. Many vets will accommodate this wish as well. Again, it's an individual decision, and you shouldn't let anyone pressure you into doing something you're uncomfortable with. Thinking about this ahead of time and deciding what you want to do is better than making a snap decision you'll have to live with forever.

174

Not all vets are comfortable euthanizing pets. Some, like no-kill shelters, don't believe in it, says Milani. That's something you want to know before your pet becomes gravely ill. Vets are only human--and some are freaked out by death. If you know in advance that you have a vet who, for example, freezes up when faced with euthanasia, you might want to request another vet, or bring along someone who will provide the support you need. "Without a doubt, euthanasia is the most difficult thing veterinarians do," Milani says. "It is unfortunate that it's the thing they get the least amount of training for." When it comes time for you to euthanize your pet, feel free to request die veterinarian you would like to do the procedure. Make an appointment in advance. Don't just drop in to the vet's office. Some veterinarians will make house calls to put your dog to sleep. What to Do with the Body Again, it's a good idea to give some thought in advance to what you want to do with your dog's body after he dies. Your vet can dispose of it for you, or if local laws allow, you can take the body home to bury it. You can also choose to bury your pet in a pet cemetery. Do your homework about such cemeteries to make sure you're contracting with a reputable one. The Association for Pet Loss and Bereavement (APLB) provides a listing of cemeteries that belong to the International Association of Pet Cemeteries and/or the Accredited Pet Cemetery Society. Access that listing, as well as a variety of information about coping with pet loss, at the APLB's Web site: www.aplb.org . Another option is to have your animal cremated and the ashes returned to you. Cremation is a surprisingly expensive procedure, says Milani, since high temperatures are required to break the body down into ashes. Often pets are cremated in groups. In that case, you might get ashes back from the group cremation that represent your animal but aren't actually his ashes. Or you may get no ashes at all. If you want your dog's actual ashes to be returned to you, arrange with your vet, in advance, for an individual cremation. If you cremate your pet, and have her ashes returned, then you have to make a decision about what to do with the ashes. Some people sprinkle them in a significant area. Others put them in a special urn or box and keep them in the house. When Mary Osterberg of Portland, Oregon, lost her beloved dog,

175 Maynard, to cancer, she had her cremated and kept her ashes in an urn. Exactly seven mondis later, Maynard's best friend, a cat named Tabitha, died. Osterberg combined the two animals' ashes in the urn and placed two name-plates on it. "Maynard was my heart and Tabitha was my soul," she says. "They belong together." Some people keep special mementos of their dog's life, like a collar or favorite toy, near the ashes or in a keepsake box. Others bury their dog and place a special grave marker at the site. Again, this is a highly personal decision, one that bears thinking about in advance. Coping with Your Grief If you plan ahead for your pet's death, you'll probably have an easier time coping with the loss. If, while your dog is still healthy, you face the reality that he will die, you're less likely to have made any decision that you might feel guilty about. "Guilt is the most devastating emotion in the human/pet relationship," says Milani. One of the difficulties in coping with the devastating loss of a cherished animal companion is that people who are not pet lovers cannot understand the depth of your grief. Callous comments like "he was just a dog" or "why don't you just go out and get another one?" can be hurtful. The Association for Pet Loss and Bereavement (APLB) offers a list of qualified counselors who specialize in pet loss to help you work through your grief. It also provides a list of hot lines that are affiliated with established organizations, like veterinary schools, as well as a list of support groups. You might feel isolated in your grief, and fear that no one can understand. But there is a world of hope out there, and the APLB Web site offers a great starting place for finding it. If you don't have Internet access, call the APLB at (718) 832-0690. Another resource to help you in your grief is the lams Pet Loss Support Resource Center. You can call it toll-free at 1-888-332-7738; you'll be given the number of the pet-loss support line nearest you. Everyone grieves differently. As she copes with her own loss, DeGioia advises others to let out their emotions. "All your feelings about death, the ends of relationships, and saying good-bye will be affected if you don't deal with it. Fall apart, cry, scream, whine, yell, but get it out," she suggests. "Nature designed most of

176

our pets to have such different life spans. I think one of the reasons that design was made was to help us learn how to grieve." Getting a New Pet Deciding whether to get a new pet after one has died is also a highly personal decision. Well-meaning friends may encourage you to get one right away, or even offer to give you one. Don't take in a new pet until you're absolutely ready, and don't expect that pet to replace your old friend. The new pet may help fill the hole in your heart, but he's a unique animal, not a replacement. Again, don't let others influence you unduly. You may be ready immediately, in a few months or years, or maybe never. It's your decision, one you don't have to make any excuses for. Thinking about your dog dying isn't easy, no matter how far into the future that eventuality seems. But it's a fact that our dogs live short lives, so we should prepare for the worst. Face your fears, even if your dog is healthy. Talk to your vet and your family members. You'll be glad you did when the time for major decisions arrives.

GUIDE DE LA DIVERSIFICATION
D’UNE EXPLOITATION AGRICOLE
EN ÉLEVAGE CANIN




        Page 1     SEPTEMBRE 2018
      Préambule



Ce document a pour but d’être un outil pour les
porteurs de projets de diversification de production
ou d’installation en activité canine. Il tente de
reprendre toutes les étapes de réflexion à aborder
pour s’installer dans de bonnes conditions.
L’élevage de chien peut entrer dans le monde de
l’élevage de rente, les mécanismes de mise en place
sont identiques.

La filière canine est en pleine mutation, avec de
nouvelles     réglementations      favorables     aux
productions plus importantes. L’image du chien,
animal de compagnie, doué de sensibilité, meilleur ami de l’homme est très bonne et valorisante. Mais il
convient d’être très attentif aux conditions d’élevage : elles sont à la fois l’image de l’élevage mais elles
conditionnent aussi le développement du futur chien et le public y sera toujours très attentif. Par ailleurs,
la nouvelle loi de la consommation, qui gère la vente de chiots entre professionnel et particulier, peut
engager la responsabilité du vendeur en cas de troubles particuliers de l’animal.

La filière canine est particulièrement dynamique, essentiellement dans l’accompagnement de la
production des chiens : toilettage, pension, éducation, dressage utilitaire, vente de matériel et
d’aliments… Créer un projet professionnel autour du chien n’est pas chose simple. Cela demande de
nombreuses compétences dans ce domaine : alimentation, reproduction, médecine, comportement…
une étude de projet et de marché approfondie, une persévérance pour convaincre ses futurs partenaires
de la viabilité de son projet sont nécessaires. Les Chambres d’Agriculture, la Société Centrale Canine et
les organismes professionnels agricoles ont vocation à accompagner les porteurs de ces projets de
diversification.

1     Le contexte actuel du monde canin
Une enquête menée à l’automne 2016 confirme la progression du chat dans les foyers français. En deux
ans, la population féline a augmenté de plus de 6 % passant de 12,7 à 13,5 millions. Simultanément le
nombre de chiens a augmenté de 1 % dans l’hexagone alors que les effectifs de l’espèce canine avaient
largement diminué lors des précédentes années. L’amour des Français pour les animaux ne se dément
pas, en témoignent les 63 millions d’animaux familiers actuellement présents dans les foyers français.
Avec 13,5 millions de chats, 7,3 millions de chiens, 5,8 millions d’oiseaux, 32,7 millions de poissons et
3,4 millions de petits mammifères, le nombre total d’animaux familiers reste stable par rapport à 2014.


◼ Quelques chiffres sur la filière canine
  La Société Centrale Canine (SCC) a réalisé une étude portant sur l’activité des éleveurs en 2014. Il
  s’avère que près de 80 % des éleveurs produisent moins de 25 chiots par an soit moins de 5 portées en
  moyenne. 20 % des éleveurs produisent plus de 25 chiots par an.
  La très grande majorité des éleveurs de la SCC produit des chiens inscrits dans un livre des origines. Ce
  sont donc des chiens dits « LOF » (voir fiches pratiques). Plus de 75 % des éleveurs sont des
  sélectionneurs, c’est-à-dire qu’ils participent à des expositions ou des concours, ils réalisent les
  examens de santé recommandés par leur club de race, etc…
  Plus de 60 % des éleveurs n’élèvent qu’une seule race, 20 % en élèvent deux. On remarque que la
  passion l’emporte souvent sur le choix initial de la race et que les éleveurs y sont fidèles. Le choix
  dépend bien entendu de critères qui sont propres à chacun.
  Il est à noter que seule une bonne moitié des éleveurs ne vivent que de l’élevage de chiens. Les autres
  gardent une activité annexe (principale ou secondaire). Cette activité annexe correspond
  généralement à des emplois complémentaires dans un autre domaine que celui de l’élevage :
  fonctionnaire, intérimaire, artisan… Enfin, il est aussi possible de diversifier son activité cynophile,
  avec d’autres prestations dans le monde du chien : pension, éducation, toilettage… Moins de 10 %
  d’entre eux ont une pension canine en même temps que leur élevage.
  La réglementation ayant changé en 2014, toute personne qui vend un chien ou un chat est considérée
  comme professionnelle.


◼ L’organisation actuelle
  L’élevage canin est structuré en France. Les éleveurs d’une race considérée sont bien souvent
  adhérents du club de la race. Ce club est le centre névralgique des actions menées pour la bonne
  évolution de la race.
  Les clubs de race, aussi appelés Associations Spécialisées de Race, assurent la direction technique
  d’une ou plusieurs races déterminées et particulièrement son amélioration et sa promotion. Leurs
  missions sont de rédiger et diffuser le standard pour une race française, de publier et diffuser le
  standard reconnu par la Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI) pour une race étrangère,
  d’élaborer les règles techniques de sélection et d’inscription au LOF en accord avec la SCC. Enfin, ils
  organisent des séances de confirmation, des expositions (Nationales d’Elevage, Régionales d’Elevage,
  Spéciales de Race) et des épreuves de sélection (Test de Caractère, Test d’Aptitude Naturelle).
  Il n’y a qu’un seul club reconnu officiellement par race. Mais un club peut s’occuper de plusieurs races.
  Toute le monde peut adhérer au club de la ou des races qui l’intéresse dans le but d’être informé des
  actualités, recevoir la revue du club et obtenir des tarifs préférentiels pour des expositions voire pour
  les examens de santé.
  La SCC fédère l’ensemble de ces clubs de race, afin de fixer des directions communes dans le
  développement de la filière canine.

2     Les tendances actuelles et futures
L'élevage canin est l'activité agricole de conduite de la reproduction de chien en vue de la production et
de la commercialisation de chiots. L'élevage de chiens peut être pratiqué avec des chiens de race ou des
chiens croisés s'apparentant à une race.


◼ L’élevage
  L’activité d’élevage canin est une activité qui se développe toujours. De plus en plus de gens se
  forment auprès des organismes de formation pour obtenir leur attestation de formation, permettant
  d’exercer la profession d’éleveur. Le nombre de chiens restant globalement stable en France, les
  débouchés restent favorables. Bien évidemment, la qualité est de plus en plus recherchée par les
  acheteurs, qui apprécient les éleveurs performants et investis dans leur activité.
  Le développement de la médecine vétérinaire, de beaucoup de professions visant au bien-être animal
  et finalement du regard de la société vers nos animaux de compagnie font que le métier d’éleveur
  change, au profit d’un élevage de qualité, produisant des animaux beaux et surtout équilibrés
  émotionnellement.


◼ La pension
  La pension est bien souvent en appoint d’un élevage. En effet, les structures sont assez similaires à
  celles de l’élevage et les revenus sont plus réguliers que ceux de la vente de chiots. Il faut cependant
  rester vigilant, car la surcharge de travail peut être importante, en particulier si les vacances scolaires,
  donc le pic de population de la pension, coïncident avec des naissances dans l’élevage.


◼ L’éducation
  L’éducation est une activité intéressante, car elle permet de suivre l’évolution des chiots. En effet,
  avoir les compétences et la structure pour réaliser ces cours, permet de les proposer à des chiens
  extérieurs, mais aussi aux chiens issus de votre élevage. Ce service est souvent très bien vu par les
  futurs acheteurs de chiots. Ils ont alors la possibilité de poursuivre l’éducation de leur animal avec celui
  qui le connaît le plus : son éleveur.
  L’inconvénient de cette activité est le temps pris par celle-ci. En effet, une heure de cours vous prendra
  en réalité plus de deux heures, entre les discussions autour du chien, l’accueil puis le départ des
  propriétaires. Cette activité est donc particulièrement chronophage pour une rentabilité variable. La
  concurrence est de plus assez importante dans ce domaine à la mode, surtout près des grandes villes.


◼ Les autres activités
  D’autres activités peuvent être mises en place comme du toilettage, de l’entrainement sportif, de
  l’entrainement à des activités spécifiques (chasse, fields, agility, recherche utilitaire…). Ces activités
  demandent des compétences particulières mais sont toujours un excellent complément.
  Malheureusement, ces activités sont souvent aussi chronophages et diminuent donc la rentabilité,
  au profit du plaisir que l’on a à pratiquer ces activités avec ses chiens. Le choix est donc très personnel.




                                                   PARTIE 2 - Page 5
3       L’évaluation économique
Cette évaluation est primordiale afin de monter un projet abouti, qui doit permettre d’avoir un minimum
de rentabilité.

◼ Les investissements nécessaires
  Il est difficile de réaliser un véritable chiffrage des investissements à faire pour monter son élevage. Cet
  investissement dépendra effectivement des structures déjà existantes, des matériaux choisis et bien
  entendu de la race : il n’y aura pas les mêmes besoins pour élever des Chihuahuas de 1 kg que pour
  des Terres Neuves de 60 kg.

    Faisons le choix de 7 chiens. L’investissement initial qui correspond au logement sera peu dépendant
    de la taille des chiens, mais pas nul tout de même : les logements devront être parfois plus grand, les
    clôtures plus renforcées… Mais il sera surtout dépendant de la qualité des matériaux utilisés et de
    l’agencement qui sera mis en place. Concernant les frais de fonctionnement, il y aura quelques
    différences, notamment lorsque le choix des chiens s’orientera vers les races géantes : le cout de
    l’aliment, des soins vétérinaires… seront bien entendu majorés. En effet, prenons comme exemple le
    cout d’un antibiotique, qui peut passer de 10 € la semaine pour un chien de 3 kg à plus 60 € pour un
    chien de 50 kg. Un gros chien va manger plus de 400 grammes de croquettes par jour, contre
    60 grammes pour une race miniature…


    Pour 7 chiens de moins de 5kg (Chihuahua, Teckel, Shih Tzu…) :

     Investissement initial                         Frais de fonctionnement
                                                    Alimentation       – coût moyen 900 €
     Logement – coût moyen                          Frais vétérinaires – coût moyen 1 000€
     2 000 à 5 000€
     selon la structure préexistante                Petit matériel     – coût moyen 700 €
                                                    Autres charges – coût moyen 1 000€


    Pour 7 chiens de 20 kg (Labrador, Golden Retriever, Berger Australien…) :

     Investissement initial                         Frais de fonctionnement
                                                    Alimentation      – coût moyen 2 350 €
     Logement – coût moyen                          Frais vétérinaires – coût moyen 1 500€
     3 000 à 10 000€
     selon la structure préexistante                Petit matériel     – coût moyen 1 300 €
                                                    Autres charges – coût moyen 2 000€

    Pour 7 chiens de 50 kg (Terre neuve, Leonberg, Montagne des Pyrénées…) :

     Investissement initial                         Frais de fonctionnement
                                                    Alimentation       – coût moyen 4 000 €
     Logement – coût moyen                          Frais vétérinaires – coût moyen 2 500€
     4 000 à 15 000€
     selon la structure préexistante                Petit matériel     – coût moyen 1 500 €
                                                    Autres charges     – coût moyen 2 500€




                                                   PARTIE 1 - Page 6
◼ Les gains potentiels
  Les gains fluctueront avec la rentabilité et les frais nécessaires à chaque race, la vente des chiots (vente
  à 2 mois ou plus tardive, prix de vente, concurrence locale…). Il faut éviter d’être séduit par des chiens
  « à la mode » mais parfois compliqués à gérer dans un élevage : les brachycéphales demandent des
  compétences plus importantes en termes de santé et demandent une attention plus contraignante lors
  des mises bas. Le choix d’une race dite rustique est souvent un meilleur début. Ce choix semble donc
  plus judicieux pour faire ses premiers pas en élevage, un monde parfois moins évident qu’il n’y paraît…

  Il est très difficile de faire un réel choix de race en se basant simplement sur une notion de rentabilité.
  En effet, l’implication personnelle de l’éleveur dans l’élevage de chienne est tel, qu’il est important de
  choisir une race qui convient à l’éleveur : préfère-t-on un grand chien ou un petit ? Un chien calme ou
  un chien de chasse ? Un chien de compagnie ou un chien indépendant ? Autant de questions
  importantes car l’éleveur va partager sa vie avec ses compagnons pendant plus de 10 ans… Bien
  entendu, l’aspect rentabilité ne peut être ignoré. Le risque de problème de santé et de reproduction
  est plus important chez le Bouledogue Anglais que chez le Cocker…Mais le prix de vente est aussi bien
  différent. Ainsi si on veut uniquement se référer aux races les plus demandées par le public, il convient
  de suivre l’évolution des naissances de chiens LOF à la SCC, on retrouve alors les 10 races les plus
  appréciées ces dernières années.

  Si on part sur un très petit élevage, de trois femelles reproductrices, on peut espérer en moyenne deux
  portées par an, soit dix chiots en moyenne. Cela correspond à un chiffre d’affaires moyen de 9 000 €
  (en prenant un prix moyen du chiot de 900 €).

  NB. : le prix de 900 € est un prix moyen. Certaines races très prolifiques et facile d’élevage coûtent
  moins cher, d’autres bien plus. Et bien entendu, la valeur de la femelle et la valeur de la portée (gain
  de concours, de prix et de récompenses) permettent d’augmenter le prix de vente du chiot.
  Si le choix se porte sur un élevage avec sept femelles, pour se rapporter au paragraphe précédent, le
  gain moyen sera de cinq portées par an, soit vingt-cinq chiots par an et donc un chiffre d’affaires lors
  de la vente des chiots de 22 500 €.
  Dans ce dernier exemple, le gain net potentiel par an sera donc de 9 000 €.

  Bien entendu, ce résultat dépendra nettement des investissements nécessaires pour la création de la
  structure, ainsi que des frais de fonctionnement. Par ailleurs, ce calcul ne prend pas en compte les
  exceptionnels frais vétérinaires en cas de coup dur ou si l’une des femelles devient inapte à la
  reproduction. Il est ainsi préférable de se laisser une marge de deux chiennes pour pallier l’inévitable
  retraite des plus anciennes, ou à la pathologie exceptionnelle d’une des reproductrices.




                                                  PARTIE 1 - Page 7
4       La réglementation en élevage canin

On entend par élevage de chien l’activité consistant à détenir au moins une femelle reproductrice
dont au moins un chien est cédé à titre onéreux (Art L214-6 du code rural et de la pêche maritime).


Ainsi, depuis le premier janvier 2016, toute personne qui a une portée de chiots issue d’une femelle
qu’il possède, devient éleveur dès qu’il vend un chiot de cette portée. La nouvelle définition de
l’élevage s’applique donc dès le premier chien ou chat vendu. En revanche, si les chiots sont cédés
gratuitement, cette disposition ne s’applique pas. Mais il n’est possible de céder à titre gratuit qu’une
seule portée par foyer fiscal.
La mention « gratuit » doit apparaître clairement dans toutes les petites annonces.


◼ La législation concernant l’activité d’élevage
  L’activité d’élevage doit faire l’objet d’une déclaration d’activité au préfet. Elle est subordonnée à la
  mise en place et l’utilisation d’installations conformes aux règles sanitaires et de protection animale.
  Ces activités ne peuvent s’exercer que si au moins une personne, en contact direct avec les animaux
  peut justifier soit :

    •   d’un certificat professionnel
    •   du suivi d’une formation permettant d’acquérir les compétences relatives aux besoins des animaux
        de compagnie afin d’obtenir une attestation de connaissance
    •   d’un certificat de capacité délivré avant l’ordonnance du 07/10/2015

    Toute personne exerçant l’activité d’élevage de chiens ou de chats est tenue de s’immatriculer dans
    les conditions prévues à l’article L.311-2-1 du code rural et de la pêche maritime.
    Cette personne obtient donc un numéro de Siret, indispensable pour toute vente ultérieure de chiots.
    Il existe cependant une dérogation pour les personnes ne vendant pas plus d’une portée de chiots
    inscrits au Livre des Origines par an et par foyer fiscal. Ce cas ne sera pas abordé ici, car cette situation
    ne correspond pas réellement à une diversification économique.

    La déclaration d’activité se fait auprès de la DDPP du département à l’aide du formulaire Cerfa
    15045*02. Ce formulaire comprend notamment l’identification du déclarant, l’adresse, la raison
    sociale et le numéro de Siret, le nom du capacitaire, les coordonnées du vétérinaire sanitaire choisi, le
    type d’activité et les espèces animales concernées. Cette déclaration a évolué ces dernières années, il
    n’y a plus de pièces justificatives à apporter au dossier, mais le déclarant s’engage, en cas d’inspection
    par des agents de la DDPP, à présenter le plan d’ensemble à jour de l’établissement, le registre des
    entrées et des sorties, le registre sanitaire, le certificat de capacité ou l’attestation de formation du
    responsable de l’activité.
    Bien entendu, les revenus générés par la vente des chiots et par les autres activités éventuelles
    doivent faire l’objet d’une déclaration fiscale.


◼ La législation concernant les locaux
  L’arrêté du 3 avril 2014 fixe les règles sanitaires et de protection animale auxquelles doivent satisfaire
  les élevages. Les éleveurs doivent respecter l’ensemble des règles qui se trouvent ci-dessous. Ainsi
  tout vendeur d’au moins un chiot non LOF par an ou de plus d’une portée LOF par an sont dans
  l’obligation de suivre ces règles.




                                                     PARTIE 1 - Page 8
   Installation des établissements
    Les structures doivent être réalisées de manière à protéger les animaux des conditions climatiques
    excessives, des sources de contamination et de blessures. Elles doivent permettre de prévenir les
    nuisances et le stress et répondre aux besoins biologiques, physiologiques et comportementaux
    des espèces et races détenues en permettant une maîtrise de la reproduction, d’éviter la fuite des
    animaux, de faciliter les opérations de nettoyage et de désinfection et permettre la mise en œuvre
    de bonnes pratiques d'hygiène en prévenant les sources de contamination et en évitant les
    contaminations croisées, notamment en respectant le principe de la marche en avant dans la
    structure.

    Les établissements doivent disposer de locaux, d’installations et d’équipements appropriés pour
    assurer l’hébergement, l’abreuvement, l’alimentation, le confort, le libre mouvement, l’occupation,
    la sécurité et la tranquillité des animaux détenus.

    Il doit y avoir une infirmerie : un local séparé à l’écart du secteur sain, pour l’hébergement des
    animaux malades ou blessés. Ce local doit être spécialement aménagé de manière à permettre de
    procéder aux soins des animaux dans de bonnes conditions d’hygiène et éviter que les chiens
    contagieux ne soient une source de contamination pour les autres animaux.

    Il doit y avoir une maternité : un local spécialement aménagé pour la mise bas des femelles
    gestantes, l’entretien des portées et des animaux sevrés.

    Les locaux doivent aussi être équipés d’un lave-mains alimenté en eau chaude et froide ou d’un
    dispositif de lavage hygiénique des mains. Ils sont adaptés pour stocker la nourriture dans de
    bonnes conditions de conservation et d’hygiène, pour entreposer le matériel de soin et les
    médicaments dans de bonnes conditions d’hygiène et de sécurité et pour garder le matériel de
    nettoyage et de désinfection.

    Par ailleurs, ces structures doivent avoir un système hygiénique de collecte, de stockage et
    d'évacuation des déchets et des eaux sales, un conteneur étanche et fermé, permettant le stockage
    des cadavres à température négative, un système de détection des incendies et un système de
    lutte contre les incendies.
    Dans les établissements employant du personnel, les installations doivent disposer de vestiaires
    équipés de lave-mains et de toilettes.

    Dans les logements des animaux, le sol, les murs et autres surfaces en contact avec les chiens sont
    en matériaux résistants, étanches, imputrescibles, non toxiques et facilement lavables et
    désinfectables. Le sol doit être non glissant, non abrasif, uniforme et peut supporter les chocs et le
    déplacement de tout équipement mobile. Sa conception doit permettre un nettoyage facile et
    l’évacuation efficace des eaux de lavage par tout système approprié.

   Milieu ambiant
    Les animaux sont détenus dans des conditions ambiantes, adaptées. Il est interdit de les laisser en
    permanence dans l'obscurité ou dans la lumière. L'alternance naturelle du jour et de la nuit est à
    respecter, y compris les jours de fermeture de l'établissement.

    Les locaux et installations d'hébergement des animaux doivent disposer d’une aération efficace et
    permanente, d’un éclairage naturel complété, si nécessaire, par un éclairage artificiel adéquat et
    suffisant, de moyens permettant de maintenir une température et une hygrométrie conformes aux
    besoins des animaux présents.




                                                PARTIE 1 - Page 9
   Soins aux animaux
    À leur arrivée dans l’établissement, les animaux nouvellement introduits sont inspectés dans un
    emplacement séparé et au calme. Les animaux apparemment sains sont transférés dans des
    installations, préalablement nettoyées, désinfectées pour y subir une période d’acclimatation et
    d’observation, sans mélange de lots de provenance différente. Il faut donc avoir une pièce de
    quarantaine.

    Si les animaux nouvellement introduits font l’objet d’une vente, la livraison ne pourra avoir lieu qu’à
    l’expiration d’une période dont la durée minimale est fixée à cinq jours pour les chiens.
    Tous les animaux doivent faire l’objet de soins quotidiens attentifs et adaptés pour assurer leur
    bonne santé physique et comportementale. Les animaux doivent disposer en permanence d’une
    eau propre et potable, renouvelée autant que de besoin (mais au moins une fois par jour) et
    doivent recevoir, quotidiennement et à un rythme adéquat, une nourriture saine et équilibrée
    correspondant à leurs besoins physiologiques.

    Les chiens, à l’exception de ceux qui sont naturellement solitaires et des animaux isolés pour raisons
    sanitaires ou comportementales, doivent être logés en groupes sociaux formés d’individus
    compatibles. Tous les animaux auront à disposition un espace suffisant pour permettre l’expression
    d’un large répertoire de comportements normaux. L’enrichissement du milieu, c’est-à-dire l’apport
    des éléments et accessoires aux animaux pour leur assurer un équilibre comportemental, doit être
    suffisamment complet et adapté à leurs besoins. Une présence interactive suffisante est impérative
    pour favoriser leur socialisation et leur familiarisation à l’homme. Si les animaux manifestent des
    troubles comportementaux, des démarches doivent être entreprises pour en trouver la cause et y
    remédier.

    Seul un vétérinaire peut réaliser l'euthanasie, lorsqu’elle lui parait justifiée. Cet acte est à pratiquer
    dans le respect des règles de déontologie vétérinaire. L’euthanasie est mentionnée dans le registre
    sanitaire, avec cachet et signature du vétérinaire l’ayant effectuée.

   Hébergement
    Les chiens doivent disposer d’un logement étanche et isolé thermiquement pour les protéger des
    intempéries et des conditions climatiques excessives. Il doit être adapté à leur taille, équipé d’une
    aire de couchage sèche et isolée du sol. L'espace minimal requis pour l’hébergement des chiens est
    d'une surface de 5 m² par chien et d'une hauteur de 2 m. Tout ou partie de cet espace
    d'hébergement doit être abrité des intempéries et du soleil. Il peut être réduit pour les séjours dans
    les locaux d’isolement le temps du traitement de l’animal malade.

    Pour les chiens dont la taille est supérieure à 70 cm au garrot, la surface d’hébergement ne peut
    être inférieure à 10 m2 ; cette surface peut toutefois accueillir deux chiens. Les chiots non sevrés
    peuvent être hébergés sur ces surfaces minimales avec leur mère.

    Les chiens doivent être hébergés autant que possible en groupes sociaux harmonieux, sauf quand il
    est justifié de les isoler pour raisons sanitaires ou comportementales. Les chiens doivent avoir accès
    quotidiennement à des contacts interactifs positifs avec des êtres humains et d’autres chiens. Une
    attention particulière doit être portée à leur socialisation et leur familiarisation.

    Les chiens doivent pouvoir se mouvoir librement, sans entrave et sans gêne. Ils ne peuvent être
    tenus à l’attache que ponctuellement et conformément à l’arrête du 25 octobre 1982 relatif à
    l’élevage, la garde et à la détention des animaux. Les chiens, à l’exception des animaux malades ou
    isolés provisoirement pour raison sanitaire, quel que soit leur âge et leur mode de détention,
    doivent être sortis en extérieur tous les jours, afin qu’ils puissent s’ébattre et jouer entre eux et
    partager des interactions positives avec l’humain.



                                                  PARTIE 1 - Page 10
◼ La législation sanitaire
  L’arrêté du 3 avril 2014 précise les points suivants :
  •   un vétérinaire sanitaire doit être désigné pour chaque structure (il peut être le vétérinaire
      traitant de l’élevage, mais pas obligatoirement)
  •   un règlement sanitaire doit être rédigé en collaboration avec le vétérinaire sanitaire et le
      responsable de la structure
  •   les locaux sont visités deux fois par an par le vétérinaire sanitaire (une seule fois pour les petits
      élevages de moins de 9 chiens sevrés)
  •   des autocontrôles doivent être réalisés par le responsable à partir notamment du Guides de
      Bonnes Pratiques.

    Le règlement sanitaire doit être mis en place avec l’aide du vétérinaire sanitaire de l’élevage.
    Ce règlement comprend, à minima un plan de nettoyage et désinfection des locaux et du matériel,
    les règles d’hygiène à respecter par le personnel ou le public, les procédures d’entretien et de soins
    des animaux. Un plan de nettoyage, de désinfection et de lutte contre les nuisibles doit être établi et
    pour chacun des équipements et les différentes parties des locaux (fréquence des différentes
    opérations de nettoyage et de désinfection, mode opératoire précis…).

    L’éleveur doit faire procéder au moins deux fois par an à une visite des locaux par le vétérinaire
    sanitaire. À titre dérogatoire, pour les établissements de garde, de pension, et d’élevage de petite
    taille, détenant au plus neuf chiens de plus de quatre mois ou neuf chats de plus de dix mois, il peut
    être procédé à une seule visite annuelle, dans la mesure où celle-ci ne révèle pas de
    dysfonctionnements de nature à nuire aux animaux.

   Registres
    Un registre d’entrée et de sortie des animaux doit être tenu à jour. Il doit comporter toutes les
    données de façon lisible et indélébile. Tout volume du registre portant mention d’un animal vivant
    doit être conservé dans les locaux pendant trois années après la sortie de cet animal. Pour chaque
    animal présent, le registre doit comporter une mention permettant son identification, notamment
    l’espèce, la race, le sexe, la date de naissance, si elle est connue ou l’âge au moment de l’inscription,
    le numéro d’identification et éventuellement tout signe particulier.
    Un registre de suivi sanitaire et de santé doit être réalisé. Il doit comporter les informations
    relatives à l’état de santé des animaux, aux soins et aux interventions vétérinaires réalisées. Tout
    volume du registre doit être conservé pendant trois années à compter de la dernière inscription qui
    y a été portée.

    Le compte rendu des visites du vétérinaire sanitaire, ainsi que toutes propositions de modification
    du règlement sanitaire seront consignés sur ce registre par le vétérinaire sanitaire. Ce registre doit
    aussi contenir les ordonnances vétérinaires correspondant aux médicaments prescrits.


◼ La réglementation dans les autres activités en relation avec le chien
  Comme l’activité d’élevage, le gestion d’une fourrière ou d’un refuge, l’exercice à titre commercial
  des activités de transit ou de garde, d’éducation, de dressage et de présentation au public font
  l’objet d’une déclaration d’activité au préfet, sont subordonnées à la mise en place et l’utilisation
  d’installations conformes aux règles sanitaires et de protection animale. Ces activités ne peuvent
  s’exercer que si au moins une personne, en contact direct avec les animaux peut justifier soit :
  •   d’un certificat professionnel
  •   du suivi d’une formation permettant d’acquérir les compétences relatives aux besoins des
      animaux de compagnie afin d’obtenir une attestation de connaissance
  •   d’un certificat de capacité délivré avant l’ordonnance du 07/10/2015




                                                 PARTIE 1 - Page 11
5           Les recommandations et obligations spécifiées
L’élevage de chiens est une activité particulière. Des normes spécifiques sont à considérer, mais encore
plus important : le chien fait bien souvent partie de la famille et les liens tissés entre cet animal de
compagnie et l’homme rendent cette activité de production très sensible aux regards de la société.

◼ Les normes propres à l’espèce canine
  En droit français, l’ensemble des dispositions mises en place pour la protection des animaux sont
  réunies dans le Code Rural et de la Pêche Maritime (CRPM) et plus particulièrement dans son
  chapitre IV intitulé « la protection des animaux « (Article L 214 et suivants). L’activité d’élevage, de
  vente, de gardiennage, ainsi que l’activité des refuges, des fourrières de même que toutes les autres
  activités liées aux animaux de compagnie y sont règlementées dans le but de protection et du respect
  du bien-être des animaux.
  « Il est interdit d'exercer des mauvais traitements envers les animaux domestiques ainsi qu'envers les
  animaux sauvages apprivoisés ou tenus en captivité. » (Article L214-3 du Code rural).

       Une sélection et des pratiques d’élevage respectueuses (Annexe II de l’arrêté du 03 avril 2014)
        L’élevage vise à obtenir des animaux en bonne santé, au caractère équilibré, exempts de tares ou
        de propriétés portant atteintes à leur bien-être. Les femelles ne peuvent reproduire qu’à partir de
        leur deuxième cycle. Les méthodes de reproduction employées ne doivent pas être source de
        souffrance pour les animaux. Les femelles reproductrices ne doivent pas mettre bas plus de trois
        fois par période de deux ans. La séparation des chiots de la mère ne peut se faire avant l’âge de six
        semaines (sauf nécessité décrite dans le règlement sanitaire) et progressivement. Le devenir et
        l’entretien des reproducteurs et reproductrices réformés sont à assurer.

       Démarches au titre des installations classées
        En fonction du nombre de chien (de plus de 4 mois) présents sur la structure, les normes de
        l’établissement sont différentes.
        •    Jusqu’à 9 chiens : Installation NON classée
             Elle est soumise au Règlement Sanitaire Départemental (RSD) et à la réglementation municipale.
             Il est obligatoire de respecter la tranquillité du voisinage et d’éviter les nuisances (sonores,
             olfactives, visuelles, assainissement…). Elle est sous la responsabilité du Maire en vertu du
             Règlement Sanitaire Départemental, du Code de la Santé Publique, du code général des
             collectivités locales, d'arrêtés municipaux éventuels, du PLU (Plan Local Urbain) ou du POS (Plan
             d’Occupation des Sols). Des règlements complémentaires tels que cahier des charges des
             lotissements peuvent indiquer des règles de construction de chenil et de détention des chiens.
        •    De 10 à 100 chiens : Installation CLASSÉE soumise à DÉCLARATION
             La préparation et la présentation d’un dossier complet à la DDPP ou DDCSPP, selon le
             département, permettra de valider le projet.
        •    De 101 à 250 chiens : installation CLASSEE soumise à ENREGISTREMENT
             La préparation et la présentation d’un dossier complet à la DDPP ou DDCSPP, selon le
             département, permettra de valider le projet.

        •    A partir de 251 chiens : Installation CLASSÉE soumise à AUTORISATION
             Le dossier à fournir est bien plus important. Il faut se rapprocher de la DDPP pour en obtenir les
             détails. Les délais de procédure et l’acceptation du dossier d’autorisation varient de 6 mois à 1 an
             selon les départements.

◼ Les conditions d’élevage
  Le logement des chiens est l’un des éléments fondamentaux du bon fonctionnement de l’élevage. En
  effet, de celui-ci dépend à la fois le bien-être des animaux mais aussi la facilité ou la difficulté à
  entretenir les locaux et donc du temps possiblement passé à s’occuper des chiens. La conception
  architecturale doit prendre en compte non seulement les contraintes légales, mais également les
  contraintes liées à la gestion d’un groupe d’animaux et au fonctionnement quotidien du chenil. Il faut
  absolument noter l’importance, par ailleurs, des conditions d’élevage et de l’environnement dans le
  modelage du système nerveux du chiot. L’organisation des locaux doit permettre un confort physique
  aux animaux. Le chien étant un animal social, il est important que la vie en groupe soit possible.

   Certains lieux doivent être particulièrement adaptés à l’élevage. Notamment la maternité. Elle
   représente le noyau de l’élevage. À cet égard, elle doit faire l’objet de précautions et de surveillances
   particulières, car elle héberge les individus les plus fragiles de l’exploitation : les chiots et les mères. Ce
   lieu doit à la fois permettre une hygiène irréprochable, mais aussi permettre le calme, le confort et
   une sérénité pour les mères et les nouveaux nés. Progressivement, ce lieu doit apporter le
   développement nécessaire aux très jeunes chiots.

   Cependant, pour réussir le développement psychologique des chiots, ces derniers doivent être
   exposés à des stimulations extérieures et il est donc nécessaire de garder l’élevage ouvert sur
   l’extérieur, afin que le chiot puisse découvrir et s’habituer au monde façonné par les humains.
   L’adéquation entre le milieu de développement et le futur milieu de vie doit rester un objectif à
   atteindre pour tout éleveur vendant sa production. Les élevages en milieux ruraux, moins stimulants,
   doivent veiller à renforcer les stimulations artificiellement par des bruits et des stimuli proches de
   ceux que rencontreront les chiots chez leurs futurs propriétaires.

◼ La sélection des reproducteurs
  La sélection des reproducteurs est un élément central du travail d’éleveur, elle représente
  l’orientation que l’éleveur souhaite donner à son élevage : production de chiens de famille et/ou de
  chiens de travail, recherche de conformité au standard de la race, …

   De plus, le choix des parents peut être déterminant dans de nombreuses affections héréditaires. Les
   clubs de races informent les éleveurs sur les maladies héréditaires présentes dans la race, et sur la
   sélection à effectuer sur les reproducteurs selon leur statut pour ces maladies. Dans le cas des
   affections comportementales, le choix de la lice est particulièrement important. En effet, c’est elle qui
   doit être capable d’enseigner à ses chiots le calme nécessaire à la compréhension de son
   environnement. Dès lors, choisir une chienne très peureuse, instable ou elle-même souffrant
   d’hyperactivité, va favoriser le risque d’avoir des chiots eux-mêmes atteints. Mais, l'essentiel n'est pas
   d'éliminer cette lice peureuse, mais très belle, mais plutôt de déterminer qu'elle est anormale sur le



                                                    PARTIE 1 - Page 13
   plan comportemental. Dès lors, elle peut être rééduquée en dehors de ses périodes de gestation et
   ses chiots feront l'objet d'une surveillance comportementale particulière. Les autres chiens de
   l’élevage seront invités à participer à l'éducation de ces chiots. Il convient ainsi de rappeler qu'il est
   normal, et même nécessaire, qu'une mère rudoie ses petits. Les interventions maternelles au cours de
   l'éducation doivent être bien connues par les éleveurs.

◼ La conduite de l’élevage
  Certaines règles de conduite d’élevage permettent de limiter les risques d’apparition de troubles du
  comportement. Dès la gestation, le fœtus interagit avec son environnement et l’éleveur peut d’ores et
  déjà agir sur les capacités de perception du futur chiot et donc initier la mise en place des filtres de
  perception. En effet, le fœtus n’est pas isolé de son environnement ; il possède in utero des
  compétences tactiles, gustatives et émotionnelles. Les chiots réagissent dès le 45e jour à une palpation
  des cornes utérines de la chienne. L’intensité de ces réactions diminue avec le nombre des
  stimulations (phénomène d’habituation). Ceci joue probablement un rôle dans la mise en place des
  seuils de sensibilité tactile.

   Une fois les chiots nés, les premiers jours sont très calmes, les chiots dorment 90 % du temps. Pendant
   ces jours, il est impératif de respecter le temps de sommeil et de réaliser des stimulations tactiles
   régulières (comme lors des pesées par exemple).

   L’absence d’attachement et de maternage peut avoir de graves conséquences pour la vie future du
   chien. L’absence de maternage est notamment à l’origine de troubles très déficitaires du chiot
   (dépression de détachement précoce). Il est alors possible d’envisager des imprégnations
   hétérospécifiques par un individu d’une autre espèce et tenus à l’écart de leur espèce jusqu’à environ
   quatre mois.

   Plus les chiots grandissent, plus les troubles de la socialisation peuvent apparaître, engendrant de
   graves problèmes de communication et des conflits avec les congénères. Il est donc important de
   laisser les chiots avec leur mère jusqu’à 7 semaines. En cas d’impossibilité (chiots orphelins), il
   convient de les mettre en présence d’adultes normosocialisés. Pour fournir des chiots capables de
   vivre normalement en famille, dans une ville…, il est indispensable que le milieu de développement
   leur permette d'être confrontés à de nombreux stimuli. Les éleveurs socialisent au maximum les chiots
   et les habituent au maximum de stimuli différents, grâce à des tapis d’éveil, des disques de bruitage et
   un enrichissement du milieu de vie (jeux éducatifs, obstacles d’école des chiots…).

   Jusqu’à 7 semaines, le chiot est attiré par ce qui est nouveau. À partir de 7 semaines, les expériences
   doivent être positives pour participer à cette socialisation. Après 14 semaines, l’aversion domine. La
   socialisation interspécifique est moins facile à
   réaliser et moins stable que la socialisation
   intraspécifique et nécessite des rappels. La
   généralisation aux caractères supra-individuels est
   plus difficile. La socialisation interspécifique est
   plus sensible aux expériences défavorables. Elle
   permet de prévenir les comportements de
   prédation. Il est donc important de mettre
   précocement le chiot en présence d’individus de
   types différents (hommes, femmes, enfants etc…),
   de le mettre en contact avec d’autres espèces et
   différents individus de ces espèces.




                                                  PARTIE 1 - Page 14
6     La commercialisation
La commercialisation des chiots est bien évidemment une étape importante dans la vie d’un élevage.

◼ La communication
  La communication est extrêmement importante, pour faire connaitre son élevage et donc trouver de
  futurs maîtres pour vos chiots.

     Faire connaître son élevage
     Il est important de faire une demande d’affixe. L’affixe, c’est le nom de l’élevage. Ce nom est
     toujours accolé au nom du chien, lorsque que celui-ci est présenté en exposition, en concours….
     C’est la signature de l’élevage. Il permet à toute personne qui trouve tel chien magnifique de
     remonter facilement à l’éleveur et donc potentiellement de venir prendre un chiot.

     Pour faire connaître son élevage, il est important de sortir les chiens en concours : en concours de
     beauté, ce sont les expositions canines, ou en concours de travail, selon la race que l’on a. Ces
     concours de travail peuvent être ludiques (agility, fly ball, dog dancing…) ou sélectifs de race (field,
     ring, RCI…).

     Plus l’élevage est isolé, plus la communication doit être performante.

     Le site internet
     Le site internet est une très belle vitrine, à condition qu’il soit bien réalisé, que les photos soient
     belles et que les mises à jour soient fréquentes. Il n’y a rien de plus ennuyeux qu’un site avec des
     photos floues ou qui n’évolue jamais. C’est donc un investissement très intéressant, mais il faut
     avoir le temps de le faire vivre.

     Il est en effet difficile pour un acheteur de ne pas avoir des nouvelles régulièrement de son futur
     chiot et donc de ne pas avoir des photos régulières et récentes de la portée. Par ailleurs, le site
     internet permet de mettre en avant les objectifs de l’élevage, de présenter ses choix de
     reproduction et de partager ses idées sur la race.

     Il est possible de créer son site soi-même. L’avantage est bien entendu de pouvoir le créer à son
     image et de le faire évoluer progressivement et régulièrement. Une autre possibilité est de passer
     par un professionnel. La qualité est alors bien souvent excellente, avec un graphisme irréprochable.
     Les inconvénients sont souvent le coût de cette prestation et les difficultés pour installer les mises à
     jour.

     Les flyers
     La réalisation de flyers est aussi un bon vecteur de communication. Vous pourrez disposer ces flyers
     lors des manifestations canines, lors de rencontres éleveurs/particuliers, chez les vétérinaires …. Là
     encore, il faut que cette communication soit de bonne qualité. De l’image que vous donnerez, les
     gens se feront une idée de votre élevage…. Il vaut mieux que ce soit en votre faveur !

     Là encore, il est possible de la créer soi-même ou de passer par une agence professionnelle. Le coût
     n’est évidemment pas le même, mais la qualité est parfois aussi bien différente. Le choix se fera en
     fonction de vos fonds économiques… et de vos compétences en informatique.

     Les cliniques vétérinaires
     Les structures vétérinaires peuvent aussi participer à la connaissance de votre élevage. Il est




                                                  PARTIE 1 - Page 15
      toujours possible de présenter son élevage à l’équipe soignante, qui généralement tient une liste
      d’éleveurs en fonction des races demandées par la clientèle. Il est aussi souvent possible de déposer
      des cartes de visite ou des flyers à mettre en salle d’attente.

     Les autres contacts
      Tous les commerces animaliers peuvent être preneurs de contacts locaux pour leurs clients. Il faut
      donc prendre le temps de faire le tour des enseignes locales.
      Certaines enseignes accueillent des villages de race et des salons des chiots. Il est alors possible de
      rencontrer directement les futurs acheteurs. Quelques précautions sont à prendre lors de ces
      manifestations : une réglementation particulière y est appliquée et les conditions sanitaires doivent
      être particulièrement suivies.


◼ Les documents règlementaires lors de la vente de carnivores domestiques
  De nombreux documents plus ou moins officiels et importants sont remis aux propriétaires lors de
  l’achat d’un chiot. Certains de ces documents sont obligatoires !

      L’attestation de vente
      Ce document, exigé par la loi, fait office de contrat entre le vendeur et l’acheteur du chien. Il
      mentionne les coordonnées de l’éleveur et de l’acheteur, l’identité du chien, son prix de vente, son
      numéro d’identification, les noms et numéros de LOF de ses parents, la tâche pour laquelle le chiot
      est destiné (ce qui conditionne le prix de vente et les recours possibles en cas de litige : chien de
      compagnie, chien de travail…) et enfin la date de la vente, essentielle pour les délais de recours lors
      de vice caché ou de vice rédhibitoire. Ses documents peuvent être achetés ou fournis par les
      vendeurs de croquettes. De nombreux exemples sont accessibles sur internet.

      La carte d’identification
      Tous les chiens cédés en France doivent être identifiés soit par tatouage soit par puce électronique.
      Le tatouage est le plus souvent réalisé dans l’oreille droite sous anesthésie générale et peut être
      facilement contrôlé lors de la vente.

      Si le chiot est identifié par puce électronique, le contrôle de l’identification se fait lors de la
      première visite chez son vétérinaire qui utilise un lecteur pour lire la puce.

      Quel que soit le mode d’identification, il est essentiel de vérifier l’exactitude des données inscrites
      sur la carte d’identification et de réaliser les modifications nécessaires auprès de l’I-CAD en cas de
      changements d’adresse, de propriétaire, de numéro de téléphone …

      Le certificat de naissance
      Il atteste que le chiot acheté est bien pure race et inscrit provisoirement au Livre des Origines
      Français. Le vendeur peut parfois ne pas avoir reçu ce document de la SCC lors de la vente. Il inscrit
      alors sur l’attestation de vente le numéro du dossier de déclaration de portée à la SCC. Il s’engage à
      envoyer dès leur réception les certificats de naissance aux nouveaux propriétaires des chiots.

      Le certificat vétérinaire avant cession d’un chien
      Ce document a pour but d’attester de l’état sanitaire du chien avant la cession. Il est généralement
      établi lors de la consultation d’identification et de vaccination du chiot. Le vétérinaire note dessus
      les données de l’animal : numéro d’identification, race ou apparence, appartenance ou non à une
      catégorie et les résultats observés lors de l’examen clinique. Aucun délai n’est précisé par la loi
      entre la réalisation de ce certificat et la vente du chiot. La loi parle juste d’un délai raisonnable.




                                                   PARTIE 1 - Page 16
      Le document d’information
      Les éleveurs ont l’obligation de remettre ce document aux futurs propriétaires de leurs chiots. Ce
      dernier doit présenter les caractéristiques de la race considérée et des informations relatives à
      l’alimentation, l’entretien du chien…

      La vaccination n’est pas imposée par la loi lors de la vente de chiots. Toutefois il est conseillé de la
      réaliser à partir de l’âge de sept semaines afin de protéger les chiots contre les maladies virales
      dangereuses. Si cette injection vaccinale est réalisée, elle est notée sur le certificat vétérinaire
      avant cession ainsi que sur le carnet de santé ou le passeport du chiot.


◼ Le prix de vente des chiots
    Il est complexe de faire des généralités tant les prix peuvent fluctuer d’une race à l’autre, selon
    l’inscription au LOF ou non, les résultats des parents (santé, beauté et/ou travail), la robe du chiot
    (dans certaines races, des robes sont plus recherchées et donc vendues plus chères) …

     Le bon prix est aussi une bonne adéquation entre les qualités actuelles et attendues du chiot et la
     somme demandée. Enfin le bon prix est un prix qui convient au vendeur et à l’acheteur content et
     satisfait de l’animal qu’il a accueilli. Un chiot en mauvaise santé est toujours trop cher !

     En se renseignant près de son vétérinaire, du club de race et sur internet, il est facile de trouver le
     prix moyen correspondant à la race de chien choisie et ainsi avoir un regard critique sur la somme à
     demander.

7       Les formations
Voici les principaux centres de formations. Les listes ne sont bien entendu pas exhaustives. Il faut aussi
faire attention à la validité du diplôme obtenu à la fin de la formation. Certaines structures sont
reconnues comme organisme de formation, mais ne délivrent pas de diplôme reconnu par l’état, mais
simplement un diplôme d’école. Ces formations sont parfois très intéressantes, mais plus comme culture
personnelle que pour leur valeur « diplômante ».

◼ Les formations diplômantes
  Pour exercer en tant qu’éleveur, selon les définitions vues ci-dessus, il faut obtenir l’attestation de
  formation pour l’élevage. Plusieurs centres réalisent ces formations et font passer cet examen
  national.

    La Société Centrale Canine est habilitée à dispenser cette formation. Vous trouverez plus d’information
    sur cette formation sur le site internet de la Centrale : https://www.centrale-canine.fr/articles/la-
    formation

    D’autres diplômes permettent de faire de l’élevage, sans obtenir cette attestation :
    • CAPA élevage canin
    • BPA élevage canin
    • BEPA exploitation, spécialité " élevage canin "
    • BEPA animalerie, spécialité " laboratoire "

FICHE 1                     dans la cynophilie française

La Société Centrale Canine (ou Centrale Canine) est l’organisme pilier de la cynophilie française. La
Fédération, dite « Société Centrale Canine », pour l’amélioration des Races de Chiens en France, a été
fondée en 1882. Elle est reconnue comme établissement d’utilité publique, par décret du 28 avril 1914.
Ses objectifs sont la promotion des races de chiens en France ainsi que la promotion et la protection des
divers rôles du chien dans la société.


        Historique

      1882 : Fondation de la SCC qui regroupe les associations régies par la loi de 1901 ayant pour but de
      contribuer à l’amélioration, à la diffusion et à la défense en France de toutes les races canines
      (utilité, sport ou agrément).

      1885 : Ouverture du Livre des Origines Français (LOF)

      1910 : Avec la Société Royale Saint Hubert de Belgique, la SCC pose les fondations de la Fédération
      Cynologique Internationale (FCI) pour faire reconnaître hors de nos frontières les races françaises
      et introduire en France des races étrangères. La FCI permet la reconnaissance mutuelle des livres
      généalogiques des pays membres et la coordination de leurs actions.

      1914 : La SCC est reconnue d’utilité publique grâce à ses actions menées dans le domaine de
      l’élevage canin en France. Le LOF et les pièces délivrées par la SCC (le certificat de naissance et le
      pedigree) sont reconnus officiellement.

      1969 : La SCC est agréée en tant que Fédération par un arrêté du ministre de l’Agriculture pour
      tenir officiellement le Livre Généalogique Canin.

      1971 : La SCC est agréée, par arrêté du ministre de l’Agriculture, pour l’identification par tatouage
      des chiens ainsi que la création et la tenue du fichier national afférent.

      2013 : La SCC cogère le fichier canin, au travers de la société I-CAD.

      2015 : Modification des statuts de la Centrale canine, et par conséquent de tous les clubs
      d’utilisation, les Clubs spéciaux et des Canines territoriales.



        Organisation

      Le siège social de la SCC se situe 155 avenue Jean Jaurès à Aubervilliers. La SCC est dirigée et
      administrée par un comité composé de 26 personnes qui sont des membres d’une association
      affiliée et élus en assemblée générale. Les membres du comité sont élus pour 6 ans et rééligibles
      par moitié tous les 3 ans.

      La SCC assure l’amélioration et la vulgarisation de toutes les races de chiens en France. Elle a pour
      rôle de resserrer les liens qui unissent ses membres affiliés (associations spécialisées de races,
      fédérations et sociétés canines territoriales). Elle coordonne les activités des membres affiliés et
      assure leur représentation auprès des pouvoirs publics afin de mieux organiser la défense de
      l’élevage canin en France.

FICHE 2                      Qu’est-ce que le LOF ?


                                                       Le LOF, ou Livre des Origines Français, est un
                                                       registre créé en 1885 où sont répertoriées les
                                                       origines des chiens français de race. Seuls les chiens
                                                       inscrits au LOF ont droit à l'appellation « chien de
                                                       race ». Dès que la Société Centrale Canine a été
                                                       fondée, elle a été dotée des deux outils de base que
                                                       requièrent la mise en route et le contrôle régulier de
                                                       toute politique de sélection animale : l'organisation
                                                       d'expositions et un livre généalogique. Le Livre des
                                                       Origines Français (LOF) a donc été créé le 11 mars
                                                       1885 en y inscrivant le premier chien : un Griffon
                                                       Français à poil laineux nommé MARCO, produit par
                                                       M. Boulet, éleveur normand.

                                                   En 1957, la qualité du LOF a été reconnue par le
                                                   Ministère de l'Agriculture qui a décidé d’inscrire le
                                                   LOF au Registre des Livres Généalogiques. Cette
                                                   inscription a pour valeur de reconnaissance et c'est
                                                   ainsi que le LOF, bien qu'il appartienne à une
                                                   association privée, est devenu le livre généalogique
officiel français pour l'espèce canine. Sa tenue confère donc à son propriétaire, la Société Centrale
Canine, la reconnaissance d'utilité publique.

À son ouverture, le Livre des Origines Français était réellement un gros cahier dans lequel on inscrivait les
informations concernant les chiens. Un tel support a été largement suffisant pour recevoir l'inscription
des 200 chiens qui ont été déclarés à la SCC durant la première année, mais de nos jours, ce sont plus de
200 000 inscriptions qui y sont enregistrées chaque année. Il est bien évident que les registres reliés
utilisés à l'ouverture du LOF n'auraient pas permis le contrôle rationnel d'un tel flot d'inscriptions. C'est
pourquoi il s’agit actuellement d'un fichier informatique.

Un chien inscrit au LOF possède un pedigree. Ce dernier est le document officiel comportant la
généalogie du chien et qui certifie l’exactitude de ses origines. Grâce à lui, il est possible de connaître les
origines d'un animal, de retrouver ses ascendants ou ses descendants. Il autorise le suivi des différentes
lignées répertoriées et leur comparaison grâce à l'enregistrement systématique des récompenses
officielles obtenues par chaque animal.

Le pedigree n’est pas attribué automatiquement. Un chiot issu de deux parents LOF et confirmés peut
recevoir un certificat de naissance et être inscrit provisoirement au LOF. Toutefois il ne sera inscrit
définitivement au LOF qu’après passage devant un juge (expert-confirmateur ou spécialisé de cette race)
qui confirmera qu’il correspond bien au standard de la race. Le juge remplit le formulaire de demande de
confirmation et signe le certificat de naissance. Ces documents sont à retourner à la Centrale Canine
accompagnés de la photocopie de la carte d’identification et du montant des droits d’inscription. La SCC
renverra alors le pedigree définitif. Cette étape s’appelle la confirmation et donne la possibilité à ce chien
de devenir un reproducteur dont la descendance peut être inscrite au LOF. Il n'y a pas d'âge maximum
pour que votre chien soit confirmé mais un âge minimum. Ces examens de confirmation se font
généralement lors des expositions canines ou des séances de confirmation partout en France.

FICHE 2                       Qu’est-ce que le LOF ?


L'inscription des chiens (réglementée par l'article 5 du décret n°74-195 du 26 février 1974 relatif à la
tenue du livre généalogique canin) peut s'effectuer selon l'une des 4 modalités suivantes :

•   au titre de la descendance quand il s'agit de chiots issus de parents eux-mêmes déjà inscrits
    définitivement. Ils reçoivent alors un certificat de naissance qui témoigne de leur inscription provisoire,
    car ils ne seront inscrits définitivement qu'après avoir été reconnus aptes lors de l'examen de
    confirmation. L'inscription définitive est attestée par la délivrance du pedigree.

•   à titre initial, quand le livre de la race est ouvert, pour des chiens adultes dont on ne connaît pas les
    origines mais qui, à l'occasion de l'examen de confirmation ont été reconnus conforme au standard de
    leur race et capables de contribuer à son amélioration. Des conditions de santé sont généralement
    demandées par le club de race.

•   au livre d’attente : pour les chiens sans origine connue avec la délivrance d’un certificat au titre de
    l’apparence (races dont le LOF est fermé)

•   au titre de l'importation, quand il s'agit de chiens inscrits à un livre généalogique étranger reconnu par
    la SCC et reconnus aptes par un expert confirmateur.


       Les différents documents nécessaires pour la confirmation ou la déclaration d’une saillie sont
       disponibles sur le site de la SCC : https://www.centrale-canine.fr/

FICHE 3                       Comment avoir une
                              portée de chiens LOF ?




Plusieurs étapes sont nécessaires afin qu’une portée de chiots soit inscrite au LOF. La première condition
à respecter est que les deux parents soient inscrits de façon définitive au LOF, c’est-à-dire qu’ils soient
confirmés, ou inscrits au livre généalogique d’une Société Canine reconnue par la FCI pour les étalons
étrangers. Si ce n’est pas le cas, le dossier est rejeté.

Ensuite le propriétaire de la femelle doit adresser dans les 8 semaines suivant l’accouplement une
déclaration de saillie à la SCC. Pour cela, un certificat de saillie est à télécharger sur le site de la SCC. La
déclaration de saillie coûte 10 euros. Le diagnostic de gestation peut être réalisé par le vétérinaire à partir
de 22-25 jours de gestation. Lorsqu'il s'agit d'une insémination artificielle, il faut joindre à cette
déclaration une attestation du vétérinaire qui a pratiqué l’insémination.

La SCC vérifie les renseignements et produit un dossier, qu'elle envoie au propriétaire de la chienne,
comportant deux volets : une déclaration de naissance et une demande d'inscription.

La déclaration de naissance est à adresser à la SCC dans les quinze jours suivant la naissance de la portée,
en indiquant la date de la mise bas et le nombre de chiots nés.

Puis, une fois les chiots tatoués ou identifiés par puce électronique, le propriétaire de la chienne enverra
la demande d'inscription de la portée. Cette demande comprend le nom et le sexe de chaque chiot, sa
couleur, la nature du poil et le numéro d’identification. On y joint le volet bleu des cartes de tatouage ou
le certificat provisoire d’insert remis par le vétérinaire ainsi que le règlement de 21 euros. Cette demande
d’inscription doit dans tous les cas être effectuée dans les six mois maximum après la naissance.

La SCC édite alors les certificats de naissance de toute la portée et les envoie au propriétaire de la
chienne qui doit les fournir par la suite aux nouveaux propriétaires des chiots.

Le Berger Allemand est la race pour laquelle le nombre d’inscriptions au LOF est le plus élevé depuis de
nombreuses années. On retrouve ensuite par ordre décroissant en fonction du nombre d’inscriptions au
LOF par année : le Berger Belge, le Golden Retriever, le Staffordshire Terrier Américain, le Berger Austra-
lien, le Labrador, le Cavalier King Charles, le Staffordshire Bull Terrier, le Chihuahua, le Bouledogue Fran-
çais, le Setter Anglais….

Les effets de mode influencent de façon importante la représentation des races en fonction des périodes.
Le Labrador, le Cocker et le Husky sont des races qui ont un temps attiré spécialement le public, tout
comme le Jack Russel qui semble déjà en déclin. D’autres races émergent et semblent particulièrement
attirer actuellement les futurs maîtres comme le Staffie, le Bouledogue Français ou le Chihuahua. Le Gol-
den Retriever, le Cavalier King Charles ou encore le Berger Australien sont toujours aimés des Français.

Il est malheureusement regrettable que des effets de mode impactent de façon importante les cheptels
de certaines races dont la qualité est alors menacée. De plus, mal renseignés sur les spécificités de la
race, des propriétaires déçus par leur animal choisissent alors l’abandon car leur compagnon ne corres-
pond pas à l’image idyllique qu’ils s’en étaient fait. Ainsi récemment le Jack Russel a bien trop souvent été
choisi par des propriétaires qui ignoraient leurs caractères et leurs compétences de chiens de chasse, né-
cessitant une éducation ferme.

CAHIER D'EXERCICES
POUR AVOIR UN CHIEN
   SUPER CALME
            N°1 : L'EXERCICE
            DE LA GAMELLE
Pour cet exercice, vous aurez besoin de la gamelle de
votre chien dans laquelle vous mettrez une poignée de
ses croquettes ou des friandises. L'idéal est de travailler
cet exercice en conditions réelles, à chaque moment des
repas de votre chien pendant 2 à 3 minutes par jour.




                                1- POSEZ LA
                                GAMELLE AU SOL
                                Appelez votre chien et
                                montrez lui sa gamelle.
                                Sans rien lui dire,
                                accroupissez-vous et
                                posez la gamelle au sol
                                devant lui en prenant soin
                                de garder la main dessus.
                                 2- RELEVEZ
                                 LA GAMELLE

                                 Dès que votre chien se
                                 précipite sur sa gamelle
                                 pour manger, relevez-la
                                 aussitôt sans rien lui dire.




De nouveau, posez la gamelle au sol en la décalant un
peu de devant votre chien, et relevez-la s'il s'en approche
et tente de manger sans que vous ne lui en ayez donné
l'autorisation.

Recommencez cet exercice autant de fois que nécessaire
et jusqu'à ce que votre chien attende sagement et ne tente
plus de manger le contenu de sa gamelle posée devant lui.
3- RÉCOMPENSEZ VOTRE CHIEN

Au moment où votre chien ne tente plus de manger le
contenu de sa gamelle, et reste calme (assis, ou couché),
récompensez-le en lui donnant une friandise ou une
croquette à la main, contenue dans la gamelle.

Au début ne faites patienter votre chien que quelques
secondes avant de le récompenser.
                                    4- POSEZ ET
                                    LEVEZ-VOUS
                                    Augmentez la difficulté
                                    en posant la gamelle
                                    au sol sans la tenir puis
                                    relevez-vous.




L'objectif de cet exercice est d'apprendre à votre chien à rester
devant sa gamelle pleine, posée au sol et de ne pas y toucher
sans avoir eu votre autorisation. Votre chien tentera plusieurs
fois de "se servir" et vous devrez toujours relever la gamelle sans
lui laisser le temps de manger la moindre croquette.

A l'inverse, si votre chien se résigne et ne cherche plus à
manger sans autorisation, vous pourrez récompenser ce bon
comportement en lui donnant vous même une croquette.
                                  À terme, à l'heure du
                                  repas, vous devrez pouvoir
                                  poser la gamelle de votre
                                  chien devant lui, vous
                                  tenir à distance et avoir
                                  un chien qui ne touche
                                  pas à son repas tant que
                                  vous ne lui avez pas
                                  donné l'autorisation de
                                  manger.




 Pour cet exercice il est important de ne pas parler à
votre chien (pas de "non", "pas toucher", "attend"...) car
 votre chien doit comprendre par lui même que son se
  précipiter sur sa gamelle ne sera pas bénéfique pour
   lui, et qu'il n'aura accès à sa nourriture que lorsqu'il
saura patienter et aura votre autorisation pour manger.
Pour réussir cet exercice, appliquez la formule
"PPR" (Patience, Persévérance et Répétition) :

- Patience : Il faut de la patience pour éduquer un
chien car cela prend du temps et chaque chien
apprend à son rythme selon ses aptitudes.

- Persévérance : Il ne suffit pas de faire l'exercice
une fois pour que cela fonctionne, mais le travailler
quotidiennement et plusieurs fois par jour.

- Répétition : La mère de l'apprentissage est la
répétition ! Plus vous répèterez les exercices, plus
vous les ferez correctement et plus votre chien
apprendra rapidement à être calme et obéissant.




                                   À VOUS
                                 DE JOUER !!!
    N°2 : LA GAMELLE ET
  LE LANCÉ DE FRIANDISES
Nouvelle étape pour cet exercice, où nous augmentons la
difficulté pour faire comprendre à votre chien que même
s'il s'éloigne de la gamelle, quand il revient, il devra
rester calme et ne pourra pas y avoir accès gratuitement
et sans autorisation.




                              1- LANCEZ UNE
                              CROQUETTE
                              Prenez une croquette de la
                              gamelle, montrez-la à votre
                              chien puis lancez-la
                              à quelques mètres.

                              Votre chien va aller la
                              chercher, puis laissez-le
                              revenir auprès de vous et
                              de la gamelle posée au sol.
                                    2- ATTENDEZ
                                    DE VOIR CE
                                    QUE VA FAIRE
                                    VOTRE CHIEN




- Si en revenant, votre chien tente de s'approcher de sa
gamelle et de mettre le museau dedans, relevez-la,
attendez que votre chien soit plus calme puis posez la de
nouveau.

- Si à son retour votre chien reste calme devant sa gamelle
sans y toucher, récompensez-le en lui donnant une
croquette, puis lancez de nouveau une friandise dans une
autre direction que la fois précédente.
3- PROTECTION DE LA GAMELLE


                           En fonction de votre chien
                           et de sa compréhension de
                           l'exercice, vous pouvez
                           utiliser une variante qui
                           consiste à poser votre
                           main sur la gamelle pour lui
                           en interdire l'accès.




Votre chien pourra cependant essayer de lécher ou
gratter votre main pour accéder à ses croquettes.

Utilisez l'option qui convient le mieux à la bonne
compréhension de votre chien.
Le but de l'exercice est d'entraîner votre chien à résister
 à la tentation de se jeter sur sa gamelle, même après
  s'en être éloigné pour s'intéresser brièvement à autre
                 chose, et à rester calme.




  Un chien obéissant est avant tout un chien calme.
La majorité des problèmes que les maîtres rencontrent,
  viennent du fait que leur chien a trop d'énergie et
                    est trop excité.

  Mettez en place cet exercice pour qu'il devienne
   une routine et que votre chien devienne de plus
                    en plus calme.




             À VOUS DE JOUER !!!
      N°3 : LE LANCÉ DE
  FRIANDISES ET LE RAPPEL
Cet exercice va permettre de renforcer l'ordre du Rappel,
en posant l'ordre sur l'action que vous aurez provoquée par
le lancé de friandise.

Pour travailler cet exercice, munissez-vous d'une poignée
de croquettes de son repas.




                                1- LANCEZ UNE
                                CROQUETTE
                                Prenez une croquette de la
                                gamelle, montrez-la à votre
                                chien puis lancez-la
                                à quelques mètres.
                                Laissez votre chien aller la
                                chercher et la manger.
                                        2- RAPPELEZ
                                        VOTRE CHIEN
                                        Au moment où votre chien
                                        revient vers vous, appelez-
                                        le uniquement par son
                                        nom, tout en reculant et en
                                        lui montrant la 2ème
                                        croquette, ceci afin de
                                        l'attirer et l'aspirer vers vous.




   À ce stade n'utilisez aucun ordre de rappel, juste son nom afin
   d'associer ce dernier à quelque chose d'intéressant pour votre
   chien, et à le rendre donc plus focus.



3- RÉCOMPENSEZ LE RETOUR
Dès que votre chien est revenu auprès de vous, donnez-lui
immédiatement la croquette que vous avez en main sans rien lui
demander de plus (ni assis, ni pas bouger...), afin de bien récompenser
le rappel. N'hésitez pas également, à parler à votre chien pour
l'encourager et caressez-le afin que l'exercice soit fun et ludique.
Afin d'optimiser l'apprentissage, faites ces exercices
dans un environnement calme. Rangez les jouets,
assurez-vous que personne autour de vous ne puisse
distraire votre chien (enfants qui jouent, courent,
mangent...).

Travaillez les exercices au moment des repas mais
également dès que vous avez un peu de temps à
consacrer à votre chien. Il faut privilégier des
sessions de travail courtes (3,5 à 15 min) mais les
reproduire le plus souvent possible (2 à 3 ou 5 fois
par jour) pour qu'elles portent leur fruits.

Vous pouvez combiner les exercices qui vous sont
expliqués afin que le travail reste agréable pour
votre chien et qu'il ne se lasse pas.




                                  À VOUS DE
                                   JOUER !!!
N°4 : LE LANCÉ DE FRIANDISES
 ET LE MARQUEUR POSITIF
 Même exercice que le précédent mais cette fois, en
 intégrant un marqueur positif afin de renforcer le
 comportement de votre chien et vous rendre encore
 plus agréable et attractif à ses yeux.




                              1- LANCEZ DES
                              CROQUETTES

                              Comme vu dans l'exercice
                              précédent, lancez une
                              croquette dans une
                              direction, puis dans une
                              autre après que votre chien
                              soit revenu.
                                2- LE MARQUEUR
                                POSITIF
                                AU RETOUR
                                Cette fois-ci, lorsque
                                votre chien revient vers
                                vous, ajoutez un
                                marqueur positif de la
                                voix afin de renforcer ce
                                bon comportement.




Comme marqueur positif, utilisez plutôt le "Yes" que le
"Oui" (que vous utilisez une multitude de fois dans la
journée). Enchaînez les lancés de façon à ce qu'à peine
arrivé, votre chien reparte derrière une friandise.
                                3- CET EXERCICE
                                DOIT ÊTRE UN JEU
                                POUR VOTRE CHIEN
                                En pratiquant cet exercice
                                régulièrement et de façon
                                joyeuse et ludique, votre
                                chien deviendra plus
                                attentif à vous et sera donc
                                plus à l'écoute.

                                Il cherchera votre attention
                                pour interagir avec vous plus
                                qu'avec des stimuli extérieurs.



Avec cet exercice fun, vous vous rendez intéressant et
important aux yeux de votre chien et créez de l'interaction
agréable pour lui : il cherchera alors davantage à interagir,
jouer avec vous car il a compris que c'est agréable pour lui
et sera ainsi plus attentif à vous et donc moins à son
environnement en extérieur. Vous aurez un chien
beaucoup plus attentif et obéissant.


             À VOUS DE JOUER !!!
  N°5 : LE ASSIS AU LEURRE
C'est généralement le premier ordre que chaque maître
apprend à son chien, néanmoins certains chiens
s'assoient puis se relèvent aussitôt, or un "Assis" acquis
est un "Assis" maintenu.




LA PHASE 1 : LA RÉCOMPENSE
SYSTÉMATIQUE
                                1- L'IMPORTANCE
                                D'UNE BONNE
                                COMMUNICATION
                                Elle est utile pour
                                augmenter les chances
                                que votre chien vous
                                comprenne facilement
                                et vous obéisse donc
                                rapidement.
Votre communication avec lui doit être claire :
- Vous prononcerez donc en premier lieu son nom suivi de
l'ordre. (Par exemple: "Lola... Assis !")

- Inutile de répéter l'ordre plusieurs fois à la suite et avec
précipitation car cela risquerait de le rendre confus et de le
faire monter en excitation.

Egalement si vous répétez plusieurs fois l'ordre, vous
apprendrez à votre chien à vous désobéir autant de fois
que vous lui aurez demandé et qu'il n'aura pas exécuté.




2- LE "ASSIS" AU LEURRE
                                  Présentez ensuite une
                                  friandise à votre chien puis
                                  reculez pour l'attirer à vous.
                                  Arrêtez-vous puis levez la
                                  friandise au-dessus de sa tête.

                                  À ce moment-là, votre chien
                                  aura le réflexe de s'asseoir
                                  pour garder votre main et la
                                  friandise dans son champ de
                                  vision.
                                 3- LE "ASSIS"
                                 VERROUILLÉ
                                 Le Assis correctement
                                 exécuté est un assis que
                                 votre chien saura
                                 maintenir sans se relever
                                 aussitôt. Pour lui apprendre
                                 à rester assis, attendez
                                 quelques secondes avant de
                                 le récompenser avec la
                                 friandise que vous avez
                                 utilisé comme leurre.



Au début vous attendrez 3 secondes, avant de le
récompenser, puis si votre chien réussit correctement à
maintenir son "Assis", vous pourrez passer à 5 secondes, puis
10 secondes, et au fur et à mesure de la progression du travail,
vous pourrez augmenter le temps d'attente avant qu'il ne
reçoive sa récompense.

Si votre chien se relève avant le délai déterminé, déplacez-
vous puis recommencez l'exercice en diminuant votre
exigence au niveau du temps du maintien du assis.


              À VOUS DE JOUER !!!
    N°6 : LE ASSIS AU GESTE

Les chiens fonctionnent selon des lois d'apprentissage.
Pour les apprentissages, il y a 3 phases pour la
récompense.

La 1ère est la phase de récompense systématique,
(que nous avons utilisé dans les exercices précédents), et
qui permet d'apprendre un nouvel ordre ou
comportement à votre chien.

Ensuite et afin d'éviter que votre chien ne vous obéisse
uniquement si vous avez des friandises, il faudra passer
à la phase N°2.




            LA PHASE 2 :
    LA RÉCOMPENSE INTERMITTENTE
1- LE "ASSIS" AU LEURRE + ORDRE
+ RÉCOMPENSE FRIANDISE

                                 Comme sur les précédents
                                 exercices, vous allez
                                 prononcer le nom de
                                 votre chien et un "Assis"
                                 en utilisant une friandise
                                 comme leurre.

                                 Une fois que votre chien se
                                 sera exécuté, vous lui
                                 donnerez la friandise en
                                 guise de récompense, puis
                                 vous vous déplacerez pour
                                 recommencer l'exercice.



2- LE "ASSIS" AU GESTE + ORDRE
+ RÉCOMPENSE CARESSE ET FÊTE
Pour ce 2ème "Assis", vous n'aurez pas la friandise dans la
main, mais vous ferez le même geste qui accompagne
l'ordre. Quand votre chien sera assis, vous le récompenserez
uniquement en lui faisant une méga fête (récompense
vocale et caresse).
                           Après chaque réussite,
                           alternez le mode de
                           récompense, entre
                           friandise et récompense
                           vocale et caresse.

                           Répétez cet exercice
                           une dizaine de fois afin
                           que votre chien
                           apprenne à vous obéir
                           même si vous n'avez pas
                           de friandise.




          À VOUS DE JOUER !!!


N°7 : LA COMMUNICATION
       NON VERBALE
Un chien ne parle pas et communique avec ses
    congénères en utilisant des postures
  corporelles, des mimiques et des regards.

  Il est donc plus facile pour un chien de nous
comprendre et nous obéir lorsque nous utilisons
 la gestuelle plutôt que la parole. Il comprend
 d'ailleurs à 70% nos postures corporelles et
       seulement 30% les ordres vocaux.
                                LE "ASSIS" EN
                               PHASE MUETTE
                              ET RÉCOMPENSE
                               SYSTÉMATIQUE




1- LE "ASSIS" AU LEURRE + LE NOM + LE GESTE

  À partir du moment où vous ne communiquerez plus
  l'ordre par la voix à votre chien, vous lui ajoutez une
  difficulté par rapport à ce que votre chien est habitué,
  c'est pourquoi, il faudra repasser en phase 1 de la
  récompense, c'est-à-dire la récompense
  systématique...

  - Prenez une friandise, interpellez votre chien en
  prononçant son nom, puis montrez-lui la friandise,
  levez-la au dessus de sa tête. Dès que votre chien
  s'assied, récompensez-le en lui donnant la friandise
  immédiatement.
- Déplacez-vous entre chaque exercice pour
remettre votre chien en mouvement.

- Répétez cet exercice 5 fois en utilisant le leurre/la
friandise et sans prononcer le mot "Assis".

- Récompensez votre chien à chaque fois
uniquement à l'aide de la friandise.
2- LE "ASSIS" AU LEURRE + GESTE



                                 Une fois que votre chien a
                                 un taux de réussite de 100%
                                 à l'exercice au leurre (vu
                                 plus haut), vous pouvez
                                 passer au second niveau :




- Prenez une friandise dans la main, déplacez-vous et
quand votre chien est connecté à vous, immobilisez-vous
et sans rien lui dire, levez votre main au-dessus de sa tête.

Votre chien doit s'asseoir sans que vous n'ayez prononcé ni
son nom, ni l'ordre "Assis". S'il ne s'exécute pas, attendez
quelques secondes puis recommencez en faisant un
geste plus lent afin de le guider dans son mouvement.

- Attendez quelques secondes (3,5 puis 10 secondes...)
avant de récompenser votre chien. Ne le regardez pas dans
les yeux quand vous le faites patienter avant de le
récompenser car votre regard va l'interpeller et risque de le
faire se lever prématurément.
Maintenant que votre chien a compris l'ordre assis par la
gestuelle, vous allez pouvoir commencer à passer à la
phase 2 de la récompense, c'est-à-dire : la phase
intermittente.


LE "ASSIS" EN PHASE MUETTE ET
RÉCOMPENSE INTERMITTANTE
Le principe est de travailler en donnant les ordres en
phase muette, ou uniquement par la gestuelle, et
d'alterner entre le leurre + récompense friandise, et le
geste + récompense vocale et caresse.




1- LE "ASSIS" AU LEURRE + GESTE:
                             Reprenez l'exercice
                             précédent où vous demandez
                             un "Assis" par la gestuelle à
                             votre chien, en commençant
                             par utiliser une friandise
                             comme leurre.

                             Dès que votre chien s'assoit,
                             attendez quelques secondes
                             pour vous assurer que votre
                             chien maintienne sa position,
                             puis récompensez-le avec la
                             friandise.
                                   2- LE "ASSIS"
                                   AU GESTE
                                   Enchaînez avec une
                                   deuxième demande
                                   de "Assis" sans parler et
                                   uniquement par la
                                   gestuelle, mais cette
                                   fois, pas de leurre :
                                   votre main sera vide.




Dès que votre chien s'assoit,
attendez quelques secondes puis
récompensez-le vocalement et
avec une caresse en y mettant de
l'enthousiasme !

- Déplacez-vous entre chaque
demande de "Assis".

- Si votre chien ne s'exécute
pas, attendez quelques
secondes avant de reformuler
votre demande par le geste.

- Si votre chien ne s'assoit toujours
pas, n'hésitez pas à retravailler
plus longtemps la phase 1.
           N°8 : LE COUCHÉ
Tout comme le "Assis", utilisez la technique du leurre
pour apprendre l'ordre "Couché" à votre chien.


PHASE 1 - DÉCLENCHEMENT DE L'ACTION
1- LE "COUCHÉ" AU LEURRE

                               Si votre chien ne connaît pas
                               l'ordre "Couché", prenez une
                               friandise dans votre main
                               accroupissez-vous puis
                               montrez la friandise à votre
                               chien.

                               Abaissez votre main au sol
                               (paume de la main vers le sol,
                               enfermant la friandise.

                               Attendez que votre chien se
                               couche avant de libérer la
                               friandise pour le récompenser.
Si votre chien est un chiot ou qu'il ne connaît pas le
"couché", il risque de vous lécher ou de gratter votre
main avec ses pattes pour accéder à la friandise.

Patientez et laissez-le se "fatiguer" à essayer de
l'attraper, il finira par se coucher pour être plus à l'aise,
et à ce moment-là, vous libérerez la friandise. Votre
chien fonctionne par association, il va donc comprendre
que c'est en se couchant qu'il pourra obtenir la friandise.



PHASE 2 : LA COMMUNICATION
2- LE "COUCHÉ" AU LEURRE + NOM + ORDRE



                               Une fois que votre chien
                               aura compris et suivra votre
                               main qui tient la friandise,
                               vous pourrez passer à la
                               phase 2 qui consiste à
                               poser l'ordre sur l'action.



Vous vous déplacerez avec une friandise dans la
main, puis, prononcerez le nom de votre chien,
abaisserez votre main au sol en même temps que vous
direz l'ordre "Couché". Dès que votre chien se couche,
libérez la friandise.
Répétez cet exercice plusieurs fois en vous déplaçant
entre chaque exercice pour que votre chien associe bien
l'action à l'ordre (et inversement).


Attention à ne pas demander de "Assis" à votre chien
avant le "Couché", car lorsque vous lui demanderez de se
coucher, votre chien prendra l'habitude de s'asseoir
avant de se coucher. (Tous les chiens savent passer de
la position debout au couché sans passer par la position
assise).




3- LE "COUCHÉ" VERROUILLÉ

Maintenant que votre chien sait se coucher sur
demande, on veut qu'il sache tenir la position et qu'il ne
se relève pas aussitôt.

Pour cela :
1) Prononcez le nom de votre chien ainsi que l'ordre
"Couché" et abaissez votre main au sol.
2) Une fois votre chien couché, relevez votre main à
hauteur de son museau.
3) Attendez 3 secondes, puis 5, puis 10....et
récompensez votre chien avec la friandise
 Répétez cet exercice au moins 5 fois à
la suite, en vous déplaçant entre chaque.
3- LE CHIEN COUCHÉ, LE MAÎTRE
SE RELÈVE PROGRESSIVEMENT

                   Votre chien va ensuite
                   devoir apprendre à se
                   coucher sans que vous
                   n'ayez besoin de vous
                   baisser.

                   Pour cela, procédez en
                   commençant à vous
                   redresser progressivement.

                   Poursuivez l'exercice en
                   relevant la friandise de
                   plus en plus jusqu'à pouvoir
                   vous redresser totalement.




                   Attention, à ne pas essayer
                   de vous redresser trop vite,
                   votre mouvement de corps
                   va influencer votre chien.

                   Donc à chaque exercice
                   relevez-vous
                   progressivement et de
                   quelques centimètres à
                   chaque fois.
                      Dans la phase où vous vous
                      redressez progressivement,
                      enfermez la friandise
                      dans votre poing et
                      éloignez le un peu du
                      museau de votre chien
                      pour qu'il ne soit pas
                      attiré par la friandise et
                      ne se relève pas pour
                      l'attraper.




Avancez étape par étape et ne passez pas à
l'étape supérieure tant que la précédente
         n'est pas acquise à 100%.
4- LE CHIEN COUCHÉ, LE MAÎTRE DEBOUT
Une fois ces étapes franchies, vous allez pouvoir demander
le "couché" à votre chien en marquant votre geste de
façon plus appuyée tout en restant droit. Vous aurez la
friandise à la main mais celle-ci ne servira plus de leurre.




1) Friandise en main, prononcez le nom de votre chien
2) et 3) Donnez l'ordre" couché" en abaissant votre main
vers le sol.
4) Attendez que votre chien se couche.
5) et 6) Enfermez la friandise dans votre poing, éloignez-le
du museau de votre chien et redressez vous.
                   7) Récompensez
                      votre chien
                   avec la friandise.




 À VOUS DE JOUER !!!



N°8 : LE COUCHÉ
   AU GESTE
  Votre chien sait maintenant se coucher sur ordre et avec
  le geste, nous allons maintenant lui apprendre à obéir
  au "Couché" uniquement au geste et sans l'ordre vocal.
  Pour cet exercice, nous utiliseront le leurre friandise et la
  récompense systématique.


 1- LE "COUCHÉ" AU LEURRE AVEC
 LE NOM + LE GESTE




1) Prenez une         2) Faites le geste     3) Attendez que
friandise dans la     du "Couché" en         votre chien se
main, prononcez       abaissant votre        couche.
le nom de votre       main vers le sol
chien.                sans parler.




                              4) Récompensez votre
                              chien avec la friandise
2- LE "COUCHÉ" AU LEURRE + LE GESTE
Même exercice mais en à cette étape, vous ne
prononcerez plus le nom de votre chien et travaillerez
entièrement en phase muette. Répétez l'exercice
autant de fois que nécessaire pour obtenir 100% de
réussite avant de passer à l'étape suivante.




  Prenez une friandise            Faites le geste du
   dans la main, puis           "Couché" en abaissant
 montrez-la à votre chien        votre main vers le sol
sans prononcer son nom.               sans parler.




  Attendez que votre              Récompensez votre
   chien se couche.              chien avec la friandise.
3- CHIEN COUCHÉ AU LEURRE,
MAÎTRE DEBOUT

Sur la base de l'exercice précédent : l'ordre donné
uniquement au leurre et la gestuelle (en phase muette),
vous commencerez à vous redresser pour être
debout et droit.

Une fois votre chien couché, enfermez la friandise
dans votre poing, éloignez-le du museau de votre
chien et redressez-vous par étape.




Faites plusieurs fois l'exercice en vous redressant de
quelques centimètres, puis de plus en plus, au fur et à
mesure que votre chien restera couché.

- Si votre chien se relève, retravaillez plusieurs fois
l'étape précédente.
- Une fois que vous êtes relevé, commencez à compter
les secondes pour apprendre à votre chien à verrouiller
sa position.
4- LE "COUCHÉ" AVEC ET SANS LEURRE
EN ALTERNANCE
                              Comme pour le "Assis",
                              apprenez à votre chien
                              à vous obéir autant sans
                              leurre qu'avec.

                              Alternez les phases de
                              récompense à la
                              friandise avec des phases
                              sans friandises et en le
                              récompensant à la
                              félicitation vocale et à la
                              caresse.



LE "COUCHÉ" AU GESTE UNIQUEMENT
(SANS LEURRE)
1) Captez l'attention de votre chien
2) Levez votre main et abaissez-la vers le sol sans
parler pour demander un "couché" en gestuelle.
3) Attendez que votre chien se couche
puis relevez-vous (de plus en plus vite au fil
des répétitions pour augmenter la difficulté).

4) Attendez quelques secondes, puis
récompensez votre chien.




       Faites des petites séances d'exercices de 5-10
       minutes plusieurs fois par jour. Entre chacune
       de ces sessions, laissez votre chien se reposer
       pour qu'il assimile le travail réalisé.

       N'allez pas trop vite et calez-vous au rythme
       d'apprentissage de votre chien. Laissez-lui le
       temps d'acquérir totalement chacune des
       étapes avant de passer aux suivantes et au
       degré de difficulté supérieur.

       Les récompenses devront être à la hauteur de
       la difficulté de l'exercice, à vous de jouer !!
         N°9 : LE ACA (ASSIS,
          COUCHÉ, ASSIS)
Maintenant que votre chien connaît le "Assis" et le
"Couché" ainsi que l'ordre verbal et la gestuelle pour ces
2 ordres, nous allons travailler l'enchaînement de ces
2 positions.

De manière générale, votre chien passe facilement de la
position assise au couché, mais il est souvent plus
difficile pour lui, de passer du couché au assis. L'exercice
du "ACA" va permettre à votre chien d'être à l'aise sur les
2 types d'enchaînements et surtout d'apprendre à
obéir rapidement.



PHASE 1 - LE "ACA" AU LEURRE
AVEC NOM+ORDRE VOCAL+GESTE
Pour ce premier exercice, utilisez une friandise comme
leurre + nom de votre chien + l'ordre vocal + le geste.
Essayez d'enchaîner les 3 ordres le plus rapidement
possible pour apprendre à votre chien à obéir rapidement.
 Nom du chien + "Assis"
    + Geste et Leurre           Nom du chien + "Couché"
=> Exemple : "Lola, assis !"        + Geste et Leurre
                               => Exemple : "Lola, couché !"




                                 Nom du chien + "Assis"
                                 + Geste et Leurre
                                 => Exemple : "Lola, assis !"




  Si sur ce 3ème ordre, votre chien reste couché et a du mal
  à s'asseoir, n'hésitez pas à attirer son attention et vous
  montrer motivant, en utilisant des subterfuges et
  éventuellement à reculer de quelques pas pour le faire
  se lever (dans l'intention de se rapprocher de vous).
  Répétez cet enchaînement d'exercice au moins 5 fois en
  vous déplaçant entre chaque série.
  1- PHASE 2 : LE "ACA" AU LEURRE +
  ORDRE VOCAL + GESTE


  Pour cette 2eme phase, plus besoin de prononcer le nom
  de votre chien. Utilisez toujours une friandise comme
  leurre + l'ordre vocal + le geste.

  Continuez d'enchaîner les 3 ordres le plus rapidement
  possible pour apprendre à votre chien à obéir
  rapidement sans avoir à l'interpeller avant chaque ordre.

  La phase muette consiste à ne plus donner aucun ordre
vocal. Vous pouvez parler à votre chien uniquement pour le
motiver ou le féliciter. Répétez cet enchaînement d'exercices
  au moins 5 fois, en vous déplaçant entre chaque série.



               À VOUS DE JOUER !!!
           N°10 : LE DEBOUT
Pour l'apprentissage du "Debout", on travaille
toujours avec une friandise comme leurre.


1- LE "DEBOUT AU LEURRE"
À ce stade, ne donnez pas d'ordre vocal (Debout), car
votre chien ne le connaît pas encore. Il faut d'abord lui
apprendre l'action.




                               Commencez l'exercice avec
                               votre chien en position assise.
                               Mettez votre main qui tient la
                               friandise devant le museau de
                               votre chien et reculez-là pour
                               que votre chien la suive. Cela
                               provoquera le fait de se relever.
Reculez votre main en
un mouvement
rectiligne, en la gardant
au niveau du museau de
votre chien. Attention à
ne pas lever votre main
sinon votre chien risque
de s'asseoir ou de sauter.




Une fois votre chien
debout, ne bougez plus
votre bras et attendez
quelques secondes avant
de lui donner la friandise.
A ce moment là, votre
chien est debout et
immobile. Ne levez pas la
friandise sinon il risque de
s'asseoir.




Pour éviter que votre chien
ne s'assoie, passez votre
main sous le ventre et
caressez-le pour qu'il
maintienne sa position
debout. Gardez la friandise
juste devant son museau.
 Faites cet exercice du "Debout" en partant de la
 position assise mais aussi depuis la position couchée.

 Faites cet exercice plusieurs fois de suite en gardant
 votre main et la friandise devant le museau de votre
 chien.




2- APPRENDRE À MAINTENIR LA
POSITION "DEBOUT"
                            Refaites le même exercice
                            mais cette fois, en apprenant à
                            votre chien à maintenir la
                            position debout en statique.
                            Pour cela commencez à
                            éloigner votre main pour
                            garder la friandise à distance
                            tout en maintenant votre
                            chien dans la position debout.

                            Attendez quelques secondes
                            puis récompensez-le.




- Les chiens sont très souvent conditionnés à s'asseoir
dès que nous sommes en statique donc votre chien
aura le réflexe de s'asseoir, c'est pourquoi, n'hésitez pas
à garder la main sous le ventre de votre chien afin de
l'aider à rester debout.
                         - Enlevez progressivement
                         votre main de sous son
                         ventre, pour habituer votre
                         chien à rester debout sans
                         aide.




- Attendez que votre chien tienne quelques
secondes de lui même la position pour le
récompenser.

- À chaque fois que vous verrez votre chien debout
en statique, quel que soit le moment de la journée,
renforcez l'ordre en prononçant "Debout" puis
félicitez-le.
3- ENCHAÎNEMENT DU "DEBOUT /
COUCHÉ / DEBOUT"

Comme pour l'exercice de "ACA" vu plus haut, vous allez
pouvoir entraîner votre chien à enchaîner les positions
"Debout/ Couché /Debout", toujours au leurre et sans
donner d'ordre.

Le but est d'apprendre à votre chien à exécuter positions
en suivant votre main et la friandise. Répétez cet exercice
jusqu'à ce que votre chien l'intègre complètement




DEBOUT                  COUCHÉ                   DEBOUT
4- INTÉGRATION DE L'ORDRE VOCAL
Une fois que votre chien prend les positions, vous allez
pouvoir intégrer les ordres vocaux afin qu'il apprenne
à associer l'action à l'ordre et inversement.




Ne cherchez pas à aller trop vite, ne passez à cette étape que
quand votre chien a parfaitement intégré les positions
uniquement au leurre.

Continuez d'essayer de lui faire maintenir la position de
plus en plus longtemps avant de le récompenser
(quelques secondes). Ne récompensez votre chien que
lorsque celui-ci est debout et attend calmement. S'il
s'assoit, reculez pour le faire se lever.


S'il s'assoit trop souvent, qu'il se couche trop souvent alors
qu'il avait intégré la position debout, ou encore qu'il se
déconnecte et s'en va, c'est peut-être que votre chien
commence à fatiguer. Dans ce cas, arrêtez les exercices et
reprenez après que votre chien se soit reposé.
5- APPRENDRE À SE DÉSINTÉRESSER
DE LA FRIANDISE
Il faut maintenant que votre chien apprenne à ne plus
avoir besoin d'être leurré à la friandise.

Pour cela, vous ne récompenserez désormais plus le debout
mais le fait qu'il ne cherche plus à atteindre la friandise
dans votre main.




                               Partez de la position
                               couchée, puis demandez
                               un "Debout" à votre chien.

                               Une fois qu'il est debout
                               et immobile en position
                               maintenue, essayez
                               d'éloigner votre main
                               contenant la friandise.


S'il tente d'avancer, rapprochez votre main pour le
stopper, puis de nouveau, éloignez-la... Jusqu'à ce qu'il
maintienne le debout, sans chercher à manger la friandise
et ceci pendant quelques secondes puis de plus en plus
longtemps.

Pour travailler, changez de direction, remettez votre chien
en mouvement entre chaque exercice afin qu'il ne se lasse
pas et que le travail reste ludique.
À ce stade, vous pouvez
encore aider votre chien à
garder la position debout si
besoin.

Essayez de distancer de
plus en plus votre main et
de vous redresser.




Si votre chien est trop excité
par la friandise et à du mal à
se concentrer, travaillez
uniquement avec le geste
et rangez la friandise. Ne la
sortez qu'au moment de le
récompenser.
6- SOLUTION ALTERNATIVE N°1
POUR APPRENDRE LE "DEBOUT"
À VOTRE CHIEN (ET SI CELUI-CI
A TROP TENDANCE À S'ASSEOIR) :


Travaillez assis au sol en faisant avancer votre chien
entre vos jambes et que celui-ci soit debout à cheval au
dessus d'une de vos jambes, qui représentera un
obstacle ou un inconfort si votre chien s'assoit.
Augmentez la durée du maintien de la position.
7- SOLUTION ALTERNATIVE N°2
POUR APPRENDRE LE "DEBOUT"
À VOTRE CHIEN


Travaillez l'ordre debout en vous déplaçant avec
votre chien, puis arrêtez-vous et récompensez
immédiatement en présentant la friandise
devant le museau (Attention : si vous levez la
friandise trop haut, votre chien risque de s'asseoir).




        Marchez...              Arrêtez-vous et donnez
                                 immédiatement une
                               friandise à votre chien à
                               hauteur de son museau


              À VOUS DE JOUER !!!
    N°11 : LE "PAS BOUGER"
            LES BASES

1- LES BASES DU "PAS BOUGER"
SANS LAISSE

Le "Pas bouger" est un ordre qu'il est important
d'apprendre à votre chien pour pouvoir le contrôler et
lui apprendre à rester calme dans certaines situations.




                               1) Mettez votre chien
                               en position assise
                               (ou couché au choix).
                            2) Placez-vous devant lui
                            puis présentez-lui
                            votre paume de main.




À ce stade, votre chien ne connaît pas encore le "pas
bouger" donc ne donnez aucun ordre vocal car il
n'obéira pas et il faut éviter de dénaturer l'ordre.
On commence donc par lui apprendre à avoir l'attitude.




                            3) Sans regarder votre
                            chien (pour ne pas
                            l'interpeller visuellement)
                            reculez d'un pas.
                            Attendez 2 secondes.
                            4) Revenez vers votre
                            Chien : Sans le regarder
                            pour ne pas l'interpeller et
                            risquer qu'il ne bouge.
                            Restez droit pour ne pas
                            le faire fauter.




                            5) Attendez
                            quelques secondes
                            puis récompensez-le.
                            Au moment de la
                            récompense, vous
                            pouvez le regarder.




Répétez l'exercice plusieurs fois en changeant
d'emplacement et de pièce à chaque fois afin de ne pas
conditionner votre chien à obéir uniquement à un
endroit précis, et répétez-le autant de fois que
nécessaire pour que votre chien fasse à chaque fois un
sans faute. Vous pourrez à ce moment-là commencer à
augmenter la distance et reculer de 2 puis 3, 4 pas...
Si votre chien faute et bouge, faites un marqueur
négatif ("Pschiit") ou claquez des doigts, revenez et
replacez-le à l'endroit initial et recommencez
l'exercice.

Si votre chien avance vers vous quand vous reculez,
replacez-le, sinon vous aller lui apprendre qu'il peut
avancer (et donc bouger). Evitez donc toutes
approximations pour ne pas lui laisser prendre de
mauvaises habitudes.



Si votre chien faute plusieurs fois de suite lorsque vous
augmentez la distance entre vous et lui, c'est que vous
êtes allez trop vite dans la prise de distance. Dans ce
cas partez moins loin et travaillez plus longtemps la
distance à laquelle il réussi l'exercice. La distance que
vous prenez doit se faire progressivement.




Ne lui apprenez pas à répéter sans cesse "pas
bouger" sinon votre chien se conditionnera à obéir que
si vous lui parlez constamment.

Lorsque vous revenez vers votre chien, attendez de plus
en plus longtemps avant de le récompenser afin qu'il ne
se conditionne pas à bouger dès que vous arrivez et qu'il
anticipe ainsi la fin de l'exercice.
                               6) Travaillez jusqu'à
                               pouvoir vous éloigner de
                               10 pas. N'oubliez pas : plus
                               la difficulté de l'exercice
                               est importante, plus la
                               récompense doit être forte.




2- LE "PAS BOUGER" EN LAISSE
On commencera cet
exercice avec votre chien
placé à côté de vous.




                            1) Placez votre chien à
                            côté de vous et du côté
                            auquel il est
                            habituellement en laisse.
2) Faites le geste de la main
puis dites-lui "Pas bouger" et
     pivotez devant lui.
3) Reculez sans le
regarder dans les yeux et
déroulez la laisse ou la
longe pour pouvoir
mettre le pied dessus
et assurer sa sécurité au
cas où il bougerai.
Attention à ne pas tirer
sur la laisse pour ne pas
le faire fauter.




4) Revenez à côté de lui
sans le regarder et en
restant droit. Puis
déverrouillez-le en
prononçant un mot qui
annoncera la fin de
l'exercice.
Personnellement j'utilise
"Wasabi wasabi"
                                     5) Félicitez et
                                     récompensez
                                      votre chien.




Refaites cet exercice autant de fois que nécessaire pour
que votre chien apprenne à ne pas bouger même
quand vous vous éloignez de 10 pas.




Revenez bien systématiquement auprès de votre chien
pour le déverrouiller et ne le rappelez jamais à vous,
sinon il va comprendre qu'il a le droit de vous rejoindre
et aura plus tendance à bouger par anticipation de votre
rappel.



             À VOUS DE JOUER !!!
                 N°12 : LE "PAS
                   BOUGER"
       Niveau 1 : LA DISTANCE (avec stimuli)

Reprenez l'exercice du "pas bouger" comme vu plus haut :


    1- GESTE DE LA MAIN + "PAS BOUGER"
      2- PIVOTEZ DEVANT VOTRE CHIEN


                                3- RECULEZ SANS
                                LE REGARDER

                                Cette fois lorsque vous
                                serez à distance (10 pas),
                                commencez à créer du
                                stimuli en sautant, en
                                tapant des mains, en
                                levant les bras...
4- MARQUEUR NÉGATIF

Ceci fera fauter votre chien, donc faites un
marqueur négatif ("pschiit ! ou claquez des doigts)
et revenez pour replacer votre chien puis
recommencez l'exercice.




Agissez immédiatement dès que votre chien faute
pour ne pas lui permettre de vous rejoindre et d'avoir
gain de cause.


Adaptez l'intensité du stimuli en fonction de votre
chien et augmentez-le progressivement, au fur et à
mesure que votre chien réussira. Au début vous ne ferez
que sauter. Quand votre chien tiendra parfaitement son
"Pas bouger", vous pourrez ajouter des mouvements de
bras, puis ensuite, tapez dans les mains, crier....
                               À terme vous pourrez
                               sauter, vous déplacer,
                               courir, taper dans vos
                              mains, le tout en même
                              temps sans que votre
                                 chien ne bouge.




En plus d'ajouter du stimuli, éloignez-vous de plus
en plus loin de votre chien pour augmenter la
difficulté et lui apprendre à gérer sa frustration.



        À VOUS DE JOUER !!!
                 Niveau 2 : LA DURÉE

À ce stade, le niveau 1 (La distance) doit être validé. Vous
allez maintenant apprendre à votre chien à rester en "pas
bouger" à distance et pendant un certain temps puis de
plus en plus longtemps.


Reprenez l'exercice du "pas bouger" :




   1- GESTE DE LA MAIN + "PAS BOUGER"

      2- PIVOTEZ DEVANT VOTRE CHIEN

       3- RECULEZ SANS LE REGARDER.




                               4- LE CHRONOMÈTRE


                                  Cette fois lorsque vous
                                  serez à distance (minimum
                                  10 pas), mettez votre
                                  chronomètre en route et
                                  commencez sur un temps
                                  de 15 secondes.
 Si votre chien bouge, replacez-le puis recommencez. S'il
 bouge trop souvent revoyez à la baisse la durée de
 l'exercice pour ensuite augmenter de façon progressive.

Vous pouvez présenter le geste du "pas bouger" de
temps en temps, si votre chien montre des signes qui
indiquent qu'il risque de bouger (si votre chien
commence à regarder à gauche et à droite ou sentir
autour de lui).


Si votre chien réussi l'exercice refaites-le plusieurs fois
pour confirmer, puis passez à une durée plus longue en
augmentant de 5 secondes à chaque fois. Essayez d'aller
jusqu'à une minute.

Ce travail se fait sur plusieurs jours car votre chien ne
pourra pas passer d'une durée du "pas bouger" de
quelques secondes à une minute en une seule séance de
travail.



           À VOUS DE JOUER !!!
               Niveau 3 : LES CERCLES


Dans ce niveau 3 nous allons apprendre le "Pas bouger" à
votre chien, même quand vous disparaissez quelques
instants dans son dos.




1- DEMANDEZ UN "COUCHÉ" À VOTRE CHIEN
  Assurez-vous qu'il se couche "en vache", c'est à dire
  couché sur une cuisse d'un côté ou de l'autre. Si votre
  chien se couche en sphinx il aura plus facilement
  tendance à bouger.




  COUCHÉ EN SPHINX                   COUCHÉ EN VACHE
                         2- LE GESTE PIVOTANT
                         Positionnez-vous devant votre
                         chien si vous travaillez sans
                         laisse ou à côté si vous
                         travaillez avec la laisse, puis
                         faites le geste en pivotant
                         devant lui et prononcez l'ordre
                         "Pas bouger".




                         3- TOURNEZ LA TÊTE
                         Déplacez-vous en tournant
                         autour de votre chien et près
                         de lui, sans le regarder dans
                         les yeux. Votre chien va vous
                         suivre du regard jusqu'à ce
                         que vous sortiez de son
                         champ de vision. Il va donc
                         tourner la tête dans un sens
                         puis dans l'autre.



C'est exactement ce que l'on veut lui apprendre, car en
tournant uniquement la tête, votre chien n'aura pas
besoin de bouger son corps pour rester attentif à
vous. Si votre chien ne bouge pas, tentez d'enchaîner
un second cercle.
                   4- LA RÉCOMPENSE
                   Revenez devant votre chien sans
                   le regarder puis donnez l'ordre
                   de déverrouillage ("wasabi
                   wasabi") et récompensez-le.




                   5- POSITION DIFFÉRENTE
                   Refaites l'exercice en mettant
                   votre chien en position de
                   départ "Assis", afin de lui
                   apprendre que quel que soit la
                   position dans laquelle il est, il
                   ne doit pas bouger.




Habituez votre chien à différents cas de figure :
par exemple changez votre sens de rotation,
alternez la position de départ (assis ou couché...)

Essayer d’enchaîner plusieurs cercles autour
de votre chien pour augmenter la difficulté.
                        6- AUGMENTEZ
                        LA DIFFICULTÉ
                        Augmentez la difficulté en
                        faisant les tours très près
                        autour de votre chien et en
                        trottinant. À vous de voir
                        combien de cercle vous
                        pourrez faire. Adaptez-vous à
                        votre chien et à ce qu'il est
                        capable de supporter.




Augmentez progressivement la difficulté :

   en tournant et en accélérant votre allure
   en changeant de sens en changeant la position
   de départ de votre chien
   en travaillant la durée
   en faisant plusieurs cercles pour travailler sur la
   durée (niveau 2)
   en travaillant dans des endroits différents
   en augmentant le diamètre des cercles pour
   travailler sur la distance (niveau 1).


Si votre chien bouge, faites un marqueur négatif
puis replacez-le immédiatement et recommencez
l'exercice. Si besoin, diminuez le niveau de stimuli si
c'est trop difficile pour votre chien et augmentez plus
progressivement la difficulté.
 Faites des supers fêtes à votre chien quand il réussit les
 exercices et travaillez dans l'enthousiasme et la joie pour
 que ce soit fun pour lui.


 Adaptez-vous constamment au niveau de votre chien.


 Quand la difficulté est importante pour votre chien, vous
 pouvez l'aider en répétant une fois "Pas bouger" pour
 l'aider à se contrôler et lui rappeler qu'il ne doit pas
 bouger !


L'ordre du "Pas bouger" est essentiel pour avoir un chien
  calme, attentif à vous, obéissant et que vous pourrez
                   emmener partout !



            À VOUS DE JOUER !!!
            Niveau 4 : LES PASSAGES


                        Faites asseoir votre chien, faites
                        le geste du "pas bouger" puis
                        pivotez devant lui.

                        Reculez de quelques pas puis
                        décalez-vous de 1 à 2 mètres
                        d'un côté ou de l'autre pour
                        pouvoir dépasser votre chien.
                        Dépassez-le de 1 ou 2 pas dans
                        son dos.




Au retour, dépassez votre chien de 2 ou 3 pas, puis
revenez à côté de lui, s'il a bien réalisé l'exercice,
prononcez votre ordre de déverrouillage puis
félicitez-le et récompensez-le.
AUGMENTEZ PROGRESSIVEMENT LA DIFFICULTÉ :
  En passant de plus en plus près d'elle jusqu'à pouvoir la
  frôler
  En passant d'un côté puis de l'autre.
  En allant de plus en plus loin dans son dos.
  En marchant de plus en plus rapidement.
  En passant en trottinant en passant en faisant du bruit
  En faisant de grands gestes
  En parlant au téléphone pour reporter votre attention sur
  autre chose que votre chien.
  En augmentant votre niveau d'énergie (excitation, rires...)
  En cumulant plusieurs de ses actions...




  Si votre chien bouge, faites un marqueur négatif puis
  replacez-le immédiatement et recommencez
  l'exercice. Si besoin, diminuez le niveau de stimuli si
  c'est trop difficile pour votre chien et augmenter plus
  progressivement la difficulté.

  Faites des supers fêtes à votre chien quand il réussi
  les exercices et travaillez dans l'enthousiasme et la joie
  pour que ce soit fun pour votre chien.

  Adaptez-vous constamment au niveau de votre
  chien. Validez bien chaque étape afin d'apprendre à
  votre chien à se canaliser et se maîtriser en toutes
  situations.


          À VOUS DE JOUER !!!
5- NIVEAU N°5 : LES DÉPARTS DE DOS
Le niveau précédent sur les passages, vous ont permis de
vous préparer pour ce 5ème niveau. En effet, vous avez
habitué votre chien à vous voir vous éloigner de dos.
Nous allons donc maintenant travailler pleinement les
départs de dos. À ce niveau, il n'y a donc plus besoin de
pivoter devant votre chien.




1) MÉTHODE : DÉPART EN MARCHE
NORMALE



                            1- Mettez votre chien en
                            assis ou en couché (au
                            choix), placez-vous à côté de
                            lui, puis faites le geste et dites
                            lui "Pas Bouger".




                           2) Avancez de 3 pas en
                           marche normale en
                           surveillant du coin de l'œil
                           votre chien afin de pouvoir
                           réagir immédiatement en le
                           replaçant, si celui-ci tente de
                           vous suivre.
3) Sans attendre, faites demi-tour puis revenez à côté
de votre chien sans le regarder. Attendez quelques
secondes puis déverrouillez-le avec l'ordre puis félicitez-le.




 Faites cet exercice plusieurs fois en changeant de
 point de départ à chaque fois pour ne pas conditionner
 votre chien, puis au fur et à mesure de ses progrès
 rajoutez 1 ou 2 pas supplémentaires.



 2) DÉPART EN MARCHE RAPIDE
 Une fois que votre chien a bien
 compris l'exercice et qu'il vous fait un
 sans faute à chaque fois, commencez
 à augmenter la vitesse de départ
 et de marche afin que votre chien ne
 bouge pas quelle que soit l'intensité
 du stimuli. Vous pouvez revenir vers
 lui en marche normale. C'est surtout
 le départ qui est important .
Vous pouvez également, revenir vers votre chien et ne
pas le déverrouiller tout de suite mais au contraire
repartir et faire quelques pas, afin de lui apprendre que
revenir vers lui ne signifie pas forcément que l'exercice
va se terminer.

À ce stade, vous pouvez ne pas récompenser votre chien
systématiquement mais une fois sur 2 ou 3.
Vous pouvez également le récompenser en lui jetant sa
balle en alternance avec une friandise.




                      2) DÉPART EN COURANT :
                      Pour cette 3ème niveau de
                      difficulté pour le départ de dos,
                      vous partirez en courant. Votre
                      déplacement va générer chez
                      votre chien une forte envie de
                      vous suivre et donc de bouger,
                      c'est pourquoi vous pouvez
                      prononcer avant de partir un
                      "NON" avant le "Pas Bouger".
   Si votre chien bouge à plusieurs reprises, c'est que le
   stimuli est trop fort. Dans ce cas, retravaillez l'étape
   précédente et augmentez votre vitesse de départ plus
   progressivement.

   N'oubliez pas que la récompense ou les félicitations
   doivent être à la hauteur de la difficulté et de l'effort
   que fournit votre chien. Si besoin, revenez à une phase
   de récompense systématique quand l'exercice demandé
   est très difficile pour votre chien.

               À VOUS DE JOUER !!!

6- NIVEAU N°6 : L'ABSENCE
Pour travailler ce niveau, il vous faut vous trouver dans un
endroit où vous pourrez vous éclipser tout en ayant la
possibilité d'observer votre chien.




1- Même exercice : Mettez votre chien en assis ou en
couché (au choix), placez-vous à côté de lui, puis faites
le geste et dites-lui "Pas Bouger".
2- Éloignez-vous (à ce stade,
de dos), puis allez vers un
endroit où vous pourrez vous
dissimuler (derrière un canapé,
une porte, un bar, un
meuble....)




3- Cachez vous, mais pas
plus de 3 secondes pour
commencer. Notez que plus
l'endroit où vous vous cacherez
sera loin de votre chien, et plus
l'exercice sera difficile pour lui.

Également, la durée pendant
laquelle vous serez caché va
ajouter de la difficulté à
l'exercice, il faut donc
augmenter la distance et la
durée progressivement.
3- Revenez près de votre
chien sans le regarder et
sans lui parler, puis placez-
vous à côté de lui avant de le
déverrouiller avec l'ordre dédié
et félicitez-le. Répétez
l'exercice avec cette même
durée plusieurs fois jusqu'à
obtenir un sans faute à chaque
fois.




4- Augmentez
progressivement la durée de
5 secondes en 5 secondes au
début, en gardant toujours la
même distance entre votre
chien et votre cachette.




5- Ensuite, augmentez la
distance à laquelle vous
vous cacherez. En ajoutant
cette difficulté, il faudra peut-
être diminuer au début la
durée durant laquelle vous
serez caché.
Vous pourrez augmenter graduellement la difficulté en :
- Augmentant la distance.
- Augmentant la durée durant laquelle vous restez caché.
- Faisant des départs en marche rapide puis en courant.
- Changeant de cachette en commençant toujours par
travailler chez vous dans un environnement où votre chien se
sent à l'aise.




                               6- Pour pouvoir valider le
                               niveau 6, il vous faudra
                               faire tenir le "Pas
                               Bouger" à votre chien,
                               au moins 30 secondes.




Vous pourrez ensuite commencer à travailler en extérieur
sur un parking par exemple en utilisant une longe pour
sécuriser votre chien, et en vous cachant derrière une
voiture ou un arbre. Dans un nouvel environnement, il
faudra recommencer les différents niveaux de difficulté en
terme de durée et de distance.



              À VOUS DE JOUER !!!
7- NIVEAU N°7 : LES REFUS
REFUS N°1 : LE REFUS D'APPEL
Le but de maîtriser cet exercice permet que votre chien
ne réponde pas aux sollicitations que pourraient lui
faire des gens dans la rue lorsque vous lui avez
demandé de ne pas bouger. Vous lui apprenez ainsi à ne
pas réagir aux stimulations extérieures et à vous obéir à
vous et pas aux autres personnes.



                              1) Tapez légèrement dans
                              vos mains et tapez sur vos
                              cuisses, sans le regarder dans
                              les yeux.

                              Au début ne soyez pas trop
                              insistant, le but n'étant pas
                              de la faire fauter mais au
                              contraire de s'arrêter avant
                              qu'il ne faute, pour lui
                              apprendre à avoir le bon
                              comportement.
                             2- Recommencez l'exercice
                             en augmentez la difficulté :
                             accroupissez-vous, regardez
                             votre chien et ajoutez le fait
                             de taper sur vos cuisses et
                             dans vos mains.




À ce stade, et compte tenu de la difficulté et du
caractère incohérent pour votre chien, vous pouvez
rajouter l'ordre vocal "NON, Pas bouger" pour
maximiser les chances de réussite.

  Si votre chien bouge, remettez-le en position à l'endroit
  exacte où il était et recommencez l'exercice en
  diminuant les stimuli.




                            3- Revenez près de votre
                            chien, déverrouillez-le
                            avec l'ordre dédié et
                            félicitez-le. Les félicitations
                            et les récompenses doivent
                            être à la hauteur de la
                            difficulté de l'exercice.
                              4- Recommencez l'exercice
                              en augmentant encore la
                              difficulté en optant pour une
                              position d'appel : inclinez-
                              vous, regardez votre chien et
                              ajoutez le fait de taper sur vos
                              cuisses et dans vos mains.




À ce stade, et compte tenu de la difficulté et du caractère
incohérent pour votre chien, vous pouvez aussi rajouter
l'ordre vocal "NON, Pas bouger" pour maximiser les
chances de réussite.



                              5- Vous pouvez ensuite
                              rajouter des cris, des
                              interpellations afin que la
                              difficulté soit encore plus
                              grande. N'hésitez pas à
                              répéter si besoin "NON pas
                              Bouger" et à privilégier la
                              position couchée, qui aidera
                              votre chien à rester plus
                              statique.


À ce stade la difficulté est grande pour votre chien, il vous
faudra donc beaucoup de PPR (Patience, Persévérance et
Répétition). Les récompenses et félicitations devront être
fortes.
                              6- Mettez-vous ensuite en
                              déplacement, courrez,
                              criez... Et assurez-vous que
                              votre chien tienne sa place en
                              lui répétant si besoin "NON
                              Pas bouger !"




Si votre chien faute, ce n'est pas qu'il vous désobéit mais
c'est que vos critères sont trop hauts. Dans ce cas,
recommencez l'exercice en revoyant à la baisse les stimuli,
en travaillant plus longtemps sur cette étape et en
augmentant les stimuli de façon plus progressive.

Votre chien ne pourra bouger qu'au signal de
déverrouillage, même si vous prononcez son nom.



              À VOUS DE JOUER !!!
                       REFUS N°2 :
                       LE REFUS D'APPÂTS
                       1- Mettez votre chien en
                       position de "pas bouger"
                       (assis ou couché au choix),
                       puis laissez tomber une
                       friandise au sol devant lui.

                        (Si c'est trop difficile pour
                       lui, posez-là au sol). Dans un
                       premier temps, ne vous
                       éloignez pas.




                       Si en posant la friandise,
                       l'exercice du pas "bouger"
                       est encore trop difficile
                       pour votre chien, dans ce
                       cas, protégez la friandise
                       en mettant votre main
                       au dessus si votre chien
                       s'y intéresse.




Cet exercice permet d'apprendre à votre chien
à résister et à renforcer ses auto-contrôles.
                             2- Augmentez la
                             difficulté en semant
                             plusieurs friandises
                             devant votre chien (plus
                             ou moins près de lui
                             selon le niveau de
                             difficulté).

                             Travaillez la durée
                             pendant laquelle votre
                             chien est capable de
                             tenir son "pas bouger"
                             devant les friandises
                             sans y toucher.




                             Travaillez également
                             la distance en vous
                             éloignant afin que votre
                             chien soit capable, de
                             lui-même, de se contenir
                             devant les friandises
                             même si vous êtes à
                             distance.


Revenez ensuite près de votre chien et déverrouillez-
le avec votre ordre et laissez-le manger quelques
friandises au sol.
3- De nouveau, demandez à votre chien la position
"Pas bouger" puis présentez-lui une friandise dans
votre main et sous son museau. Votre chien ne devra
pas y toucher. S'il tente de manger dans votre main,
répétez "Pas bouger" (Ou "pas toucher"), et retirez
légèrement la main pour ne pas lui laisser y accéder.



Répétez plusieurs fois jusqu'à ce que votre chien
détourne la tête quand vous approchez la friandise de
son museau.

Dès que votre chien détourne la tête et ne tente plus
de manger, revenez à côté de lui et déverrouillez-le
avec votre ordre et récompensez-le avec la friandise
tant convoitée !



     Répétez l'exercice autant de fois que nécessaire
     jusqu'à ce que votre chien ait comme première
     réaction de détourner la tête.
                                   3- Autre niveau de difficulté :
                                   Votre chien en "Pas bouger",
                                   cette fois, faites intervenir
                                   l'aide d'une autre personne
                                   qui déposera des friandises
                                   devant votre chien.

                                   Vous apprenez ainsi à votre
                                   chien à ne pas manger ce
                                   que d'autres personnes
                                   voudraient lui donner.


    N'oubliez pas de bien donner l'ordre de déverrouillage,
    de récompenser votre chien et de le féliciter.


               À VOUS DE JOUER !!!


REFUS N°3 : LE REFUS DE JEU
1- Pour commencer, mettez votre chien en "Pas Bouger"
et déposez une balle au sol devant lui. Soyez près à mettre
la main dessus si votre chien bouge et à le replacer. Si votre
chien n'y touche pas, revenez près de lui, donnez l'ordre de
déverrouillage puis autorisez-le à la prendre.
2- Plus difficile : faites
maintenant l'exercice
en lâchant la balle
devant lui pour que
celle-ci soit en
mouvement.




3- Augmentez encore
les stimuli en jouant à
faire rebondir la balle
devant votre chien qui
doit rester en "Pas
bouger".




4- Autre exercice pour
augmenter la difficulté
pour votre chien : Mimez
le geste du lancé de
balle. Vous pouvez aller
plus loin en mimant le
lancé puis en lâchant le
jouet.
Entre chaque exercice, remettez votre chien
en "Pas bouger" en changeant d'endroit.


Pensez à utiliser le "NON" et répétez "Pas
bouger" si c'est un exercice difficile pour votre
chien.


Faites des pauses et ponctuez de phases
de jeu afin que votre chien libère la frustration
qu'il emmagasine durant ces exercices.


Si pendant le jeu, votre chien ne veut pas
redonner la balle, faites la méthode de
l'échange en lui présentant une friandise ou
tout autre chose qui aura une valeur plus forte
à ses yeux que la balle.
                        5- Vous pourrez ensuite
                        commencer les vrais
                        lancés de balle, sans trop
                        de vitesse pour que le
                        stimuli ne soit pas trop fort




                        Autre étape encore plus
                        difficile : Faites
                        intervenir une autre
                        personne qui lancera la
                        balle et la fera rebondir.




Chacun de ces exercices permet d'augmenter
les auto-contrôles de votre chien et renforce
le focus sur vous.
Certaines de ces étapes du "Pas bouger" peuvent prendre
du temps avant que votre chien ne les maîtrise, l'important
étant de persévérer et répéter autant de fois que nécessaire
et ne pas hésiter à revenir sur un exercice moins difficile afin
que votre chien reprenne confiance et soi dans la
réussite pour ensuite mieux pouvoir augmenter la difficulté,
toujours de façon très progressive. Il vous faudra vous
adapter aux aptitudes de votre chien.




       À ce stade, demandez à des amis, enfants... de tout
       faire pour faire fauter votre chien afin d'identifier
       les points sur lesquels vous devrez encore travailler
       pour que votre chien soit totalement indifférent à
       n'importe quel stimuli lorsqu'il est en "Pas Bouger".



       N'hésitez pas à renforcer l'ordre "Pas
       bouger" par anticipation et utilisez le "NON.
                               6- Lancez une balle contre
                               un mur en la faisant passer
                               au dessus de votre chien.

                               Le fait que la balle arrive
                               vers lui est un élément très
                               fort qui risque de le faire
                               fauter.



S'il est très difficile pour votre chien de garder le "Pas
bouger" sur cet exercice, dans ce cas, travaillez par
             approximations progressives :




  Commencez par lancer la balle de chaque
  côté de votre chien dans sa direction.
  Ensuite lancez-la progressivement au dessus
  de lui mais sans trop d'élan (la vitesse représente
  un stimuli)
  Enfin, lancez la balle au dessus de votre chien
  et contre le mur en augmentant la vitesse.
N'oubliez pas qu'il vous faudra avoir de la Patience, être
Persévérant et Répéter de nombreuses fois les exercices
pour que votre chien les réussisse. (PPR)


Identifiez les points faibles de votre chien pour
pouvoir travailler dessus.




Si votre chien échoue trop                 À VOUS
souvent, ce n'est pas qu'il vous          DE JOUER
désobéit, souvenez-vous que                  !!!!
c'est que l'exercice est trop
difficile pour lui, et qu'il vous
faut vous adapter à son
niveau de maîtrise.
         N°13 : LE "ON / OFF"
Cet exercice consiste à travailler sur les auto-
contrôles de votre chien, lui permettre de savoir gérer
ses pics d'excitation et lui apprendre à retrouver
rapidement son calme en toutes situations, et face à
tout type de stimuli.

                               1) Faites monter votre
                               chien en excitation.
                               Pour cela vous allez
                               pouvoir utiliser tout ce
                               qui le fait réagir :

                               - Mettez-vous à courir,
                               parlez fort, tapez dans
                               vos mains, sur vos cuisses,
                               sautez, poussez-le, titillez-
                               le, utiliser son jouet
                               favoris...
   Pour commencer, adaptez le niveau d'excitation en
   fonction du niveau de votre chien.


                              2) Lorsque votre chien est
                              en état d'excitation, vous
                              stopperez toute activité
                              d'un seul coup :
                              - Ne parlez plus,
                              - Ne bougez plus,
                              - Ne le regardez plus
                              - Dites lui "STOP" et
                              demandez-lui de s'asseoir
                              pour qu'il prenne une
                              position d'apaisement.


3) Attendez que votre chien s'apaise de lui même. Il est
possible qu'au début, vous deviez attendre quelques
secondes avant qu'il ne retrouve son calme.

Ne lui parlez pas afin qu'il apprenne à gérer seul ses
émotions. Votre comportement va influencer le sien,
c'est pourquoi, votre immobilité et votre mutisme va
l'aider.
4) Si votre chien monte très vite et haut en excitation,
le faire redescendre risque d'être difficile pour lui.

Dans ce cas, faites le monter en excitation de façon
modérée. Vous pouvez par exemple pour commencer,
courir, crier, agiter le jouet que pendant quelques
secondes pour ne pas lui permettre de monter trop haut
en excitation.

Ainsi, lorsque vous lui demanderez le retour au calme,
cela ne sera pas trop difficile pour lui et vous ne le
mettrez pas en échec. Progressivement, vous pourrez
intensifier les montées en excitation.
N°14 : APPRENDRE
    LE PANIER


         1) Posez le panier (ou le
         couchage) de votre chien
         près de vous, puis
         commencez l'exercice en
         lançant une friandise au
         sol à votre chien.




         2) Avec une autre
         friandise que vous
         utiliserez comme leurre,
         ramenez votre chien
         dans son panier, en
         prononçant "panier"
3) Dès que votre chien a
les pattes dans son
panier, récompensez-le
avec la friandise en lui
donnant de votre main.
Faites le sortir en lançant
de nouveau une friandise
idem étape 1)




4) Lancez une friandise
en lui donnant un signal
de liberté. Par exemple
"Go" au moment où votre
chien quitte son panier,
puis recommencez les
étapes.
Le but est que votre chien associe le mot "Panier"
au fait d'être dans son panier. À ce stade, on ne
cherche pas à ce que votre chien s'y couche, juste
qu'il soit dedans, même debout.


Attendez bien que votre chien soit dans
son panier pour le récompenser.




                      5) Pour aider votre chien à
                      se replacer dans son
                      panier, placez-vous dans
                      l'axe de façon à ce que le
                      panier se trouve entre
                      votre chien et vous.
6) Vous allez maintenant
renforcer le fait que votre
chien reste dans son panier,
vous allez donc le récompenser
lorsqu'il est au panier sans
donner d'ordre et sans rien lui
dire.

Pour cela, vous ne lui
donnerez plus la friandise à
la main mais vous en
déposerez plusieurs dans le
panier.



7) Éloignez-vous de quelques
pas puis revenez près du
panier et donnez de nouveau
des friandises. Il associe ainsi,
que le fait qu'être dans son
panier est agréable et
bénéfique pour lui.
8) Récompensez ensuite votre
chien qui est dans son panier
en déposant les friandises
directement dans le panier, en
les mettant de chaque côté de
votre chien et aux 4 coins du
panier afin qu'il y reste.




9) Maintenant que votre chien
reste au panier, vous allez
pouvoir lui demander la
position couchée et continuer
de déposer autour de lui, des
friandises pour lui donner l'envie
d'y rester. N'hésitez pas à
utiliser une bonne quantité de
friandises pour associer le fait
d'être au panier à quelque
chose de très agréable pour lui.
10) Continuez ce même
exercice mais en
commençant à vous
éloigner du panier puis en
revenant y déposer des
friandises.




11) À ce stade, vous ne
récompenserez plus la
sortie c'est-à-dire que vous
ne faites plus de lancés de
friandises associés à la
sortie du panier.

Faites revenir votre
chien au panier en vous
positionnant de l'autre
côté de celui-ci et en
utilisant le leurre si besoin.
                               12) Continuez de vous
                               déplacer et de vous
                               éloigner du panier en
                               continuant de venir déposer
                               très régulièrement des
                               friandises quand votre chien
                               est dans son panier.




Si votre chien tente d'en sortir, vous pouvez avancer
vers lui dès qu'il met une patte en dehors du panier afin
de le faire reculer pour rester dans son panier. Travaillez
aussi les sorties : Apprenez à votre chien à ne sortir du
panier que sur votre autorisation et à l'ordre" Go".
13) Vous pouvez travailler
l'envoi au panier en
faisant asseoir votre
chien et en demandant
un "pas bouger".




Allez déposer des
friandises dans le panier,
revenir à lui, le déverrouiller
et le laisser aller de lui-
même dans son panier pour
aller manger les friandises
que vous y avez déposé en
lui disant "Panier" au
moment où il monte dedans.
Répétez cet exercice plusieurs fois et
régulièrement afin d'apprendre à votre chien à aller
au panier, et à l'apprécier. Associez le fait d'y aller et
d'y rester à quelque chose d'agréable pour votre
chien.




Poussez la difficulté en demandant un "au panier"
à votre chien puis un "couché" et venez durant
quelques secondes vous installer dans votre canapé,
puis de plus en plus longtemps jusqu'à ce que votre
chien sache y rester.

Ne lui demandez pas au début d'y rester durant
toute la durée de votre repas, mais travaillez en
augmentant graduellement la durée jusqu'à ce
qu'à terme et à force de travail, il y reste calmement

Introduction




Lorsque l'on parle de dressage de chiens à la garde et à la
défense, on imagine aussitôt des animaux de grande tail-
le, très typés, agressifs, aux mâchoires puissantes et au re-
gard féroce. En fait s'il existe effectivement certaines ra-
ces de chiens qui, de par leurs caractéristiques physiques
et de par leur tempérament, se comportent essentielle-
ment comme d'excellents gardiens et de redoutables dé-
fenseurs, il n'en est pas moins vrai que n'importe quel
chien - tout à fait en marge de sa taille et de son caractère
- peut être dressé à la garde et même dans certains cas à
la défense.
De toute évidence avec certaines races de chiens, on limi-
tera le dressage aux premières leçons, correspondant à la
première phase de l'entraînement qui permettra toutefois
au chien de remplir une mission de surveillance et de
garde pour son maître, sa famille et ses biens. Ainsi un
petit Terrier domestique dont la plus grande adresse con-
siste à chasser les rats, peut devenir un excellent chien de
garde donnant l'alerte de façon efficace grâce à un entraî-
nement adéquat. Un chien Berger destiné en principe à
surveiller les troupeaux de brebis peut être converti en un
intrépide défenseur et en excellent gardien, de même
qu'un fragile Chihuahua peut devenir un bon chien de
garde à la maison s'il est correctement dressé.
 Pour atteindre cet objectif, il suffit que le propriétaire du
chien ait, dès le début, l'intention claire et nette de possé-
Retrouver ce titre sur Numilog.com


 der un chien qui soit autre chose qu'un simple objet dé-
 coratifet qu'il sache le dresser correctement et systémati-
 quement.
 Personne n'est plus apte à dresser un chien que le maître
 lui-même, dans la mesure où il connaît fort bien et mieux
 que quiconque ses vertus, ses travers et ses limites. Une
 mauvaise éducation peut faire d'un excellent chien de
 garde et de défense tel que le Boxer, un gentil compagnon
 docile et mièvre, doux comme un agneau et allant même
 lécher la main du malfaiteur qui vient cambrioler la mai-
 son. C'est un risque qui peut se produire, mais n'importe
 quel chien est capable de suivre un dressage à la garde et
 à la défense et les résultats ne dépendent que de l'habilité
 du dresseur.
 Afin de déterminer le type de dressage qu'un chien est
 apte à recevoir, il est opportun que le propriétaire affine
 son sens de l'observation, au cours des toutes premières
 semaines de la vie du chiot, et étudie avec soin son com-
 portement. Il pourra ainsi savoir s'il s'agit d'un sujet dy-
 namique ou bien au contraire paresseux, attentif ou dis-
 trait, docile ou taquin, nerveux ou équilibré. C'est pour-
 quoi il est essentiel que le futur dresseur établisse une vé-
 ritable étude de caractère de l'animal et bien sûr, c'est là
 où la coexistence acquerra toute son importance. Dès
 que le dresseur aura pu définir clairement la capacité
 d'observation et d'attention du chien, ses aptitudes, son
 dynamisme et diverses autres indications utiles, il lui sera
 possible de fixer les critères à suivre tout au longde la pé-
 riode d'entraînement de l'animal.
 Selon les caractéristiques du chien, le dresseur adaptera
 les exercices proposés dans ce livre, en fonction de la du-
 rée et de la difficulté dechaque étape. Les exercices prati-
 ques sont décrits à partir de cas types afin que personne
 ne puisse s'étonner du retard que peut accuser un sujet
 par rapport aux normes établies ou bien de la résistance
 qu'il semble opposer à un certain type d'apprentissage ou
 encore s'il assimile certains exercices avec une rapidité
 surprenante. Il est erroné d'attribuer ces signes à une plus
 ou moins grande intelligence du chien. Il faut au contrai-
 Retrouver ce titre sur Numilog.com


re les imputer aux caractéristiques propres à chaque
chien selon sa race, et lorsque l'entraîneur les connaît
bien, il évite des efforts inutiles à l'animal.
N'importe quel sujet peut devenir un excellent chien de
garde. En effet, sans considération de la taille ou de la
race, mis en présence d'un danger quelconque, tous les
chiens tendent à se défendre, et à défendre leurs maîtres
ainsi que leur propriété. Ils tendront de même à protéger
les enfants de la maison et s'ils sont désavantagés par rap-
port aux forces de leur adversaire, ils sauront donner
l'alarme et attirer l'attention sur le danger qui existe.
Mais ces réactions répondent à des impulsions que l'on
peut qualifier d'instinctives. Le dressage a pour objet de
tirer parti de cette aptitude innée, de la canaliser et de la
contrôler pour le bénéfice duchien et du maître.
C'est pourquoi, au fur et à mesure que le chien grandit et
devient adulte, il est du ressort dudresseur que cet instinct
et cette force puissent être canalisés par un dressage effi-
cace afin de faire de l'animal un parfait chien de garde et
de défense.

 Qu'est-ce quele dressage?




 Grâce à son instinct de survie dans son milieu d'origine
 et à ses qualités innées que l'on qualifie habituellement
 d'instinctives, n'importe quel chien sait se défendre lors-
 qu'il est attaqué et sait de même reconnaître son maître
 ou la personne qui lui donne à l'accoutumée sa pâtée,
 sans qu'on ait à le lui enseigner. Il distingue aussi l'indi-
 vidu s'approchant avec des intentions malignes.
 Mais il s'agit en quelque sorte d'une qualité telle un dia-
 mant à l'état brut, ni taillé, ni ouvragé. Lechien possède
 des facultés d'association à différents niveaux que l'on
 nomme de façon conventionnelle "intelligence" et leur
 utilisation de façon efficace ainsi que leur potentialisation
 constituent le but du dressage.
 On considère habituellement que les chiens doivent être
 dressés à devenir les esclaves privilégiés pour ainsi dire
 des hommes, sans tenir compte en fait qu'à partir du mo-
 ment où on leur a imposé une destinée de domestication
 hors de leur milieu d'origine, la seule place qu'ils peu-
 vent occuper dans la société est précisément aux côtés de
 l'homme dont ils dépendent d'ailleurs pour subsister.
 Tout ce que l'homme fait pour soigner, protéger et aider
 le chien à vivre, lui est ensuite rendu en termes d'obéis-
 sance, de loyauté, de fidélité et d'affection du chien. Par
 ailleurs, le dressage contribue à rendre plus facile, agréa-
 ble, sûre et plaisante la vie de l'animal tout en lui con-
 fiant des missions et des responsabilités.
  Retrouver ce titre sur Numilog.com

De cette façon le dressage est le biais permettant d'obte-
nir du chien le maximum de compréhension et de coopé-
ration pour son propre bénéfice et celui de son maître.
Quand commencer le dressage
Le dressage débute dès que le chien commence à grandir.
Les premiers exercices, tels la reconnaissance du nom à
l'appel peuvent être pratiqués dès que le chiot est âgé de
deux mois. Retarder ou ignorer ces débuts par laxisme ou
simplement par ignorance, en alléguant que l'animal est
encore trop jeune pour apprendre quoi que ce soit, est
aussi erroné que prétendre laisser un jeune enfant briser
des objets, manger à sa guise ou bien se conduire comme
un vrai petit sauvage sans fixer de limites. Les chiots sont
tout comme les jeunes enfants; si, lorsqu'ils sont petits,
on leur permet toutes sortes de fantaisies et de libertés en
les prenant à la légère et en riant de leurs bêtises, si on ne
leur impose pas certaines normes sous prétexte qu'il sera
toujours bien temps de le faire lorsqu'ils grandiront, on
aura un chien adulte très mal éduqué et peu apte à assi-
miler ce qu'on souhaiterait lui apprendre.
Dresser est éduquer et ceci n'implique pas uniquement
désarmer un malfaiteur qui vient cambrioler. Le dressage
consiste également à apprendre au chien à ne pas traver-
ser de rues dangereuses seul, à lui montrer comment
marcher près de son maître sans laisse, en plein centre
ville. Cela consiste aussi à lui permettre d'acquérir un
mode de vie plus agréable, une plus grande sécurité et
également à établir un lien d'affection et de camaraderie
indissoluble avec son maître.

Quelle est la limite d'âge pour effectuer le dressage
Si les premières notions que l'on inculque au tout jeune
chiot sont essentielles dans la mesure où elles constituent
la base même du dressage qui fera plus tard de l'animal
Retrouver ce titre sur Numilog.com

un bon gardien, l'apprentissage pour les chiens de garde
doit commencer dès que l'animal est âgé de six mois et le
dressage du chien à la garde et à la défense lorsque l'ani-
mal a atteint l'âge de huit mois. Si ce dernier a été dressé
dès son plus jeune âge, il n'existe aucune limite à l'inté-
gration de nouveaux exercices. On peut même continuer
à lui enseigner denouvelles choses passé l'âge d'un an.
Il est certain qu'un chien adulte qui n'a reçu aucun type
de formation au préalable aura bien desa bien des diffi-
cultés à assimiler ce qu'on tentera de lui inculquer, et en
tout cas, il sera nécessaire de redoubler depatience si l'on
tient à lui enseigner quelques exercices de base. C'est
pourquoi la première étape de la vie d'un chien est déci-
sive pour sa formation.
Les exercices de dressage sont systématisés. Leur présen-
tation n'est pas arbitraire, mais au contraire suit un ordre
logique. Il est par conséquent vivement recommandé de
respecter les différentes étapes et l'ordre proposé dans ce
livre car, si logiquement, un chiot de six mois peut ap-
prendre à marcher en restant auprès de son maître, sans
que ceci ne présente de difficultés, il serait absurde de
vouloir lui apprendre à sauter par-dessus une palissade
ou bien à ramper avant même qu'il ait atteint l'âge d'un
an.
Dans la mesure où le processus de développement physi-
que, musculaire, énergétique et psychique du chien est le
facteur qui détermine la progression dudressage, une mé-
thode trop accélérée, ne tenant pas compte de l'âge du
chiot, présente inutilement le risque de provoquer des lé-
sions psychiques, voire physiques chez l'animal, qui peu-
vent ensuite nuire à tout le processus de dressage en soi.
Tel est le cas, par exemple, lorsque l'on apprend au chien
à tenir un objet entre ses crocs. Si l'on tire trop fort sur
l'objet afin de vérifier que l'animal fait preuve de mor-
dant avant l'âge de six mois, on risque de déchausser l'un
deses crocs fraîchement implantés et encore peu solides.
Quant aux exercices pratiques d'attaque, il ne faut les
commencer que lorsque l'animal est âgé d'un an, c'est-à-
dire lorsqu'il est suffisamment mûr et équilibré et peut

parfaitement se rendre compte de ce qu'il fait et qu'il
connaît ses propres forces. Cet équilibre émotionnel lui
permettra de savoir s'arrêter à bon escient et à temps sans
dépasser certaines limites et sans risquer de transformer
une attaque paralysant l'adversaire en une tragédie san-
glante.
La vanité humaine est telle que certains propriétaires se
vantent parfois de l'intelligence ou de la vivacité de leur
chien en les obligeant à réaliser certains exercices au-delà
de leurs capacités, afin de se faire valoir auprès de leurs
amis comme si leur chien n'était autre qu'un pauvre ani-
mal de cirque. Ceci rappelle étrangement la prétention de
certains parents à vouloir faire de leur enfant, tout à fait
sain et normal, un monstrueux petit prodige.
Lorsque l'on décide de dresser un chien, il faut toujours
tenir compte de ses capacités et ne jamais le forcer au-
delà, quelle qu'en soit la raison. Chercher à utiliser le
chien de façon compétitive pour susciter l'admiration au-
tour de soi risque de provoquer des troubles émotionnels
graves chez l'animal. Le maître qui aime vraiment son
chien ne cherchera jamais à l'éduquer sans tenir compte
de ses possibilités, et de son processus de développement.

Règles de base du dressage
La bonne humeur, le goût du jeu, la persévérance et l'af-
fection qui existent entre le maître ou l'entraîneur et le
chien constituent la base sur laquelle s'effectuera un dres-
sage efficace. Croire que des gestes autoritaires, une atti-
tude brutale et tyrannique, des cris et des coups sont la
meilleure méthode d'enseignement est une grave erreur.
Mieux vaut, dans ce cas, confier le soin de dresser l'ani-
mal à une personne mieux informée et plus qualifiée si
l'on veut éviter un échec retentissant.
Si l'on souhaite entreprendre le dressage avec succès, il
ne doit jamais signifier martyre, torture ou obligation
pour le chien et le dresseur. Il faut non seulement créer
un climat de bonne entente mais également s'efforcer
Retrouver ce titre sur Numilog.com


  d'effectuer le dressage dans d'excellentes conditions cli-
  matiques et de visibilité, dans un lieu agréable ni trop
  chaud ni trop froid..
  Un chien soumis à un dressage trop dur tend à se replier
  sur lui-même et offre une plus grande résistance. Domi-
  ner un chien par la force n'aboutit qu'à un triomphe mo-
  mentané.
  Il incombe au dresseur d'adapter le temps de dressage en
  fonction du chien et non l'inverse. La volonté d'appren-
  tissage du chiot augmentera au fur et à mesure qu'il dé-
  couvrira ses facultés et ses progrès et qu'il s'apercevra
  que ses échecs sont passagers et jamais motif à humilia-
  tion.
  Un chien qui s'efforce de s'appliquer au cours de la pé-
  riode de dressage, essaie en fait de plaire à son maître,
  pour obtenir son affection et un bon traitement. Le chien
  n'a pas conscience en soi de la signification globale du
  dressage et ne poursuit qu'un seul but: la dévotion au
  maître. C'est pourquoi il est bon de récompenser chaleu-
  reusement un chien qui vient d'exécuter parfaitement un
  exercice, et de l'encourager en le gratifiant de caresses, de
  mots affectueux et, à l'occasion en lui donnant quelques
  sucreries ou mets qu'il affectionne tout particulièrement,
  afin de le motiver, de l'encourager à participer à l'entraî-
  nement et de l'inciter à renouveler ses efforts.
  Dresser un chien consiste à l'éduquer et non à le domp-
  ter. Il ne s'agit point de contrôler la volonté rebelle d'un
  animal sauvage, mais d'améliorer les conditions de la vie
  en société d'un animal domestique. Le but du dressage
  n'est pas de plier la volonté du chien devant celle du maî-
 tre, pour en tirer ensuite louanges et admiration auprès
 des amis, mais d'apprendre au chien comment tirer parti
 de ses propres facultés.
  Les chiens ne comprennent pas exactement le sens des
 mots qu'on leur adresse, mais ils saisissent de façon glo-
 bale le sens du langage conventionnel adopté internatio-
 nalement et dont les termes ont été choisis en fonction de
 leur sonorité, facilitant une rapide association avec l'ac-
 tion qu'ils représentent. Ces termes qui figurent dans cha-
 Retrouver ce titre sur Numilog.com

cun des exercices décrits sont le fruit d'une longue expé-
rience, de même que les différentes phases proposées
pour chaque groupe d'exercices résultent de diverses
expérimentations qui ont permis d'aboutir aux pratiques
présentées dans ce manuel et dont les résultats sont pro-
bants.
Dans la mesure où le chien capte essentiellement le ton
de voix utilisé, il est indispensable que le dresseur ap-
prenne avant tout à dominer sa voix afin de donner les
ordres de façon adéquate. Si le chien est félicité sur un
ton sec et coupant, il prendra aussitôt ceci pour un repro-
che ou pour une réprimande. La sensibilité de la gent ca-
nine à ce sujet est telle que si le dresseur se sent déprimé
ou de mauvaise humeur, il lui est vivement conseillé de
remettre au lendemain la leçon de dressage afin d'éviter
tout risque de déconcerter l'animal.
Au cours du premier stade du dressage, on cherchera
avant tout à ce que l'animal établisse une corrélation en-
tre l'ordre donné et son immédiate exécution. Ledresseur
doit faire preuve d'une immense patience et de persévé-
rance, et il ne cherchera surtout pas à brûler les étapes.
C'est à force d'insistance, de manières fermes mais dou-
ces, de mots affectueux, de félicitations chaleureuses que
l'on obtiendra des résultats satisfaisants.
Il faut prendre l'habitude de répéter inlassablement un
même exercice sur un ton de voix égal jusqu'à ce que le
chien l'exécute parfaitement. Nejamais passer à un nou-
vel exercice avant la parfaite réalisation du précédent.
Dresser un chien n'est pas tâche simple et exige patience
et temps. Il faut également faire preuve d'intelligence:
tout le dressage, d'un point de vue technique, a été systé-
 matisé afin de faciliter l'apprentissage du chien. Ainsi, les
ordres donnés de façon concise et brève exigeant des
 mouvements rapides et précis, sont representés par des
 mots brefs et tranchants, tandis que les actions plus en-
 chaînées et s'intégrant les unes à la suite des autres sont
 représentées par des ordres plus longs. Quiconque ne se
 sentirait pas apte à dresser patiemment son chien ne ten-
 tera pas l'expérience sous peine de résultats négatifs.

 Outre le ton de voix et la patience requise, afin dedonner
 au chien tout le temps que requiert son apprentissage, la
 périodicité est un facteur à considérer. De même que le
 chien devra s'habituer à prendre un seul repas par jour,
 donné régulièrement à la même heure, à sortir à heure
 fixe, pour satisfaire ses besoins physiologiques, le dressa-
 ge s'effectuera selon des horaires précis à respecter afin
 d'   btenir une participation meilleure et complète de
 l'aonimal.

 Ceque le dresseur doit savoir
 Soulignons, une fois de plus, que toute brutalité ou tenta-
 tive d'humiliation vis-à-vis du chien est à bannir. Il peut
 être puni en cas de mauvaise conduite ou de désobéissan-
 ce, mais le châtiment ne signifiera jamais violence ou
 agression, parce que entre autres raisons un chien effrayé
 devient craintifet sans initiative.
 Ledresseur doit tenir compte des points suivants:
 —chaque fois que le chien aura exécuté un exercice de
     façon satisfaisante, il sera gratifié de mots affectueux
     et de caresses, surtout entre les pattes avant ou sur la
     poitrine, commeil préfère;
 —le chien est un animal routinier et qui acquiert facile-
     ment des habitudes; il faut par conséquent veiller à ne
    jamais répéter les exercices dans le même ordre et
     dans le même lieu;
 —avant de commencer l'entraînement, il est souhaitable
     de laisser courir le chien en toute liberté pendant cinq
     minutes afin qu'il puisse s'échauffer;
 —il convient d'effectuer les exercices avant que le chien
    ne mange, ceci afin de ne pas interrompre son proces-
    sus dedigestion qui est particulièrement lent;
 —si le chien se montrait peu en forme ou bien inquiet,
    il est préférable de supprimer l'entraînement cejour-
    là et de le remettre au lendemain. Le forcer ne servi-
    rait pas à grand-chose;
 —il est bon de vérifier l'état des pattes avant de com-
  Retrouver ce titre sur Numilog.com

  mencer les exercices, ainsi qu'à la fin au cas où le
  chien se serait planté une épine ou une écharde;
— l'idéal est d'exécuter les exercices loin des badauds,
  des enfants et d'autres chiens qui jouent, afin d'éviter
  tout sujet de distraction à l'animal;
—si le chien refuse d'obéir à un ordre, soit par défi, soit
  par manque d'attention, il doit être réprimandé mais
  certes pas de façon agressive. En revanche, s'il n'a pas
  compris un ordre, il faut le lui répéter patiemment.
  C'est là où entre en jeu la perception du dresseur qui
  doit essayer de saisir les réactions de son élève;
— les exercices d'attaque et d'agressivité ne doivent pas
  être exécutés selon un rythme journalier mais un jour
  sur deux, en alternant avec d'autres leçons, afin que
  l'animal n'en vienne pas à détester systématiquement
  ses sorties;
— le ton de voix utilisé pour féliciter l'animal doit être
  chaud et toujours accompagné de caresses ou de tapes
  affectueuses et parfois même d'une petite friandise;
—à l'inverse, la correction peut être un geste ferme, un
  ton de voix sévère mais jamais de coups. La violence
  n'a jamais grande utilité pédagogique;
—il ne faut pas laisser boire le chien aussitôt la leçon
  terminée. Il est préférable d'attendre cinq à dix minu-
  tes avant qu'il se désaltère;
—le dresseur saura alterner intelligemment les exercices
  assimilés et les exercices nouveaux afin que l'entraî-
  nement ne soit jamais monotone, et que le chien puis-
  se améliorer ses connaissances;
— lorsque mention est faite d'une durée moyenne du
  temps d'apprentissage pour certains exercices, il ne
  s'agit évidemment pas de faire exécuter à l'élève le
  même exercice pendant exactement le temps indiqué,
  ceci serait bien trop ennuyeux pour le dresseur et le
  chien. Ces temps sont donnés à simple titre indicatif,
  afin d'orienter le dresseur sur la durée totale à donner
  approximativement à l'exercice;
—pour certains exercices décrits dans les chapitres qui
   suivent, ni la durée des leçons ni le nombre de jours
Retrouver ce titre sur Numilog.com

   ne sont précisés dans la mesure où ils sont faciles et
   peu fatigants, et peuvent être répétés à maintes repri-
   ses, ou bien parce que leur complexité ne permet pas
   de fixer une durée conventionnelle;
 — lorsqu'une variante est proposée, le chien ne sait ja-
   mais s'il doit répéter exactement le même exercice,
   qu'il connaît déjà, ou innover; il suffit de lui indiquer
   que tout est pareil pour qu'il reprenne vite les habitu-
   des acquises;
 — les pratiques acquises doivent être contrôlées de façon
   régulière en présence d'autres membres de la famille,
   d'amis ou autres personnes, car il est plus difficile,
   une fois l'entraînement bien avancé, d'obtenir du
  chien la même obéissance devant des enfants ou des
  tierces personnes. C'est pourquoi il est important de
  pratiquer régulièrement quelques exercices en présen-
  ce d'autres spectateurs.

La psychologie du chien
L'intelligence canine est l'une des théories les plus discu-
tées depuis des années. D'une part certains "mordus" de
cynophilie voudraient démontrer que les chiens sont les
animaux les plus intelligents - après les êtres humains -
mais d'autre part, il est indiscutable que les dauphins, les
singes, les rats et les jars sont, comme il a été prouvé,
bien plus intelligents que les chiens. Par contre, on a pu
constater que le chien capte bien plus rapidement que
tout autre animal les exercices qui lui sont enseignés.
En fait, nos connaissances en matière de comportement
psychique des chiens sont encore très limitées, toutefois
une chose est certaine: la somme de leurs impulsions, de
leurs associations, de leurs craintes, de leur mémoire ain-
si que diverses composantes, que nous qualifions à notre
échelle "d'univers affectif', peut être observée dans leur
comportement, celui-ci étant en fait l'ensemble de tous
ces facteurs que recouvre de façon générale le terme
d'"intelligence canine".

Chez le chien comme chez l'homme, certaines circons-
tances peuvent avoir une importance capitale et détermi-
ner des comportements différents. Ainsi, si le chiot a été
sevré trop tôt, s'il a souffert d'un déménagement ou d'un
déplacement et en a été profondément marqué, si petit
chien il a été élevé à la campagne, il supportera difficile-
ment l'atmosphère bruyante de la ville. Tous ces faits
modèleront sa personnalité et détermineront sa plus ou
moins grande capacité d'assimilation.
Dès la naissance, la différence de comportement est ma-
nifeste. Il suffit d'observer une nichée de chiots pour re-
pérer bien vite le plus glouton, celui qui se débrouille le
mieux pour obtenir la meilleure ration ou la place la plus
confortable, le plus vif, le plus paresseux, La personnalité
de chacun évoluera selon les circonstances et le milieu
ambiant. Bien peu de maîtres accordent une importance
suffisante à ce facteur puis s'étonnent ensuite que leur
chien réagisse de façon inattendue, comme s'il s'agissait
d'un simple jouet mécanique. S'occuper d'un chien, le
dresser, ne consiste pas uniquement à lui donner sa pâtée
tous lesjours et à l'éduquer à la propreté. C'est aussi ad-
mettre que le chien est un être doué de sentiments et
d'une sensibilité qu'il faut reconnaître et respecter. Le
maître qui aime véritablement son chien et tient à bien
l'éduquer, n'oubliera pas que le chien est un animal sen-
sible et perceptif. Si une bonne entente s'établit la com-
munication sera parfaite et les résultats excellents.
Choixd'un assistant
Pour certains exercices, il sera indispensable de se faire
aider par un assistant ou collaborateur, par exemple pour
les exercices de recherche et d'exploration ou bien pour
ceuxd'attaque et dedéfense. Etant donné que le chien est
incapable de symboliser, au lieu de lui donner un ordre
de façon abstraite, il est nécessaire de le mettre en pré-
sence d'un objet ou d'une personne afin qu'il puisse com-
prendre cequ'on attend de lui.

Lechien est par nature un animal utile et en tant que tel il a collaboré
depuis toujours avec l'homme à des tâches aussi diverses que la
défense de son maître et de sa famille, de ses biens, la garde des
troupeaux, les courses et les spectacles de cirque. Il est donc tout
à fait logique de vouloir éduquer et dresser son chien pour qu'en
plus d'être un agréable compagnon, il sache être vigilant et puisse
remplir une mission de protection qui est parfaitement complémen-
taire de sa nature.
N'importe quel chien peut être un bon gardien. Il n'est pas nécessai-
re pour cela qu'il soit de grande taille ou ait des dons exceptionnels,
si son maître connaît à fond ses caractéristiques et tient compte des
limites de sa constitution physique et de ses qualités naturelles.
C'est précisément l'objet de cet ouvrage : connaître et développer
les facultés d'intelligence de son chien pour que, quelles que soient
sa race et sa taille, il puisse devenir un gardien efficace de notre
foyer.

1º- Como Escolher e Utilizar Escovas e Pentes para Cães.


Escovar e pentear o cão contribuem para mantê-lo bonito porem, a escovação e os
penteados realizados periodicamente não se limitam à questão de estética. Elas
garantem a boa saúde e higiene do animal,removendo a sujeira e a poeira. Além
disso, ativam a circulação sanguínea, estimulam o crescimento dos pêlos,
asseguram uma perfeita distribuição dos óleos naturais da pele por toda a extensão
dos pêlos e ajudam a remover a pelagem morta.

A falta de escovação pode trazer muitos danos a beleza e higiene dos cães,
principalmente porque o acumulo de sujeira causa o abafamento da pele,
favorecendo a ocorrência de dermatites e a proliferação de pulgas.
Você pode fazer com que a escovação traga grandes benefícios, desde que utilize
a técnica e os materiais corretos.

Antes de mais nada é importante saber que a escolha do material deve ser feita de
acordo com o tamanho do cão e seu tipo de pelagem.

Existe no mercado uma grande variedade de escova, cada uma com sua função
especifica; a escova de pínus ou pin brush serve para massagear e separar os fios;
a pin palm brush ajuda a retirar a pelagem morta; a luva de arame é utilizada em
cães que apresentam muito subpêlo ( Basset Hound), a luva de borracha serve
para retirar o pêlo morto de cães com pelagem curta; a escova de cerdas naturais é
indicada para pelagem muito delicadas e a rasqueadeira é usada especialmente
para retirar o pêlo morto.

Os pentes servem para desembaraçar os fios e retirar os últimos nós que restarem
após a escovação. Os melhores pentes são aqueles que apresentam dentes
metálicos, não muito finos e com pontas arredondadas, pra não ferir a pele do
animal.

2º- Material Certo.

Antes de adquirir o material necessário para escovação, procure levar em conta o
tamanho e o tipo de pelagem do seu cão, para facilitar, vamos agrupar as raças
segundo sua pelagem.

Cães de pelagem curta, lisa, macia e sem subpêlo:
Dobermanns marrons, Daschshunds e Fox Paulistinha- utilize luva de borracha.

Cães de pelagem curta, lisa e com subpêlo: Beagle, Basset Hound, Basenjii,
Dálmata, Weimaraner, Fila Brasileiro, Dobermann ( preto e marrom), Dogue
Alemão,Boxer e Pointer – use luva de borracha e escovas de cerdas macias.

Cães de pelagem longa ou semi longa, lisa e sedosa: Afghan Hound, Maltês,
Yorkshire, Cocker Spaniel Inglês – use escova de pinos e pente de aço.

Cães de pelagem longa ou semi longa, lisa e áspera: Lhasa Apso, Collie, Pastor
Alemão, Pastor Belga, Chow Chow, Akita, Husky Siberiano, São Bernardo, Old
English Sheepdog e Pequinês – utilize escova de pinos, rasqueadeira e pente.

Cães de pelagem longa ou semilonga, crespa e áspera: Poodle e Bichon Frise –
use escova de pinos rasqueadeira e pente.

Cães de pelagem longa ou semi longa, crespa e dura: Scottish Terrier, Fox Terrier
pêlo duro – use rasqueadeira especial e pente.
Como Proceder

A freqüência da escovação vai depender principalmente do ambiente onde o cão é
criado. Normalmente, para os cães criados em ambientes domésticos, recomenda-
se a escovação três vezes por semana. Já os animais que vivem em contato com
grama, terra, areia etc. devem ser escovados diariamente, a movimentação da
escova deve ser sempre no sentido do crescimento do pêlo.

O pente, que ajuda a retirar os últimos nós dos pêlos, deve ser usado com muito
cuidado, principalmente para evitar ferimentos na pele do cão, não é necessário
usar força, mas firmeza.

3º- Truques e Dicas.

Seguindo algumas dicas, você poderá realizar a escovação de forma correta e
agradável para o animal.

Aproveite o momento da escovação para fazer uma inspeção na pele do animal,
verificando se não há indícios de alergia, dermatites, etc. Verifique, também, se o
animal apresenta pulgas ou outros parasitas.
Acostume o cão a permanecer deitado ou numa posição confortável, para que ele
não fique inquieto, quanto mais cedo ele se habituar à escovação, melhor, pois
assim ele aceitará facilmente o tratamento.
Use quando puder um borrifador com água limpa para umedecer o pêlo antes de
escovar, nunca escove a pelagem seca ou muito suja, para não arrebentar os
pêlos.

Escove com movimentos firmes e não superficialmente, insistindo nas áreas que
apresentam maior volume de pêlos e maior tendência a apresentar nós.

Para facilitar o trabalho, pode utilizar um secador com temperatura fria ou morna,
na direção dos pêlos.

Durante a escovação, procure não tocar a pele do animal, principalmente se ele
apresentar ferimentos. A escovação deve se transformar em momentos agradáveis
para o cão, e não em horas de luta e sofrimento.
Mais dicas.


Limpe sempre a lâmina da máquina com uma escovinha, aplique um spray
antiferrugem.
Desinfete a lâmina com produto próprio vendido em casas
especializadas. Sempre olhe o lado interno da máquina, deve estar
sempre com graxa.
No furo lateral da máquina coloque sempre
óleo. Troque o carvão sempre que
necessário.
Sempre procure limpar a máquina com uma escovinha para que não aqueça.
Não utilize álcool ou WD 40 nas lâminas, pois oxidam o fio da lâmina e diminuem a
vida útil da mesma.




4º- Fox Terrier Pêlo Duro.




Tosa de Exposição

Esta tosa deve ser feita 10 a 15 dias antes da exposição.
Tosa dividida em 3 estágios. Passar o stripping comb por todo o corpo do animal,
menos as pernas, usa-se tesoura dentada e reta nas pernas e abdome. Por fim a
rasqueadeira por todo o corpo.
    1- Mais ou menos cheio.
    2- Curto.
    3- Bem raso.
5º - Tosa de Pet Shop - Fox Terrier.


Nesta tosa pode-se usar a lâmina 10 onde o pêlo fica bem curto ou a lâmina
7, o pêlo fica mais cheio.


CABEÇA- Imagine uma linha que saia do canto externo do olho até o ínicio da
boca, deste ponto até o focinho não se tosa. Tose a cabeça, as orelhas ( dentro
e fora).


PEITO- Tose o pescoço até chegar no início do osso externo ( osso pontudo no
meio do peito).


CAUDA- Completamente tosada.

CORPO-Todo tosado (observe o pontilhado).




Observe o sentido que a máquina deve seguir.

PERNAS- Não tose.

ABDOME- Deve ser tosado.

Acerte o bigode e as pernas com tesoura.
6º- Tosa de Pet Shop. Airedale.

  A tosa do Airedale é idêntica ao do Fox
  Terrier. Escolha a lâmina e bom trabalho.

7º- Tosa de Exposição: Schnauzer Standard.
Lembre-se as tosas de exposição sempre devem ser feitas de 10 a 15 dias antes
da
exposição.
1- Stripping comb e tesoura.
2- Tesoura dentada (deixe raso). 3- Tesoura
dentada (bem raso). 4- Máquina lâmina 10

Patas, sobrancelhas e cavanhaque, devem ser aparados com tesoura.
Por fim um bom spray fixador, (tome cuidado com qualquer spray, muitos
animais podem ter problemas respiratórios devido ao uso do mesmo).




Tosa de Pet Shop- Schnauzer.
Tose o animal com máquina e use
lâmina 10. Observe a linha que sai do
olho.
  Mais detalhes para você.
  As orelhas também são tosadas, por fora e por dentro.




  Observe a limpeza da região abdominal.

Detalhe da cabeça - Veja as sobrancelhas e o bigode. Detalhe da traseira –
Ficou fácil visualizar a tosa.
8º- Tosa de Pet Shop: Scottish terrier.




1- Tose com a lâmina 10.
2- Tose o corpo com a lâmina 5 ou 7.
Observe o peito do animal, deve ficar em forma de triângulo.
Sempre deixe a saia – só apare as pontas.




9º- Trimming do Bichon Frise.
    Acompanhe o texto e observe as figuras.
Antes de começar o corte dos pêlos é importantíssimo que o pêlo esteja bem limpo,
seco e bem esticado (você pode fazê-lo com uma escova de pinos).

A seguir, coloque o cão sobre uma mesa, de modo que você não tenha que se
curvar para trabalhar nele, lembrando que sua superfície não deve permitir
escorregões do animal. Depois promove-se a abertura de todos os pêlos com um
pente. Faça isso em movimentos contínuos, de cima para baixo, sem torcê-los,
como se tivesse realmente penteando o animal.



Dando Forma ao Bichon.

O corte do Bichon deve dar a impressão de que ele é um cão quadrado. A primeira
parte a ser mexida é a traseira do cão.Com a tesoura reta, em posição paralela ao
corpo, vá aparando as pontas dos pêlos, sempre em movimentos contínuos
seqüenciais, caso contrário perde-se a noção de conjunto, e a pelagem poderá
apresentar muitas falhas. Na verdade, o que você vai fazer é simplesmente tirar
seus excessos. Ao aparar a traseira do cão, não esqueça de tirar bem os pêlos ao
redor do ânus ( nunca encoste a lâmina nessa região). A angulação posterior é
bem definida. Isso significa que a região próxima ao bumbum do cão deve
apresentar menos pêlos do que nas pernas ( figura 1).

Essa aparência é conseguida com o corte de maior quantidade de pêlos na
primeira região. Um outro ponto bastante importante é que se deve deixar mais
pêlos na parte da frente das patas traseiras. Isso dá impressão que a pelagem
desse local segue uma linha única, que parte da barriga. Uma dica a ser respeitada
durante todo o trimming é que o corte dos pêlos deve ser arredondado, e o mais
natural possível. Terminada a parte superior do Bichon vamos à etapa seguinte. A
linha inferior ( região da barriga) é bem curta, acompanhando o corpo, o que dá
idéia de um cão com pernas mais altas, use a tesoura normalmente como já foi
recomendado. A próxima região a ser trimada é a linha superior ( as costas do
cão). Aqui você deve dar um corte bem plano em cima, e ir arredondando aos
poucos pelas laterais do Bichon.

Aproximadamente uns 4 ou 5 dedos da cernelha, comece a deixar os pêlos mais
altos, pois a partir deste ponto já vai se iniciando a juba. Para tanto, acerte apenas
as pontinhas dos pêlos ( figura 2). Vamos agora para a parte da frente do animal.
As patas dianteiras são paralelas ao corpo. Vista de frente, são cilíndricas, dando
continuidade ao pescoço, com muito sentido de conjunto.

A porção de trás das patas dianteiras também deve apresentar mais pêlo do que na
frente, sendo que isso precisa ser realizado na mesma proporção do que já ocorreu
nas patas traseiras. Não se esqueça tanto aqui, como nas outras patas, de contorná-
las, dando-lhes aspecto arredondado.

O peito deve seguir as mesmas regras, bem definido, ele também passa por um
corte arredondado. A partir da garganta, aproximadamente, vá deixando o pêlo mais
cheio, também para formar a juba (figura 3).
Últimos Retoques

É muito importante saber que não se mexe na cana nasal, a não ser na região
localizada entre os olhos. Nesse ponto, você vai tirar apenas uma faixa reta,( figura
4). Feito isso, já pode ir subindo para a região da cabeça. O trimming da cabeça
tem que formar entre orelha, topete e barba uma bola, a característica juba desta
raça. Para trimar esse local, procure tirar o mínimo possível, deixar a juba bem
cheia. As orelhas fazem parte desse conjunto.

Portanto, tire também somente as pontinhas dos pêlos, acompanhando o
arredondamento da bola.

Um macete válido penteie os pêlos varias vezes enquanto estiver cortando uma
determinada região. Sempre podem aparecer algumas pontas, que precisam ser
aparadas.

11º- Trimming de Exposição do Cocker Spaniel Inglês.




O cocker dourado é o mais demorado de todos, graças ao fato de setenta por cento
do pêlo precisar ser arrancado com a mão. Só assim não acontecem as diferenças
na cor causadas pela tesoura. As cores preto e black and tan por sua vez, tem
trimmings fáceis feitos com tesoura. Quem tem mais experiência pode trima-los até
um dia antes da exposição, o que não ocorre com os dourados que é trimado
quinze dias antes do evento e na véspera ainda passa por inspeção geral. Os
particolores (branco e preto, branco e laranja, branco com preto e marrom ou
branco com chocolate) e os ruões (mistura-se qualquer uma dessas cores) também
demora bastante, devido ao uso da pedra vulcânica para acerto da pelagem.

As Primeiras Etapas.

Para o trimming deixe os materiais à mão; stripping comb, pedra vulcânica,
máquina de tosa, tesoura dentada e tesoura de ponta. Comece passando o
stripping comb por todo o pêlo, indo do dorso até a lateral do pescoço sempre
manejando como uma escovação. Assim você retira toda lã e deixa o pêlo mais
rebaixado. Procure manter a pele bem esticada para o comb deslizar melhor.

A próxima etapa é com a pedra vulcânica. O pêlo deve ser repartido em pequenas
regiões. Cubra esses pêlos com uma das mãos,e com a outra vá fazendo a pedra
puxar os fios presos. Com essa operação só os fios novos permanecem o que dá
um viço instantâneo. Passe a pedra por todo dorso, pelo alto da cabeça e pela
região da traseira ( embaixo da cauda).

Depois entra em cena a máquina de tosa, lâminas 10 e 15 (quanto maior o numero
da lâmina mais batido o pêlo ficará). Em todos os tipos de cockers ingleses a parte
superior das orelhas, as laterais da cabeça, todo o pescoço, maxilar e traseira são
raspados à máquina. Fixe o começo da dobra da orelha como limite para
raspagem. A seguir vá deixando bem batido também o pêlo da lateral da cabeça,
da região logo acima do focinho e lábios. desça a máquina por todo o pescoço,
cobrindo a região que vai do esterno ( osso proeminente no começo do peito) até
perto dos lábios. Para terminar raspe os rodamoinhos de pêlos situados logo
embaixo da cauda.

Terminando o Trimming.

Entre a pelagem raspada e a sem raspar, forma-se um desnível, chamada pelos
trimadores de degrau. Como o trimming deve dar sempre a impressão de
naturalidade, esses degraus devem desaparecer. Com uma tesoura dentada,
colocada na diagonal em relação aos pelos vá nivelando todo o dorso, pescoço,
cabeça, bochechas e a traseira. Entre uma cortada e outra,escove o pelo para ver
o resultado, apare também os pêlos da cana nasal, tire os bigodes e corte os cílios,
Para não machucar os olhos do cão, mantenha-os bem fechados puxando os para
trás. Depois repasse a tesoura pelos mesmos locais, usando-a na posição vertical,
no sentido do nascimento dos pêlos. A tesoura não deve parar e nem afundar no
pelo para não fazer buracos.

Reforce o contorno redondo das patas cortando os pêlos excedentes com uma
tesoura dentada e, para limpar bem os pêlos entre as almofadas dos pés, segure a
pata do cão e corte os com uma tesoura de ponta, na seqüência apare os pelos
longos, começando pelos do jarrete, seguindo a linha das pernas. Depois acerte a
saia ( pelos longos abaixo do dorso) aparando de leve qualquer desigualdade com
a tesoura dentada. Comece definindo-a desde o pé, suba desenhando o contorno
da saia para que corresponda ao padrão. Os pêlos do jabot (os do peito) devem ser
aparados só em baixo, para reforçar a impressão de continuidade com a saia. E
para terminar acerte as pontas das orelhas.

Use uma escova de pinos e água misturada ao creme desembaraçante, só para
umedecer levemente o pelo. Escove a pelagem com muito cuidado, o pelo é
sedoso e pode se partir com escovamento mais brusco. A rasqueadeira quebra o
pelo não deve ser usada.

A escovação do maltês é tão importante que se feita diariamente ( umedecendo
levemente o pelo com creme e água) reduz pela metade o tempo que um iniciante
levaria para fazer o trimming , que é cerca de uma hora, para começar o trimming
prenda com elásticos firmes ( cuidado para não prender a pele do animal), e em
dois tapetes os pelos longos em cima dos olhos, em seguida, com um pente de
metal penteie novamente, abaixando ainda mais a pelagem,( se tiver nós
desmanche-os com muito cuidado).

Os tapetes.

Penteie os tapetes do cão, traga uma linha das costas até perto dos olhos. Divida
os tapetes em dois tufos. Observe que a base deles precisa ficar fofa, sem esticar
muito a raiz do pelo.

Depois disso, você tem duas formas de fazer os tapetes uma serve para o cão que
vai participar de uma exposição de beleza, a outra de manutenção, para aquele
que só vai ficar em casa.

Na de manutenção, providencie 2 pedaços de papel de seda branco, com cerca de
10 cm, e enrole cada um ao redor dos tufos, depois dobre os tubinhos de papel (
com os tufos de dentro) ao meio. Dobre mais uma vez e amarre-os ao redor com
elástico pequeno e fino.

Certifique-se que os tufos estejam bem amarrados. Já que os topetes ou tufos de
um cão que disputará exposições são um pouco diferentes.

Deixe também fofa a base dos tapetes. Amarre cada um deles com elástico
pequeno e fino. Dobre os tufos de pêlos para trás e amarre-os novamente com
outro elástico. Pegue dois pedaços redondos de tule, de preferência preto ( com
diâmetro de forma que quando dobrado não passe do tamanho do tapete), e
coloque-os sobre cada tapete, amarre bem o tule de cada um deles com outro
elástico. Se quiser pode colocar um lacinho envolvendo o tule de cada tapete.



Materiais usados.

Tesoura reta com ponta redonda, tesoura dentada, escova de pinos, creme e
água, pente de metal de dentes largos, uma folha de seda, oito elásticos
pequenos e finos, dois lacinhos, dois pedaços pequenos de tule preto.
16º- Trimming do York shire.




Material:

Uma tesoura reta, outra com pontas arredondadas, pente de aço com dentes
largos, uma escova macia de pinos.

(Nunca passe a rasqueadeira no pelo do York).

O trimming básico: Os pelos da orelha são o primeiro ponto. Imagine a orelha do
Yorkshire terrier dividida em três porções horizontais. A parte que corresponde a
porção mais alta( a ponta das orelhas) deve ser completamente desbastada de
pelos internos e os externos aparados seguindo a linha em V, da região. Para tanto
use a tesoura reta. O objetivo é reforçar o contorno e aliviar os efeitos de possíveis
orelhas mais afastadas, já que o padrão da raça diz, ( as orelhas são em forma de
V, postadas eretas e colocadas não muito separadas).

Agora com a tesoura de pontas, livre o canto interno dos olhos de pelos. Essa
retirada facilita a limpeza diária com algodão e água.
Dar banho no animal de estimação não precisa ser uma guerra contra a
bagunça!


1. Xixi antes. Não coloque seu animal de estimação na água sem antes dar
um passeio rápido para que ele possa se aliviar. Acredite, essa dica é valiosa.
2. Organize os produtos. Separe tudo que você vai precisar para o banho,
desde o xampu, escova, toalha e panos. Deixe os produtos à mão, na ordem
de uso: xampu, escolha, panos e toalhas. Assim, não corre o risco de deixar
sozinho o animal molhado e doido para fugir, só porque esqueceu algo
importante.
3. Recompense. A cada etapa bem sucedida do processo (passou o xampu,
esfregou, tirou o xampu, e por aí vai), premie o pet. Tudo fica melhor com
uma recompensa.
4. Cheire à vontade. Cachorros gostam de conhecer bem os espaços onde
estão sendo levados, portanto deixe que ele cheire todo o local, inclusive o
equipamento que será usado no banho. Luvas, banheira, vidro de xampu,
escova, entre outros. No final, dê um petisco pelo bom comportamento.
5. Concentre a bagunça. Se as experiências anteriores mostraram que, além
do animal de estimação, o banheiro também parece ficar todo molhado,
invista em um chuveirinho manual. Dar banho de chuveirinho no cão é mais
fácil do que embaixo do chuveirão.


6. Não tropece. Ninguém merece, justo no fim do banho, levar aquele tombo
dentro do box. Um tapete de borracha bem preso ao chão vai fazer com que
tanto o animal quanto você estejam mais seguros.
7. Evite a maratona. Para que seu cachorro não saia correndo desesperado,
como um maratonista, procure dar banho em um lugar que você possa fechar
a porta. Se não puder banhar em um lugar fechado, escolha um espaço
abrigado do vento, e não deixe a água nem muito quente e nem muito fria –
especialmente se for filhote, senhorzinho ou senhorinha.
8. Tenha paciência. Banho nem sempre é algo muito confortável para o pet.
Tenha paciência e seja gentil com seu amigo, dando tempo para ele se
acostumar ao banho.
9. Mantenha as pulgas longe! Faça uma “coleira de espuma” em volta do
pescoço para evitar que as pulgas corram todas para a cabeça do animal.
  Depois, massageie o xampu do pescoço até o rabo. Volte para a cabeça e
  finalize.

  10.    Confira a limpeza. Enxaguar bem, até que a água saia bem limpinha e o
  pelo esteja sem nenhum sinal de resto do xampu. Depois, não economize na
  qualidade da toalha. Quanto maior e mais felpuda, melhor ela vai enxugar o
  animal.     Faça   desse   momento   a   hora   da   recompensa   pelo   bom
  comportamento, ou pela tolerância ao banho.



Dicas para a hora do banho

        Algumas pessoas, por motivo de economia, costume ou
        praticidade, preferem dar banho em seus animais de estimação
        em casa. Cuidados profissionais de confiança trazem sempre um
        resultado diferenciado, porém, é possível limpar seu pet tomando
        as devidas precauções. Trazemos, portanto, as cinco principais
        dicas para a hora do banho de seu bichinho.




Antes de qualquer coisa, lembre-se de que a periodicidade de banho nos
animais varia de acordo com sua espécie e raça (tipo de pelagem). Uma boa
média é considerar banhos semanais em cães e trimestrais em gatos. Claro
que, no caso de o animal se sujar excepcionalmente, esta frequência pode ser
alterada.
  Antes de vermos as dicas, vejamos um procedimento comum de banho em
  animais de estimação:

1. Proteja os ouvidos do bicho com algodão;

2. Comece dando o banho apenas do pescoço pra baixo pra não assustá-lo;

3. Utilize água morna e produtos especializados;



4. Comece por um sabonete antisséptico. Este produto pode irritar os olhos, por
  isso use-o apenas do pescoço para baixo;

5. Esfregue cada patinha e entre os dedinhos;

6. Enxague bem. Não deixe nada de produto na pele;

7. Use shampoo neutro próprio para o bichinho (cachorro ou gato, pelo longo ou
  curto) que não irrite os olhos. Lave desde a cabecinha. Enxague;

8. Use um condicionador próprio caso seu animal tenha pelos mais longos.
  Enxague;

9. Cuidado sempre com o focinho. Não deixe entrar produto.

10. Vá para a etapa de secagem e limpeza de ouvidos.

  Dicas para a hora do banho do seu pet

  Os conselhos abaixo trazem os cinco principais aspectos a se pensar na hora
  de banhar seu pet:


  Tenha cuidado com as orelhas

  Todos os donos de pets devem ter cuidados extras com as orelhas de seus
  animaizinhos, pois, geralmente, a anatomia das orelhas dos cães e gatos
  favorece a entrada de água (ao se molharem) e sujidades que podem causar
  doenças.

  Ao dar banho, utilize um algodão para proteger as orelhas do animal. Coloque
  um chumaço de algodão nos ouvidos e faça leve pressão para não entrar água.
  Cuidado para não aprofundar muito o algodão.

  Sempre confira os ouvidos após dar banho ou secar seu bichinho. Verifique se
  não ficou água, pois a umidade neste local pode trazer problemas de saúde e
inflamações. E, importante: não se esqueça de tirar o algodão. O abafamento
do local por períodos longos pode também provocar problemas.

Para limpar as orelhas, faça-o separadamente, após o banho ou em outro
momento. Você pode utilizar um algodão umedecido ou mesmo o cotonete,
com muito cuidado para não introduzi-lo muito profundamente. Você também
pode umedecer o algodão ou bastonete com um produto de limpeza específico.
Jamais utilize objetos pontiagudos ou jogue água no ouvido de seu bichinho.
É interessante também, conversar com o veterinário sobre produtos específicos
que amolecem a cera dos ouvidos. Utilize apenas os produtos que o
profissional recomendar. Não confie em receitas caseiras não testadas.

Alerta para a secagem
A umidade pode causar problemas de pele como fungos e bactérias. Por isso,
seque bem o animal. Caso o dia esteja quente e ensolarado, você poderá
apenas secá-lo com uma toalha e depois deixá-lo andar no sol, caso ele tenha
pelos curtos.

Mas lembre-se: se seu animal estiver úmido e o tempo estiver frio, com vento,
ele poderá ficar com a resistência baixa e contrair um resfriado. Além disso,
lembre-se de que, se você soltar seu pet livremente em um gramado ou local
com terra, você corre o risco de colocar todo o banho a perder.

O uso de um secador é obrigatório nos animais de pelos mais longos. Utilize
escovas de arame (próprias para seu bichinho) e secador em temperatura fria
ou morna. Jamais use o aparelho na temperatura quente sob o risco de causar
queimaduras e machucar o animal.


Cuidado com a temperatura da água

Se você está acostumado (a) a tomar banho quente, de modo que a água
passe pela pele com um pouquinho de ardência, saiba que esta temperatura é
prejudicial até para você e será pior para o banho de seu bichinho.

Utilize água morna no inverno. Teste sempre com a parte interna do braço,
como é indicado no caso de banho de bebês.


Locais para banhar seu animal

Banheira, bacia, tanque, chuveiro etc. Para cachorros que gostam de banho,
tanto faz o local. Já para animaizinhos que detestam esta hora, o ideal é
escolher um local pequeno onde ele não possa escapar.

Evite banhos ao ar livre se o tempo estiver frio ou com vento para evitar
desconforto e resfriados.


Mime seu bichinho

Principalmente se seu pet não gosta do banho, mimá-lo após o procedimento é
uma boa estratégia. Dê-lhe uma gostosura (própria para sua espécie) e faça
muito carinho. Assim, ele sempre se lembrará de que a hora do banho pode ser
muito boa!

Cuidar da higiene dos cães em casa é uma prática bastante comum, seja por
economia ou por opção mesmo. Mas para os donos que preferem dar banho
nos seus animais de estimação em casa, ao invés de levá-los ao pet shop, é
necessário ter alguns cuidados neste momento de interação com eles.


FREQUÊNCIA:


A frequência dos banhos depende muito do dia a dia do seu cão. Os banhos
podem ser semanais, quinzenais ou mensais, variando de acordo com a
necessidade (por exemplo: cães que passeiam bastante na rua, possuem mais
necessidade de banhos). Por outro lado, banhos em excesso podem fazer mal
para seu animal de estimação: dar 1 ou 2 banhos por semana faz com que a
pele do cão perca a proteção natural, deixando-o exposto a alergias e outras
doenças.


SHAMPOO:


Deve-se utilizar sabonete ou shampoo próprios para cachorros. Existem
shampoo indicados de acordo com a pelagem do cão: pelos brancos, pelos
escuros, antialérgicos e antipulgas.


HORÁRIO:


O melhor horário para o banho é entre as 11h e as 15h, onde a temperatura
natural está mais agradável para que o cachorro não fique com frio.


CUIDADOS:


Tenha cuidado com os olhos e os ouvidos do animal. De preferência, use um
pouco de algodão em cada orelha dele. Não lave a cabeça do cão com
esguicho de água muito forte e tome cuidado para que o shampoo não caia na
região dos olhos.


SECAGEM:


Seque bem seu animal com a ajuda de uma toalha e um secador. Não deixe
pelos úmidos, nem ouvidos molhados. Muito menos deixe que seu pet se
seque sozinho porque isso pode deixá-lo por muito tempo e causar alguma
doença.

ESCOVAÇÃO:

É necessário, também, cuidar dos pelos do animal antes e depois do banho
através da escovação. A escovação antes do banho remove os pelos soltos,
facilitando bastante a eficácia do sabonete ou do shampoo.


Importância do banho e tosa

Ter um animalzinho de estimação, como um cachorro, por exemplo, pode trazer
muito mais alegria para uma família, disso não há a menor dúvida! No entanto,
não se pode esquecer de que um cão também é um ser vivo, de modo que
implica responsabilidades para o seu dono.


Não basta apenas brincar com ele e alimentá-lo, são necessários outros cuidados
para que ele fique sempre saudável e a convivência com a família seja ainda
melhor.


O banho é um dos cuidados mais importantes que o dono de um cão precisa ter,
diferentemente de quem escolhe um gato como animal doméstico. Você já
percebeu que os gatos estão se limpando constantemente? Os cachorros já não
possuem esse hábito, não é da sua natureza, por isso, a tarefa precisa ser feita
pelos donos.
O ideal é que o primeiro banho seja dado quando o cachorro tiver 45 dias de vida
e, de preferência em casa. Mas, por que não levá-lo a um pet shop logo para o
seu primeiro banho? É muito simples: provavelmente, com menos de dois meses,
o cão ainda não tomou todas as vacinas necessárias, assim, não é recomendável
que fique exposto em um ambiente onde possa contrair doenças de outros
animais.


Prefira levar o seu cão ao pet shop ao invés de dar banho nele sempre em
casa. Nesse tipo de estabelecimento, trabalham profissionais especializados
em estética canina, de modo que sabem exatamente quais os melhores
produtos, escovas e procedimentos para higienizar cada cão, de acordo com
as suas características.


O resultado do trabalho realizado no pet shop sempre acaba ficando melhor do
que o feito em casa, por isso, certamente vale a pena fazer esse investimento no
seu amigo.


Outro detalhe que merece atenção é a tosa, imprescindível para algumas raças,
como Poodle, Shitzu, Cocker, Schnauzer e outros, que precisam ser tosados a
cada 45 dias, no máximo, para evitar que a pelagem fique enfraquecida. Nesse
caso, também é preciso deixar o seu animalzinho nas mãos de um tosador
profissional.


E não se esqueça de escovar seu cão sempre, para remover pelos mortos e detectar
possíveis parasitas.


A importância do banho para seu cão

Que os cães devem ser mantidos limpos e higienizados, todos sabemos. No entanto,
os donos ainda ficam um pouco na dúvida com relação a mandar o pet para o banho e
tosa e com qual frequência. Na verdade, é que cada raça de cão possui suas próprias
particularidades e, por isso, cada caso deve ser analisado isoladamente, já que só
assim a necessidade e constância dos banhos e tosas serão determinadas,
justamente, por todas essas características. Os cães que possuem uma pelagem mais
longa, por exemplo, costumam precisam de muita escovação, além do banho e da tosa
pois os fios ficam mais embaraçados.

Eles podem se tornar um ambiente perfeito para o acúmulo de sujeira e o
surgimento de problemas com a dermatite, que também pode ser causada por
falta de banhos e higiene em geral. Além de prestar atenção na pelagem,
conhecer os hábitos do cão também é importante para definir melhor a hora do
banho, já que eles vivem muito tempo em ambientes externos e fica muito tempo
mais sujo do que um que vive a maior parte do tempo dentro de um apartamento.
A recomendação é que os cães com pelagem mais curta tomem banho, em
média, a cada 15 dias. Os de pelagem mais longa e que se sujam com mais
frequência podem ser semanais. Escovar o pet antes de tomar banho é
importante para tirar qualquer resquício de sujeira.

Caso seja você que vai dar banho no seu pet, lembre-se de utilizar produtos
próprios para ele e aproveite para higienizar as partes importantes como os
dentes e ouvidos. Não se esqueça de fazer um charme e deixar seu amiguinho
bonito com enfeites como Gravata para Cachorro e Adesivos para cachorro.
Escolha o que você acredita que mais o agrada e faça da hora do banho uma
grande diversão.



Como escovar os dentes dos cachorros

Muita gente se pergunta se é realmente necessário ou se é bobagem escovar os
dentes do cachorro, a resposta, segundo especialistas, é: precisa sim e é muito
importante. Apesar de ser um costume ainda pouco difundido, já que muitos não
sabem como escovar os dentes dos cachorros o hábito é válido não apenas para
espantar o mau-hálito, mas principalmente para manter a saúde bucal do bichinho.

Após as refeições, os cães também ficam expostos aos males que os restos de comida
ou ração que se depositam entre os dentes podem causar. Por isso, é importante
saber como escovar os dentes dos cachorros. Trata-se de uma região onde podem se
acumular milhares de bactérias capazes causar perda da dentição, inflamação, irritação
e vermelhidão das gengivas e mais o acúmulo de tártaro (crosta amarelo-
amarronzada), sem contar um sério risco de contrair infecções, sendo, muitas delas,
fatais.

Como em todo hábito, a escovação deve começar desde cedo, ainda quando seu pet é
filhote. Nessa época, eles estão mais receptivos às novidades e aceitarão sem maiores
problemas passar pelo procedimento.


Se o seu pet já é adulto, a tarefa fica um pouco mais complicada. Isso ocorre, em um
princípio, porque como não está acostumado com a intervenção humana em escovar
os dentes caninos na região da boca e ele pode estranhar, reagindo negativamente aos
primeiros intentos, por mais confiança que tenha no seu dono ou cuidador. Mas fique
tranquilo, nada que uma boa dose de paciência e amor não resolvam! Mãos à obra:

Itens essenciais para a escovação dos dentes dos pets

Pasta: Quando vamos comprar para nós mesmos uma pasta, muitas vezes preferimos
sabores refrescantes. Contudo, lembre-se que na hora de fazer a escolha do melhor
creme dental para seu cachorro, de nada adianta que o sabor seja gostoso para você e
não para ele. Ou seja, nada de se assustar com opções exóticas ou aparentemente
estranhas como o sabor à carne, por exemplo, que para eles podem ser bem mais
saborosos e instigantes.

Dedal ou escova de dentes: o dedal, ou dedeira como alguns preferem chamar, é
anatômico, tem cerdas muito macias ou revestimento de silicone e você deve usá-lo no
seu dedo indicador para facilitar a escovação dos dentes do bichinho. Já a escova de
dentes especial para pets tem cerdas ultramacias e, em geral, um cabo longo para
facilitar a ação do dono. Os dois são ótimas opções. Para escolher qual será a melhor
para o seu cão já depende de você e dele, o fundamental é que ambos se sintam o
mais cômodos possível durante o processo.

IMPORTANTE

Jamais uma pasta dental de consumo humano deve ser utilizada para realizar
a limpeza dos dentes de um cachorro. Elas possuem componentes que fazem mal ao
estômago do bichinho e podem provocar doenças e desconfortos.


Bem-estar animal
O conceito de bem-estar animal refere-se a uma boa ou satisfatória qualidade de
vida que envolve determinados aspectos referentes ao animal tal como a
saúde, a felicidade, a longevidade (Tannenbaum, 1991; Fraser, 1995).

Um dos conceitos mais populares de bem–estar animal foi dado por Barry
Hughes que o define como "um estado de completa saúde física e mental, em
que o animal está em harmonia com o ambiente que o rodeia" (Hughes, 1976).
Outra definição foi dada por Broom (1986) em que o bem-estar animal é definido
pela "sua capacidade em se adaptar ao seu meio ambiente".

No entanto há diversas perspectivas sobre o que é mais importante para se obter
essa qualidade de vida. Todas essas perspectivas levam a que           possamos
perceber que há muitos aspectos a ter em atenção e que nenhum deles podem
ser considerados certos ou errados, mas que apenas correspondem a diferenças
de valores e de opiniões. Assim, o conceito de bem-estar animal tem de
representar um consenso entre os cientistas e o público em geral. Tendo por base
este consenso surgiu as cinco liberdades dos animais teoria criada pelo professor
John Webster e divulgada pelo Farm Animal Welfare Council (FAWC): ele deve
ser livre de fome e de sede; livre de desconforto; livre de dor, lesões ou doença;
livre para expressar os seus comportamentos normais; livre de medo e aflição.

Perspectivas sobre bem-estar animal


Num ensaio sobre a matéria, David Fraser e Ian Duncan, ambos professores
catedráticos no Canadá, distinguem entre três perspectivas:


Experiência subjectiva nos animais


Bem-estar animal está relacionado com o conceito moral que envolve os animais
por lhe atribuirmos capacidade de gerar experiências subjectivas tais como
estados afetivos, sofrimento em condições adversas e sentimentos de prazer em
situações agradáveis. Como afirmava Bentham (1789), "A questão não é:
Possuem razão? nem, Conseguem falar?, mas Podem sofrer?". Segundo a
perspectiva de experiência subjectiva, bem-estar é quando um animal se sente
bem. Dado a dificuldade em medir estados afetivos diretamente, tem se proposto
várias medidas comportamentais indiretas como a análise da preferência animal
em várias situações e sua motivação para ter acesso a recursos ou executar
comportamentos     particulares;   estudos   sobre   comportamentos      anormais
(estereotipias), comunicação animal (vocalizações), entre outros.



Animais como sistemas biológicos
Nesta perspectiva o mais importante é o funcionamento do organismo, levantando
questões de bem-estar as situações de doença, dor, mal nutrição. Assim, um animal
atinge o seu bem-estar ao crescer e desenvolver-se normalmente, reproduzir-se, ter as
funções fisiológicas e comportamentais normais, ter uma longa longevidade e elevado
fitness. Alguns autores acreditam que os animais sentem o sofrimento, no entanto
como é um parâmetro difícil de ser avaliado, apoiam esta visão com o objectivo de
assim obterem melhores informações.

Outros atribuem pouca importância ao que um animal sente, pois são da opinião
que questões de bem-estar só são preocupantes quando os sistemas biológicos
são afetados em termos de sobrevivência ou de reprodução. Uma outra vertente
defende ambas as perspectivas, no entanto coloca as medidas de funcionamento
biológico acima das comportamentais.

Natureza dos Animais


Esta visão postula que o bem-estar animal é obtido se os animais se encontrarem
em locais naturais onde possam comportar-se de forma natural, ou seja, onde
possam realizar os comportamentos específicos da espécie. Para testar esta
vertente muitos estudos comparam o comportamento dos animais em estado
selvagem e em cativeiro. Outros tentam recriar as características do meio
selvagem para que os animais usem todo o seu repertório comportamental. Este
conceito tem limitações respeitantes à mutabilidade        do       comportamento
animal,   muitas   vezes   como    forma de adaptação ao ambiente que o rodeia.

No geral, as três vertentes anteriores convergem para um bem-estar em que o
comportamento animal é natural, adaptativo ao ambiente e que permita um bom
funcionamento biológico a nível de sobrevivência, saúde e sucesso reprodutivo.



Medidas de bem-estar animal
O bem–estar animal pode ser medido através de metodologias que reflitam com
exatidão este conceito em diferentes situações. Parâmetros e métodos que permitam
esta avaliação devem ser consensuais e pouco subjetivos. Estes são divididos em dois
grandes grupos, fisiológicos e comportamentais.

Em termos fisiológicos, são comumente avaliados            sinais   de stress como as
endorfinas, corticosteróides, batimento cardíaco, entre outros. Contudo há limitações
respeitantes a esta análise, uma vez que fatores genéticos e/ou ambientais podem
produzir diferentes outcomes físicos, mesmo que o estado mental do animal não esteja
comprometido. Por exemplo, um cão pode encontrar-se de perfeita saúde, mas
ansioso, apresentando parâmetros fisiológicos alterados por se estar pontualmente
numa situação de stress. Outra limitação reside na difícil interpretação desses factores
que podem ser aumentados tanto por experiências positivas (presença de semelhante)
como por negativas (presença de predador).

Por outro lado, apesar de nos fornecer grande número de informações, o estudo de
emoções e factores comportamentais nos animais é limitado. Uma das abordagens
desta avaliação é o estudo da comunicação entre animais. Estudos de Poindron & Levy
(1990) exemplificam este facto ao demonstrarem que nas ovelhas o fortalecimento de
relações parentais parece estar intimamente relacionado com a comunicação olfativa.
A nível comportamental, as medições são muitas vezes feitas às situações e não ao
próprio animal. As preferências e o esforço feito pelo animal em determinada tarefa dá
indicação de quanto o animal necessita de determinado recurso e de como a sua
ausência poderá afetar o seu bem-estar (Duncan & Mathews, 1997).

Nutrição Animal

A nutrição animal é definida pelo conjunto de processos em que um organismo vivo
digere ou assimila os nutrientes contidos nos alimentos, usando-os para seu
crescimento, reposição ou reparação dos tecidos corporais e também, para elaboração
de produtos (Ex: Produção de leite pela vaca).


Os animais, sejam eles para consumo humano ou de estimação, merecem                uma
alimentação balanceada e de qualidade. A nutrição animal reúne os pontos importantes
e imprescindíveis para a saúde de bovinos, equínos, suínos, caprinos, aves e outros.
Um dos aspectos mais destacados relacionado a esse tema se refere ao manejo
correto dos elementos contidos na nutrição de animais de corte, ou seja, aqueles que
serão direcionados para o consumo humano, pois esse fator influencia diretamente na
saúde do homem.

O principal objetivo da nutrição animal é propiciar uma produção com baixo custo,
respeitando princípios básicos para que não ocorram riscos à sociedade consumidora
de produtos de origem animal. Os quesitos que auxiliam nessa meta são: ecologia,
qualidade dos produtos e responsabilidade. O primeiro está diretamente relacionado às
medidas de desenvolvimentos sustentáveis; a segunda, com as condições dos
alimentos que, por sua vez, são     encaminhados para fins alimentícios; a terceira,
relacionada ao trabalho que envolve a vida do animal e a do homem.

Estão disponíveis em uma alimentação balanceada: fibras, proteínas, carboidratos,
vitaminas e minerais em proporções adequadas para a digestão. E, caso o alimento
seja preparado manualmente pelo tratador, é importante lembrar da necessidade de
uma supervisão de um especialista para que esse alimento seja formulado
corretamente. Outro elemento indiscutivelmente crucial na criação de animais é a
disponibilização de água para que saciem a sede.

Geralmente, os produtos disponíveis no mercado apresentam em suas embalagens,
principalmente em indicações de rótulo, a que os nutrientes se destinam, além de
outras especialidades. Constam nas tabelas presentes no verso ou na lateral, as
orientações quanto às quantidades diárias fornecidas, de acordo com a necessidade do
animal, seja de peso ou idade.

Qualquer sinal de doença ou sofrimento que o animal possa apresentar é um indicativo
de que, talvez, existam falhas na alimentação. Logo, é essencial que o comportamento
animal seja observado constantemente, para que seja identificada qualquer alteração.
Os principais sintomas são: isolamento do grupo, apatia, alterações na condição física,
comportamento não comum, quebra na produção de leite, falta de apetite, espirros,
ausência de ruminação, tosse persistente, respiração rápida ou irregular, diarreia,
produção excessiva de saliva e inchaço nas articulações.



A Homeopatia para os Animais


Histórico Criada na Alemanha por Hahnemann há mais de duzentos anos, a
homeopatia rapidamente conquistou o mundo todo. Na América do Sul, a medicina
homeopática humana logo foi oficializada e apresenta alto padrão de qualidade. Na
América do Norte e na maioria dos países europeus, é reconhecida e amplamente
adotada e vem se disseminando pela Oceania, África e Oriente Médio.
A medicina homeopática foi introduzida no Brasil em 1840, tendo sido prontamente
assimilada e posteriormente implantada com sucesso na rede pública hospitalar,
tornando nosso país um dos líderes na utilização desta terapia.
Na mesma época em que iniciaram os estudos da homeopatia médica, Hahnemann
disse ao curar seu próprio cavalo: “se as leis que proclamo são as da Natureza, elas
serão válidas para todos seres vivos.“
Dá-se início, então, a Homeopatia em Veterinária, aplicada por seu próprio criador,
Hahnemann. que, em 1815, em uma conferência realizada em Leipzig, apresentou o
trabalho: “O tratamento homeopático dos animais domésticos” . Suas idéias foram
retomadas alguns anos depois, e ampliadas pelo pensamento e pela prática de
diversos veterinários.

No Brasil, em 1942, foi publicado pelo Dr. Nilo Cairo o “ Guia Prático da Veterinária
Homeophatica” ou “Tratamento homeopático de todas as moléstias dos animais
domésticos”. Na década de 50, o médico-veterinário Cláudio Real inicia seus estudos
na França, tornando-se o primeiro veterinário homeopata do Brasil. Posteriormente,
entre os anos 70-80, um pequeno grupo de médicosveterinários se dirige às escolas
homeopáticas de Curitiba, Ribeirão Preto, e Buenos Aires onde, após freqüentarem os
cursos de homeopatia humana, dão inicio, na década seguinte, a cursos de
homeopatia veterinária em Campinas, Porto Alegre, Curitiba, São Paulo e Ribeirão
Preto.
Em 1996, a especialidade é reconhecida pelo Conselho Federal de Medicina
Veterinária.


Conceito


A homeopatia é uma terapia específica de estímulo do organismo doente, na qual a
escolha do medicamento é feita de acordo com os sintomas do caso. Assim,
consideram-se especialmente as causas, o desenvolvimento da doença, a forma do
adoecer, as circunstancias concomitantes, bem como as características do organismo
doente.
A eficiência da homeopatia se fundamenta em seus princípios básicos estabelecidos
desde a época de seu fundador Christian Samuel Hahnemann .
Os princípios fundamentais da homeopatia
O essencial da homeopatia foi publicado em 1810 por Hahnemann em seu livro:
Órganon da arte de curar, que contém suas idéias principais:



 Cada paciente apresenta uma forma pessoal da doença que sofre;
 Este modo individual é descrito pelos sintomas surgidos depois do início da
doença; as propriedades curativas de cada medicamento são;
 Conhecidas por meio de sua experimentação no homem são;
 O medicamento a ser prescrito é aquele cujos sintomas manifestados quando
ingerido pelo homem são, apresentam-se os mais próximos daqueles
manifestados pelo paciente;
 Não se deve empregar mais de um medicamento porvez;
 O medicamento deve ser diluído e dinamizado (agitado vigorosamente).


A Homeopatia Tratando Animais

Os princípios e as leis da homeopatia veterinária são os mesmos da homeopatia
humana: sua colocação em prática salva algumas especificidades, é igualmente
idêntica. Prescreve-se um medicamento homeopático a um animal doente em função
de suas características e sintomas individuais. Trata- se, portanto de identificar os
elementos básicos de sua “personalidade” dentro de uma mesma espécie ou de uma
raça, com os quais ele elabora sua própria reação de defesa a uma dada doença.

O papel do “Dono”


Para tratar um animal pela homeopatia, é necessário o bom conhecimento do animal
ou pelo dono ou por quem lida direto com ele. Estes são os verdadeiros intermediários
entre o animal e o veterinário. Só eles têm condições de escrever em detalhes o
animal, suas atitudes usuais e nãousuais, reconstruir sua história e, assim, trazer
informações indispensáveis à escolha do medicamento adequado.


Cuidando de Espécies Diversificadas
Todos os animais que se beneficiam de uma observação detalhada por parte de seus
donos podem ser tratados pela homeopatia. Na medicina veterinária, distinguem-se
tradicionalmente os animais domésticos e os animais de criação.

Os Animais Domésticos


A medicina homeopática é muito eficaz no tratamento de animais de estimação (cães e
gatos), assim como no de cavalos e pôneis, aves (papagaios, periquitos e canários,
principalmente) e peixes de aquário. O mesmo ocorre com os animais que a sociedade
contemporânea elevou à categoria de animais domésticos, como os roedores (coelhos,
cobaias, hamsters, ratos e camundongos, por exemplo) e os répteis (tartarugas e
serpentes, principalmente).


Os Animais de Criação

Os animais de criação (bois, porcos, carneiros, cabritos etc.) podem igualmente ser
tratados pela homeopatia. No caso de uma doença que afeta parte ou o conjunto do
rebanho, é possível tratar individualmente cada animal, mas normalmente os animais
são analisados como se formasse um único indivíduo, sendo ministrado o mesmo
medicamento homeopático a todos os animais do grupo. Neste caso a prescrição é
determinada a partir da análise dos sintomas mais característicos que todos os animais
pertencentes ao rebanho apresentam.
Além de prescrever o medicamento o veterinário deve estar preocupado com o bem
estar dos animais. Deve se concentrar em melhorar a saúde e prevenir as doenças
mais do que simplesmente tratá-las.


Quais são as Vacinas Necessárias para Cães e Gatos



Animais de estimação são sinônimo de alegria e companheirismo. Eles costumam
recepcionar seus donos com latidos, ronronares e lambidas. Porém, às vezes, os
amiguinhos de quatro patas mudam de comportamento, ficam cabisbaixos e
desanimados. Isso pode ser um sinal de que há algo errado com a saúde deles.
Pra evitar que isso aconteça é necessário manter a caderneta de vacinação em dia. A
tosadora de Sorocaba (SP), Juliana Corcini, que é dona de sete cães e de dois gatos,
sabe bem disso.
“Mantenho as vacinas em dia para prevenir que eles fiquem doentes. Sempre vacino
meus pets de acordo com as datas de nascimento. Além disso, todos os anos eles
tomam o reforço da vacina antirrábica e V10”, conta Juliana.
A médica veterinária Bruna Rosa destaca a importância de vacinarmos os pets. “A
vacinação é de extrema importância, pois a imunização acontece de forma preventiva.
Quando o animal não está vacinado, ele fica suscetível a contrair doenças como a
raiva, cinomose e leptospirose, que podem levar o animal a óbito”, explica a veterinária.
Respeitar o calendário de vacinação dos pets é fundamental para garantir que os
animais fiquem saudáveis e felizes. Apesar de apenas a vacina antirrábica ser
obrigatória, outras vacinas também são importantes.


                 “De acordo coma nossa legislação,somente a vacina antirrábica é obrigatória, já
                 quese trata de uma zoonose, doença que pode ser transmitida a seres humanos.
                 Porém, os animais devem receber também doses da V8 ou V10”,alerta Bruna.

Vacinas necessárias para cães:


      Vacina antirrábica – A vacina antirrábica protege contra a raiva e deve ser
       aplicada em uma única dose após os três primeiros meses de vida dos
       cães. Essa vacina é aplicada gratuitamente por órgãos ligados ao setor
       de zoonoses das cidades.


      Vacina V8 – Essa vacina protege o cão contra cinomose, parvovírus,
       adenovírus tipo 2, parainfluenza, coronavírus, leptospirose causada
       pelas cepas icterohaemorrhagiae e canicola. A aplicação é dividida em
       três seções, com intervalos de 21 a 30 dias entre cada uma.


      Vacina V10 – Além de proteger contra as mesmas doenças que a V8, a
       vacina V10 também protege o cachorro de outras duas cepas
       causadoras da leptospirose, a grippotyphosa e a Pomona. As aplicações
       seguem a mesma indicação da V8.

      Outras vacinas indicadas para os cães são contra a gripe canina,
       giárdia e leishmaniose.
Vacinas Necessárias para Gatos



      Vacina Antirrábica – No caso dos gatos, a vacina antirrábica segue
       as mesmas especificações para os cães.
      Vacina V3 – A tríplice felina protege os animais contra o calicivírus,
       inotraqueite e panleucopenia. A primeira dose deve ser aplicada
       depois dos primeiros 60 dias do animal, a segunda após o intervalo de
       21 dias.
      Vacina V4 – Além de proteger os bichanos das mesmas doenças que a
       tríplice, a quádrupla felina protege também contra a clamidiose.
      Vacina V5 – Essa vacina protege das mesmas doenças que a V4 e contra a
      leucemia felina. As doses devem ser aplicadas a partir dos nove meses
       do animal e com intervalo de 21 a 30 dias.
      É importante ressaltar que as vacinas devem ser aplicadas anualmente e
       apenas por médicos veterinários. A imunização do animal só acontece
       após a aplicação da última dose das vacinas, por isso, quando o pet
       estiver no quadro vacinal, não deve ter contato com outros animais.


Normas de Biossegurança em Medicina Veterinária
Ambiente Clínico-Veterinário:
É muito importante preparar o ambiente antes de iniciar o atendimento. O planejamento
evitará, por exemplo, o contato da mão enluvada com materiais e equipamentos.


Determinadas superfícies, especialmente as de toque frequente (negatoscópio,
recipientes de gaze, algodão, maçanetas, etc.) podem servir como reservatório de
agentes infectantes, uma vez que daí, os micro-organismos podem ser transferidos
para nariz, boca, olhos ou outra parte do corpo muito facilmente. A infecção acidental
de clientes ou pacientes ocorre principalmente através do contato com as mãos
enluvadas do profissional.
A limpeza e desinfecção de instrumentos e ambientes de uma forma em geral
constituem etapas importantes na minimização do risco. Estes procedimentos reduzem
significativamente, a contaminação e infecção cruzadas.
Classificação dos Ambientes


Áreas não críticas - são aquelas não ocupadas no atendimento dos clientes ou as quais
estes não têm acesso. Essas áreas exigem limpeza constante com água e sabão com
poder desinfetante.

Áreas semi-críticas - são aquelas vedadas às pessoas estranhas às atividades
desenvolvidas. Ex: lavanderia, laboratórios, biotério, salas de raio-X. Estas, devido ao
seu nível crítico, exigem limpeza e desinfecção um pouco mais eficiente que as áreas
anteriores.

Áreas críticas - são aquelas destinadas à assistência direta ao paciente, exigindo
rigorosa desinfecção. Ex: clínica de pequenos e grandes animais domésticos ou
silvestres (antes de cada atendimento), setor de esterilização e salas de cirurgia.


Segundo o Centro de Controles e Prevenção de Doenças dos Estados Unidos, existem
duas categorias de superfícies:


Superfície de contato clínico: apresenta um alto potencial de contaminação/infecção
direta a partir de artigos contaminados seja por aerossóis gerados durante o
procedimento ou pelo contato das mãos enluvadas do profissional. Essas superfícies
podem, mais tarde, facilitar a contaminação de outros instrumentos, equipamentos,
luvas e até mesmo infectar mãos.


Superfícies domésticas: estas não entram em contato com clientes, pacientes,
instrumentos ou equipamentos usados durante os procedimentos clínicos. Portanto,
essas superfícies têm um risco limitado de transmissão de infecções. Como é o caso
de paredes, pisos e pias.


Para desinfecção de bancadas, móveis e equipamentos com superfícies metálicas é
adequado a fricção com álcool etílico a 70% com tempo de exposição de 10 minutos,
conforme      descrito   na   norma   Processamento   de   Artigos   e   Superfícies   em
Estabelecimentos de Saúde MS/94. A operação deve ser repetida até completar o
tempo de ação. Friccionar, deixar secar e repetir três vezes a aplicação, até completar
o tempo de ação de 10 minutos.
Para as superfícies de contato clínico que não possam ser descontaminadas
facilmente, indica-se o revestimento com materiais descartáveis.


Todas as superfícies que são passíveis de contaminação e, ao mesmo tempo, de difícil
descontaminação devem ser cobertas. Incluem-se:


- Puxadores de portas e gavetas de armários;
- Tubo, alça e disparador do raio-X;
- Filme radiográfico;
- Interruptores de equipamentos laboratoriais de uma forma em geral;
- Interruptores de negatoscópio;
- Hastes e dispositivos de apoio em equipamentos laboratoriais.


A cobertura deve ser feita com material impermeável (folhas de alumínio, capas
plásticas, etc.) a qual se descarta após o atendimento de cada paciente. As
coberturas de alumínio, por serem passíveis de esterilização, devem ser
utilizadas nos procedimentos cirúrgicos.

O uso adequado das coberturas depende dos passos descritos abaixo:

 A colocação da cobertura limpa deve ser realizada preferencialmente com
luvas de procedimento.

 Após o uso, a remoção da cobertura utilizada, deve ser realizada com luvas
grossas de borracha.
Quanto à limpeza de paredes e pisos recomenda-se o uso de água e sabão. Usar
hipoclorito de sódio a 1%, em todas as superfícies domésticas não metálicas. Pisos e
bancadas devem ser limpos diariamente antes e ao final das atividades e as demais
superfícies, gavetas, mobiliários, entre outros, devem ser limpos uma vez por semana ou
em uma periodicidade menor se for o caso.



Higiene e Saúde Animal


Banho
1. Xixi antes. Não coloque seu animal de estimação na água sem antes dar um passeio
rápido para que ele possa se aliviar. Acredite, essa dica é valiosa.


2. Organize os produtos. Separe tudo que você vai precisar para o banho, desde o
xampu, escova, toalha e panos. Deixe os produtos à mão, na ordem de uso: xampu,
escova, panos e toalhas. Assim, não corre o risco de deixar sozinho o animal molhado
e doido para fugir, só porque esqueceu algo importante.


3. Recompense. A cada etapa bem sucedida do processo (passou o xampu, esfregou,
tirou o xampu, e por aí vai), premie o pet. Tudo fica melhor com uma recompensa.


4. Cheire à vontade. Cachorros gostam de conhecer bem os espaços onde estão
sendo levados, portanto deixe que ele cheire todo o local, inclusive o
equipamento que será usado no banho. Luvas, banheira, vidro de xampu, escova,
entre outros. No final, dê um petisco pelo bom comportamento.


5. Concentre a bagunça. Se as experiências anteriores mostraram que, além do
animal de estimação, o banheiro também parece ficar todo molhado, invista em
um chuveirinho manual. Dar banho de chuveirinho no cão é mais fácil do que
embaixo do chuveirão.



6. Não tropece. Ninguém merece, justo no fim do banho, levar aquele tombo
dentro do box. Um tapete de borracha bem preso ao chão vai fazer com que tanto
o animal quanto você estejam mais seguros.



7. Evite a maratona. Para que seu cachorro não saia correndo desesperado,
como um maratonista, procure dar banho em um lugar que você possa fechar a
porta. Se não puder banhar em um lugar fechado, escolha um espaço abrigado
do vento, e não deixe a água nem muito quente e nem muito fria – especialmente
se for filhote, senhorzinho ousenhorinha.


8. Tenha paciência. Banho nem sempre é algo muito confortável para o pet.
Tenha paciência e seja gentil com seu amigo, dando tempo para ele se acostumar
ao banho.


9. Mantenha as pulgas longe! Faça uma “coleira de espuma” em volta do
pescoço para evitar que as pulgas corram todas para a cabeça do animal.
Depois, massageie o xampu do pescoço até o rabo. Volte para a cabeça e
finalize.


10. Confira a limpeza. Enxaguar bem, até que a água saia bem limpinha e o pelo
esteja sem nenhum sinal de resto do xampu. Depois, não economize na
qualidade da toalha. Quanto maior e mais felpuda, melhor ela vai enxugar o
animal. Faça desse momento a hora da recompensa pelo bom comportamento,
ou pela tolerância ao banho.

                Foreword

                          In 1987–88, I spent a sabbatical year as a Visiting Professor jointly at the Dental and Veterinary Schools of
                          Liverpool University; this led to an invitation to edit the first BSAVA Manual of Small Animal Dentistry, which
                          was published in 1990 as a modest volume of 158 pages, limited to black-and-white illustrations.

                          When the first edition was written, dental equipment and instruments in the typical UK small animal practice
                          consisted of an ultrasonic scaler and a limited selection of tooth extraction instruments. The intervening 30
                          years have seen an explosion in awareness of small animal dentistry. Now, even in a non-specialist practice, a
                          high-speed dental unit with hand-pieces, burs and an air-water spray, and a dental radiographic unit,
                          preferably digital, are considered essential to practicing good quality general dentistry. This book fills a very
                          useful purpose, because dentistry has yet to achieve the veterinary school ‘curriculum time’ appropriate for
                          its clinical importance. Continued professional development and reading expert texts such as this book are
                          critical means of closing the dental knowledge circle for veterinary practitioners.

                          To match the need for greatly expanded dental information, the Editors of this fourth edition have assembled
                          a very strong group of contributors. The book is logical in its organization, thorough in its depth of coverage,
                          well referenced, and very well illustrated with several excellent ‘how-to’ sequences. It tackles the
                          controversial topics, such as ‘anaesthesia-free dentistry’ and ‘use and abuse of antibiotics in association with
                          dental treatment’ in a fair and useful way.

                          While it remains unlikely that every small animal practice will ever have the expertise, experience, equipment,
                          instruments and supplies to offer the full range of veterinary dental procedures, all small animal practices
                          should be capable of two things:

                          1. Effective management of the common dental and oral conditions in cats and dogs.
                          2. Recognition of the full range of dental and oral conditions, so that informed referrals can be
                             made to dental specialists who are able to offer equipment- and knowledge-intensive procedures.

                          This book provides the detailed, well-illustrated information required for the first of these critical items, and
                          sufficient detail for the second to ensure that accurate information about treatment and prognosis can be
                          provided to owners when a referral to a specialist is indicated.

                          One area in which significant progress has been made is in the understanding of the interactions between the
                          oral cavity and the rest of the body. The association of distant organ pathology (cardiac, renal, hepatic) and
                          systemic response to increasing severity of periodontal disease is now well documented in dogs, and
                          provides a powerful stimulus to establish an effective periodontal disease preventive program in every
                          practice. As is well described in this book, this consists of professional scaling when indicated, extractions
                          when necessary, and an effective home-care oral hygiene program. The general health of our pets will benefit
                          when early attention is paid to prevention as well as treatment of this, the most common disease occurring in
                          dogs and cats.

                          Please take time to read through this book, and then be sure to ‘lift-the-lip’ every time you see any patient for
                          any reason, so that you can recognize the oral-dental conditions that are so well described here.

                          I hope you will find, as I did, that dentistry offers a challenging, interesting and professionally satisfying use of
                          your veterinary skills!

        Preface

                  It has been 6 years since we were first approached to edit the 4th edition of this book, thus continuing a
                  series of BSAVA manuals on dentistry and oral surgery in dogs and cats. We found it important to add ‘and
                  oral surgery’ to its title, as many procedures performed in and around the mouth involve surgical techniques
                  beyond the treatment of teeth.

                  This book has been written to reach veterinarians, veterinary technicians and nurses, and veterinary students.
                  It contains 13 chapters and is intended to educate the reader about the following topics:

                  Ethical aspects; anatomy and physiology; examination; diagnostic imaging; common pathology; anaesthesia
                  and analgesia; management of periodontal disease, non-periodontal inflammatory, infectious and reactive
                  conditions, dental and oral trauma, developmental disorders, and oral and maxillofacial neoplasia; tooth
                  extraction; and perioperative considerations.

                  We come from both academia and private practice, and put great thought and effort into this project. The
                  reader can hope to learn the basics of dentistry and oral surgery in dogs and cats by reading this manual,
                  and we also included intermediate and advanced information for those that already have a special interest in
                  the discipline. While no attempt was made to be all-inclusive, we wanted to deliver well-referenced
                  knowledge that is supported by an abundance of image material.

                  We selected authors that are known leaders and experienced professionals in their field of expertise. They
                  were instrumental in the writing of this manual, and we thank them for having made significant contributions
                  to the veterinary literature. We are also grateful to our partners, families, friends and colleagues who
                  supported us during this journey. Our special gratitude goes to our mentors Dr Colin Harvey, Dr Paul Orsini
                  and Mrs Bonnie Miller, who were influential in making us become who we are today.

                  Respectfully,

                Tooth size and shape is determined genetically. Size does
                not seem to be strongly correlated with body or head size,
                but rather to the size of supporting structures. Small-breed
                dogs, however, show large teeth (in particular the mandib-
                ular first molar tooth) relative to bone height, which may
                predispose small dogs to pathological bony fractures
                (Gioso et al., 2001).
                    Teeth can have one, two or three roots, with a relatively
                constant number for each tooth (Figure 2.12). However,
                variations resulting from fusion of two roots or from the
                presence of an extra or supernumerary root may occur.

        Canine teeth
        Canines are simple, single-rooted teeth with a strong,
        long, distally curved conical crown used to grasp and
        hold (Figure 2.15). They are characterized by the presence
        of coronal developmental grooves and shallow ridges
        that may allow drainage of blood while holding and killing
        prey. Canines are also used to lacerate flesh. They have
        an oval shape, being slightly flattened in a vestibulopal-
        atal or vestibulolingual direction. The root is larger than
        the crown, with the maximum diameter at the middle
        third. Deciduous canine teeth are relatively small and
        pointed compared with their permanent counterparts
        (see Figure 2.6).                                                    2.16

                Premolar teeth
                Premolar teeth presumably have a function in catching and
                holding prey. The shape, size and number of roots of per-
                manent premolars vary significantly, ranging from the
                small single-rooted first premolar to the large three-rooted
                maxillary fourth premolar (Figure 2.17).
                    The two-rooted premolar teeth are grossly symmetri-
                cal, compressed buccolingually and have pointed cusps
                that do not necessarily meet when the jaws are closed.
                Carnassial teeth (permanent maxillary fourth premolar and
                mandibular first molar) have a blade-like shape and are
                used to cut skin and meat. The maxillary fourth premolar
                tooth has a similar shape in both dogs and cats, with a
                large distal root and two thinner mesial roots (buccal and
                palatal). The small mesiopalatal root is only connected to
                the mesiobuccal root (Figure 2.18), which is an important
                consideration for root separation during extractions.

                Molar teeth
                In dogs, molar teeth have a bunodont shape (Figure 2.19).
                Maxillary molars have two higher buccal (mesial and distal)
                cusps with long and relatively thin roots and a lower pala-
                tal cusp with a short and stubby root, connected to both
                vestibular roots (Figure 2.20). Often the distobuccal and                               ight ma illa top and mandib la bottom mola teeth of

           The mandibular first molar tooth has two similarly elon-
        gated roots, slightly curved distally (see Figure 2.19). The
        crown has two tall mesial cusps and a lower distal cusp,
        which – with the occlusal surface of the other mandibular
        molars – creates an effective surface for crushing bones
        and hard materials against the maxillary molars.
           The roots of multi-rooted premolar and molar teeth in
        dogs often present a longitudinal groove corresponding to
        a bony ridge in the alveolus (Figure 2.21). Normally the
        grooves are present on the mesial surface of the distal root
        and the distal surface of the mesial root. The interlock

                Pulp cavity
                The pulp cavity follows the external tooth shape and
                should always appear radiolucent. Even in the case of pulp
                death, the radiodensity of the pulp cavity will not change.
                However, radiopaque dystrophic pulp mineralization may
                rarely develop following trauma. Discrete calcifications
                (pulp stones) may also be seen within the pulp chamber or
                coronal third of the root canal as round or oval radiopaque
                structures. The aetiology of pulp stones is unknown, and in
                human patients they represent occasional findings with no
                clinical consequences. At times, pulp stones may be
                radiographically difficult to differentiate from a condition
                known as dens in dente, where the outer surface of the
                tooth folds inward. In young animals, the open apex is
                seen directly connected to the periodontal space, but the
                thin microscopic canals of the adult apical delta are not             a
                detectable radiographically.

                Periodontal space
                Healthy tooth roots are surrounded by a thin radiolucent
                line, the periodontal space (see Figure 2.9). The size of the
                space may vary slightly along a root, but should be consist-
                ently visible all around it. In cases of ankylosis, the perio-
                dontal space will be obliterated. Usually, the cross-section
                of canine and feline teeth is round or oval. Therefore, as the
                X-ray beam passes tangential to the root surface, a single
                radiolucent line is created on the radiograph. In dogs, how-
                ever, some of the roots of the mandibular premolar and
                molar teeth may exhibit a cashew nut-like cross-section,
                with a concave area between two convex surfaces (see                  b
                Figure 2.21bc). In this case the periodontal space may
                appear radiographically as a double radiolucent line.                                                               2.23

                Despite its radiopacity, the lamina dura is not cortical
                bone. Its high radiopacity is due to a summatory effect of            c
                the X-ray beam passage through this thick layer of bone.

        The masseter muscle arises from the zygomatic arch, covers

        on the ventrolateral and ventromedial surface of the man-

        retractor is helpful to retract soft tissues for visualization of

        used during the oral examination are the periodontal probe

        Dental mirror
        A dental mirror provides several useful functions while
        working in the mouth of a veterinary patient. When used for
        indirect vision (Figure 3.2), it prevents the back and neck of
        the clinician from having to be strained and curved. The
        mirror provides the ability to maintain proper ergonomics,
        important in preventing workplace musculoskeletal dis-
        orders that have been known to cause forced early retire-
        ment of dentists and oral surgeons. The mirror is handy to
        use for retraction of the lips and tongue, especially during
        use of power scalers where heat from the tips may cause
        tissue trauma. A mirror may be used both for retraction and
        indirect vision, as in the case of holding the mirror caudal to
        the maxillary second molar to view the molars while retract-
        ing the cheek. Indirect illumination is another function of a
        dental mirror. When needing to focus on a particular area of
        a tooth, such as during scaling or root planing, the instru-
        ment can be held so as to bounce the overhead light off the
                                                                                          Dental explorer working ends. From top to bottom:

             agitated and evasive once the mouth is forced open
        •    Lift the lips gently by the margins, to avoid accidentally
             touching a painful lesion such as mucosal ulcers
        •    In dogs, avoid pushing on the sensitive nasal planum.
             Even careful lifting of the lips close to the nasal planum
             is tolerated only for a few seconds and followed by
             sneezing and/or evasive movements
        •    In cats, the general rule applies that minimal restraint
             results in less defensive behaviour. Consider
             approaching the patient from caudolaterally, instead of
             the front. A frontal approach is more threatening to the
             cat and renders the clinician at greater risk of feline
             defensive behaviour. Repeated stroking of the head
             prior to the intraoral examination helps to calm the cat.
             Gentle front leg restraint by an assistant may be helpful
             in some cases, in particular during the relatively short               Demonstration of the lifting of the upper lip of a small

               •    Gingival enlargement: This presents as gingival over-
                    growth on to areas of the crown that would not normally
                    be covered by gingiva. Knowledge of the normal
                    gingival contour and location is required for the clinician
                    to measure the degree of enlargement. The free gingival
                    margin normally apposes the crown about 0.5 mm in
                    cats and 1–3 mm in dogs beyond the cementoenamel
                    junction. Adjacent teeth that may have less or no
                    gingival enlargement may serve to help the clinician to
                    estimate where the gingival contour should be. The term
                    enlargement is a clinical term and could encompass
                    benign and malignant causes for excess gingiva or
                    gingiva-like tissue. Gingival hyperplasia is a common
                    cause of gingival enlargement. Vertically enlarging
                    gingival tissue can form a ‘pseudopocket’ (or gingival
                    pocket) where the periodontal probe discovers a
                    pocket, but periodontal attachment to the cementoe-
                    namel junction may still be intact. Differential diagnosis
                    should also include gingival oedema, which accompa-
                    nies gingivitis. If gingivectomy is performed in case of
                    an oedematous lesion, gingival recession may develop
                    following resolution of inflammation. Pseudopockets
                    invite accumulation of plaque, hair and debris, and they
                    may therefore contribute to future attachment loss, in
                    which case a pseudopocket and a true periodontal
                    pocket combine to form one deeper pocket.

        Dental radiographic techniques
        A full-mouth set of radiographs of a dog or cat typically
        includes 10–14 views and should show all the teeth with
        2–3 mm of periapical area visible for each root. The use
        of a number 4 film/plate size is advisable to ensure
        capturing of large teeth or voluminous pathology in one
        image. An intraoral technique allows superimposition of                                       Dental ﬁlm senso pad phospho plate

        to obtain an image with each tooth as near to actual
        size and shape as possible. In the mid to caudal mandib-

        (Figure 4.9), but in all other areas a bisecting angle
        technique is necessary (Figure 4.10) (Operative Techniques
        4.1 and 4.2).                                                   operator is facing the patient (Figure 4.11). With radio-

        Ultrasonography
        Ultrasonography utilizes high-frequency sound waves (typi-
        cally of the order of a few megahertz in frequency) to image
        internal anatomy in real time. It is based on the reflection of
        sound from the internal structures of the body. It provides
        cross-sectional images in any orientation. Ultrasonography
        typically does not require sedation or anaesthesia, though
        these may be necessary in fractious patients and when
        interventional procedures are performed. Another advan-
        tage of ultrasonography is that it allows insertion of needles
                                                                                        lt aso nd machine a t ansd ce is applied to the s in in the

        birdcage design are often used. However, for imaging of
        small specific parts of the head, such as the TMJs, small
        surface coils can also be employed.
            MRI acquisition times require the use of general anaes-
        thesia, with another requirement being that the equipment
        used must be MRI compatible. For head imaging the
        patient should be placed in sternal recumbency with
        the long axis of the body parallel to the long axis of the
        gantry. The head should be placed perfectly symmetrically
        within the coil so that exact symmetry is achieved when
        imaging in the transverse plane; the hard palate should be
        parallel to the table. This often requires the use of pads
        and tape to maintain the head in the appropriate position.

        structures include, for example, underdeveloped teeth
        and atrophied masticatory muscles.

        Shape
        Shape abnormalities are often the most relevant findings in
        dentistry and oral surgery and include abnormally formed
        teeth, altered periodontal structures, worn and fractured
        teeth, jaw fractures, oral and maxillofacial masses, and
        osteolytic changes and periosteal reactions of facial bones.

        Opacity
        The teeth are the hardest and most mineralized structures
        of the body, and loss of radiographic opacity of hard
        tissues (teeth, bone) is always a significant finding.
        Developmental abnormalities such as enamel hypoplasia
        and enamel hypomineralization may be due to a systemic
        insult (such as with distemper) or result from local trauma,       (a)
        infection and inflammation during the time when enamel is
        developing in a tooth that has not yet erupted. More severe
        insult may lead to odontodysplasia, i.e. deformation of
        the entire tooth.
            Damage to the hard tissues (enamel, dentine and
        cementum) of erupted teeth can be caused by fracture,
        resorption, erosion, attrition, abrasion, caries and neoplasia.
        With metabolic conditions such as primary or secondary
        hyperparathyroidism there is often osteopenia, with prefer-
        ential demineralization of the alveolar bone of the upper and
        lower jaws leading to the radiographic appearance of freely
        floating teeth. Osteolysis is the process of active bone
        destruction through an aggressive infectious or neoplastic
        disease. Other causes of abnormally reduced opacity
        include abnormal gas accumulation, for instance in an
        infected root canal. This is relatively subtle and identified
        on CT.
            Periosteal and endosteal lesions are reactive changes          (b)

               at any level of the tooth. When the X-ray beam falls
               parallel with the plane of a root fracture, the site of the
               fracture appears as a sharp radiolucent line between
               tooth fragments (Figure 4.38). If the X-ray beam orienta-
               tion is more oblique to the fracture plane, some of the
               tooth structure superimposes over the fracture, and
               the fracture appears as a poorly defined grey shadow or
               may not be visible at all. Root fractures are usually trans-
               verse and oblique and are more commonly noticed on                         (a)
               incisor teeth. Longitudinal crown-root fractures are rela-
               tively uncommon. Root remnants are a common radio-
               graphic finding in dogs and cats (Farcas et al., 2014). On
               occlusal radiographs, root remnants are often found as
               round opaque structures with a variously sized central
               lucency (the root canal) (Figure 4.39).


               Resorption
               Radiographically detectable external resorption may be
               inflammatory (AVDC type 1 resorption) or non-inflamma-
               tory (AVDC type 2 resorption) in nature (Figure 4.40). The
               latter is also referred to as replacement resorption, in
               which the periodontal ligament space and lamina dura
               disappear in some or several areas around the root due                     (b)

        tion (1 and 2) are found together in the same tooth. In
        dogs, type 2 tooth resorption is much more frequently
        diagnosed than type 1 tooth resorption. The severity
        of external tooth resorption is staged according to loss of
        tooth substance. External surface resorption is also
        relatively common in dogs. It affects cementum and
        dentine and is often considered a self-limiting process.
        Radiographically, the affected root appears irregularly
        shaped, with one or more resorption lacunae but
        normally corresponding periodontal ligament space and
        lamina dura (Peralta et al., 2010a).
            Radiographically    detectable     internal   resorption
        presents as a fairly uniform, oval-shaped radiolucent
        enlargement of the pulp cavity. The original outline of the
        root canal or pulp chamber is distorted (Figure 4.41).
        Unlike external root resorption, resorption of the adjacent

               Periapical disease
               The periodontal ligament should follow the root in close
               proximity, but a chevron artefact is often present, sur-
               rounding the apex of incisor and canine teeth. This is a
               tunnel-shaped widening of the periodontal ligament space
               that follows the shape of the root and is part of normal
               radiographic variation (Figure 4.44).
                   On the contrary, a bullous radiolucency surrounding the
               apex of a root is a sign of periapical disease that usually
               originates from a diseased pulp. A radiolucency surround-
               ing the root apex with loss of lamina dura is usually related
               to the presence of a chronic periapical abscess or a peria-
               pical granuloma (Figure 4.45); its border varies from a well
               defined sclerotic band to a diffuse region that blends into
               adjacent bone. A periapical cyst may be radiographically
               indistinguishable from a granuloma, though often it is more
               apt to have a thin hyperostotic (radiopaque) border com-
               pared with a granuloma (Figure 4.46). An acute periapical

                   Evaluation of root canal therapy, including the assess-
               ment of shaping, obturation, compaction and restoration,
               and of the short- and long-term outcome, is mostly based
               on radiographs. A tooth treated with successful root canal
               therapy will have maintained a normal width of the perio-
               dontal ligament space, and previously present periapical
               findings will either not have progressed or may have disap-
               peared. If a periapical lucency has decreased or remained
               the same and apical resorption has not progressed, the
               treatment outcome is defined as ‘no evidence of failure’
               (Figure 4.50). If a periapical lucency or apical resorption
               has developed subsequent to treatment, or if a periapical
               lucency has increased in size and apical resorption has
               progressed, the outcome is defined as ‘failure’.
                   Evaluation of the outcome of vital pulp therapy also
               includes the assessment of signs of the continued
               presence of pulp vitality, including continued tooth devel-
               opment (root lengthening and apical closure in immature                   (a)
               teeth; progressive thickening of the dentinal walls and
               narrowing of the pulp cavity in mature teeth) and absence
               of internal or external root resorption (Figure 4.51).
               Occasionally, chronic pulpitis may result in diffuse pulpal
               mineralization (Figure 4.52), which, if occurring after vital
               pulp therapy, would be considered a treatment failure.
               Traditionally, formation of an irregular dentinal bridge
               between the pulp capping material and the underlying
               pulp has been considered as a sign of successful
               vital pulp therapy, but more recent studies show that
               a dentinal bridge is not significantly associated with
               increased or decreased odds of treatment failure
               (Luotonen et al., 2014).

        Jaws and temporomandibular
        joints
        Odontogenic cysts
        Cysts in the jaws are most commonly diagnosed in the
        tooth-bearing region, as they originate from rests of
        odontogenic epithelium that remain within bone after
        tooth formation. Radiography and particularly CT are
        very sensitive to detect and monitor cysts. The typical
        radiographic appearance of a cyst is a round or oval                (a)
        radiolucent area, surrounded by a thin opaque lining.
        Occasionally, cysts are multilocular, with several radio-
        lucent areas separated by bony walls. Cysts may cause
        displacement or resorption of adjacent teeth and, if
        present in the upper jaw, could cause nasal airway
        obstruction. The dentigerous cyst is most commonly
        diagnosed in the area of an unerupted mandibular first
        premolar tooth in brachycephalic dogs. It is initially
        attached to the cementoenamel junction of the unerupted
        tooth; however, with continued enlargement it will com-
        pletely enclose the tooth within its lumen. The second
        most common odontogenic cyst is the periapical cyst.

        sequences of brachycephalism can be overcrowding of
        teeth with associated tooth eruption disorders and mal-
        occlusion as well as upper airway problems.
            Asynchronous growth of the skull bones is often
        assumed in dogs and cats with marked head asymmetry
        and is best assessed with CT. In cats a slightly curved
        nasal septum and intranasal obstructing hypertrophic
        turbinates are common incidental findings. A curved nasal
        septum is also commonly seen in brachycephalic dogs
        where it may be quite prominent, contributing to the
        obstructive airway conditions these patients often have.
        Premature closure of the bony sutures of the zygomatic
        arch may also cause maxillofacial asymmetry and open-
        mouth jaw locking.

        osteoproliferative conditions
        Osteomyelitis and osteonecrosis of skull bones are rare
        conditions that most commonly affect young adult to
        middle-aged, large-breed dogs. The radiographic appear-
        ance includes generalized and palisading periosteal reac-
        tion, osteolysis, and soft tissue swelling indicating cellulitis
        around affected skull bones. Intraoral dental radiography
        and CT are helpful to characterize the extent and location
        of inflammation (Figure 4.53).
            Penetrating foreign bodies often enter the soft tissues
        of the head via the oral cavity and lead to infection
        and abscessation of the retrobulbar space, masticatory
        muscles, tongue, periaural space, salivary glands and retro-
        pharyngeal region. Both contrast-enhanced CT and MRI
                                                                            (b)

        the salivary ducts for obstructive sialoliths and the
        periglandular fat for oedematous changes with infection.
        The salivary duct can be obstructed or ruptured, neo-
        plasia, cysts and abscesses can cause parenchymal filling
        defects, and contrast medium can extend through defects
        of the gland or duct into submucosal or subcutaneous
        spaces. In limbic epilepsy, salivary glands are often
        enlarged and asymmetrical but otherwise normal (con-
        sider the presence of sialadenosis). Intravenous contrast
        medium administration can reveal non-enhancing paren-
        chyma consistent with a cyst, abscess or central necrosis
        (e.g. necrotizing sialometaplasia). Differentiation between
        neoplastic and inflammatory/infectious conditions is not
        always possible.
            Due to the excellent soft tissue contrast obtained with
        MRI, the salivary glands are clearly differentiated from
        the adjacent fat and muscles even without gadolinium
        injection. Normal salivary glands are mildly to moderately
        hyperintense compared with muscles on T1-weighted
        pre-contrast and T2-weighted series and typically show
        moderate homogeneous contrast enhancement after
        gadolinium injection. The paired major salivary glands
        can routinely be evaluated with MRI. The parotid gland is
        located at the base of the ear ventral to the horizontal
        portion of the ear canal; it is V-shaped and has a
        lobulated appearance. The mandibular gland is ventral
        and medial to the parotid gland, oval-shaped and
        smoothly marginated. A hypointense hilus is usually seen
        in the mid-portion of the gland. The monostomatic part of
        the sublingual gland is intimately associated with the                    Transverse T1-weighted images in two dogs showing the
                                                                         4.79

        caudal to the eye in the retrobulbar space; it is adjacent
        and immediately lateral to the medial pterygoid muscle,
        and in the transverse plane it is rectangular, trapezoid or
        triangular in shape with well defined borders and slightly
        lobulated margins. It is surrounded by hyperintense
        orbital fat (Figure 4.79).


        Sialadenitis
        Sialadenitis can be assessed with ultrasonography when
        inflammation affects an easily accessible gland such as
        the mandibular gland. When using ultrasonography, an
        inflamed gland appears enlarged, heterogeneous and is
        surrounded by hyperechoic heterogeneous tissue that             (a)
        often has a striated pattern due to oedema/cellulitis in the
        periglandular fat. Hypoechoic areas in an affected gland
        can represent regions of necrosis or abscessation (Figure
        4.80). The zygomatic glands are better assessed with CT or
        MRI (Cannon et al., 2011). When using MRI, an inflamed
        gland appears enlarged with fuzzy margins. It is hypo-
        intense on T1-weighted pre-contrast images, hyperintense
        on T2-weighted series and shows significant contrast
        enhancement on T1-weighted series after gadolinium injec-
        tion (Figure 4.81). The enhancement is often hetero-
        geneous, with non-enhancing areas that can correspond
        to areas of necrosis or sialocele formation as a result of      (b)
        the inflammation. The eye is frequently displaced by an                    Long a is lt asonog ams of the no mal and in amed
        enlarged zygomatic gland. Like CT, MRI provides more             4.80      mandibular salivary glands in a dog with mandibular

                  TECHNIQUE

                  General
                  In all views, bring the cone of the dental X-ray machine as close to the target as possible, ensuring the beam captures
                  the desired teeth and periapical bone by centring the film/sensor pad/phosphor plate within the circumference of the
                  cone. If necessary, use sponges or rubber tubes to keep the dental film/sensor pad/phosphor plate in the desired
                  position. Wooden sticks or other instruments may be used to aid in visualizing the beam and bisecting angle. For any
                  view, it is recommended that the cusps of the target teeth are placed close to the margin of the film (or sensor pad/
                  phosphor plate) to increase the area of visualization and decrease the risk of projecting the root apices beyond the
                  opposite border of the film.

               Commonly encountered dental
               and oral pathologies
               Alexander M. Reiter


               This chapter provides information about dental and oral
               pathologies commonly encountered in cats and dogs. The
               information is deliberately kept brief for conditions that are
               covered in greater detail in other chapters.



               Periodontal disease
               The periodontium is a functional unit consisting of the gin-
               giva, periodontal ligament, alveolar bone and cementum.
               Periodontal disease is inflammation and infection of the
               periodontium by plaque bacteria and the host’s response
               to the bacterial insult. Small dog breeds and older animals                                                         Gingivitis with mild (arrowheads) and severe (arrowed)
               have a higher risk of developing periodontal disease                                                           5.2  gingival recession in a dog with moderate plaque and calculus

            Lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune disease char-
        acterized histologically by basal cell destruction, hyper-
        keratosis, epithelial atrophy, subepithelial and perivascular
        lymphocytic infiltration and vascular dilatation with sub-
        mucosal oedema, biochemically by evidence of circulating
        autoantibodies against various cellular antigens in both the
        nucleus and cytoplasm, and clinically by the presence of
        acute lesions (systemic lupus erythematosus) on the skin,
        mucosa and multiple organs, or chronic lesions (discoid
        lupus erythematosus) mostly confined to the skin of the
        face and mucosa of the oral cavity (Lommer, 2013; Olivry
        et al., 2015).
            Masticatory muscle myositis is an autoimmune disease
        affecting the temporal, masseter, and medial and lateral
        pterygoid muscles of the dog. The term masticatory
        myositis is an acceptable alternative (Reiter and Schwarz,
        2007). For detailed information about the diagnosis and
        treatment of these conditions, the reader is referred to
        Chapter 8.

        Abnormal number, size and
        morphology of teeth
        A persistent deciduous tooth is a primary tooth that is
        present when it should have exfoliated (Figure 5.11). A
        supernumerary tooth is an extra tooth (also called hyper-
        dontia) (Figure 5.12). Hypodontia is the developmental
        absence of a few teeth, while oligodontia is the develop-
        mental absence of numerous teeth and anodontia is a
        failure of all teeth to develop. These terms must not be
        used for unerupted teeth or those that are missing as a
        result of exfoliation or extraction (Verhaert, 2007).

               Abnormal eruption of teeth
               Eruption is sometimes delayed for weeks and occasionally
               for months (Hoffman, 2008). Familial delayed eruption
               occurs in Tibetan and Wheaten Terriers and probably also
               in other dog breeds. Delayed eruption of deciduous and
               permanent teeth has also been observed in dogs affected
               by myotonia congenita (Gracis et al., 2000). Folliculitis
               is inflammation of the follicle of a developing tooth.
               Pericoronitis is inflammation of the soft tissues surround-
               ing the crown of a partially erupted tooth. Transposition
               refers to two teeth that have exchanged position.

        Mandibular distoclusion (class 2 malocclusion) refers to an
        abnormal rostrocaudal relationship between the dental
        arches in which the lower arch occludes caudal to its
        normal position relative to the upper arch. Mandibular

             distocclusion is present on one side of the face while
             the contralateral side retains normal dental alignment.
        •    Maxillomandibular asymmetry in a side-to-side
             direction occurs when there is loss of the midline
             alignment of the maxilla and mandible.
        •    Maxillomandibular asymmetry in a dorsoventral
             direction results in an open bite, which is defined as an
             abnormal vertical space between opposing dental
             arches when the mouth is closed.


        Management of malocclusion
        Preventive orthodontics are procedures undertaken in
        anticipation of a problem developing (AVDC, 2017). It             (a)
        requires knowledge of the development of the dentition
        and maxillofacial structures, and includes the diagnostic
        procedures undertaken to predict malocclusion and the
        therapeutic procedures instituted to prevent its onset.
        Examples of preventive procedures include:

        •    Client education about timetables for exfoliation of
             deciduous teeth and eruption of permanent teeth
        •    Fibrotomy (severing of gingival fibres around a
             permanent tooth to prevent its relapse after corrective
             orthodontics)
        •    Operculectomy (surgical removal of an operculum to
             enable eruption of a permanent tooth)
        •    Extraction of a tooth that, if left, could result in the
             development of malocclusion.

            Interceptive orthodontics is concerned with the elimina-
        tion of a developing or established malocclusion. Inter-
        ceptive procedures are typically undertaken in the growing        (b)
        patient (AVDC, 2017). Examples of interceptive procedures
        include:                                                                   (a) Both mandibular canine teeth in this cat appeared

               Jaw fracture
               Traumatic jaw fractures occur after motor vehicle trauma,
               falls, kicks, gunshots and fights with other animals.
               Pathological jaw fractures are often secondary to perio-
               dontal disease, less often due to oral neoplasia, and rarely
               caused by metabolic abnormalities.


               Jaw fracture location
               A mandibular fracture is a fracture of the lower jaw
               (mandible). The line of a favourable mandibular body
               fracture runs in a rostroventral direction, resulting in a
               more stable compression of the fracture segments upon
               contraction of the masticatory muscles that close the
               mouth (Figure 5.44). The line of an unfavourable mandibu-
               lar fracture runs in a caudoventral direction, resulting in a
               more unstable separation of the fracture segments upon
               contraction of the masticatory muscles that close the
               mouth (Figure 5.45). Common sites for mandibular
               fracture in dogs are the premolar/molar region and the
               area distal to the canine tooth (Figure 5.46). Mandibular

        the lower jaw towards the side of injury, causing malocclu-
        sion. Bilateral mandibular fractures may cause a dropped
        lower jaw appearance (Reiter and Lewis, 2011).
            A maxillary fracture is a fracture of the upper jaw (maxilla
        and other facial bones). Fractures of the upper jaw are often
        multiple. Epistaxis, facial swelling, pain and asymmetry are
        the usual physical findings, with or without crepitus and
        subcutaneous emphysema (Figure 5.48). Airway obstruction
        caused by displaced bones, swelling or blood can be life-
        threatening. Cats with head trauma commonly present with
        an acute cleft palate, zygomatic arch fracture or separation
        of the temporal bone from the parietal bone; the latter may
        often go unnoticed (Figure 5.49) (Reiter and Lewis, 2011).
            Diagnostic imaging should be performed to assess
        tooth injuries and define fracture sites. Dental radiography
        is usually sufficient for rostrally located mandibular and
        maxillary fractures and fractures involving the premolar/
        molar tooth-bearing part of the mandibular body.
        Computed tomography (CT) should be employed for
        assessment of more complex oral and maxillofacial trauma
        (Reiter and Lewis, 2011).

               sionally lead to ankylosis and progressive inability to open
               the mouth (particularly in young animals). Treatment of
               ankylosis consists of condylectomy and excision of all
               associated osteophytes (Strøm et al., 2016).
                   Luxation of the TMJ is often confused with open-mouth
               jaw locking. Both conditions may present with inability to
               close the mouth, but their causes, manifestations and
               treatments differ. A diagnosis is made by means of clinical
               examination and radiography (e.g. dorsoventral view) or
               CT. Rostrodorsal luxation of the TMJ can usually be
               resolved by placing a pencil between the ipsilateral maxil-
               lary and mandibular carnassial teeth and then closing the
               mouth. However, this treatment would cause further
               trauma and pain in a patient with open-mouth jaw locking,
               which is treated by means of partial zygomectomy, partial
               coronoidectomy or a combination of both procedures
               (Reiter and Lewis, 2011). For detailed information about the        (a)

               Oral soft tissue injury
               Bite wound
               A laceration resulting from a bite comprises a tear or cut in
               the gingiva/alveolar mucosa, tongue/sublingual mucosa,
               lip skin/labial mucosa, cheek skin/buccal mucosa, palatal
               mucosa or palatine tonsil/oropharyngeal mucosa (Figure
               5.50). A chewing lesion is a mucosal or cutaneous lesion
               resulting from self-induced bite trauma on the cheek, lip,
               palate or tongue/sublingual region (Figure 5.51) (Lewis and         (b)

               Foreign body
               A penetrating oral foreign body is an object that originates
               outside the body and enters oral tissue to create deep
               and contaminated wounds in the sublingual area, palato-
               glossal fold, soft palate, palatine tonsil and tonsillar fold,
               floor of the orbit or pharyngeal wall. A retrobulbar abscess
               develops behind the globe of the eye, while a retropharyn-
               geal abscess is located behind the pharynx. Foreign
               bodies can also be caught around the tongue, sawing their
               way into the lingual frenulum, be stuck in between teeth
               (Figure 5.52), causing inflammation of the surrounding soft
               tissue, or be trapped in a salivary gland duct, resulting in
               facial swelling (Goldsworthy et al., 2013; Robinson et al.,

        fests in the pharyngeal region and a cervical sialocele in

        nate from the sublingual or mandibular salivary glands. A
        parotid sialocele presents over the lateral aspect of the
        face (Proot et al., 2016). A mucus retention cyst refers to
        an intraductal mucus accumulation with duct dilatation,
        resulting from obstruction of salivary flow (e.g. due to a
        sialolith or other foreign body). The ductal obstruction
        may lead to inflammation of the glandular tissue (Smith
        and Reiter, 2015).

        Sialadenitis
        Sialadenitis is the inflammation of a salivary gland, typi-
        cally seen in middle-aged to older dogs. The zygomatic
        gland is most often affected (Boland et al., 2013). The
        patient may present with a painful swelling in the area of
        the affected gland, exophthalmos, lymphadenopathy, diffi-
        culty opening the mouth and fever. Sialolithiasis, charac-
        terized by the presence of one or more sialoliths in the

        salivary duct or gland, may be a contributing factor.

        Sialadenosis and necrotizing
        sialometaplasia
        Sialadenosis (also called sialosis) is a non-inflammatory,
        non-neoplastic enlargement of a salivary gland. There
        are no obvious cytological or histological abnormalities.
        Necrotizing sialometaplasia (salivary gland necrosis or
        infarction) refers to the squamous metaplasia of the sali-
        vary gland ducts and lobules with ischaemic necrosis of
        the salivary gland lobules (Spangler and Culbertson, 1991).
        Both conditions occur most often in the mandibular glands
        of young adult to middle-aged, small-breed dogs (e.g.
        terriers). Both disorders have a similar history and clinical    (b)
        presentation, but it remains speculative whether sialaden-
        osis can progress to necrotizing sialometaplasia (Smith
        and Reiter, 2015). See Chapter 8 for detailed information
        about the diagnosis and treatment of these conditions.

        Salivary gland neoplasia
        Neoplasia of salivary glands is uncommon in cats and
        dogs. The mandibular salivary gland appears to be most
        often affected, with adenocarcinoma most commonly
        diagnosed (Hammer et al., 2001). Staging according to the
        tumour, node and metastasis (TNM) system will permit
        formulation of a treatment plan. Complete surgical excision
        of malignant tumours is difficult because of their invasive
        characteristics and the proximity of neural and vascular         (c)
        structures in the salivary gland region. Radiation therapy,

               lesions (Figure 5.70) (Nemec et al., 2012b; Lommer, 2013).
               Calcinosis circumscripta refers to circumscribed areas of
               mineralization characterized by deposition of calcium salts
               (e.g. in the tip of the tongue of young large-breed dogs)
               (Figure 5.71) (Tafti et al., 2005; Mouzakitis et al., 2015).
                   Craniomandibular osteopathy is a disease character-
               ized by cyclical resorption of normal bone and excessive
               replacement by immature bone along mandibular, temp-
               oral and other bone surfaces in immature and adolescent
               dogs (Padgett and Mostosky, 1986; Pettitt et al., 2012).
               Calvarial hyperostosis is a disease characterized by irreg-
               ular, progressive proliferation and thickening of the cortex
               of the bones forming the calvarium in adolescent dogs                         (a)
               (Pastor et al., 2000; McConnell et al., 2006). Fibrous
               osteodystrophy is a disease characterized by the forma-
               tion of hyperostotic bone lesions, in which deposition of
               unmineralized osteoid by hyperplastic osteoblasts and
               production of fibrous connective tissue exceed the rate of
               bone resorption; it usually develops due to primary or
               secondary hyperparathyroidism and results in softened,
               pliable and distorted bones of the face (‘rubber jaw’)
               (Reinhart et al., 2015). Periostitis ossificans refers to

                   Animals considered to be ‘healthy’ (i.e. ASA physical                                                                      6.4
               status I–II) will cope well with most anaesthetic agents
               and techniques. ‘Sick’ patients (i.e. ASA physical status                                                                   Anaesthetic

               98,036 dogs and 79,178 cats concluded the risk of anaes-
               thetic and sedation-related death was 0.05% and
               0.17%, respectively, for ASA physical status I and II
               (Brodbelt et al., 2008). Deaths increased significantly to
               1.33% and 1.40%, respectively, for ASA physical status
               III–V, hence the importance of thoroughly assessing
               health preoperatively.




               Preparation for anaesthesia
               Equipment preparation
               Anaesthesia and sedation may carry higher than normal
               risk if performed without adequate preparation. All
               anaesthesia-related equipment should be checked before
               commencing premedication. Using a checklist has been
               shown to reduce the risk of accidents related to human
               error and speed up the setting-up process (Figures 6.3
               and 6.4).


               Airway management
               Dentistry and oral surgery demand good airway manage-
               ment to prevent accidental aspiration of fluids (e.g. coolant
               water, blood, saliva) and solids (calculus, instruments,
               parts of teeth). Well fitting, secured, cuffed endotracheal
               tubes are mandatory in addition to pharyngeal packing
               (Lamata et al., 2012).
                                                                                            Endotracheal tubes
                                                                                            Cuffed tubes are preferred, as they seal the space

        Dental explorer
        The dental explorer has a slender working end that tapers
        to a sharp-pointed tip. It is designed to give maximum
        tactile sensitivity and is used in sedated or anaesthetized
        patients to:

        •   Detect softened enamel and/or dentine, which may
            indicate caries
        •   Explore the structural integrity of the tooth surface (e.g.
            tooth fractures, tooth resorption, enamel hypoplasia)
        •   Feel for the presence of subgingival and supragingival
            dental deposits
        •   Evaluate the margins of restorations and prosthodontic
            crowns
        •   Determine the presence of pulp exposure.

            The dental explorer (Figure 7.10) is held with the modi-

        Dental mirror
        Dental mirrors come in a variety of sizes and may be plain
        or magnifying (Wolf et al., 2005). Practice is required in
        order to visualize the reflected image. Condensation can be
        prevented by applying special anti-fogging solutions or by
        wiping the mirror across the oral mucosa before use (Figure
        7.17). If single-ended, the opposite blunt end of the instru-
        ment handle can also be used to evaluate for tooth mobility
        (by holding the tooth between an index finger and the
        instrument end) or for gentle percussion of teeth to assess
        for discomfort in the conscious patient. A dental mirror is
        held with the modified pen grasp technique and used to:               (a)                                   (b)

        •   Allow indirect visualization of lesions and areas of
            interest that are not approachable at the front or side of
            the mouth (e.g. the palatal/lingual/distal surfaces of
            teeth, particularly of the maxillary and mandibular
            molars in dogs)
        •   Reflect light on to and magnify areas of interest
        •   Retract the cheeks to the side, push the tongue
            medially or ventrally, and lift the soft palate dorsally or
            pull it rostroventrally
        •   Protect oral soft tissues (e.g. by placing the mirror as a
            barrier between the sublingual area and the mandibular
            cheek teeth when using power equipment on those teeth).           (c)                                   (d)

               Prophy angles, polishing cups, brushes and
               pastes
               Smoothing of tooth surfaces is achieved by using polish-
               ing paste and a prophy cup (or occasionally a soft brush)
               screwed to or snapped on a prophy angle (depending on
               the design) or latched on to a contra-angle attached to a
               low-speed handpiece (Figure 7.23). To reduce friction, the
               prophy cup should be filled with polishing paste, used for
               a few seconds on each tooth, moved continuously on the
               tooth surface and rotated at very low speed (less than
               3000 rpm) (Wolf et al., 2005). The rotating cup is pressed
               gently against the surface of the tooth, causing the edge
               of the cup to flare out and polish the tooth surface above
               and below the gingival margin. Disposable plastic prophy

               silicate (Wolf et al., 2005). They are often graded as coarse,
               medium and fine. Coarse pumice may deliberately be used
               to create scratches in the tooth surfaces in an attempt to
               increase retention of temporary bis-acryl composite
               devices (such as splints for non-invasive jaw fracture repair
               or direct inclined plane fabrication). Small containers with
               polishing paste can comfortably be held in one hand
               during polishing of the teeth (Figures 7.25 and 7.26).

        largely been replaced by other means of gingivectomy and

        Periosteal elevators
        Periosteal elevators come in various sizes and blade
        shapes (Figure 7.28). These are sharp instruments used
        to separate soft tissue from bone when raising a flap.
        Periosteal elevators are often double-ended instruments
        with one end rounded and flat, and the other end pointed                         (a)                                     (b)

        against the bone and the convex side against the soft                                       a he t o di e ent tips of a pai of poc et ma ing fo ceps

        oral surgery in veterinary patients. The broad rounded
        blade is used to raise mucoperiosteal flaps with a pushing
        stroke, while the more pointed end is used to raise the
        more delicate gingival part of a flap, utilizing a prising
        motion. Sharp and narrow-tipped (2–6 mm) periosteal
        elevators (such as Mead No. 3 or Periosteal No. EX-9M for
        middle-sized and larger dogs, and Glickman No. 24G
        or Periosteal No. EX-9 for small dogs and cats) are also
        very useful in reflecting the mucoperiosteum during perio-
        dontal flap procedures, mandibulectomies, maxillec-
        tomies and hard palate surgery (Reiter, 2013).

               Scalpel handles and blades
               Oral surgery often requires precise control of instruments,
               especially when sulcular incisions are made in and around
               teeth. For this reason scalpel handles are often held using
               a pen or modified pen grasp. Rounded scalpel handles
               allow easy rotation of the scalpel handle, which facilitates
               curved incisions around teeth. Longer handles are useful
                                                                                            (a)

               ideal for making precise incisions. Some dentists and oral
               surgeons also prefer No. 11 blades. Others prefer finer
               instruments such as Beaver ® blades and handles, which
               give excellent precision and control in more delicate pro-
               cedures (especially in cats) (Reiter, 2013).

               Thumb forceps
               Thumb forceps are used to grasp and stabilize tissue
               during a surgical procedure, especially during dissection
               and suturing. They should be able to grasp delicate tissue
               securely without traumatizing it. Thumb forceps should not
               be used to grasp needles as this may damage their tips
               (Reiter, 2013). They are held between the thumb and two or
               three additional fingers of the same hand. The tips should
               meet, and any intermeshing striations or teeth should align
               perfectly. There are many different patterns and sizes
                                                                                                        Tissue scissors. (1) Mayo scissors. (2) Metzenbaum scissors.

        suture materials used in the oral cavity may contain poly-

            Xenografts are grafts taken from other species. Bovine
        cancellous bone is occasionally used in veterinary
        dentistry. To prevent infection or graft rejection, the bone
        is heated to 1,100°C, and the material is considered to
        be osteoconductive only.


        Barrier membranes
        Membranes are an integral part of guided tissue regener-

        dontal tissues such as alveolar bone, periodontal ligament
        and cementum. Membranes are placed to avoid the rapid

        Professional dental cleaning
        Supragingival and subgingival plaque and calculus are
        removed using a combination of power scaling and hand
        scaling, followed by polishing of the cleaned tooth sur-
        faces (Operative Technique 7.1). Because of their higher
        frequency of operation, ultrasonic scalers work faster than
        sonic scalers, but both are faster than hand scaling, which
        takes considerable time and particular skill to perform. All
        methods have been shown to be effective in removing
        plaque and calculus from tooth surfaces, thereby reducing
        the bacterial load in periodontal pockets. However,
        smoother root surfaces (which are less plaque retentive)                        (a)
        are obtained with curettes than with power instruments.
            Power scaling is used in most cases for initial plaque
        and calculus removal (Niemiec, 2003). The scaler tip
        should point in an apical direction, with the last 2–3 mm in
        contact with the tooth. The long axis of the scaler tip is
        used at an angle of less than 15 degrees to the tooth
        surface. It is important to keep the scaler moving, apply
        light pressure and use copious volumes of water to cool
        the tip (Figure 7.45). The flow rate should be at least 20–30
        ml/min in the application region. The tip of the scaler
        should not be used perpendicular to the tooth surface
        because of the concentration of energy (risk of structural
        damage to the dental hard tissues) and heat (risk of pulp                       (b)
        injury). It should also not point in a coronal direction, as
        the uncooled part of the scaler could make contact with                                    napp op iate se of an lt asonic scale a ip pe pendic la
                                                                                          7.46    (arrowed) to the tooth surface risks structural damage to

        this time for small teeth (e.g. in cats) and teeth where the                   (© Dr Alexander M. Reiter)
        pulp is likely to be closer to the tooth surface (worn teeth
        and those with uncomplicated fractures). Power scalers                             Once power scaling is completed, hand scalers and
        should be used cautiously in subgingival areas because                         curettes can be used to remove any remaining supra-
        the coolant may not cool the scaler tip sufficiently, risking                  gingival and subgingival plaque and calculus in areas that
        thermal damage to the gingiva (Niemiec, 2003). Thus, the                       are not accessible to a power scaler. After irrigation of
        scaler should be kept moving and used for as short a time                      the area to remove any debris, the tooth surfaces should

        Lavage
        After scaling, root planing, gingival curettage and polishing
        are completed, the teeth and subgingival areas are rinsed
        with water from the air/water syringe to remove any
        remaining debris (Lewis and Miller, 2010). Then the tooth
        surfaces are dried with the air/water syringe, looking for
        any remaining calculus, which, once dried, will show as a
        chalky material. The tooth surfaces are also evaluated with
        a periodontal probe for smoothness. If any irregularity is
        found, the area is scaled and polished again. Finally, the
        gingival sulcus/periodontal pocket and the mouth are                           (a)                                   (b)
        rinsed with 0.12% chlorhexidine.


        Local antimicrobial therapy
        Low-dose doxycycline gel (e.g. Doxirobe ® Gel) may be
        inserted into cleaned periodontal pockets greater than 4–5
        mm (exact value depends on the size of the tooth) after
        root planing and gingival curettage (Harvey, 1998; Zetner
        and Rothmueller, 2002; Harvey, 2005). Once the gel has
        been mixed following the manufacturer’s instructions
        (Figure 7.49), it is applied via a syringe into cleaned perio-
        dontal pockets and exposed furcation areas. Adding a few                       (c)                                   (d)
        drops of cold water makes the gel more pliable, and it can
        then be gently packed deeper into areas of interest using a
        beaver-tail hand instrument so that the hardened gel is
        positioned subgingivally (Figure 7.50). Doxycycline and
        similar compounds have antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory,
        anti-collagenolytic and immunomodulatory effects. They
        have a high affinity for hydroxyapatite in bone and dental
        hard tissues, thus the delivery of the drug into the tissues
        surrounding the periodontal pocket is long-term (for weeks
        to months following application) (Hayashi et al., 1998;
        Hirasawa et al., 2000; Dennis et al., 2012). Control of perio-
        dontal disease was also accomplished after application of
        a clindamycin hydrochloride gel into cleaned periodontal                       (e)                                   (f)

        bleeding points with the blade held at a 45-degree angle
        to completely remove the pseudopocket and achieve a
        natural gingival contour; haemostasis and fine-contouring
        can then be accomplished with a bullet-shaped 12-fluted
        bur on a high-speed handpiece with water cooling (Figure
        7.54). Gingivectomy and gingivoplasty can also be per-
        formed using electrosurgical loops (Figure 7.55). At least
        2 mm of attached gingival tissue must be preserved after
        the procedure is completed. The freshly exposed tooth
        surface is scaled and polished. Bleeding from the cut
        gingival surface is controlled with gauze sponges. An             (b)
        astringent can also be applied, followed by coating with
        a layer of surface protectant (Figure 7.56).

        Frenuloplasty
        The mucosa may create folds (frenula) between the lips
        and the gingiva. Unlike the lower lip where no definite
        median mucosal fold is present, a median frenulum can
        often be noted between the upper lip and the gingiva in
        cats and dogs. A much more distinct, but unnamed
        frenulum attaches the lower lip to the gingiva on either
        side of the lower jaw in the space between the mandib-
        ular canine and the first premolar tooth (dog) or third
                                                                          (c)

               Advanced periodontal surgery
               While there are certain limitations in the cat due its delicate
               and small oral soft and hard tissues, a variety of advanced
               periodontal surgeries can be performed in the dog. These
               surgeries include laterally positioned flaps for repair of
               gingival defects, gingival and connective tissue grafting to
               halt or cover gingival recession, apically positioned flaps
               for crown lengthening and periodontal pocket reduction
               procedures, guided tissue regeneration with or without
               bone grafting, and partial tooth resection for teeth with
               severe focal alveolar bone loss. Even though it can prolong

           OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE 7.1

           Professional dental cleaning and closed
           periodontal therapy
           INDICATIONS
           Calculus and plaque accumulation; teeth with mild to moderate periodontal disease (periodontal pockets not exceeding
           4–5 mm in dogs and 1–2 mm in cats).

           POSITIONING
           Lateral recumbency.

           ASSISTANT
           Not required.

           ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT
           Diluted chlorhexidine solution; calculus removal forceps (or extraction forceps); dental mirror; power scaler (ultrasonic
           or sonic); hand scalers; hand curettes; air-driven dental unit; low-speed handpiece with prophy angle and cup;
           polishing paste; air/water syringe; periodontal probe; dental explorer.

           SURGICAL TECHNIQUE

           1       Assess the situation by performing a periodontal
                   examination as well as taking photographs and
                   radiographs.

           2       Rinse the mouth with diluted chlorhexidine
                   solution.

           3       Remove large deposits of calculus with calculus
                   removal forceps (or – with adequate practice and
                   proper, gentle technique – extraction forceps).

           4       Use a dental mirror to retract the lips and cheeks
                   laterally and the tongue medially.
                                                                                  (© Dr Alexander M. Reiter)



           5       Use a power scaler to remove supra- and subgingival plaque and calculus.
                   •      Direct the scaler tip apically (not coronally to avoid contact of the hot instrument with soft tissue), with the last
                          2–3 mm in contact with the tooth, and at an angle of less than 15 degrees (but never perpendicular) to the
                          tooth surface.
                   •      Ensure that there is copious water flow, and keep the scaler tip moving continuously over the tooth surface (do
                          not use for longer than 15 seconds continuously on any one tooth).

                  6       Use hand scalers to remove any
                          residual supragingival plaque and
                          calculus. When placing the blade
                          against the tooth, the face should be
                          at an angle of 60–80 degrees to the
                          tooth surface.
                          a. Direct the cutting edge to the
                             apical edge of the calculus, and
                             exert lateral pressure against the
                             tooth.                                 (© Dr Alexander M. Reiter)

                          b. Employ a pulling motion away from the gingival margin to remove supragingival plaque and calculus.
                          c. Use the sharp tip of the instrument to scale thin developmental grooves on the crowns.

                  7       Use hand curettes to remove any residual subgingival plaque and calculus, plane the root surface and perform
                          gingival curettage. When placing the blade against the tooth, the face should be at an angle of 60–80 degrees to
                          the tooth surface.
                          a. Carefully insert the instrument in the gingival sulcus or periodontal pocket with the back towards the inner
                             gingival surface and the face towards the tooth surface.
                          b. Advance the instrument gently apically until resistance is felt (i.e. to the bottom of the sulcus or pocket).
                          c. Engage the cutting edge on the tooth surface with a pulling action to remove subgingival plaque and calculus.
                             – Exploratory stroke: Initial assessment of the topography of the tooth surface by very lightly feeling for
                                 irregularities.
                             – Working stroke: Applying pressure against the tooth and pulling the blade vertically, horizontally
                                 or obliquely in a short, controlled motion.
                             – Root planing stroke: Longer in length with light pressure to avoid removal of excessive amounts of cementum.
                          d. Insert the tip of the curette into the periodontal pocket with the face directed against the pocket wall, and use
                             the sharp blade against the inner gingival surface to remove inflamed and infected granulation tissue.

                  8       Polish all tooth surfaces.
                          a.   Attach a prophy angle and cup to a nose cone secured on a low-speed handpiece engine.
                          b.   Fill the polishing cup with polishing paste.
                          c.   Use gentle pressure with the cup on the tooth surface at low speed and with short contact times.
                          d.   Carefully flare out the edge of the cup underneath the gingival margin to polish subgingival crown and
                               exposed root surfaces.

           9       Rinse debris and residual polishing paste from the
                   gingival sulcus or periodontal pocket with the air/water
                   syringe.

           10      Dry the tooth surfaces with the air/water syringe and
                   evaluate the root surface with a periodontal probe and
                   crown surface with a dental explorer for smoothness
                   and complete removal of dental deposits.

           11      Place low-dose doxycycline gel (when available) into
                   cleaned periodontal pockets deeper than 4–5 mm.

               PRACTICAL TIPS

               •    It is important to keep the power scaler moving, apply light pressure and use copious volumes of water to cool
                    its tip
               •    The blades of hand scalers and hand curettes must be kept sharp to be effective
               •    Avoid:
                    • Holding the tip of a power scaler perpendicular to the tooth surface
                    • Directing the tip of a power scaler coronally (otherwise there is a greater chance for the less cooled part of
                         the scaler to inadvertently contact oral mucosa)
                    • Spending more than 15 seconds on a tooth continuously with a power scaler
                    • Using a power scaler on teeth with prosthodontic crowns and in areas of restorations (use hand instruments
                         instead)
                    • Injuring the gingival attachment to the tooth when performing subgingival work
                    • Spending more than 3 seconds on a tooth continuously with a rotating polishing cup

                  2       Make an internal bevel incison slightly apical to the gingival margin and down to the alveolar bone.



                  3       Create mucoperiosteal flaps:
                          a. Modified Widman flap: Partially mobilized
                             envelope flap; no vertical incisions are
                             made and the gingival flap is not reflected
                             beyond the mucogingival junction; or
                          b. Flap beyond the mucogingival junction:
                             Requires one or two vertical (or slightly
                             diverging) releasing incisions into gingiva

                  8       Optional:
                          a. Utilize agents for root surface treatment
                             (e.g. citric acid, ethylenediamine tetra-
                             acetic acid, fluoride).
                          b. Place bone replacement materials in bone

                      PRACTICAL TIPS

                      •   Always use fresh scalpel blades when performing periodontal surgery
                      •   Use stay sutures attached to the inside (connective tissue side) of the flap when manipulating or retracting it
                      •   Plan a periodontal and radiographic re-examination under anaesthesia about 3 months following treatment
                      •   Avoid:
                          • Excessively removing cementum from root surfaces with hand curettes, as this will expose sensitive dentine
                             and possibly compromise soft tissue reattachment
                          • Removing healthy tooth-supporting bone during alveoloplasty procedures
                          • Letting inflamed granulation tissue on the inside (connective tissue side) of the flaps come into contact with
                             exposed dentine surfaces, as this could result in root resorption

           OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE 7.3

           Gingivectomy and gingivoplasty
           INDICATIONS
           Benign gingival enlargement.

           POSITIONING
           Lateral recumbency.

           ASSISTANT
           Optional.

           ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT
           In addition to that listed in Operative Technique 7.1: pocket-marking forceps; scalpel handle and blade; gingival knives;
           bullet-shaped 12-fluted bur; electrosurgical wire loops; swabs; cotton-tipped applicators; aluminium chloride; tincture
           of myrrh and benzoin.

           SURGICAL TECHNIQUE

           1      Make a series of bleeding points on the outer gingival surface to mark the base of any pseudopockets:
                  •       Insert the blunt tip of a pocket-marking forceps into the pocket and close the forceps; the right-angled,
                          pointed tip of the forceps will create a bleeding point; or
                  •       Insert a periodontal probe down to the base of the pocket and measure its depth. Remove the probe and hold
                          it on the outer gingival surface at the measured pocket depth. Then poke the blunt tip of the probe
                          perpendicularly into the gingiva to create a bleeding point.

           2      Make an external bevel incision slightly (1–2 mm) apical to the
                  bleeding points with a scalpel blade held at a 45-degree angle to
                  remove a band of excess gingiva, thus eliminating the pocket and
                  establishing a natural gingival contour; it is also possible to use loop,
                  needle or diamond-shaped electrodes in a fully rectified mode (cutting
                  and coagulating) or a bullet-shaped 12-fluted bur on a high-speed
                  handpiece with water-cooling to shave off excess free gingiva while
                  contouring the remaining attached gingiva.

                  5       Coat the cut gingival surface with a tissue protectant (tincture of myrrh and benzoin) using a cotton-
                          tipped applicator.

                      PRACTICAL TIPS

                      •   Remove the bulk of excess gingiva with a scalpel blade (gingivectomy) and then recontour the
                          gingiva (gingivoplasty) with a 12-fluted bur or an electrode
                      •   Ensure that at least 2 mm of attached gingiva is preserved after completion of the procedure
                      •   Avoid:
                          • Contact of the 12-fluted bur with the crown, as enamel damage will occur
                          • Contact of the electrode with the crown, root or alveolar bone, as thermal tissue damage and
                             delayed wound healing can occur

        mucosa rarely persist long enough to be observed, due to
        constant trauma from chewing, playing and grooming
        (Lommer, 2013a). Therefore, secondary ulcerative lesions in
        the oral cavity are relatively more common.
             To narrow the list of differential diagnoses, oral inflam-
        matory conditions are described here primarily according
        to the type of lesion they produce (i.e. ulcerative versus
        nodular lesions) rather than according to their aetiology.

        Ulcerative lesions
        Ulcers are deep, secondary lesions characterized by loss
        of tissue, and affecting both the epithelium and underlying
        connective tissue.

        Feline chronic stomatitis
        Feline chronic stomatitis is a persistent inflammatory
        disease of the oral mucosal tissues that causes significant
        discomfort and distress for the affected patient. Cats of
        any age, sex and breed may be affected, although a predi-                            (b)

        clinical information to be collected include the weight of the   the mouth, which in turns leads to decreased chewing
        patient, the size of regional lymph nodes, the presence of       activity and further plaque accumulation, thus creating a

        Canine chronic ulcerative stomatitis
        Canine chronic ulcerative stomatitis (CCUS) and chronic
        ulcerative paradental stomatitis (CUPS) are inflammatory
        oral diseases of dogs that are sometimes classified sep-
        arately (Caiafa, 2007). However, their clinical presentation,
        histological features, prognosis and treatment options are
        comparable. Aetiology, although still only partially known,
        is also probably similar. They may, therefore, just be
        expressions of the same disease, and they are discussed
        here as one pathological entity (Anderson et al., 2017).
             CCUS affects adult dogs of any breed and sex,
        although small to medium breeds such as Maltese,
        Cocker Spaniels and terriers seem to be over-represented
        (Anderson et al., 2017). An allergic hypersensitivity or          (a)                                  (b)
        intolerance to dental plaque has long been thought to be
        a key factor in the development of the disease, possibly
        similar to ST in cats (Lommer, 2013). However, a recent
        study has shown common clinical and histopathological
        features to human oral lichen planus, a chronic inflam-
        matory disorder considered to be a T-cell mediated auto-
        immune disease (Anderson et al., 2017). In dogs it is
        characterized clinically by contact mucositis, comprising
        inflammation and ulceration of the mucosa in contact with
        the surface of teeth affected by periodontitis or even
        those just showing plaque and calculus accumulation
        (Figure 8.9). In fact, most patients only show mild perio-
        dontitis (Anderson et al., 2017). The alveolar, labial and
        buccal mucosa, the palatal mucosa along the dental
        arches, and the lateral margins of the tongue adjacent to         (c)                                  (d)

        especially in the cheek area (Figure 8.12). The gingiva is
        also frequently involved (see Figure 8.9). Typically, the
        maxillary soft tissues (particularly next to the canine and
        carnassial teeth) are more commonly affected than the
        mandibular soft tissues, possibly because of a different
        degree of mucosa-to-tooth contact (see Figure 8.9).
        However, the mucosa and mucocutaneous junction labial
        to the mandibular canine teeth are also frequently
        affected. When involved, the mucocutaneous junction of
        the lips may initially lose its pigmentation. The lesions may
        then progress to frank tissue loss (i.e. loss of the labial
        papillae or even more severe lesions) (Figure 8.13).
        Intertrigo and dermatitis of the lower lip secondary to
        drooling (Figure 8.13) and regional lymphadenomegaly are
        also common findings. The lesions may appear as ulcers,
        erosions with a pseudomembranous change, or as lesions
        showing a reticular/lichenoid pattern (i.e. lace-like white
        lesions), and in some cases affect the mucosa at endent-
        ulous areas as well (Anderson et al., 2017).
             Clinical signs include depression, anorexia, inability to
        fully open the mouth, restricted yawning, drooling and            (a)                                    (b)

        planned to evaluate brushing efficiency and owner’s com-

        Radiation therapy: Mucositis is a common acute side
        effect of radiation therapy that includes the oral and peri-
        oral regions in the radiation field (Pruitt and Thrall, 2011).
        Treatment includes gentle local cleansing and rinsing
        and the prescription of antibiotic, anti-inflammatory and
        analgesic medications. The use of compounded mouth
        washes containing various percentages of local anaes-
        thetic gels (e.g. 2% lidocaine), antacids and protectants
        of the mucosa, and antihistamine drugs may also be                (a)
        recommended. Osteoradionecrosis, periodontal disease
        and xerostomia (dry mouth) may develop as late radia-
        tion effects.

        Uraemic stomatitis: This is a disorder associated with
        uraemia in animals affected by renal failure. As with other
        manifestations of uraemia, it may be considered to be an
        intoxication secondary to the combined effects of metab-
        olites retained as a result of loss of renal function. The
        oral lesions include erosions and ulcers of the oral
        mucosa and tongue that may progress to tissue necrosis,
        mucosal sloughing and haemorrhage. Clinical signs result
        from increased excretion of urea in the oral cavity, metab-
        olism of urea to ammonia compounds by bacterial
        urease, and consequent tissue damage. Xerostomia and
        clotting deficiencies related to uraemia also contribute to
        the development of oral lesions. It is necessary to control
        renal disease to achieve resolution of uraemic stomatitis.
        Supportive treatment, including antibiotic, anti-inflam-
        matory and analgesic medications, may be administered
                                                                         (b)
        to control secondary infections and oral pain.

        Canine oral eosinophilic granuloma
        Oral eosinophilic granuloma is an uncommon disease in
        dogs. As described for its feline counterpart, canine OEG
        should be thought of as a reaction pattern to a variety of
        different stimuli rather than a disease. A genetic basis is
        suspected in the Siberian Husky, German Shepherd and
        Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (van Duijn, 1995; Bredal et
        al., 1996). In non-genetically predisposed breeds, OEG is
        thought to occur as the result of local reaction or trauma
        with consequent foreign body entrapment (e.g. biting at
        bees, wasps or hornets).
             Dogs may be presented with signs of clearing the
        throat, difficulty eating and swallowing, or coughing during
        and after eating (Lommer, 2013a). The disease is charac-
        terized by single or multiple ulcerated plaques or nodules
        that are located on the lateral or ventral surface of the
        tongue, soft or hard palate, and palatoglossal folds (Figure
        8.20). Canine OEG has a similar histopathological appear-

               ing with an antiseptic solution, use of ear cleansing solution,
               etc.). Postoperative management includes pain control and
               – depending on the severity of lesions – a 30- to 60-day
               course of antimicrobial therapy (initially empirical, then
               adjusted according to culture results). Commonly used oral
               antibiotics include clindamycin (11 mg/kg q12h), metronid-
               azole (30 mg/kg q24h for 2 weeks and then tapered to 10

        Masticatory muscle myositis
        Masticatory muscle myositis (MMM) is an autoimmune
        disease affecting the temporal, masseter, and medial
        and lateral pterygoid muscles in dogs (and rarely in cats).
        It may also be called masticatory myositis, as myositis is
        already defined as muscle inflammation. Other synonyms
        used include eosinophilic myositis and atrophic myositis,
        but these terms should be avoided because they
        probably represent acute and chronic stages of a single
        disease, respectively.


        Signalment
        Dogs of any age, breed and sex can be affected. However,
        large-breed, young adult to middle-aged dogs appear to
        be most commonly affected (Gilmour et al., 1992;
        Barone and Reiter, 2011), with the German Shepherd,               (a)
        Rottweiler, Samoyed, Dobermann, and Labrador Retriever
        over-represented.


        Forms
        An acute stage (painful muscle swelling/inflammation) may
        be followed by a latent stage (apparently healthy animal)
        which is then followed by a chronic stage (muscle atrophy)
        or a recurrent acute stage. Untreated acute episodes last
        2 to 3 weeks, and relapses can occur in weeks or months.
        The chronic form may develop without the owner having
        observed acute signs (Barone and Reiter, 2011).


        History and presenting complaint
        Dogs with acute MMM have a history of decreased                   (b)
        activity, lethargy, dysphagia, reluctance to eat, weight loss,
                                                                                   Dogs with masticatory muscle myositis (MMM). (a) A

        The acutely affected dog may show fever, regional
        lymphadenomegaly, swelling of temporal and masseter              which then leads to production of antibodies against
        muscles, exophthalmos due to swelling of temporal and            muscle fibre protein (Neumann and Bilzer, 2006). The
        pterygoid muscles, inability to blink properly, ocular           autoantibodies target the unique myosin component of
        discharge, conjunctivitis and keratitis (Figure 8.28a).          type 2M fibres, resulting in muscle inflammation, necrosis

        goid muscles, and inability to open the mouth fully (Barone      penetration, ocular disease and space-occupying orbital/

        to the desired size, and the dentinal walls are flared with
        the use of progressively larger Gates Glidden drills, hand
        files or a bur with a non-cutting tip, removing any dentinal
        overhangs. After using each instrument, the area should
        be irrigated and the debris flushed out. Gates Glidden
        drills may also be used to prepare the coronal two-thirds
        of straight root canals using a step-back technique (i.e.
        tapering the canal in an apico-coronal direction using
        progressively larger drills).


        Debriding, shaping and disinfecting
        The main purposes of root canal therapy include the
        thorough debridement of the pulp cavity to completely
        remove infected, inflamed and necrotic tissues and the
        placement of a tight-seal obturation (Baugh and Wallace,
        2005). It is still controversial if debridement of the
        entire pulp chamber is necessary or if entombing some
        coronal pulp after root canal obturation and coronal
        restoration is acceptable (e.g. in an intact canine tooth). If
        the tissue contained in the pulp chamber is to be
        removed, access holes should be modified accordingly.                            lp tiss e f om a ecentl f act ed ight mandib la canine

               the canal due to not precurving the file or excessively
               forcing it into the canal. Zipping results from a flexible file
               that tends to straighten inside a curved canal, causing an
               over-enlargement of the canal along the outer side of the
               curvature and an under-preparation of the inner aspect of
               the curvature at the apical end point. Perforation into
               periapical tissues may happen due to persistent filing
               with too large an instrument or continual zipping. Trans-
               portation is the excessive removal of dentine from the
               outer wall of a curved canal in the apical segment.
               Stripping is a thinning of dentine at the inner curvature of
               the canal due to over-preparing and accidental straight-
               ening of the curved canal and can lead to perforation.

               should be inserted to the apex and its position confirmed
               radiographically to determine working length (the distance
               from a reference point on the crown to the apical stop)
               (Figure 9.11). Every single instrument thereafter is used
               similarly, placing a rubber stop along the instrument shaft
               at the same distance from the tip, measuring with an
               endodontic ruler. Files of progressively larger sizes are
               used, up to the last file that is able to reach the apex (last
               file or master apical file). A radiograph is obtained to con-
               firm the file fitting the apical portion of the root canal
               (Figure 9.11). After using each instrument, abundant irriga-

               Studies evaluating the minimum root canal size have not
               been performed in veterinary patients, but in humans it is
               recommended to enlarge the canal to a diameter of at
               least 0.35 mm (file #35) to facilitate debris removal and to
               allow adequate irrigation of the apical third (Baugh and           e
               Wallace, 2005). To simplify obturation in relatively thin root
               canals, the canal taper may be slightly increased using
               a step-back technique, with files larger than the master
               apical file set to decreasing working lengths.
                    Once the root canal has been debrided and shaped, it
               is abundantly irrigated with saline. Alternatively, 5–10 ml of
               NaOCl may be used, followed by 17% ethylenediamine
               tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) solution, which is left in place for
               about 1 minute to remove the smear layer (dentine debris
               produced during filing, coating the root canal walls and
               clogging the orifices of the dentinal tubules). NaOCl is then
               used as a final rinse or followed by a 95% ethanol rinse
               before obturation to favour drying of the root canal
               (Stevens et al., 2006). The root canal is also dried with the
               aid of paper points of appropriate sizes (Figure 9.12).
               The last paper point should be dry and white in colour. Any
               discoloration of the point’s tip may indicate the presence

               Restorative materials and defect preparation
               Any endodontic procedure should be completed with the
               placement of a well sealed restoration, which prevents
               bacterial invasion of the treated tooth. Coronal microleak-
               age can be a reason for treatment failure (Figure 9.14). A
               direct composite restoration is normally utilized, unless
               crown integrity is severely compromised by the initial
               trauma and/or the animal is used for special activities (e.g.
               police dogs), potentially requiring reconstruction of the
               lost portion of the tooth. First, residual GP and sealer in
               the pulp chamber are removed with a heated excavator
               and a bur on a high-speed or low-speed handpiece, and
               then the restoration is applied. Numerous restorative
               materials are available (Colmery, 1998). The choice should
               be based on a number of factors, including the size and
               location (e.g. occlusal versus interproximal) of the defect,
               the need for aesthetics (tooth-coloured materials may be
               preferable in certain situations, even if the cosmetic result
               is less of a concern in animals than humans), the type of                a
               endodontic procedure performed and the type of endo-
               dontic material used for root canal obturation. The most
               common restorative material used in veterinary patients is
               compactable or flowable composite in combination with
               acid etching/dentine conditioning and adhesive bonding
               (Operative Technique 9.3).

        with a failure rate of approximately 6% of treated
        roots (Kuntsi-Vaatovaara et al., 2002). Failure may also be
        caused by defective preparation or obturation, use of
        inferior materials, or misuse of dental materials. Following
        the manufacturer’s instructions is mandatory, and no
        changes in handling indications should ever be made. In
        humans, persistent intraradicular or extraradicular infec-
        tion is the major cause of endodontic failure of both well
        treated and poorly treated teeth (Siqueira, 2001).
        Therefore, every effort should be made to achieve infection
        control and prevention (i.e. use of aseptic techniques,
        thorough debridement, use of appropriate irrigants,
        adequate obturation and restoration) (Siqueira, 2001).
             Even for apparently well treated teeth, radiographic         a                                   b
        re-evaluation should be performed 3 months after root
        canal therapy, and ideally at 1 year and annually there-
        after (especially if a pre-existing periapical radiolucency
        persists at follow-up) (Kuntsi-Vaatovaara et al., 2002).
        Ideally, with time any preoperative periapical radio-
        lucency should diminish and possibly resolve, the perio-
        dontal ligament space should be visible and be of normal
        width, and any pre-existing root resorption should have
        ceased. In human dentistry, CBCT has been increasingly
        utilized to diagnose early signs of endodontic failure,
        such as apical periodontitis and root resorption, because
        of its superior sensitivity compared with intraoral radio-
        graphy (de Paula-Silva et al., 2009; Garcia de Paula-Silva
        et al., 2009; Patel, 2009).

               Management of temporomandibular joint
               conditions
               Temporomandibular joint luxation
               Trauma is the usual cause of rostrodorsal luxation of the
               TMJ, with the mandibular condyle moving rostrally and
               dorsally (Klima, 2007). This results in the lower jaw shift-
               ing laterorostrally toward the contralateral side, manifest-
               ing in an acute inability of the animal to close its mouth
               fully due to abnormal contact between the maxillary and
               mandibular teeth on the opposite side. An increased
               width of the joint space and rostral displacement of the
               mandibular condyle will be noted on a dorsoventral radio-
               graphic view (Figure 9.28). Lateral oblique views are also
               useful in establishing a diagnosis and confirming treat-
               ment success.
                                                                               a
                   Reduction of rostrodorsal TMJ luxation in cats and
               small dogs is achieved by placing a hexagonal pencil
               between the maxillary fourth premolar and mandibular first
               molar teeth on the affected side only and closing the lower
               jaw against the dowel (that functions as a fulcrum) while
               simultaneously rotating the pencil (clockwise when the lux-
               ation is on the left, counterclockwise when the luxation is
               on the right). This allows slight forward movement of the
               mandibular condyle to slide over the articular eminence
               rostrodorsal to the mandibular fossa.
                   The reduction is often unstable, and a tape muzzle for
               2 to 3 weeks may be indicated to prevent the patient from
               opening the mouth wide, thus reducing the likelihood of
               recurring displacement. A larger wooden dowel can be
               used to attempt reduction of rostrodorsal TMJ luxation in
               mid-sized and larger dogs; however, a surgical approach
                                                                               b
               should also be considered if conservative manual reduc-

               of viable tissues available for definitive repair at a later time
               (Reiter, 2012).
                   Dogs and cats shot by an arrow may present with a
               wound of unknown origin if the arrow breaks off below the
               skin or if the arrow grazes the patient. Arrowheads
               designed for hunting often have three razor-sharp trian-
               gular projections that widen further from the tip (Lewis and
               Reiter, 2011). Blindly pulling the arrow from the entrance
               wound or advancing one that has not fully exited is not
               recommended due to the risk of causing further trauma.
               Surgical dissection to the level of the arrowhead should be
               performed; once it is exposed, dissection is continued to
               expose its barbs that can be removed at the level of the                  a
               shaft to prevent further injury, prior to removing the rest of
               the arrow (Lewis and Reiter, 2011).


               Lacerations, foreign bodies and bite wounds
               Labial, buccal, lingual and palatal lacerations are debrided
               and sutured closed with a synthetic absorbable monofila-
               ment suture material. Severe tongue injury may occur
               during fights with other animals, and tongue avulsion has
               been reported due to entrapment in a paper shredder.
               Trauma to the mandibular or sublingual salivary gland
               ducts or salivary gland capsule and parenchyma may
               result in extravasation of saliva into submucosal and sub-
               cutaneous spaces, causing sublingual, pharyngeal or
               cervical sialoceles (Smith and Reiter, 2011).                             b
                   Foreign bodies tend to penetrate the oral mucosa in
               the sublingual area (Figure 9.36), palatoglossal fold, soft
               palate, tonsil, floor of the orbit, or pharyngeal wall
               (Walshaw, 2011). They could also be lodged across the
               hard palate between maxillary cheek teeth (e.g. a wooden
               stick) or get caught around the tongue and saw their way
               into the lingual frenulum (e.g. a needle with thread). Clinical
               signs depend on the location of the foreign body
               (decreased appetite and water intake, pawing at the face,
               swelling in the intermandibular or neck region, intra- and/or
               extraoral sinus tracts, drooling of clear or blood-tinged
               saliva, and retching, gagging or vomiting). Because many
               foreign bodies are not radiopaque, ultrasonography, CT
               and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are often more                       c
               helpful than radiographs in pinpointing their location

        Severe oral bleeding may be due to injury of significant
        blood vessels, bleeding dyscrasias (e.g. von Willebrand’s
        disease), lingual or palatal injury, severe inflammation or
        soft tissue trauma, oral neoplasia, and jaw fracture.
        Volume replacement is accomplished with crystalloids,
        colloids and/or blood products (Lewis and Reiter, 2011).
        The airway should be protected by placing a cuffed
        endotracheal tube to minimize the risk of aspiration of
        blood and subsequent pneumonia. Diffuse bleeding from
        nasal mucosa (e.g. after maxillectomy or palate surgery)          a
        may respond to irrigation with a mixture (0.05–0.1 ml/kg in
        cats; 0.1–0.2 ml/kg in dogs) of 0.25 ml phenylephrine 1%
        and 50 ml lidocaine 2% (Reiter, 2012). Other means of
        haemostasis are by vessel ligation, digital pressure, refrig-
        erated rinsing solutions, astringents, bone wax, cellulose
        meshes, gelatin powder/sheets, polysaccharide powder,
        collagen powder/sheets, thrombin in a gelatin matrix, fibrin
        sealants or cyanoacrylate tissue adhesives. Pressure
        bandages or temporary ligation of large supplying arteries
        is required in cases of uncontrolled bleeding that could
        lead to hypovolaemic shock.

        Management of salivary gland trauma
        Sialocele (salivary mucocele) is an accumulation of saliva
        in the subcutaneous or submucosal tissue and the result-
        ing tissue reaction to saliva. While a cyst is lined by
        epithelium, a sialocele has a non-epithelial, non-sec-
        retory lining that is composed primarily of fibroblasts and
        capillary vessels. The aetiology is not clear, but trauma
        to the salivary ducts or gland capsule and parenchyma
        has been proposed as a causative factor. The inability,
        however, to induce sialoceles by experimental duct injury
        in laboratory dogs suggests the possibility of a devel-
        opmental predisposition in some animals (Smith and
                                                                          c

           OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE 9.1

           Vital pulp therapy
           INDICATIONS
           Acute pulp exposure of teeth following crown fracture, crown reduction or defect preparation.

           POSITIONING
           Lateral, ventral or dorsal recumbency (depending on the tooth treated).

           ASSISTANT
           Needed.

           ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT
           Rubber dam and dental clamps; round carbide bur; round diamond bur; (cross-cut) fissure bur; lactated Ringer’s
           solution (or saline); sterile paper points; calcium hydroxide (CaOH) powder or mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) and sterile
           applicator; CaOH cement; glass ionomer (or zinc oxide eugenol, ZOE); polyacrylic acid; phosphoric acid; unfilled resin;
           dental composite; white stone bur.

           SURGICAL TECHNIQUE

           Approach
           Preoperative radiographs are obtained to evaluate root development, lack of complicating factors, and signs of
           endodontic or periodontal disease. Instruments and materials coming in direct contact with vital pulp must be sterile.
           The use of rubber dam and clamps (not shown below) is strongly recommended to isolate the tooth and decrease the
           chances of pulp infection.

           Surgical manipulations
           1      When indicated, and after dental scaling and polishing with pumice, perform crown reduction using a (cross-cut)
                  fissure bur on a high-speed handpiece under cooling irrigation (remember that anything coming in contact with
                  vital pulp needs to be sterile).




                     D Ma ghe ita   acis


           2      Remove 6–8 mm of coronal pulp with a
                  round carbide or round diamond bur to
                  eliminate potentially inflamed and infected
                  tissues and to provide space for the layers
                  of materials used for direct pulp capping
                  and restoration.

                   a postoperative radiograph.


               PRACTICAL TIPS

               •   Gentle irrigation with a refrigerated solution may
                   improve haemostasis
               •   Slightly moistened paper points are less likely to stick
                   to the pulp and thus will not cause a flare-up of
                   bleeding once removed
               •   In case of persistent haemorrhage, remove a few
                   more millimetres of pulp
               •   It may be advisable to treat one tooth at a time
                   (steps 1–5) to decrease the time of pulp exposure for         D Ma ghe ita   acis
                   each tooth



           POSTOPERATIVE CARE
           Dental radiographs should be obtained after 3–6 months and then yearly thereafter to ensure continued vitality of the
           pulp.

           SURGICAL TECHNIQUE

           Approach
           Preoperative radiographs are obtained to evaluate root development, lack of complicating factors, and signs of
           endodontic or periodontal disease. The procedure must be performed aseptically, possibly using a rubber dam.
           Placing a suction tip next to the access hole is recommended while rinsing the root canal, to reduce the risk of

                     PRACTICAL TIPS

                     •    One should master a standardized filing technique and cold lateral condensation before engaging in motor-
                          driven filing techniques and warm condensation methods
                     •    It may be avisable to cut and remove the distal end of each GP point as deeply as possible with a heated
                          instrument prior to inserting other points, to avoid congestion of the pulp chamber with GP and to ensure a
                          uniform obturation of the root canal (note that this is a slightly different technique compared with that shown in
                          point 16)
                     •    In multi-rooted teeth, the pulp chamber should not be forgotten in terms of filing, shaping, disinfecting and
                          restoring, as furcation canals connecting the pulp chamber with the periodontal ligament have been reported



                  POSTOPERATIVE CARE
                  Dental radiographs should be obtained after 6 months and then yearly thereafter to ensure continued periapical health
                  of the treated tooth.

                  Dental defect preparation and restoration
                  INDICATIONS
                  Restoration of a dental defect such as that created when accessing the pulp chamber during endodontic treatment.

                  POSITIONING
                  Lateral, ventral or dorsal recumbency (depending on the tooth treated).

                  ASSISTANT
                  Needed.

                  ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT
                  Appropriate burs (diamond round, carbide round and cross-cut fissure) and instruments for defect preparation
                  including materials for dentine conditioning, enamel etching and adhesive bonding; glass ionomer; dental composite;
                  and finishing burs (such as a cone-shaped white stone).

           SURGICAL TECHNIQUE

           Approach
           The restoration is placed to avoid leakage into vital pulp tissue or the pulp cavity of an endodontically treated tooth.
           Preoperative radiographs are obtained to evaluate the defect to be restored and to assess the lack of complicating
           factors. The procedure must be performed aseptically, which includes using a dental dam (not shown below).

           Surgical manipulations
           1      The crown of the tooth is scaled and polished with a glycerin-
                  free product (such as pumice powder) and then rinsed and
                  air-dried. Residual gutta-percha (GP) and endodontic sealer are
                  removed from the walls of the pulp chamber with an excavator or
                  a pear-shaped bur (which should not be used for any of the
                  successive steps to avoid GP contamination of the restorative
                  materials). The access site should be free from GP.

                          whole defect is filled or slightly overfilled. When curing, the
                          light tip is kept as close as possible to the material, and the
                          restoration should be cured from different angles.

           12      Finally, the restoration is polished with very
                   fine polishing disks, finishing rubber burs
                   and appropriate polishing paste. An extra
                   layer of unfilled resin may be applied and

                   to make the restoration surface smoother.

           Interarch splinting
           INDICATIONS
           Provision of maxillomandibular fixation for occlusal alignment and stabilization of caudal lower jaw fractures or chronic
           temporomandibular joint luxation.

           POSITIONING
           Lateral, dorsal or ventral recumbency.

           ASSISTANT
           Needed.

           ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT
           Coarse pumice; materials for acid etching and adhesive bonding; dental composite and/or bis-acryl composite; power
           tools for trimming of the splints.

           SURGICAL TECHNIQUE

           Approach
           Resin bridges are fabricated between the maxillary and mandibular canines (or other teeth) with the mouth slightly
           open but the jaws in proper occlusal alignment.

           Surgical manipulations
           1       The teeth to be involved in the splints
                   are scaled, dried and acid-etched for 15
                   seconds.

                  2       The acid and any oral debris are rinsed from the mouth.

                  3       Avoiding any contact with the etched teeth, the
                          endotracheal tube is positioned so that it emerges
                          from the mouth in the median plane.

                  4       The teeth are air-dried, and an unfilled resin is applied
                          and light-cured.

                          proper occlusal alignment with the mouth slightly
                          opened and the tips of the canine teeth slightly
                          overlapping (gap of about 8–15 mm in cats and small
                          dogs and 20–25 mm in medium to large dogs between
                          the incisal edges of the maxillary and mandibular
                          incisors). Alternatively, a twisted wire can be applied,
                          which helps keep the mandible in proper occlusion
                          and increases mechanical retention of the resin.

                          tongue to freely move in and out of the mouth.

           9       The splints are removed after 2–4 weeks (or after

               PRACTICAL TIPS

               •   Pieces of plastic straws (cut to the desired length) may be placed between opposing canine teeth into which
                   the resin material can flow
               •   Additional retention is achieved by treating the scaled tooth surface with coarse pumice (which creates tiny
                   scratches for micromechanical retention) and by applying unfilled resin to the acid-etched and dried enamel
                   surface (which improves retention, but complicates the resin’s removal)
               •   Unfilled resins should only be applied to a small area of the surface of the crown and not to the tip, to reduce
                   the risk of crown fracture at the time of splint removal
               •   Providing the pet owner with extraction forceps allows breakage of the splints in case of sudden respiratory
                   compromise (e.g. after aspiration of food matter)


           POSTOPERATIVE CARE
           Elizabethan collar as needed; soft food until splint removal; no hard toys or treats.

                  SURGICAL TECHNIQUE

                  Approach
                  An orthopaedic wire is brought around both mandibles immediately distal to the mandibular canine teeth, leaving the
                  least amount of soft tissue between the wire and bone surface, and twisted below the chin. Images shown here were
                  obtained from a cadaver specimen. In a clinical patient, the hair should be adequately clipped, the skin prepared for
                  aseptic surgery, and the surgical site draped.

                  Surgical manipulations

           7       The twisted wire is trimmed (left), and the 0.5 to 1 cm
                   portion of twisted wire is bent caudally so that the skin
                   covers it (one nylon suture may be placed near the
                   most caudal aspect of the incision) (right). If the twisted
                   wire is not bent, a protective covering (made of resin)
                   should be placed over the cut end of the twisted wire
                   to prevent the exposed portion from catching on fabric
                   and/or causing laceration.




                                                                                  D   le ande M   eite




           8       A radiograph is obtained to confirm proper alignment
                   of the separation.

           9       The wire is removed after about 4 weeks, following
                   radiographic confirmation of healing, by cutting it
                   intraorally and straightening its ends, incising the
                   skin at the chin, grasping the twisted wire and pulling
                   it out.




                                                                                  D   le ande M   eite



           10      The intraoral and skin wounds are rinsed and left to granulate and epithelialize.


               PRACTICAL TIP

               •   When bending twisted wire, the wire may loosen or become fatigued, especially if the bend is created where
                   the first twist occurs. Creating the bend further away from the junction between the loop and twisted wire may

                  OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE 9.6

                  Interdental wiring and splinting
                  INDICATIONS
                  Upper and lower jaw fractures with sufficient numbers of teeth available for anchorage of wire and resin.

                  POSITIONING
                  Lateral, ventral or dorsal recumbency.

                  ASSISTANT
                  May be needed.

                  ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT
                  Hypodermic needle; orthopaedic wire; coarse pumice; materials for acid etching and adhesive bonding; dental
                  composite; bis-acryl composite; pencil; power tools for trimming and shaping of the splint.

                  SURGICAL TECHNIQUE

                  Approach
                  A wire-reinforced interdental splint is fabricated on teeth within a dental arch.

                  Surgical manipulations
                  1       Scale and polish the teeth to be involved in the splint.


                  2       Use orthopaedic wire (22–26 G in dogs and 24–28 G in cats)
                          and place it intragingivally below the dental bulge, where
                          possible (via a hypodermic needle that is inserted through
                          gingiva between teeth).




                                                                                                 D   le ande M   eite




                  3       Interdental wiring:
                          a. Stout multiple-loop technique (imagine a fracture between the right mandibular third and fourth premolar
                             teeth):
                             – Start caudally and, as you proceed rostrally, include two or more teeth in each fracture segment
                             – Make wire loops lingually (or labially/buccally, but be aware of occlusion) for lower jaw fractures and
                                 labially/buccally for upper jaw fractures
                             – Insert an appropriately sized hypodermic needle through the gingiva in between teeth, and then guide a
                                 fitting wire through the needle opening
                             – Leave the ‘working’ wire (the one used to make loops) longer than the ‘static’ wire (the one threaded
                                 through the loops once they have been created)
                             – Hand twist the wire ends in edentulous areas (if present), and then continue the loop technique
                             – Once sufficient teeth have been included in the wiring procedure, twist the rostral wire ends and
                                 interdental loops in a pull-and-twist fashion (slight ventral pull for the lower jaw and dorsal pull for the
                                 upper jaw)
                             – Trim the twisted rostral wire end until a 5–7 mm knot remains which is bent towards the tooth without
                                 interfering with occlusion
                             – Curve the twisted loops interdentally without interfering with occlusion.

                   b. Modified Risdon technique (imagine several fractures between the stable right maxillary fourth premolar tooth
                      and left maxillary canine tooth):
                      – Start caudally and secure a wire around a tooth with sufficient periodontal attachment (intragingivally
                         distally and – if possible – also mesially)
                      – Hand twist the two equally long wire ends along the dental arch (lingually for the lower jaw and labially/
                         buccally for the upper jaw) and anchor them to a tooth rostral to the bone fracture(s); one can also cross
                         towards the other side or have twisted wires meet rostrally from either side
                      – Use a strong synthetic absorbable monofilament suture material and secure the twisted wire to gingiva at
                         several locations in between the two anchor teeth, which effectively aligns displaced fracture segments.

                          the teeth (ensuring that their crowns are not re-contaminated
                          with blood, saliva or other fluids).

                  6       Apply bis-acryl composite primarily to the lingual surface of
                          mandibular teeth and the labial/buccal surface of maxillary
                          teeth (leave the tips of the crowns uncovered to ease splint
                          removal upon healing).

                  When possible, the composite resin should be applied at a
                  distance from the gingiva. If not possible, it should not extend
                  beyond the mucogingival junction.
                                                                                             D   le ande M    eite

           14      Remove the splint after 4–8 weeks (or after radiographic confirmation of healing) by interdental sectioning with a
                   bur and detaching the material in segments, using an extraction or band remover forceps and a dental elevator;
                   then clean and polish the teeth.

              PRACTICAL TIPS

              •    Pharyngotomy or transmylohyoid orotracheal intubation may be used to allow intraoperative control of
                   occlusion without the need for extubation of the patient during the procedure
              •    Wire slippage from the teeth can be prevented by:
                   • Placing the wire intragingivally between the teeth and below the dental bulge
                   • Placing drops of dental composite at the gingival third of the mesial and distal crown surfaces of the teeth
                        to create overhangs that allow the wire to remain in position (particularly useful in cats)
              •    Additional retention is achieved by:
                   • Treating the scaled tooth surface with coarse pumice (which creates tiny scratches for micromechanical
                        retention)
                   • Applying unfilled resin to the acid etched and dried enamel surface (which improves micromechanical
                        retention) at select areas with or without also applying dental composite
                   • Leaving the twisted interdental loop ends intact, thus allowing resin material to flow into them
              •    Coloured resin aids in visualization during splint application and removal
              •    Before complete removal, it is recommended to section the splint at the level of the bone fracture lines, and
                   gently test the mandibular/maxillary segment mobility
              •    If stabilization is satisfactory, then the entire splint is removed. Otherwise, the splint is repaired by simply
                   adding new bis-acryl composite resin at the sectioned sites and maintained in place for a longer time. Any
                   fracture of the resin happening during the healing period may be repaired in similar fashion


           POSTOPERATIVE CARE
           Elizabethan collar as needed; soft food until splint removal, with no hard toys or treats; gingival inflammation from splint
           and wire trauma usually subsides within a few days after splint removal.

               cclusion), we are referring to a mesocephalic head. The
               Nomenclature Committee of the American Veterinary
               Dental College (AVDC) has reviewed malocclusion and
               its various forms in order to clarify and standardize
               the diverse conditions encompassed under this term
               (AVDC, 2015).


               Normal occlusion (orthocclusion)
               A closed mouth inspection is necessary to fully evaluate
               dental occlusion. In mesocephalic and dolichocephalic
               dogs, the maxillary incisor teeth are positioned labial to
               the corresponding mandibular incisor teeth (Figure 10.1;
               see Chapter 2). The incisal tips of the mandibular incisor
               teeth contact the cingula of the maxillary incisor teeth.
               The mandibular canine tooth is inclined labially and                                                         (a)
               bisects the interproximal (interdental) space between
               the opposing maxillary third incisor and canine teeth. The
               maxillary premolar teeth do not contact the mandibular
               premolar teeth. The crown cusps of the mandibular
               premolar teeth are positioned slightly lingual to the arch
               formed by the maxillary premolar teeth. The cusps of the
               mandibular premolar teeth bisect the interproximal (inter-
               dental) spaces mesial to the corresponding maxillary
               premolar teeth. The mesial cusp of the maxillary fourth
               premolar tooth is positioned buccal to the space between
               the mandibular fourth premolar and first molar teeth.

        Malocclusion is a misalignment of the teeth and/or jaws. It
        can be atraumatic, cause discomfort or result in severe
        pathology. The cause may be genetic, developmental or
        accidental (Lobprise et al., 1999; Gracis et al., 2000;
        Sarkiala-Kessel, 2001). It can involve the teeth (size, shape
        and position) and/or the jaws (size, shape and relation to
        each other). Head shape, jaw length, tooth size and posi-
        tion are inherited and characteristic of each breed.

        Dental malocclusion (neutrocclusion or class 1 maloc-
        clusion): Dental malocclusion refers to malposition of one
        or more teeth regardless of the presence or absence of a                     (a)
        normal rostrocaudal relationship of the upper and lower
        dental arches; the terminology used to describe maloc-
        clusion is defined in Figure 10.3.

        Symmetrical skeletal malocclusion: Mandibular distoc-
        clusion (class 2 malocclusion) refers to an abnormal
        rostrocaudal relationship between the dental arches in
        which the lower dental arch occludes caudal to its normal
        position relative to the upper dental arch (Figure 10.4).                    (b)
           Mandibular mesiocclusion (class 3 malocclusion) refers
        to an abnormal rostrocaudal relationship between the                                 (a) Front and (b) lateral view of a dog with a class 2

               Linguoversion of mandibular canine teeth
               Breeds with narrow lower jaws such as poodles seem to
               be over-represented. The lingual displacement of the
               permanent mandibular canine teeth is often associated
               with persistence of the deciduous canine teeth (Bannon
               and Baker, 2008). Linguoversion may be the only abnor-
               mality (Figure 10.12) or it may be part of a class 2 maloc-
               clusion where the mandibular canine teeth become
               ‘trapped’ palatal or distal to the maxillary canine teeth.
               The aetiology affects the ethics of treatment, but not the                     (a)
               treatment itself. The linguoverted mandibular canine teeth
               may impact the mucosa in the interproximal space
               between the maxillary third incisor and canine teeth or
               the palate, creating a soft tissue defect or, in the worst
               case scenario, an oronasal fistula.

               Treatment: The treatment includes extraction, crown
               reduction with endodontic therapy, or corrective ortho-
               dontic movement of the affected tooth. Extraction is rarely
               recommended, as it is traumatic and can lead to complica-
               tions such as mandibular fracture, alveolar osteitis, osteo-
               myelitis, haemorrhage, lingual ptosis and loss of defensive
               capacity (Bannon and Baker, 2008). Crown reduction with
               vital pulp therapy is a viable option that has the advantage
               of sparing the gingival third of the crown and supporting
               root and being performed in one anaesthetic session
               (Figure 10.13) (Legendre, 1994a). This technique preserves
               function and vitality of the tooth, which continues to
               provide support for the tongue. A major disadvantage
               includes the risk of introduction of pulpal infection and
               inflammation; thus, some veterinary dentists prefer stand-
                                                                                              (b)
               ard root canal therapy over vital pulp therapy in mature
               patients with closed root apices (Greenfield, 2011).
               Radiographic follow-ups are necessary to monitor the
               success of this procedure.
                   Corrective orthodontics may involve one of several
               techniques, such as rubber ball therapy, W-wire, expan-
               sion screw, composite resin inclined plane, composite
               resin telescopic inclined plane, and cast metal telescopic
               inclined plane (Oakes and Beard, 1992; Pavlica and
               Cestnik, 1995; Wiggs and Lobprise, 1997; Verhaert, 1999).
               The rubber ball, being a removable appliance, is the                           (c)
               simplest. Unfortunately, it is reserved for cases presenting
                                                                                                        (a) Linguoversion of mandibular canine teeth (*) in a dog with

               Treatment: Extraction of the affected tooth is a treatment
               option; however, this may lead to entrapment of the upper
               lip by the mandibular canine tooth. If the maxillary canine
               tooth is not in the direct path of the mandibular
               canine tooth, crown reduction with vital pulp therapy of
               the mandibular tooth can be performed. Active ortho-
               dontic movement usually has a superior outcome (Figure
               10.18), thus often remaining the treatment of choice

                   In rostral crossbite one or more mandibular incisor
               teeth are labial to the opposing maxillary incisor teeth

               ciated with class 3 malocclusion and is considered normal
               or acceptable in most brachycephalic breeds. If the upper
               jaw is short or the lower jaw too long, the mandibular
               incisor teeth occlude labial to the maxillary incisor teeth.
               Less frequently, it is diagnosed in a patient with neutroc-
               clusion (class 1 malocclusion). The crossbite may cause
               traumatic contact between the teeth and/or with the oppo-
               site soft tissues. The maxillary incisor teeth may also
               contact the mandibular incisor teeth or the opposing oral
               mucosa upon closing of the mouth. The mandibular canine
               teeth may also contact the maxillary second or third
               incisor teeth. Repeated trauma may result in tooth attrition,                   Rostral crossbite in a dog involving the right mandibular

        other breeds. The complications of dentinogenesis imper-
        fecta are difficult to manage, and fractured teeth should
        be treated by extraction.


        Regional odontodysplasia
        Regional odontodysplasia is a very rare dental anomaly
        involving both deciduous and permanent teeth, so far only
        described in one young cat (Hoffman, 2008). In humans, it
        usually affects teeth in only one jaw quadrant. Salient signs
        include soft discoloured teeth, gingivitis, swelling or
        abscess. Enamel and dentine are hypomineralized and
        hypoplastic, giving the affected teeth a ghostly appearance
        on radiographs. The aetiology is unknown, and recommen-
        dations are to extract all affected and unerupted teeth.

        Odontoblastic dysplasia
        Odontoblastic dysplasia, also known as dentine dysplasia
        type III, is another rare condition with only one report in the
        veterinary literature (Smithson et al., 2010). The name
        comes from the human literature where cases are linked to
        an autosomal dominant trait. It is difficult to speculate
        about an exact cause of the disease. Upon presentation,                        De elopmentall missing mandib la thi d inciso and ﬁ st

        appearance. On radiographs there is partial obliteration of
        the pulp chamber, and the density of contrast is poor. The
        root canals are so irregular that any needed endodontic
        treatment carries a poor prognosis.

        Size abnormalities of teeth
        Macrodontia refers to teeth larger than normal. Micro-
        dontia refers to teeth smaller than normal. Both conditions
        are rarely reported. They are of limited clinical importance
        except perhaps when macrodont teeth result in crowding,
        correction of which requires extraction.

        Numerical abnormalities of teeth
        Anodontia refers to the failure of all teeth to develop. This
        is often hereditary and very rare in both dogs and cats
        (Vieira et al., 2009).
            Hypodontia refers to the developmental absence of a                         pe dontia in a dog he e a e ﬁ e ight ma illa inciso and

                  OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE 10.1

                  Obtaining a full-mouth impression, bite registration
                  and creating stone models
                  INDICATIONS
                  Full-mouth impression and bite registration are necessary to create stone models. The models can be used as a
                  preoperative database or to build an appliance.

                  POSITIONING
                  Dorsal and ventral recumbency.

                  ASSISTANT
                  Needed.

                  ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT
                  Impression trays; alginate; water; flexible plastic bowl; spatula; boxing wax; rope wax; bandage tape; slightly damped
                  paper towels; baseplate wax or polyvinyl siloxane; dental stone type III or IV; dental laboratory knife; power trimmer,
                  plaster cutter or laboratory bur.

                  TECHNIQUES

                  Full-mouth impression
                  1       Scale, polish, rinse and dry the teeth.

                  2       Select the appropriately sized tray (there
                          should be at least 5 mm of space between
                          the teeth and the edge of the tray, which
                          must have holes, otherwise a tray adhesive
                          will need to be used).

                                                                           (© Dr Alexander M. Reiter)




                  3       Pre-measure the amount of alginate impression material and water to be used; follow the manufacturer’s
                          instructions (polyvinyl siloxane could also be used, but alginate is less expensive and gives adequate results).

           4      Pour the cold water on to the
                  powder in the flexible plastic bowl
                  and start mixing vigorously with a
                  spatula, working the mix against
                  the walls of the bowl to minimize
                  air bubble formation. As soon as
                  the mix is homogenous, transfer it
                  to the tray.

           5      Seat the tray on the teeth of the upper or lower
                  jaw, making sure that the lips and tongue are
                  not in the way when taking the impression.




                                                                               (© Dr Alexander M. Reiter)




           6      Wait until the alginate is set. Then carefully pull the tray off of the teeth. Inspect the impression for voids, and if
                  necessary take a new impression. Clean any debris from the impression, trim any redundant material, wrap it in a
                  slightly damped paper towel (to prevent dehydration), and set aside.




                  (© Dr Alexander M. Reiter)




           7      Repeat the process for the opposite jaw.

           Bite registration
           1      Soften a sheet of baseplate wax under warm water (a roll of polyvinyl siloxane wide and long enough to include
                  incisor and canine teeth can be used instead).

           2      Fold it to create a double-layered sheet, extubate the patient (or detach the endotracheal (ET) tube from the
                  anaesthesia machine, deflate its cuff, and carefully insert the tube further down the trachea) and roll the tongue to
                  the back of the mouth just enough to allow complete closure of the mouth, but carefully preventing obstruction of
                  the larynx.

                  ➜ OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE 10.1 CONTINUED


                  3       Place the sheet (or roll) in between the incisor and canine teeth and close the mouth tightly enough to imprint the
                          sheet (or polyvinyl siloxane roll).

                          (© Dr Alexander M. Reiter)


                  4       Open the mouth, remove the sheet (or roll), retrieve the tongue, re-intubate (or reposition the endotracheal tube),
                          inflate the ET tube cuff, and reattach the tube to the anaesthesia machine. The imprinted sheet or roll will allow
                          the dental laboratory technician to properly align the stone models produced of the upper and lower jaws.

                  Stone model fabrication
                  1       If using alginate impression material, models have to be poured within 30 minutes of taking the impressions. If
                          using polyvinyl siloxane, models may be poured within 14 days without seeing any significant shrinkage. Use a
                          dental stone type III (moderate strength) or type III (high strength) gypsum material. Types I and II are not strong
                          enough.

                  2       Cover the dental vibrator with a plastic bag to protect it from being soiled. Add water to dental stone powder in a
                          flexible plastic bowl (follow the manufacturer’s instructions) and mix it with a spatula.




                          (© Dr Alexander M. Reiter)




                  3       Place the bowl on the dental vibrator to
                          eliminate air bubbles introduced into the mix
                          during the mixing process.




                                                                              (© Dr Alexander M. Reiter)

           4      Wet the impression such that the dental indents are slightly filled with water.

           5      Place the impression on the vibrator on an incline. With the help of a small spatula, add a small amount of stone at
                  the caudal end of the impression and let it run down into the dental indents, displacing the water in the process
                  (without water, the stone is more likely to trap air, creating bubble defects in the model).

           6      When all the dental indents are coated with stone, pour the surplus water out.

           7      Place boxing wax secured with bandage tape around the tray and impression. Build up the base of the model
                  with additional dental stone. Leave undisturbed until dry.

           8      From 4 to 6 hours later, remove the trays from the impression materials. Incise the impression material by making
                  numerous cross-cuts. Remove the sections gently, one at a time to prevent damage to the model.

                  1       The canine and other selected teeth (e.g. incisors and rostral premolars), depending on the size of the inclined
                          plane and direction of tooth movement, are cleaned, etched, rinsed and dried.
                          a. Drops of dental composite may be placed and an orthopaedic wire (24 G) secured between the canine and

           2      A self-curing composite resin is used to create inclined planes extending from where the tips of the mandibular
                  canine teeth contact the hard palate mucosa, two-thirds of the way up the crowns of the maxillary canine teeth, to
                  where they should normally be. The inclined planes incorporate several incisor teeth and/or rostral premolar teeth
                  for added stability. The deposition of composite resin can be controlled by using utility wax to delineate the areas
                  to be built up.

           3      The appliance is trimmed, shaped and smoothed. The inclined surfaces need to be as smooth as possible and
                  should follow a minimum of a 45-degree angle with the surface of the palate.

                  Active orthodontic appliance with brackets,
                  buttons or ligature wires and elastic chain
                  INDICATIONS
                  One of the most common indications for the use of active orthodontic appliances with brackets, buttons or hooks,
                  wires and elastic chains is the treatment of a mesioverted maxillary canine tooth. The goal is to pull the displaced
                  canine tooth distally.

                  POSITIONING
                  Lateral recumbency.

                  ASSISTANT
                  Needed.

                  ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT
                  Metal brackets or buttons; plastic buttons; ligature wire; wire cutter; 37% phosphoric acid etching gel; dental brush;
                  unfilled resin; light-curing gun; light-cured dental composite; self-curing bis-acryl composite; shaping composite
                  instruments; trimming burs; elastic chain (continuous filament pattern); rope wax to cover areas that could cause
                  discomfort upon contact.

                  TECHNIQUE

                  1       The displaced maxillary canine tooth and the anchor teeth are scaled and polished with pumice,
                          then rinsed, etched, rinsed again and dried.




                                                                                                                                          277

          2       Various designs of anchorage are possible for the movement of the canine tooth, including a ‘snowman’, custom-
                  made composite button, wire-reinforced resin hook, metal button or plastic button.

           3      An anchorage unit is created by connecting the maxillary fourth premolar to the first molar teeth (dog) or the
                  maxillary third premolar to the fourth premolar teeth (cat). This is achieved using metal brackets, metal or plastic
                  buttons, and/or custom-made composite buttons that are connected with each other by a twisted ligature wire
                  (the twisted wire end may then also be used as a hook that is covered with some resin).




                  (© Dr Alexander M. Reiter)



           4      The resting length of the chain between the anchorage unit and the anchorage device on the canine tooth is
                  measured in holes. The chain should not be reduced to less than 75% of its resting length when stretched
                  between the anchorage unit and the anchorage device on the canine tooth (e.g. if the resting length is 10 holes,
                  then the chain should not be stretched to fewer than eight holes).




                                               (© Dr Alexander M. Reiter)



           5      The chain is changed every 10–14 days. In most cases, the movement is completed in 6–10 weeks. It may be wise
                  to leave a ‘neutral’ chain as a retainer in place for several more weeks or months to avoid movement of the treated
                  tooth to its original position.

          6       Occasionally, the mandibular canine tooth gets tipped labially while the
                  maxillary canine tooth moves distally. If the mandibular canine tooth does
                  not relapse into its original position, a second appliance is constructed
                  to tip the tooth distolingually.

        illectomy (Esplin, 2008). Oral MM has a variable metastatic
        rate, depending on site, size and biological behaviour of
        the individual tumour. The authors have seen a great
        degree of variation in the aggressiveness of MM and
        survival times of affected patients.


        Squamous cell carcinoma
        Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the most common oral
        and maxillofacial tumour in cats and the second most
        common malignant tumour of the mouth in dogs. It usually
        has the appearance of a pink or red ulcerated mass that
        may bleed very easily (Figures 11.4, 11.5 and 11.6). SCC
        may be evident as ulceration of the soft tissues of the
        upper or lower jaw, with no evidence of an overt mass.
        Occasionally, cats or dogs with SCC will present with the
        clinical finding of a loose tooth or teeth, which may be
        mistaken for periodontal disease. Risk factors in cats may
        include use of flea collars and eating canned tuna and
        canned cat food. Exposure to environmental tobacco
        smoke increased the risk for having SCC by a factor of two                             Squamous cell carcinoma of the left mandible in a 7-year-old

        The adenocarcinoma is of epithelial origin, deriving from
        glandular tissue of either the oral cavity, nasal cavity or
        salivary gland duct tissue (major or accessory). The
        haemangiosarcoma is a tumour of vascular endothelial
        origin characterized by extensive metastasis and has
        been reported in the gingiva, tongue and hard palate. The
        lymphosarcoma, also known as lymphoma, is a tumour
        defined by a proliferation of lymphocytes within solid
        organs, such as the lymph nodes and tonsils, or the skin,
        nasal cavity, and mouth. The rhabdomyosarcoma origi-
        nates from skeletal muscle (such as in the tongue) or
        embryonic mesenchymal cells. An anaplastic neoplasm is
        a tumour whose cells are generally undifferentiated
        and pleomorphic (displaying variability in size, shape and
        pattern of cells and/or their nuclei). An undifferentiated
        neoplasm is a tumour whose cells are generally immature
        and lack distinctive features of a particular tissue type.

            (small punch, needle core) may provide only very small

            tonsillar and palatal masses) may require prompt
            excision, prior to obtaining a histopathological
            diagnosis. A final plan is then made once
            histopathology is available.


        Clinical examination of the regional lymph nodes
        Regional lymph nodes (parotid, mandibular and medial
        retropharyngeal) are palpated to assess consistency, size
        and mobility. Lymph node enlargement may be the first
        visible sign associated with the oral mass, especially in the
        case of tonsillar SCC; however, lymph nodes affected by
        metastasis are not always enlarged (Williams and Packer,
        2003). Medial retropharyngeal lymph node enlargement can
        be difficult to discern because this lymph node is deeply
        seated in the neck, caudomedial to the mandibular salivary        (a)
        gland, resulting in lateral displacement of the salivary gland
        that must not be confused with the node itself. From the
        mandibular lymph nodes, lymph may flow to the ipsilateral
        medial retropharyngeal lymph node, or along anastomotic
        connections to the contralateral medial retropharyngeal
        node (Belz and Heath, 1995). During the staging process,
        regional lymph nodes should also be aspirated when
        possible, since palpation is known to be neither sensitive
        nor specific in detecting regional lymph node metastasis
        (Williams and Packer, 2003). While fine-needle aspiration of
        the mandibular lymph nodes is easily accomplished in most
        dogs and cats, aspirating the parotid node is difficult or
        impossible if it is not enlarged. Medial retropharyngeal
        lymph nodes may be aspirated under sedation or anaes-
        thesia by CT or ultrasound guidance (Figure 11.16).

           OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE 11.1

           Unilateral rostral maxillectomy
           INDICATIONS
           Unilateral rostral maxillectomy may be chosen as a curative-intent surgery for small, lateralized masses where
           diagnostic imaging and histotype suggest a unilateral approach to be sufficient.

           POSITIONING
           Lateral or dorsal recumbency.

           ASSISTANT
           Necessary.

           ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT
           High-speed dental drill; cross-cut fissure surgical length bur; small round carbide bur; periosteal elevators of various
           sizes; No. 15 scalpel blades; winged dental elevators; Seldin elevator; large round diamond bur; cooling solutions.

           SURGICAL TECHNIQUE

           Approach
           Gingiva, alveolar, labial and palatal mucosa, bone, teeth ± nasal conchae are removed en bloc from the rostral upper
           jaw with an intraoral approach to allow for removal of the tumour with clean margins. Images shown in this operative
           technique were obtained from a cadaver specimen. In a clinical patient, the hair should be adequately clipped, the skin
           prepared for aseptic surgery, and the surgical site draped.

           Surgical manipulations
           1      Margins are pre-measured, and a sterile marking pen is used to guide the line of cut. The arch of cut is
                  semicircular on the labial and palatal aspects of the gingival mass.

                  2       A No. 15 scalpel blade is used to incise through
                          gingiva, alveolar and labial mucosa, and submucosa of
                          the rostrolateral upper jaw to expose the bone. Edges
                          of the incised soft tissues may be lifted with a
                          periosteal elevator, and the soft tissues retracted with
                          1–2 sutures or an appropriate instrument prior to
                          performing osteotomy.




                                                                                          (© John R. Lewis)




                  3       A cross-cut fissure surgical length bur is used to
                          perform osteotomy on the labial surface, full-thickness
                          through the root of the canine tooth and a less deep
                          score line elsewhere. Sterile saline or lactated Ringer’s
                          solution is used to cool the bur. There is potential risk
                          of tumour invasion along the periodontal ligament
                          space. Thus, the entire tooth is ideally removed in one
                          piece together with a malignant tumour. However, it
                          may be decided on a case-by-case basis whether the
                          piece resected should contain entire teeth or one can
                          cut through teeth at sufficient distance from the tumour
                          margins.




                                                                                          (© John R. Lewis)




                  4       The palatal mucosa is incised with a No. 15 blade and
                          is lifted and retracted to expose the bone. Significant
                          bleeding will occur from the diffuse venous plexus of
                          the palatal soft tissues. Digital pressure over the major
                          palatine artery caudal to the incision will decrease
                          blood loss. Significantly bleeding vessels may be
                          ligated. Avoid use of electrosurgery, radiosurgery or
                          laser on cut edges of mucosa.

           6      A winged dental elevator or Seldin elevator is placed
                  in the score line and the piece is lifted en bloc from
                  the surgery site by breaking any remaining bony
                  attachments. If the piece is still too attached to
                  remove, the score lines are made deeper until it can
                  be gently removed. Any vessels attached to the
                  dislodged piece are ligated with absorbable
                  monofilament suture material and transected.

           OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE 11.2

           Mandibular rim excision (dorsal marginal
           mandibulectomy)
           INDICATIONS
           Mandibular rim excision, also known as dorsal marginal mandibulectomy, is a procedure reserved for small, dorsally
           located tumours of the lower jaw that require 1 cm or less of normal tissue margins for a surgical cure. The size of the
           patient plays a role in determining if this technique will result in a functional mandible or one that will be prone to future
           jaw fracture due to minimal remaining bone. In small patients, a segmental mandibulectomy may be advisable rather
           than a mandibular rim excision.

           POSITIONING
           Lateral recumbency.

           ASSISTANT
           Optional.

           ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT
           High-speed dental drill; cross-cut fissure surgical length bur; small round carbide bur; periosteal elevators of varied
           sizes; No. 15 scalpel blades; winged dental elevators; Seldin elevator; large round diamond bur; cooling solutions.

           SURGICAL TECHNIQUE

           Approach
           Gingiva, alveolar and buccal mucosa, submucosal tissue, teeth and bone are removed from the dorsal aspect of the
           mandible with an intraoral semilunar incision to allow for removal of the tumour with clean margins. Most images shown
           in this operative technique were obtained from a cadaver specimen; some are from a clinical patient. In a clinical
           patient, the hair should be adequately clipped, the skin prepared for aseptic surgery, and the surgical site draped.

           Surgical manipulations
           1      Margins of 1 cm are measured, and a sterile marking pen is used to guide the line of cut. The arch of cut is
                  semilunar and gradual rather than rectangular or steep. A No. 15 scalpel blade is used to incise gingiva, alveolar
                  and buccal mucosa, and submucosa of the mandibular body to expose the underlying bone, both on the buccal
                  and the lingual sides.

                          periosteal elevator, and sutures can be placed to retract the
                          soft tissue dorsally prior to performing the osteotomy.

                          mandible, beginning with full-thickness cuts on the
                          rostrodorsal and caudodorsal surfaces of the mandible.
                          Sterile saline or lactated Ringer’s solution is used to cool
                          the bur.

                  4       As the bur follows the arch ventrally, a partial-thickness score
                          line is created to match up with the full-thickness bone cuts
                          rostrally and caudally. Care should be taken to avoid damage
                          to the adjacent soft tissues and the inferior alveolar
                          neurovascular bundle in the mandibular canal.

                  5       A winged dental elevator or Seldin elevator is placed in the
                          score line, and the piece is carefully lifted (broken away) en
                          bloc from the remaining intact mandible. If the piece is still
                          too attached to remove, the score lines are made deeper
                          until the piece can be gently detached from the mandible
                          while avoiding an iatrogenic mandibular body fracture.

           The gingiva, alveolar and buccal mucosa and
                submucosal tissues are undermined to allow for a

               PRACTICAL TIPS

               •   The bur will damage teeth adjacent to the line of osteotomy unless care is taken to avoid the roots and crowns
               •   Due to the close spacing of the teeth, cuts are best made through the crown of a tooth rather than attempting
                   to cut between the crowns of teeth
               •   Residual pieces of crown and root structure are removed prior to closure



           POSTOPERATIVE CARE
           Soft food for 2 weeks. Expect some serosanguineous oral discharge for a few days postoperatively. If only the ventral
           mandibular cortex remains in place, prohibit large hard toys indefinitely to avoid fracture of the remaining portion of the
           mandibular body.

                  Bilateral rostral mandibulectomy is indicated for rostral masses of the lower jaw in which a surgical cure would be
                  achieved by removal en bloc of a portion of the rostral mandibles containing incisors, canines and, if necessary, rostral
                  premolar teeth and surrounding bone and soft tissue.

                  SURGICAL TECHNIQUE

                  Approach
                  Skin, bone, teeth and mucosa are removed en bloc to allow for removal of the tumour with clean margins. The rostral
                  lip is reconstructed to minimize postoperative drooling and moist dermatitis. Images shown in this operative technique
                  were obtained from a cadaver specimen. In a clinical patient, the hair should be adequately clipped, the skin prepared
                  for aseptic surgery and the surgical site draped.

                  Surgical manipulations

                          Branches of mental vessels are ligated as necessary. The
                          sublingual mucosa is also incised, possibly rostral to the
                          salivary gland duct openings, as dictated by the margins of
                          the tumour.

                  Caudal to the mesial root of the mandibular second
                  premolar tooth, the mandible is scored to nearly the
                  level of the mandibular canal, and the remaining bony
                  attachments are fractured to allow for safe ligation of
                  the inferior alveolar neurovascular bundle. There is a
                  potential risk of tumour invasion along the periodonteal
                  space. Thus, the entire tooth is ideally removed in one
                  piece together with a malignant tumour. However, it

           5      Roots of any transected teeth are removed. Dental
                  radiographs are taken of the excised piece and the
                  remaining mandibles, to ensure that root remnants are
                  not retained.

            Oral flaps should be grasped on their connective tissue
        side rather than at their margins so that the latter will not
        get traumatized prior to suturing; thumb forceps providing
        a fine rat-toothed grip are ideal for that purpose (Figure
        12.7). Periosteal elevators are used to raise oral flaps,
        engaging the flat or concave side of the instrument against
        the bone and its convex side against the soft tissue, thus
        reducing the chance of tearing or puncturing the elevated
        soft tissue (Reiter and Soltero-Rivera, 2014).

                  SURGICAL TECHNIQUE

                  Approach
                  The mouth is rinsed with a 0.12% chlorhexidine solution, and dental scaling is performed. Preoperative radiographs are
                  obtained to evaluate root development, confirm lack of complicating factors, and identify signs of endodontic or
                  periodontal disease.

                  Surgical manipulations
                  1       Incise the gingival attachment around the tooth.

                  2       Make diverging mesial and distal releasing incisions starting apical to the mucogingival junction, into the alveolar
                          mucosa down to the bone and extending them towards the gingival margin at the mesial and distal aspects of the
                          tooth.

                  3       Use a sharp periosteal elevator to free the gingiva and alveolar mucosa from the underlying bone labially, and
                          elevate the palatal gingiva as an envelope flap to expose the alveolar margin.

                  4       Use a round bur with water irrigation to reduce the level of the alveolar bone overlying the root as needed. Narrow
                          grooves can also be burred at mesial and distal aspects of the root to allow for better elevator purchase.

           8       Appose the flap to the palatal gingiva by means of simple interrupted sutures. The corners of the flap are sutured
                   first, and additional sutures are placed 2–3 mm apart and 1–2 mm from the flap edges.




           (© Dr Alexander M. Reiter)



               PRACTICAL TIPS

               •    The distal releasing incision of the flap should preferably be created without cutting into the gingival sulcus of
                    the first premolar tooth (or detachment of gingiva from this tooth)
               •    A triangular flap may also be used, utilizing a single releasing incision mesial to the canine tooth and extending
                    the gingival horizontal incision to the first or second premolar tooth
               •    Stretching the alveolar mucosa dorsocaudally with a thumb will move the neurovascular bundle emerging from
                    the infraorbital foramen away from where the distal releasing incision is made
               •    Avoid:
                    • Injury to the neurovascular bundle at the infraorbital foramen
                    • Creation of an acute oronasal fistula during alveolectomy or elevation of the tooth
                    • Elevator purchase on the palatal aspect of the tooth, which could cause fracture of the thin bone separating
                        the tooth from the nasal cavity and displacement of the apex into the nasal cavity

               PRACTICAL TIPS

               •    Slight elevation of the gingiva at the mesial aspect of the tooth will reveal the furcation between the
                    mesiobuccal and mesiopalatal roots, facilitating proper sectioning between the mesiobuccal and mesiopalatal
                    crown-root segments
               •    Slightly elevating the mucosa on the palatal aspect of the tooth will avoid injury to the palatal gingiva during
                    sectioning between the distal and mesiobuccal crown-root segments
               •    Removal of dental tissue at the mesial and distal aspects of the tooth may improve elevator purchase in areas
                    with limited interproximal space (i.e. between the maxillary third and fourth premolar teeth, and between the
                    maxillary fourth premolar and first molar teeth)
               •    A triangular flap may also be used, utilizing a single releasing incision at the mesial aspect of the fourth
                    premolar tooth, and extending the gingival horizontal incision distally to the first molar tooth
               •    Avoid:
                    • Injury to the neurovascular bundle at the infraorbital foramen and the ducts of the parotid and zygomatic
                        salivary glands during flap creation
                    • Injury to the neurovascular bundle in the infraorbital canal during reduction of septal bone overlying the
                        mesiopalatal root following extraction of the mesiobuccal crown-root segment
                    • Injury to the mesiobuccal root of the maxillary first molar tooth during alveolectomy
                    • Transportation of root tissue into the infraorbital canal, nasal cavity or maxillary recess
                    • Creation of an oronasal or oroantral fistula during extraction of the mesiopalatal crown-root segment

           7       Incise the periosteum at the base of the flap with a scalpel blade, dissect its connective tissue with blunt tissue
                   scissors, and ensure that the tension-free flap spans over the extraction site.

           8       Excise the flap margins, elevate the lingual gingiva, and proceed with debridement, smoothing of alveolar bone
                   and lavage of the extraction site. Take a postoperative radiograph to confirm complete removal of dental tissue.

           9       Appose the flap to the lingual gingiva by means of simple interrupted sutures. The corners of the flap are sutured
                   first, and additional sutures are placed 2–3 mm apart and 1–2 mm from the flap edges.

               PRACTICAL TIPS

               •    Creation of an envelope flap on the lingual aspect of the tooth will avoid injury to the lingual gingiva during
                    sectioning between the mesial and distal crown-root segments
               •    An envelope flap may also be used, utilizing a single horizontal incision along the alveolar margin extending
                    from the fourth premolar to the second premolar teeth
               •    Removal of dental tissue at the mesial and distal aspects of the tooth improves elevator purchase in areas with
                    limited interproximal space (i.e. between the mandibular fourth premolar and first molar teeth and between the
                    mandibular first molar and second molar teeth)
               •    Avoid:
                    • Excessive flap elevation buccally and lingually
                    • Injury to the neurovascular bundle in the mandibular canal during alveolectomy and elevation of crown-root
                        segments
                    • Transportation of root tissue into the mandibular canal
                    • Excessive force during luxation and elevation of crown-root segments resulting in mandibular fracture

                  Lateral recumbency.

                  ASSISTANT
                  Preferable.

                  ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT
                  Scalpel; periosteal elevator; round burs; round diamond burs; (cross-cut) fissure burs; lactated Ringer’s solution (or
                  saline); dental elevators; extraction forceps; root tip elevators; root tip forceps; tissue scissors; thumb forceps; suture
                  material; needle holder; suture scissors; gauze.

                  SURGICAL TECHNIQUE

                  Approach
                  The mouth is rinsed with a 0.12% chlorhexidine solution, and dental scaling is performed. Preoperative radiographs are
                  obtained to evaluate root development, lack of complicating factors, and signs of endodontic or periodontal disease.

                  Surgical manipulations
                  1       Incise the gingival attachment around each tooth.

                  2       Make a horizontal incision along the alveolar margin from the mesiolabial aspect of the maxillary canine tooth to
                          the distal aspect of the most caudal tooth to be extracted. Make a vertical releasing incision at the mesial aspect
                          of the canine tooth starting apical to the mucogingival junction, into the alveolar mucosa down to the bone and
                          extending it towards the gingival margin.

                  3       Use a sharp periosteal elevator to free the gingiva and alveolar mucosa from the underlying bone labially and
                          buccally, and elevate the palatal gingiva as an envelope flap to expose the alveolar margin.

                  4       Use a round bur with water irrigation to reduce the level of the alveolar bone overlying the roots as needed.
                          Narrow grooves can also be burred at mesial and distal aspects of the roots to allow for better elevator purchase.

                      PRACTICAL TIPS

                      •    It is advisable to inspect and palpate the root apices and compare radiographs before and after extraction of
                           teeth (prior to suturing of the flap) to confirm complete removal of dental tissue




                      (© Dr Alexander M. Reiter)

                      •    A large flap may be closed with a simple continuous suture pattern to minimize the number of knots in the
                           mouth and reduce total anaesthesia time. However, the risk of wound dehiscence and postoperative
                           complications should be considered when choosing this type of suturing technique
                      •    It is wise for less experienced clinicians to extract one tooth at a time rather than to perform alveolectomy on
                           multiple teeth, in case anaesthesia needs to be interrupted and the patient quickly awakened for medical
                           reasons
                      •    Avoid:
                           • Excessive flap elevation labially/buccally and palatally as well as traumatic flap manipulation
                           • Excessive bone removal
                           • Injury to the neurovascular bundle at the infraorbital foramen or inside the infraorbital canal
                           • Injury to the ducts of the parotid and zygomatic salivary glands
                           • Transportation of dental tissue into the nasal cavity or infraorbital canal
                           • Elevator purchase on the palatal aspect of the canine tooth, which could cause fracture of the thin bone
                                separating the tooth from the nasal cavity and creation of an acute oronasal fistula or displacement of the
                                apex into the nasal cavity

                      PRACTICAL TIPS

                      •   This procedure should only be employed when closed or open extraction cannot be accomplished on teeth
                          with radiographic confirmation of dentoalveolar ankylosis and root replacement resorption and absence of
                          periodontitis, endodontic and periapical disease and stomatitis
                      •   Reducing the resorbing root below the level of the alveolar margin allows a blood clot to form into which
                          alveolar bone can grow above the remaining root tissue during healing

        limited mouth opening due to masticatory muscle myositis.
        Severe lingual and sublingual swelling resulted from venous

               procedures where sodium hyplochlorite is used, or when
               handling sharp instruments around the maxilla. Post-

                   Orbital penetration by dental elevators leading to
               ocular and brain trauma has been reported in dogs and
               cats associated with tooth extraction procedures (Smith

               Troxel, 2015). Outcomes included recovery after antibiotic
               therapy, enucleation of the affected eye, and death from
               braincase fracture and brain abscessation. Early treat-
               ment and referral to a veterinary ophthalmologist are
               recommended. Awareness of the anatomical proximity
               of caudal maxillary tooth roots and the orbit, appropriate
               interpretation of dental radiographs, and proficiency
               in tooth extraction techniques will minimize the risk of
               these complications.
                   Injury to orbital structures (causing retrobulbar haema-
               toma, transient vision loss, and glaucoma with permanent

            The instrument handle design is of utmost importance
        (Aller, 2005). Appropriate shape and pattern can provide
        traction and decrease a pinch grip. A lightweight (hollow)
        handle will improve tactile sensitivity and is less strenu-
        ous to use. A relatively larger diameter also decreases a
        pinch grip (a slender handle leads to cramping) (Figure
        13.21). Instruments should be sharpened after each use,
        thus improving efficiency and reducing fatigue. The cord
        of a dental handpiece can be adjusted around an elbow
        so that its weight is not pulling on the operator’s wrist.
        Similarly, the cord of an ultrasonic handpiece can be                           a io s inst ment handle shapes light eight hollo and

        use of sharp instruments (Angel, 2014). Each stroke of an
        instrument against the tooth will wear away the metal of
        the cutting edge, causing it to transform from a precise,
        sharp line at the junction of the face and lateral surfaces to
        a dull, rounded surface. Using a dull surface requires
        heavier lateral pressure against the tooth, reducing tactile
        sensitivity and creating hand fatigue. The dull surface will
        burnish the calculus, rather than causing it to be shaved
        off. Once burnished, this calculus is difficult to detect and
        remove (Lewis and Miller, 2010).
             Instruments should be sharpened after cleaning and
        before sterilizing. This can be accomplished manually with
        sharpening stones or automated devices. Either way, it is
        critical to have a thorough understanding of the instrument
        design, including the cross-sectional shape and the line
        angles between surfaces, to enable a sharp cutting edge
        to be reestablished without creating changes in the instru-
        ment’s original design. Two methods of manual sharpening                                           Carborundum, India, and three shapes of Arkansas stones

        Home oral hygiene
        Starting with clean teeth and healthy gums
        Plaque control is a critical component in the maintenance
        of treatment success. When oral hygiene is less optimal
        and plaque is allowed to accumulate, it becomes thicker
        and more complex. Calculus forms when calcium carbonate
        and other calcium salts in salivary fluid crystallize on the
        tooth surface, mineralizing the plaque into a hard material.
        Following professional dental cleaning it takes 2–3 days for
        plaque to become sufficiently mineralized to form calculus
        that resists being readily wiped off by mastication or tooth
        brushing. Calcium salts are more likely to be deposited on
        plaque in an alkaline environment. Because the mouths of
        dogs and cats are slightly alkaline, they are more prone to
        deposition of calculus than humans (Harvey, 2005).
            Professional dental cleaning followed by home oral
        hygiene is the gold standard for prevention of periodontal       (a)
        disease (DuPont, 1998; Gorrel, 2000). A painful mouth will
        make for a non-compliant pet and may cause the client to
        give up on tooth brushing and other home oral hygiene
        measures completely. Thus, it is often best to start with
        clean teeth and healthy gums (Figure 13.31). Educating
        the pet owner about home oral hygiene is an important
        role of the technician/nurse and dental hygienist. Tooth
        brushing techniques can be demonstrated and recom-
        mendations made for products that reduce plaque and
        calculus build-up, including the use of dental diets,
        dental chews, treats and toys, oral rinses, gels, tooth-
        pastes and drinking water additives (Hale, 2003).
        Decisions about what products to use can be facilitated
        by consulting the website of the Veterinary Oral Health
        Council (www.vohc.org). Performing home oral hygiene
        may allow for longer intervals between (and fewer sur-
        prises during) professional dental cleanings (Aller, 1993;
        Roudebush et al., 2005; Ray and Eubanks, 2009).                  (b)

                                        Introduction à la médecine vétérinaire
                                                           Yaritagua, 27 mars 2020.
                                  Introduction.



       L’histoire de la médecine vétérinaire dans le monde remonte aux
premières civilisations établies sur terre.

       La médecine vétérinaire est née associée à l'élevage dans le but de
fournir des aliments d'origine animale, des vêtements, des chaussures et du
travail, puis pour la guerre.

       Il est né avec une culture à moitié pratique, à moitié magique ou sorcière.
Elle évolue à chaque étape historique jusqu'à sa fondation il y a 250 ans. Il
existe diverses preuves dans des peintures murales anciennes, des récipients
et des sculptures montrant des bergers s'occupant des animaux et leurs
pratiques de manipulation.

       Ce mot a plusieurs origines possibles. Le plus communément admis est
que ce mot vient de la langue latine cultivée. Veterinarius, selon l'écrivain
Caton, était l'expert et le praticien de l'art de guérir les veterinae ou veterina,
c'est-à-dire les bêtes de somme.

       Le nom de ces animaux semble provenir de vetus (ancien), car il s'agirait
d'animaux âgés, et donc ne convenant plus aux chars de course ou de guerre
et servant uniquement au transport.

       D'autres sources affirment que veterina aurait pu naître du verbe veho,
vehere, de quel véhicule serait dérivé, ce qui signifie précisément transporter.

       Pour les Arabes, il existe le mot « albéitar » qui désigne la personne
chargée de soigner les pathologies des chevaux, animaux si importants dans la
culture arabe.
                                    Histoire


    Egyptehttps://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/
       Archivo:F.L._Griffith,_Hieratic_papyri_from_Kahun_and_
       Gurob._Wellcome_L0028812.jpg
       Dans l’Egypte ancienne, le chat était un animal sacré pour les Égyptiens,
et les vaches étaient d’abord des bêtes de somme, puis une source de
nourriture, principalement du lait. C'est dans la civilisation égyptienne que l'on
trouve les premiers témoignages d'une culture et d'une technique de soin des
animaux et de lutte contre leurs maladies. C'est dans les Papyri Kahoun dont
l'origine remonte à 3 000 ans avant JC avec 48 colonnes de texte en
hiéroglyphes cursifs, qui décrivent les maux subis par les animaux, les
traitements par magie et enchantements, les formules médicales, les remèdes
et les maladies avec leur description respective.


    Babylone
   Dans l'ancien royaume de Babylone, vers 1700 avant JC avec son grand roi
Hammourabi, un Corpus Juris promulgué par ledit roi est écrit sur un bloc de
pierre de basalte, plus connu aujourd'hui sous le nom de Code d'Hammourabi.
Ce code, composé de 282 articles, établit les règles de la vie quotidienne de
cette grande civilisation de l'époque, la justice civile et pénale, et notamment les
mesures de protection de l'agriculture et de l'élevage, et les animaux
domestiques et les animaux sont mentionnés. Médecins vétérinaires appelés
Mounai-Sou. Verbatim dans la pierre codée, la présence du Docteur Vétérinaire
à ce moment-là est détaillée dans deux articles :


   224.- Si le Mounai-Sou d'un bœuf ou d'un âne a soigné une blessure grave
à un bœuf ou à un âne et l'a guéri, le propriétaire du bœuf ou de l'âne donnera
au médecin des honoraires d'un sixième d'argent (de son prix ou shekel).


   225.- Si le Mounai-Sou a soigné un bœuf ou un âne et l'a fait mourir, il
donnera au propriétaire du bœuf ou de l'âne un cinquième de son prix.
    Judée
      Dans la civilisation juive Le Talmud, diffusé de génération en génération
par le peuple juif vers 1300 ans avant JC Il décrit les maladies comme étant
causées par le diable, et les fidèles et les animaux sont sauvés par
l'intervention divine de Jéhovah. Des maladies telles que la rage et des
traitements basés sur l'organothérapie sont décrits, tels que des pommades à
base de graisse animale, de la viande crue pour l'inflammation et des extraits
de serpent pour la gale. Mais la grande contribution israélienne se trouve dans
le Pentateuque ou Torah, avec les règles sur le sacrifice et l'hygiène des
animaux, dirigées par l'abatteur et supervisées par des médecins vétérinaires
dans les enclos ou les abattoirs.


    Inde
      En Inde, l’ère brahmanique a commencé vers 800 avant JC. et sa plus
haute autorité, le Dharma-Sastra, communique les lois dictées par Brahma. Ces
lois indiennes qui protègent les animaux avant les hommes maintiennent des
réglementations sur les aliments tels que le lait de différentes femelles. Vers
l'an 270 avant JC Le roi Ashoka impose la religion du Bouddha et dicte dans sa
première proclamation l'interdiction de tuer des animaux, et s'il le faisait, il ne
serait pas aimé de Bouddha. Dans sa deuxième proclamation, il créa des
hôpitaux d'asile pour hommes et animaux, dit roi ayant l'honneur de fonder le
premier hôpital vétérinaire connu, sous le nom de Pacoukicisa. Des vestiges de
tels établissements se trouvent actuellement dans les ruines jaïns de l'Inde.


    Grèce
      Dans la Grèce antique de la polis et de la science médicale, plusieurs
auteurs s'efforcent de décrire la médecine et la zootechnie chez les animaux,
notamment le cheval comme élément des armées et de la guerre. C'est en
Grèce que commence à être utilisé le terme principal qui donne naissance au
médecin vétérinaire : Hipiatras pour le cheval et Veterinatas pour les bêtes de
somme appelées mulets, ânes et bœufs. Simon l'Athénien avec son Hipiatrica
et Monté avec son Traité d'équitation décrivent des notions précises de santé
équine qu'il faut rechercher dans la cavalerie de l'armée romaine.


       Hippocrate,    avec    moins   d'intérêt,   et   Aristote,   avec   beaucoup
d'application, se consacrent à décrire l'anatomie et les maladies des animaux.
Mais il est le deuxième d'entre eux avec son ouvrage Historia Animalibus qui
développe un traité complet sur les animaux, et surtout dans le livre VIII il décrit
les concepts physiologiques et anatomiques des animaux, citant l'iléus, le
volvulus, les invaginations et les hernies dans les maladies du cheval.


       On décrit également la colique équine, l'infosura et le tétanos, la
pneumonie chez les bovins, la cysticercose chez le porc et la rage chez le
chien. En chirurgie, il étudie l'hémostase avec le feu, le pansement des plaies,
la cautérisation et la castration.


       Ce grand ouvrage d'Aristote confirme le titre qui lui est attribué de grand
compilateur de connaissances qui constitue déjà une doctrine vétérinaire pour
l'époque et l'humanité.


    Rome
       Rome avec son Empire est un appel à consolider les études vétérinaires
dans un corps scientifique et dans l'orientation définitive qui donne à la
médecine vétérinaire sa place dans l'histoire, en fonction de la signification
historique et sociale de l'Empire romain.
       Le Mulomedicus et le medicus-pecuarius de l'Ars-majori confèrent le
caractère médical à l'art de soigner les animaux durant l'empire millénaire. Trois
Romains, Caton, Varro et Columelle, constituent les auteurs prolifiques des
traités sur les animaux, leur élevage et leurs maladies qui définissent l'école
romaine d'agriculture et d'élevage.


       Le premier d'entre eux Caton vers 200 ans avant JC Dans son De Res
Rustica, il traite des maladies du bétail et de leurs traitements avec des recettes
vulgaires décrites sans former un corps de doctrine médicale. Varro vers 100
ans avant JC décrit dans son ouvrage Traité d'agriculture la constitution des
animaux, leur élevage, leurs maladies, leur alimentation et leur repos.


       Mais il s'agit de Lucius Junius Moderatus Columella dans les années 40
avant JC dans son ouvrage monumental en douze volumes De Re Rustica où il
donne un corps doctrinal à l'étude des animaux et de leurs maladies :
       A travers les livres VI, VII, VII et IX, il décrit le rôle des connaissances
zootechniques dans l'élevage de tous types d'animaux d'élevage, les
connaissances médicales sur les maladies, la santé et l'hygiène animales, et
les soins (valetudinarium) des animaux malades, monnaies pour les premiers.
temps notre science médicale son nom de Médecine Vétérinaire, et le nom pour
la postérité de Vétérinaire à son praticien principal.
       Il traite la contagion des maladies avec une connaissance méticuleuse,
dans ce cas il prône la ségrégation et la quarantaine, distingue les maladies qui
affectent chaque animal individuellement des maladies collectives ou grégaires,
et reconnaît et garantit la nécessité pour chaque éleveur de disposer d'une
assistance vétérinaire professionnelle.


       C'est au début de notre ère et pleinement lors de la fondation du
christianisme romain que des codes et des livres éminemment vétérinaires
furent rédigés de manière organisée dans la Rome de Constantin.
       Apsirtos,     étudiant    en   médecine         en    général,     développa     ses
connaissances médicales à Alexandrie, devenant plus tard vétérinaire en chef
de l'armée de Constantin le Grand, qui à la fin des guerres chrétiennes pratiqua
cet art en Asie Mineure, se perfectionnant comme un grand Hippiatras et
fondant l'école d'hypiatrie chrétienne avec son riche ouvrage Hipiátrika, qu'il
compile et développe grâce à ses vastes connaissances cliniques équines.
       Parmi   les     problématiques     décrites     par    l'APSIRTOS,     la   morve,
l'emphysème        pulmonaire,   le   tétanos,   les    coliques,   les    fractures,   les
saignements avec leurs indications et modalités, les boissons et les onguents
méritent d'être évoqués. Son œuvre révèle la maîtrise et la connaissance
dominante de la pratique Hippiatrika de cette époque.
    Le Protoalbeiterate espagnol.


       Un synonyme de vétérinaire est le mot albéitar, d'origine arabe. Sa
signification est qu'il fait référence à la personne chargée de soigner les
chevaux, étant compétente dans l'art du ferrage et dans la connaissance des
maladies des chevaux.
       Et ce sont les Arabes, qui ont conquis l'Hispanie avec leurs beaux
chevaux arabes et l'Albeitería en tant que science médicale du cheval, qui ont
également contribué à la consolidation de la médecine vétérinaire au Moyen
Âge.
       Des écoles d'albéitares sont fondées dans la péninsule ibérique et le
Protoalbéitare royal de Madrid est créé par la loi pragmatique du 13 avril 1500
par les Rois catholiques pour examiner les aspirants albéitares, et les albéitares
arabes sont ceux qui viennent pratiquer et développer cette éminente science
médicale équine. , avec les Arabes Maïmonide se distinguant comme praticiens
avec sa description des poisons, Almalaqui avec ses 1200 médicaments décrits
et Albucasi éditeur du Tesrif traduit comme le premier vademecum médical
avec trente volumes qui incluent la chirurgie, la pharmacologie, la nutrition,
l'ophtalmologie entre autres.




    L'Europe, berceau de la médecine vétérinaire.


       Le continent européen de la modernité progresse dans la zootechnie des
espèces, dans les races et dans la productivité du bétail grâce à l'Anglais
Bakewell, aux grandes armées et à leur cavalerie avec les maréchaux
allemands, mais l'Europe est aussi remplie de pestes, d'épidémies et de
guerres. surtout vers la fin du Moyen Âge et le début de l'ère moderne des XVe,
XVIe, XVIIe et XVIIIe siècles.
         La peste bovine s'est répandue sur tout le vieux continent en 1609, en
France en 1682 et en Italie en 1683, ainsi qu'en Suisse, en Allemagne et en
Pologne. Au cours des mêmes années, la variole ravage le bétail ovin, tuant
trois millions de têtes en Italie et dix millions entre la France et la Belgique. En
1721, la peste bovine attaquait à nouveau toute l’Europe.
         Durant ces années fatidiques de la santé animale, Lancisi en Italie, fait
office de pape Clément des épidémies.
         Le cri de tous les agriculteurs et éleveurs d'Europe est la formation des
vétérinaires pour lutter contre ces épizooties, leurs pays sont dévastés par les
ravageurs et ils ont besoin d'écoles pour former des médecins vétérinaires.


         La Médecine Vétérinaire Moderne, organisée selon des critères
scientifiques, commence avec l'émergence de la première École Moderne de
Médecine Vétérinaire au monde, à Lyon, en France, créée par l'hypologue et
avocat français CLAUDE BOUGERLAT, sur la base de l'Edit Royal de Sa
Majesté. Le roi Louis XV, le 4 août 1761.
         Ce premier centre mondial de formation de médecins vétérinaires
commença son activité avec 8 étudiants le 19 février 1762. En 1767, toujours
en France, est créée la deuxième école vétérinaire du monde, l'École d'Alfort, à
Paris.
          À partir de là, en raison de la compréhension croissante et de
l'importance sociale, économique et politique de la nouvelle profession, d'autres
écoles furent créées dans divers pays, comme en Autriche, à Vienne (1768), en
Italie, à Turin (1769). Le Danemark, à Copenhague, (1773), la Suède, à Sara,
(1775), l'Allemagne, à Hanovre, (1778), la Hongrie, à Budapest, (1781),
l'Angleterre, à Londres, (1791), l'Espagne, à Madrid, (1792).


    La profession vétérinaire en Amérique.
         C’est l’Amérique qui est appelée à maintenir la présence de vétérinaires
pour assister les populations animales du nouveau monde. Les premiers
vétérinaires arrivés sur le continent furent des Albéitares au service du Roi.
       Le continent tout entier considère également aujourd’hui qu’il est
nécessaire de former des vétérinaires pour prendre soin des richesses
animales de leurs pays, surtout après les guerres d’émancipation américaines.
       Ainsi, au milieu du XIXe siècle au Mexique, le 17 août 1853, est fondée
la première École vétérinaire du continent américain, suivie par la fondation des
autres écoles au Canada 1862, aux États-Unis 1879, en Argentine 1883, au
Chili. 1898, et Pérou 1902, Uruguay 1905, Cuba 1907, Brésil 1913, Colombie
1921, Équateur 1934, Venezuela 1938, Bolivie 1940, République dominicaine
1955, Guatemala et Paraguay 1956, Nicaragua 1961, Costa Rica 1974,
Panama en 1997.


    La profession vétérinaire au Venezuela.
       Au Venezuela, les études vétérinaires étaient d'une importance vitale
pour les gouvernements, en raison de la richesse animale de notre pays,
notamment dans les plaines vénézuéliennes.
       En 1831 et sous la direction de son bienfaiteur et président de la
République José Antonio Páez, la Société des Amis du Pays, sous la tutelle du
Dr José María Vargas, décrivait l'importance des plaines pour l'élevage et la
promotion de l'agriculture. Le 2 décembre 1942, l'École normale d'agriculture
est fondée sous la direction de cette Société dans le but, entre autres, d'assurer
l'élevage, l'amélioration et l'hygiène des animaux.
       Cela dure quelques années jusqu’à ce que le manque de budget et
d’autres accidents politiques fassent succomber une telle initiative nationale.
Les gouvernements successifs, sous le régime du centralisme, de la fédération
ou du caudillismo, tentent de fonder l'enseignement vétérinaire dans le pays.
       L'Assemblée législative de l'État d'Apure décrète pour l'année 1867 la
création d'un éphémère Institut ou École vétérinaire. En 1876, Guzmán Blanco
fonda une classe d'Agriculture et Zootechnie qui ne fonctionna jamais faute de
personnel qualifié.
       En 1897, Joaquín Crespo ordonna la création d'une école vétérinaire,
une initiative qui fut interrompue par sa mort.
       Cipriano Castro, dans son message devant le Congrès de la République
en 1904, exprima la nécessité d'enseigner la médecine vétérinaire et la
zootechnie, s'engageant à fonder une école vétérinaire dans les plaines du sud-
ouest qui ne fut jamais concrétisée.
       Sous le gomécisme et son long processus politique dans le pays, la
création de l'École fédérale d'agriculture, d'élevage et de médecine vétérinaire
est décrétée le 15 avril 1912. Son siège social se trouve dans l'ancienne et
historique demeure du marquis de Casa León appelée Hacienda La Trinidad, à
la périphérie de la ville de Maracay.
       Mais cette initiative échoue et le général achète la propriété et la
consacre à l'élevage du bétail.
       À la mort du Benemérito, La Hacienda la Trinidad devient propriété de la
nation. Après de longues années de dictature, Gómez reprend l'enseignement
des sciences vétérinaires, importantes pour la richesse agricole du pays.
       Le 19 décembre 1932, il décrète la création de l'École des experts
agricoles pour dispenser un enseignement pratique des sciences de
l'agriculture et de l'élevage.
       Le ministre de la Santé, de l'Agriculture et de l'Élevage, Henrique Toledo
Trujillo, a pris l'initiative, le 21 novembre 1933, d'approuver le cours de stages
de santé animale dudit ministère, cours officialisé par décret présidentiel du 2
janvier 1934 et dispensé gratuitement. à compter du 12 janvier de la même
année, pour une durée de trois ans et dont le certificat confère le titre d'Expert
en Médecine Vétérinaire et Zootechnie.
       Quatre médecins vétérinaires sont les pionniers dans l'exercice de la
profession vétérinaire au Venezuela dans les années 1933 et 1934 : Vladimir
Kubes, tchécoslovaque ; Carlos Otto, chilien ; Emilio Graña, Argentin ;
Fernando Roumiguiere, également argentin, a été mandaté par le ministère
concerné pour ouvrir des plans d'élevage dans le pays et, dans le cas de
Kubes, il est nommé directeur du stage de santé animale.
       Del primer curso aprobado entre los graduados destaca el Dr. Alberto
Baumeister, el cual es becado para continuar los estudios de Medicina
Veterinaria en Uruguay, donde regresa graduado, revalidando su título ante la
Universidad Central, cuestión que le distingue como el primer Médico
Veterinario Revalidado au Vénézuela.
       López Contreras accède au pouvoir en 1935 à la mort de Gómez et,
dans son programme progressiste de février 1936, il fonde le ministère de
l'Agriculture et de l'Élevage distinct de celui de la Santé.
       C'est à Alberto Adriani d'en être le premier ministre, un homme déjà
convaincu des sciences agricoles comme axe du développement de la
campagne vénézuélienne.
       Le 14 avril 1937, par décret présidentiel, est créée la Station
Expérimentale d'Agriculture et de Zootechnie, dépendant du Ministère de
l'Agriculture et de l'Élevage, dont le siège sera situé à l'Hacienda Sosa de El
Valle à Caracas.


       La base des études de médecine vétérinaire au Venezuela
       Ils ont été cristallisés le 17 janvier 1938, par résolution du ministre de
l'Agriculture et de l'Élevage Hugo Parra Pérez conformément aux dispositions
du président López Contreras, en tant qu'École supérieure vétérinaire rattachée
au MAC. dont l'opération sera également située à l'Hacienda Sosa à El Valle,
Caracas, et dont le premier directeur sera le docteur vétérinaire Enrique
Vogelsang, avec un cours de trois ans.
       Le 18 décembre 1940, la première promotion de médecins vétérinaires
est diplômée au Venezuela, composée de 17 membres: Tomas Rodil, Juan
Vásquez, Jesús Torrellas, Luis Sahmkowb, Rolando Araujo, Francisco Loreto,
Víctor Lara, Manuel Pacheco, Juan Hernández, José Pérez, Francisco
D'Onofrio, Francisco Laprea, Ramón Gómez, Agustín Strocchia, Arístides
Fernández, Juan Barrios, parmi lesquels se distingue le Dr María Lourdes
Salóm, la première collègue diplômée du pays.
       La loi sur l'éducation adoptée la même année a prolongé les études
vétérinaires à cinq ans et, en 1944, la première promotion de docteurs en
médecine vétérinaire a obtenu son diplôme.
       En 1947, l'École Supérieure fut rattachée à l'Université Centrale avec le
rang de Faculté de Médecine Vétérinaire.
       En 1948, l'Institut National d'Agriculture fut achevé dans la ville de
Maracay, sur le terrain de l'ancienne hacienda de La Trinidad, où était prévu le
MAC. installer la Station Expérimentale d'Agriculture et de Zootechnie, en plus
des Écoles Supérieures de Médecine Vétérinaire et d'Agriculture, et en 1950
elle fut définitivement transférée aux installations de Maracay où elles se
trouvent actuellement.
      Le 24 novembre 1959, elle est élevée au rang de Faculté des Sciences
Vétérinaires.
      La première revue scientifique des Sciences Vétérinaires est publiée à
l'Ecole Supérieure de Médecine Vétérinaire rattachée au MAC sous le nom de
Journal of Veterinary Medicine and Parasitology, son premier numéro parut en
mars 1939, sa fondation revenant aux Drs. Vogelsang et Piero Gallo.


    Facultés vétérinaires du Venezuela.
      En plus de l'UCV, dans l'Edo. Lara, à l'Université Centre Occidental
Lisandro Alvarado, le Doyen des Sciences Vétérinaires a vu le jour au cours de
l'année 1964.
      La Faculté des Sciences Vétérinaires a été fondée à l'Université de Zulia
en 1965.
      En 1981, la Faculté des Sciences Vétérinaires de l’Université Nationale
Expérimentale Francisco de Miranda de Coro Edo est créée. Falcón, et dans
les années 90, la Faculté des Sciences Vétérinaires de l'Université Nationale
Expérimentale Rómulo Gallegos a été créée dans la ville de Zaraza.


    L'Institut de Recherche Vétérinaire.
      Au cours de l'année 1940, plus précisément le 5 juillet, date de
l'indépendance, le président López Contreras et son ministre de l'Agriculture et
de l'Élevage, Alfonso Mejía, ont officiellement inauguré l'Institut vénézuélien de
recherche vétérinaire dans le secteur de Las delicias de Maracay.
      Au cours de son discours, le ministre Mejía a souligné les deux branches
principales pour lesquelles cette institution a été créée : la première pour la
recherche et l'étude des maladies animales et des procédures pour les
combattre ; et le second pour la fabrication de produits vétérinaires afin
d'atteindre l'indépendance des marchés étrangers pour ces produits.
      Autrefois, ce champ expérimental de Maracay abritait principalement la

    Unionisme et congrès.
        La Société des Médecins Vétérinaires du Venezuela a été fondée le 25
novembre 1939 comme principale matrice de l'organisation syndicale qui
représente aujourd'hui notre Fédération.
        Sous la direction du ministre Mejía, on a encouragé la formation de cette
société, dont le premier conseil d'administration était présidé par le Dr Enrique
Vogelsang, et en 1940 elle a tenu sa première Convention nationale.
        En 1958, à l'aube de la démocratie, il fut transformé en Collège des
médecins vétérinaires du Venezuela, avec son premier conseil d'administration
présidé par le Dr Julio Manuel Montoya.
        En 1960, le premier Code d’éthique vétérinaire a été publié. L'illustre
Congrès de la République, en 1968, a sanctionné la loi sur l'exercice de la
médecine vétérinaire, mise en œuvre par le président Raúl Leoni.
        Cette loi établit la création de la Fédération des Facultés de Médecine
Vétérinaire du Venezuela, dont le premier président fut le Dr Alirio Contreras en
1969.
        En 1972, le règlement de la loi a été publié par le président Rafael
Caldera.
        La Société des Médecins Vétérinaires du Venezuela est chargée
d'organiser du 21 au 26 juillet 1946 le Premier Congrès Vétérinaire
Grancolombien, d'une importance syndicale précieuse pour le Venezuela,
puisque à cette date est fixée la célébration de l'anniversaire de notre
profession dans le pays.
        Le Venezuela accueille également le Congrès panaméricain de
médecine vétérinaire et de zootechnie du 1er au 6 août 1982 dans la ville de
Caracas ; et le Premier Congrès National des Sciences Vétérinaires a lieu dans
la ville de Maracaibo du 23 au 25 février 1989.
    Le Collège de Trujillo.
        Dans l'État de Trujillo, la performance des médecins vétérinaires a été
présente dans les travaux agricoles de la région.
        Le 30 juillet 1972, la délégation des médecins vétérinaires de l'État de
Trujillo a été créée. Cette délégation avait comme premier conseil
d'administration le suivant : Président : MV. Julio Silva, secrétaire MV Ramón
Arapé, Trésorier MV Enrique Viera.
       Plus tard, en 1975, un groupe de seize (16) médecins vétérinaires s'est
réuni pour fonder le Collège des médecins vétérinaires de l'État de Trujillo.
       Au cours des mois de juin et juillet, le 14 août 1975, s'est tenue une
assemblée extraordinaire des médecins vétérinaires, formant le premier conseil
d'administration composé du président, le Dr Néstor Montiel Ocando, du vice-
président, le Dr Alfonso Pacheco, et du secrétaire exécutif. , Dr Guillermo Sutil,
Trésorier Dr Ramón Arapé, Secrétaire des procès-verbaux et de la
correspondance Dr Lenis Valero, Bibliothécaire Dr Carlos León, Membre Dr
Wilfredo Marín.
       Le premier tribunal disciplinaire est composé des collègues suivants : Dr
Edglisman Garmendia, Dr Neiser Romero, Dr Esneider Torres, Dr William Isea
et Dr Oscar Araujo.
       Entre 1975 et 2011, il y a eu douze directives consécutives, présidées
par les médecins suivants :
      Année 1975 – 1976 Dr Néstor Montiel.
      Année 1976 – 1978 Dr Luis Alfredo Moreno.
      Année 1978 – 1980 Dr Edglisman Garmendia.

Diet is an important consideration in the care of a pet and is a major
factor in health and life expectancy. Home-Prepared Dog and Cat Diets
is a unique handbook in that it provides an introduction to nutrition
of the healthy dog and cat as well as an extensive discussion of medical
disorders that can be treated in part by dietary management. Recipes
are provided for making home-prepared diets for both healthy pets
and pets with special conditions. These diets have been formulated
with a sophisticated computer program to ensure that they are bal-
anced and complete, according to the Association of American Feed
Control Officials (AAFCO) guidelines. Many diets have been carefully
formulated for specific health problems according to current veteri-
nary recommendations. Diets that have been designed for some special
conditions may not be complete and balanced because of necessary
diet restrictions. This is noted in the recipe, and these diets should be
fed under the direct supervision of your veterinarian.
   This edition of Home-Prepared Dog and Cat Diets has been thoroughly
updated. Chapters have been expanded and completely rewritten
to reflect nutritional recommendations based on current research.
New chapters have been added on feeding the puppy and kitten,
feeding the pregnant or lactating dog or cat, feeding the senior pet,
feeding the performance dog, and the role of diet in pets with cancer.
For ease of use, diets have been removed from individual chapters and
are now found in Section II of the book. Nutrient content for protein,
fat, carbohydrate, and fiber have been provided for every diet, along
with the nutrient density. Diets can easily be adjusted for any size dog
or cat, and exact ingested nutrient amounts can be calculated. Diets


                                                                      vii
viii    Preface

are cross-referenced for special conditions, by chapter, and also by
protein source, making it simple to find a diet to suit the needs of most
dogs or cats. Detailed directions are given regarding food safety and
proper preparation of diets.
   With the information presented in this book, pet owners will have
an excellent background in nutrition of the dog and cat. If the diet
directions are carefully followed, owners can safely prepare balanced
diets for their healthy pets. Diets for pets with special conditions
should be thoroughly discussed with the pet's veterinarian to ensure
the proper management of the pet with special needs.

           CHAPTER 1
           Homemade Diets


In the United States, there are more than 140 million dogs and cats.
The vast majority of pets receive more than 90% of their calories from
commercially prepared pet food. There is an increasing interest in
feeding home-prepared foods to pets for a variety of reasons. In a
recent telephone survey, owners of 635 dogs and 469 cats were ques-
tioned regarding diets fed to their pets. More dogs received noncom-
mercial foods (table scraps, leftovers, or homemade foods) as compared
to cats. Noncommercial foods were a part of the diet in 31% of dogs
and 13% of cats and comprised at least one-fourth of the diet for 17%
of dogs and 6% of cats. About 3% of pets were exclusively fed home-
made diets, and 7% of dogs received homemade food for at least half
of their diet. Treats of some kind were given daily to 57% of dogs and
26% of cats. Supplements were given to 13% of dogs and 6% of cats
and were reported to include multivitamins, fatty acids, chondropro-
tective agents, vitamin C, yeast, taurine, zinc, calcium, and antioxi-
dants, among others.
   For humans, food consumption has social and cultural connota-
tions. With the humanization of pets, owners may associate social and
cultural behaviors with their pets. In the telephone survey, owners
said that cuddling or petting their animals and talking to the pets were
the most common activities shared with their dogs or cats. Dog owners
were more likely to walk or run with their pets, play with toys together,
play fetch, ride in the car together, participate in obedience or agility
training, and go to work together as compared to cat owners. Other
activities that both dog and cat owners shared with their pets included
watching their pets play, grooming their pets, watching television


                                                                       5

with their pets, and eating with their pets. As pets are treated more as
“humans,” many owners may feel that their pets should share the food
customs of humans.
   There are many reasons suggested as to why a homemade pet diet
is desired. Some owners wish to feed natural or organic foods or vegan
or vegetarian foods. Many wish to cook for their pets and provide a
varied diet. Others may find commercial pet food labels and ingredi-
ents confusing and want to avoid additives, preservatives, chemicals,
or certain ingredients found in pet foods. In the previously mentioned
telephone survey, owners feeding noncommercial pet foods had less
trust in their veterinarian to provide sound nutritional advice and felt
that dogs and cats needed a variety of different foods in their diet.
Owners feeding noncommercial pet foods were more likely to feel that
processed foods for pets were unhealthy, that cooking destroys nutri-
ents in pet foods, and that organic foods were safer and healthier than
other foods. Owners that fed noncommercial food were more likely to
feel that dogs and cats need more meat than is provided in commercial
products, that information on pet food labels is misleading, and that
additives in pet foods have unhealthy side effects. They were less
likely to trust pet food manufacturers to provide nutritionally sound
products and less likely to feel that ingredients in commercial pet
foods were wholesome and nutritious. They are less likely to believe
that pets live longer today because of good nutrition from commercial
products, that commercial products contain necessary nutrition, and
that pet food companies place a high priority on pet health and well-
being. Owners feeding noncommercial foods were more likely to
believe that raw bones could be safely fed to pets, that raw meat pro-
vides better nutrition than cooked foods, and that foods sold for
human consumption provide better nutrition than do commercial
pet foods. Owners feeding noncommercial foods also enjoyed prepar-
ing foods for their pets more than did owners feeding commercial pet
foods.


Problems Associated with Homemade Diets

Veterinarians are the most commonly cited source for pet nutritional
information; however, about 17% of pet owners cite the Internet as
their primary source for pet nutritional information. Unfortunately,
there is a considerable amount of misinformation present on the
Internet, and it can be difficult to determine which information is
trustworthy. In the telephone survey discussed previously, less than
                            Chapter 1 Homemade Diets                  7

one-third of owners used a homemade diet recipe specifically designed
for pets. In another survey, 90% of the homemade elimination diets
used by veterinarians were not balanced and were not nutritionally
adequate to support adult maintenance. In another study comparing
the nutritional adequacy of commercial diets to homemade diets,
calcium, the calcium/phosphorus ratio, and vitamins A and E were
below current recommendations for nutritional adequacy in home-
made diets. Potassium, copper, and zinc concentrations were also
inadequate in homemade diets.
   Feeding unbalanced homemade diets can lead to complications,
including osteodystrophy, osteopenia, nutritional secondary hyper-
parathyroidism, and pansteatitis. Meat sources are typically high in
phosphorus and low in calcium; if no calcium source is added to the
diet, the calcium concentration is typically inadequate and the calcium/
phosphorus ratio is too low. Nutritional secondary hyperparathyroid-
ism occurs when the parathyroid hormone concentration elevates in
an attempt to raise the serum calcium concentration, and loss of bone
density results. For further discussion of nutritional secondary hyper-
parathyroidism see Chapter 17, Diet and Endocrine Disease. Deficiency
of dietary vitamin D can lead to type I rickets, characterized by osteo-
dystrophy. Deficiencies in calcium and vitamin D are especially prob-
lematic in young, growing dogs, requiring a proper balance of calcium
and phosphorus for bone growth. Certain ingredients can be very high
in a particular vitamin and cause problems if not a part of a balanced
diet. Liver is very high in vitamin A, and vitamin A toxicity can result
in pets fed unbalanced diets based on liver. Pansteatitis (yellow fat
disease) has been documented in cats fed diets with a high oily fish
content and inadequate in vitamin E.
   Some recipes call for the use of raw ingredients. Raw ingredients
often contain bacteria that would normally be destroyed by cooking
(see Chapter 2, Food Safety). The practice of feeding uncooked diets
should be discouraged.


Formulating a Homemade Diet

Formulating a diet is a difficult task. The first step in doing so is to
determine the nutritional requirements of the animal, and these
requirements are based on species, life-stage, and the animal’s special
needs. The Nutrient Research Council (NRC) publishes a book about
the nutritional requirements for various species, and these require-
ments serve as guidelines. The Association of American Feed Control
8       Section 1 Nutrition and Dietary Management

Officials (AAFCO) provides suggested nutrient profiles for dog and
cat foods (see Chapter 3, Nutrients). Once the desired levels of nutri-
ents are decided, then ingredients must be chosen that, in combina-
tion, will provide proper amounts of protein, fat, vitamins, and
minerals. Nutrient databases must be maintained to provide the accu-
rate nutritional analysis of each ingredient. Sophisticated computer
programs containing human food ingredients are available (The Food
Processor SQL, ESHA Research, Salem, Oregon), but these programs
provide only a nutritional analysis of the combination of ingredients;
they do not formulate a diet. The analysis of the combined ingredients
must be compared to the suggested nutrient profile. If there are defi-
ciencies or excesses, alterations to ingredients must be made and nutri-
tional adequacy reevaluated. This can be a long and tedious process.
   Some veterinary nutritionists offer a food formulation service or are
available on the telephone for dietary consultations. Some of the vet-
erinary nutritionists providing this service are listed in Table 1.1.


Assessing a Homemade Diet Recipe

When assessing a homemade diet recipe, there are some guidelines
that can be quickly assessed. First, the five food groups (protein, car-
bohydrate, fat, vitamins, minerals) should appear in the recipe. Second,
the carbohydrate source should be present in a higher or equal quan-
tity to that of the protein source. Carbohydrate sources include rice,
barley, lentils, potato, pasta, couscous, or quinoa. In cat foods, the
carbohydrate-to-protein ratio should be 1 : 1 or 2 : 1, and in dog foods
the ratio should be 2 : 1 to 3 : 1. Third, the protein source should be
identified. Fourth, a fat source should be identified. Fat could take the
form of an added vegetable oil or could be included in the meat source
(chicken skin, fat in undrained ground beef, etc.). Fifth, a calcium or
calcium/phosphorus supplement should be present. Calcium carbon-
ate (baking soda) or bone meal (source of calcium and phosphorus)
should also be present. Lastly, a source of vitamins and minerals
should be present, typically in the form of a multivitamin tablet. For
cat diets, a source of taurine should be present.


Choosing a Homemade Diet

There are many homemade recipe diets presented in the second section
of this book. The first step in choosing a diet is to pick a species-

appropriate diet for the life stage of the dog or cat (adult, growth,
senior, reproduction, performance). Dog diets should not be fed to
cats, as these diets will not contain the specific and unique nutrients
that cats need. Cat diets should not be fed to dogs because these diets
will usually provide some nutrients in excess for dogs. The second
step is to determine if there are any special needs of the pet (weight
loss, allergy, renal disease, heart disease, etc.). If special needs are
present, then a diet specific for that condition should be chosen. A
variety of diets using different combinations of ingredients are pre-
sented for each life stage and special condition so that substitutions
are not necessary. It is best to provide the pet with a variety of dietary
ingredients over time to ensure a proper mix of nutrients. The majority
of diets in this book have been formulated to be balanced and nutri-
tionally complete. However, some diets, such as those formulated for
renal disease and other conditions are not nutritionally complete
because of the severe dietary restrictions needed in some conditions.
                             Chapter 1 Homemade Diets                   11

If a diet is not nutritionally complete, this is stated in the diet recipe.
These diets should only be fed to dogs or cats with that specific special
condition and should not be fed to healthy pets.


Diet Preparation

Diets should be prepared according to the recipe given, with no sub-
stitutions, additions, or omissions. Each ingredient in the diet is impor-
tant and provides specific necessary nutrients. Proper preparation of
homemade diets requires time and effort. An accurate kitchen scale
that measures in grams and ounces is required for diet preparation.
Ingredients should be carefully measured to provide the proper com-
bination of nutrients.
   Individual ingredients in the diet (such as meat and the carbohy-
drate source) should be cooked separately. Meat should be cooked
for a minimum of 10 minutes at 180°F. Chicken and ground beef,
in particular, should be well cooked to prevent bacterial contamina-
tion. The use of raw ingredients is not recommended due to the
increased risk for foodborne illness (see Chapter 2, Food Safety).
Carbohydrate sources such as potatoes should be cooked to improve
their digestibility. Vegetables should be washed and then cooked
prior to use.
   Once the food ingredients have been cooked, they should be mea-
sured and combined. Any salt in the recipe can be added at this time,
but other vitamins and mineral supplements should not be added yet.
Once the food ingredients are combined, the ingredients should be
mixed in a blender to ensure their even distribution. This will prevent
the pet from picking out certain dietary ingredients and not consum-
ing others. An unbalanced diet will be consumed if ingredients are
separate and the pet does not eat the entire mixture. Vitamin and
mineral supplements should be crushed to a powder form and added
after the food sources have been cooked and combined.
   Homemade diets do not contain preservatives and are high in mois-
ture, thus they are highly susceptible to bacterial and fungal contami-
nation if left at room temperature for more than a few hours. The
recipes in this book have been designed to be prepared in small batches
to minimize the amount of food prepared but not required for feeding.
Any prepared diet that is not being consumed immediately should be
stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for no more than a
few days. If preparation of a larger batch of food is desired, then the
recipe should be prepared up to the point of vitamin and mineral
12      Section 1 Nutrition and Dietary Management

supplement addition and stored frozen. When ready to feed, the
portion of diet can be thawed, weighed, and the appropriate amount
of vitamins and minerals can be added prior to feeding. Before feeding
any food that has been stored in the refrigerator or freezer, the color,
odor, and consistency should be checked. If there are changes, or there
is visible mold growth, the food should be discarded.
   Vitamin and mineral supplements are present in small quantities,
but they are a very important part of the diet. Supplements should
be included as stated in each recipe and not substituted or omitted.
For example, many diets include both iodized salt and a salt substi-
tute (potassium chloride). Iodized salt is important as a source of
iodine and sodium, and salt substitute is included as a source of
potassium. Both are equally important for inclusion in the diet. Bone
meal is included in diets because it is an excellent source of calcium
and phosphorus, and calcium carbonate (baking soda) is included as
a calcium source. Some recipes call for one-half of a vitamin or
mineral tablet. In general, these are human products that are not
meant to be cut in half, so each half may not be exactly half of the
vitamins called for in the recipe. However, over the course of several
days, the proper amounts of vitamins and minerals will be fed
overall.
   Prior to feeding, the diet should be warmed to just below body
temperature (about 100°F). Especially if food is being warmed in the
microwave, the food should be checked for hot spots, as the food may
heat unevenly. A small amount of water can be added at this time, if
necessary. When feeding, the food should not sit out at room tempera-
ture for more than a few hours. Any food not consumed should be
removed and discarded. Bowls used for serving should be washed
thoroughly after each use.


Monitoring

When feeding a homemade diet, monitoring is important, and the pet
should be examined by a veterinarian at least twice yearly. Body
weight, body condition score, and activity level should routinely be
monitored so that adjustments to the amount of diet fed can be made.
Hair and skin should be monitored, as these are good indicators of
nutritional status. In addition, stool quality should be assessed. The
prepared diets can also be evaluated by a laboratory for nutritional

Kesselring has already been asked about this, but did not answer.
However, it stands to reason that the Führer, as Supreme
Commander of the Armed Forces, could not issue orders through
Jodl to himself in his capacity of Commander-in-Chief of the Army
and then have them carried out through Generaloberst Zeitzler.
Consequently a separation came about. From that moment on he,
with the General Staff of the Army, directed the entire Eastern Front,
while the Armed Forces Operations Staff became responsible for the
general staff work of all the other theaters of war.
     DR. EXNER: Now, the witness Field Marshal Paulus stated
before the Tribunal that the OKW was responsible for the order to
hold Stalingrad; and, as a matter of fact, both Keitel and Jodl have
been repeatedly accused by the foreign press of having given that
disastrous order. Is that true?
     JODL: No, that is not true. The witness, for whom I feel the
deepest sympathy and with whom I have worked in the most
comradely fashion possible, could not have known anything at all
about it. The facts are as follows: The moment danger threatened,
the decision that Stalingrad must be held was made by the Führer
during a private conversation with Generaloberst Zeitzler and
contrary to the latter’s advice. Zeitzler told me so himself on his
return from this interview. At a later stage, when blizzards were
already raging across the steppes of the Don, the question of a
break-through by the Stalingrad garrison was discussed again. Field
Marshal Keitel, Generaloberst Zeitzler, and I were present on this
occasion.
     THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Exner, I do not quite see how that is
relevant, although Field Marshal Paulus may have said something
about it. I mean, he may have given some evidence on the fighting at
Stalingrad, and he undoubtedly did; but I do not see how it bears
upon the case before us, or how it bears upon the case for Jodl.
     DR. EXNER: Mr. President, this has already settled the matter. It
was necessary to clear up Field Marshal Paulus’ error. But this has
already settled the matter.
     [Turning to the defendant.] We now come to the time when you
were recalled from Vienna to Berlin in 1939. What state of affairs did
you find in Berlin on your arrival?
     JODL: I found a completely incomprehensible state of affairs in
Berlin—at least it was incomprehensible to me. Nobody knew what
was really true or what was bluff. The pact with Russia sustained all
our hopes for the preservation of peace, hopes which were
immensely increased and strengthened by the surprise cancellation
of the attack ordered for 26 August. None of the soldiers to whom I
spoke expected a war with the Western Powers at that time. Nothing
had been prepared except the operations for the attack on Poland.
     There was only a defensive deployment of troops on the West
Wall. The forces stationed there were so weak that we could not
even man all the pillboxes. The actual efforts for the preservation of
peace, however, efforts I have heard about here from the Reich
Marshal, the name of Dahlerus—all these negotiations remained
unknown to me insofar as they were not published in the press. But
there is one thing I can say in conclusion. When the declaration of
war was received from England and France it was like a blow from a
cudgel for us soldiers who had fought in the first World War. And I
heard in confidence from General Stapf—today the matter is no
longer confidential—that the Reich Marshal reacted in exactly the
same way.
     DR. EXNER: Do you know when Poland mobilized?
     JODL: That I cannot say. I only know that at the moment when I
arrived in Berlin and was being informed by General Von Stülpnagel
for the very first time about the situation and our own strength, a
Polish deployment was already in progress along the frontier, as well
as the German one.
     DR. EXNER: That in itself already answers the accusation
brought against you in the trial brief, namely “planning against
Poland.”
     Had you prepared a plan against Poland?
     JODL: No. Not by a single stroke of the pen did I participate in
the preparations for the Polish war.
     DR. EXNER: Then I am right in saying, to sum up, that when
you left Berlin there was not yet a plan of operations against Poland?
     JODL: No.
     DR. EXNER: And when you returned to Berlin the plan was
ready?
     JODL: Yes. The plan of attack was completely worked out.
     DR. EXNER: Did you hear the Führer’s speech of 22 August
1939 which has been so often quoted here?
     JODL: No; on that day I was still in Vienna.
     DR. EXNER: When did you hear of that speech?
     JODL: For the first time here in Nuremberg.
     DR. EXNER: Do you remember the meeting in the Führer’s
special train on 9 September 1939, described here by General
Lahousen? Can you remember that?
     JODL: Yes, I remember that meeting perfectly.
     DR. EXNER: What was the subject of conversation during that
meeting while you were on the Führer’s train?
     JODL: I met the Führer in the so-called command car, in the
chartroom, where Field Marshal Keitel, Canaris, and Lahousen were;
and then Canaris made a brief report on the information he had
received from the West and expressed the opinion that a French
attack in the Saarbrücken sector was imminent. The Führer
contradicted this, and so did I. Apart from that nothing else was
discussed.
     DR. EXNER: Then Lahousen’s statement is correct that you
were only present during that particular part of the discussion?
     JODL: As far as I am concerned I have not a word of objection
to raise against Lahousen’s statement. Absolutely correct.
     DR. EXNER: Frequent mention has been made during this Trial
of the artillery and air bombardment of Warsaw. Did you participate
in the giving of the orders for this?
     JODL: Yes, I participated insofar as the Commander-in-Chief of
the Army had applied to the Führer for permission for the artillery to
bombard Warsaw as soon as the deployment of artillery units had
been completed. The Führer refused this. He said, “What is
happening here because of the Poles is madness.” He ordered me
to draft new leaflets—which I did personally and immediately—and
have them dropped again over the city of Warsaw. It was only when
this renewed demand to cease the hopeless resistance had proved
absolutely unsuccessful that he sanctioned artillery bombardment
and air attacks on the fortress of Warsaw—and I emphasize the
word “fortress.”
      DR. EXNER: When issuing orders, did you have anything to do
with the co-ordination of German and Soviet Russian operations?
      JODL: Yes. When we were still 3 days’ march away from the
Vistula, I was informed to my great surprise—by, I believe, the
representative of the Foreign Office—while I was entering the
Führer’s headquarters, that Soviet Russia would occupy the Polish
territories...
      THE PRESIDENT: Defendant, if it is convenient to you, I think
you might speak a little faster.
      JODL: ...that the Polish territories east of an agreed
demarcation line would be occupied by Soviet Russian troops at the
appointed time. When we were approaching this agreed demarcation
line, which was shown to me on a map—the line was the East
Prussian Lithuanian border, Narew, Vistula, San—I telephoned to our
military attaché in Moscow and informed him that we could probably
reach individual points of this demarcation line in the course of the
following day. Shortly afterwards I was informed over the telephone
that the Russian divisions were not yet ready.
      When, the day after the next, we reached the demarcation line
and had to cross it in pursuit of the Poles, I once again received
news from Moscow, at 0200 hours, that the Soviet Russian divisions
would take up their position along the entire front at 0400 hours. This
maneuver was punctually carried out, and I then drafted an order to
our German troops that wherever they had contacted the troops of
the Soviet Union, and in agreement with them, they were to withdraw
behind the demarcation line.
      DR. EXNER: Do you know on what day all this happened?
      JODL: I cannot tell you exactly when the troops reached the
line, but I would say it was about 14 or 15 September.
      DR. EXNER: We shall now deal with aggressive wars against
the neutral countries...
     THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Exner, now all that the defendant has just
been telling us seems to be to me a simple waste of our time, with
absolutely no relevance to this case at all; and why you let him do it,
I do not know.
     DR. EXNER: You have been accused of having used your
personal influence and your close relations with the Führer to attack
a whole series of neutral countries. Tell me, is that true?
     JODL: No, it is untrue. I remember that a witness here spoke of
a sinister influence, of a key position of a sinister kind—at any rate,
something sinister. But my influence on the Führer was unfortunately
not in the least as great as it might, or perhaps even ought to have
been in view of the position I held. The reason lay in the powerful
personality of this despot who never suffered advisers gladly.
     DR. EXNER: When did you first hear of a plan for a possible
occupation of Norway?
     JODL: The Führer first spoke to me—I think it was in mid-
November 1939—at any rate, a fairly long time after Grossadmiral
Raeder had first spoken to him. At that first conference, which I
believe took place on 10 October, I had not yet heard of anything nor
did the Führer give me any information. But in the middle of
November he spoke to me about it. I first learned the details during
the oral report made by the Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, which
took place on 12 November and at which I was present.
     DR. EXNER: In this connection I would draw your attention to
Document C-64, Exhibit GB-86, Page 46 of the document book. But I
do not need to read it aloud. Volume I, Page 46.
     What was the Führer’s point of view?
     JODL: The general attitude of the Führer at that time was—it is
also established in writing: “I am not at all interested in extending the
theaters of war, but if the danger of an occupation of Norway by
England really exists and if that is true, then the situation would be
quite different.”
     DR. EXNER: Was anything ordered at that time?
     JODL: Nothing was ordered at that time, but he merely
instructed me to think this problem over generally. The preliminary
work, as has been proved by documents, began on 27 January
1940.
      DR. EXNER: That may be seen from Document C-63, Exhibit
GB-87.
      Were you at that time of the opinion that the assurance given by
Hitler in December and October 1939 that Norwegian neutrality
would be respected—were you of the opinion that this assurance
was given for the purpose of lulling Norway into a state of security,
as has been alleged by the Prosecution?
      JODL: That allegation can be definitely refuted, and by means of
a few dates which I shall now enumerate. These assurances, these
political assurances, were given by the Führer—or by the Reich
Government, I do not know which—on 2 September and 6 October.
On 9 October the Führer read and signed the famous memorandum
known as Document L-52. I do not know whether the Tribunal is
aware of the fact that it is a personal memorandum by the Führer.
      DR. EXNER: That is Document L-52, Exhibit USA-540. It is
printed on Page 48, Volume I, of my document book.
      In this memorandum—for whom was the memorandum
prepared?
      JODL: This memorandum, as I think is obvious from the
document, went out to the three Commanders-in-Chief and to the
Chief of the High Command of the Armed Forces. It was dictated
word for word by the Führer himself and was completed in 2 nights.
      DR. EXNER: I shall read Paragraph 2, printed on Page 48 of my
document book:
    “The Nordic States.
    “Their neutrality, provided no completely unforeseen
    circumstances arise, may be assumed also for the future.
    The continuation of German trade with these countries
    appears possible, even if the war is of long duration.”
     JODL: It is quite out of the question that the Führer, in this
extremely secret memorandum, could have mentioned anything but
his true purpose at that particular time. That, however, is all the more
comprehensible since it was not until 1 day later, namely 10 October,
that Grossadmiral Raeder first mentioned these fears to the Führer.
     DR. EXNER: Was the occupation of Norway a very weighty
decision for the leadership?
     JODL: It was a terribly weighty decision. To put it shortly—it
meant gambling with the entire German fleet. The result of it was
that we had to defend a coastline of over 3,000 kilometers, and that
meant that nearly 300,000 men were lying idle there. The decision,
therefore, depended on really reliable information that Norway was
threatened by actual danger. That is the reason why no definite date
was fixed for this operation “Weserübung,” and the reason why I at a
later date suggested that the forces for the Norway operation, in
case it became necessary, and for an attack in the West, should be
completely separate from each other.
     DR. EXNER: What were the reasons why the occupation had to
be prepared in every detail?
     JODL: The reasons are quite openly and definitely stated in the
order of 1 March 1940 which is Document C-174...
     DR. EXNER: That is Exhibit GB-89.
     JODL: Yes; we had to be prepared in any case.
     THE PRESIDENT: Is that Document 174-PS, or what?
     DR. EXNER: It is not printed in my document book. It refers to a
document which the British Prosecution has submitted under Exhibit
GB-89.
     THE PRESIDENT: But 174 must mean something, must it not?
The document said Document 174.
     DR. EXNER: Document C-174.
     MR. ROBERTS: My Lord, it is C-174.
     THE PRESIDENT: C-174. Very well.
     MR. ROBERTS: And it was put in by Mr. Elwyn Jones, in
Document Book 3.
     THE PRESIDENT: Yes.
     DR. EXNER: Now, you say in your diary that the Führer was
searching for a justification. The meaning has already been
explained here; but you yourself should know best what the meaning
is, since you wrote it yourself. What does it mean?
      JODL: The Führer said in those days, when I wrote it—not in a
diary, but in my notebook, my memorandum book—he said: “To
carry out a decision of this kind I need absolutely reliable information
with which I can really justify this decision before the world and prove
that it was necessary. I cannot tell, I only heard the following from
Herr Quisling...” And for this reason he kept the Intelligence Service
in particular very busy at this time, in order to get even more precise
information for the Führer about these many reports which we
received...
      DR. EXNER: Now, Grossadmiral Raeder has explained the facts
from which England’s plans could be deduced. Have you anything to
add to that, or is the question settled?
      JODL: On the whole, Grossadmiral Raeder has already
submitted all the information. There is one thing which remains in my
memory and which is also written in my notebook. That is the special
insistence, quite openly advocated in the French press, that under all
circumstances Germany must be cut off from the Swedish ore
supplies. Then came the mine-laying in Norwegian territorial waters;
and then came the Altmark case which, according to my study of
international law, was a flagrant breach of the agreement ruling the
rights and duties of neutral states in naval warfare, and Articles 1
and 2...
      DR. EXNER: Regarding the first two points which the witness
has mentioned, I should like to draw attention to Document 1809-PS
—that is, his diary, Exhibit GB-88, Page 53 of Volume I of my
collection. There is an entry on 10 March:
    “The news about the Finnish-Russian negotiations is very
    gratifying from a political point of view. The French press is
    furious about it, because it considers it necessary to cut
    Germany off from Swedish ore.”
And then the entry of 25 March:
    “The English have begun to molest or to fire on our
    merchantmen in Danish and Norwegian territorial waters.”
     Now, please tell us what gave rise to the decision to attack?
     JODL: The Führer’s final decision was made on 2 April and was
made on the basis of two pieces of information. First, the reports
from the Navy regarding repeated firing on German merchant ships
both in Norwegian and Danish territorial waters. Second, a report
from Canaris that British troops and transports were lying in a state
of readiness in the northern part of the English east coast.
     DR. EXNER: What would have been the consequences for us if
England had got there first?
     JODL: As to that I can refer to Grossadmiral Raeder’s testimony,
and can only say that once Norway was in British hands the war
would have been half lost for us. We would have been strategically
encircled on the northern flank and because of the weakness of our
fleet we would have been incapable of ever rectifying this again.
     DR. EXNER: Was indisputable proof found later that the British
plan really existed?
     JODL: We captured the entire records of the British brigade
which landed in Namsos and in other places. We surprised and
captured the British war correspondent Romilly in Narvik, where he
expected anything rather than the arrival of German ships, otherwise
he could have escaped capture. To the question what he wanted to
report about the war in peaceful Narvik he could not give us any
information at all.
     Later on we captured all the records of the French General
Staff, a part of which have already been presented by Admiral
Raeder’s counsel. Particularly instructive, and of great interest to me,
were the diaries carried by the English officers and some of the
noncommissioned officers whom we captured in Norway. At least
they proved one thing, namely, that all these troops had already
been embarked and had been put ashore again the moment our
German fleet advanced towards Norway.
     DR. EXNER: I should like to refer again to two entries in the
diary, Page 54, Volume I of my document book, the entry of 24 April
and the entry of 26 April. There it says:
    “Major Soltmann reports on the interrogation of the
    Englishmen and submits additional important documents,
    among them the secret Army list. At noon the first prisoners
    arrived in Berlin. They are being interrogated in the
    Alexander Barracks and confirm the authenticity of the
    orders. All the material is being handed over to the Foreign
    Office.”
     In conclusion, I also draw your attention again to Soltmann’s
interrogatory. It is Document AJ, Number 4, Exhibit Jodl-57, which I
now present; Page 173 of Volume II. I need not read it aloud; I
merely draw your attention to Soltmann’s answers to questions 4
and 5.
     Now, one last question about this Norwegian affair. The English
representative of the Prosecution has said that this shows how
honorable the soldiers were who attacked Norway and then made
use of lies and excuses. What do you say about this?
     JODL: The Prosecution has thereby placed a purely operational
problem on the level of soldierly or human honor. Until now that has
never been the custom in this world. I can only say that I neither
attacked Norwegians, nor did I resort to lies or excuses. But I did use
all my strength to contribute to the success of an operation which I
considered absolutely necessary in order to forestall a similar action
on the part of the English. If the seals of the archives are ever
broken, the rightness of my attitude will then be clearly shown. But
even if it were wrong, the honesty of my own subjective opinion at
that time cannot for that reason be changed in any way.
     DR. EXNER: We will now talk about the war in the West. After
the end of the Polish campaign, was there already an operational
plan for attacks in the West?
     JODL: No. To begin with, there was no plan of attack in the
West; but, on the contrary, there was, particularly in the Army, a
widespread opinion that the war would die a natural death if only we
kept quiet in the West. That went so far that the Commander-in-Chief
of the Army transformed even mobile infantry divisions into fortress
divisions, and took away all their mobile equipment from them.
     DR. EXNER: Did you already know during the Polish campaign
what the Führer’s intentions were concerning the West?
     JODL: The Führer himself had his doubts during the Polish
campaign. He too could find no plausible explanation for the
complete inactivity of the French and English forces in France, who
only staged a kind of a sham war with the help of their war
communiqués. In reality not a single shot was fired at the front. But
by the end of September, if I remember rightly, the Führer did realize
that once England enters a war she fights it out to the bitter end.
     DR. EXNER: As an officer of the General Staff you should be
able to answer the following questions better than anybody else.
Could we, from a purely strategical viewpoint, have remained purely
on the defensive as far as the West was concerned?
     JODL: I shall be very brief since such problems are not directly
connected with the Trial. I will only say that it would have been the
greatest possible error of strategy, because the superiority we
possessed at that time would necessarily have diminished in
proportion to our delay in making aggressive use of it; for England
was continually bringing further divisions over to France, just as the
French were from their colonial empire.
     I believe I need say no more about that.
     DR. EXNER: I draw your attention to Document C-62, Exhibit
GB-106, Volume I of my document book, Page 56. I need not,
however, read it aloud. It is a directive for the conduct of the war, and
contains the basic ideas which we have already heard expressed.
     JODL: One thing more is perhaps important. The Führer took
such a serious view of this danger, that we might not maintain our
superiority in the long run, that he actually wanted to attack in the
winter, although all soldiers without exception advised him against it.
     DR. EXNER: Here attention might be drawn to our document,
Volume I, Pages 48 and 49. It is a memorandum of the Führer on the
conduct of the war in the West, from which Jodl has already quoted
Document L-52, Exhibit USA-540. A detailed justification of this is on
Page 49 of my document book.
     Why then was France not attacked without violating the
neutrality of Holland, Luxembourg, and Belgium?
      JODL: It was no trifle for the Führer to create new enemies
possessing a strength of 500,000 men, which the Dutch and Belgian
forces represented. It resulted in our having to make the attack in the
West with actually inferior forces, namely, with 110 divisions against
approximately 135 of the enemy. No military commander would do
that except in an emergency.
      DR. EXNER: Now, what were the reasons?
      JODL: We were not in a position to break through the Maginot
Line at its strongest points, which would then have remained
uncaptured—namely, between the Rhine and the Luxembourg
border, or the Upper Rhine where the Vosges mountains were an
additional obstacle in breaking through this West Wall at these
points, this Maginot Line. For this purpose heavy artillery was
lacking. But that was not a moral reason; it was, in fact, rather an
unmoral one.
      The great danger lay in the fact that so protracted an attack on
the fortifications exposed us to an attack in the rear by the combined
English and French mobile forces thrusting through Belgium and
Holland; and they were north of Lille with their engines already
running, one might say, for this very task. And the decisive factor
was that owing to the many reports which reached us, the Führer
and we ourselves, the soldiers, were definitely under the impression
that the neutrality of Belgium and Holland was really only pretended
and deceptive.
      DR. EXNER: How did you arrive at that conclusion?
      JODL: Individually the reports are not of great interest. There
was, however, an endless number of reports from Canaris. They
were supplemented and confirmed by letters from the Duce,
Mussolini. But what was absolutely proved and completely certain,
which I could see for myself on the maps every day, were the nightly
flights to and fro of the Royal Air Force, completely unconcerned
about neutral Dutch and Belgian territory. This necessarily
strengthened the conviction in us that even if the two countries
wished to—and perhaps in the beginning they did so wish—they
could not possibly remain neutral in the long run.
     DR. EXNER: What danger would the occupation of Belgium and
Holland by the English and French have meant to us?
     JODL: Those dangers were quite clearly indicated by the
Führer, first, in his memorandum, Document L-52, which has been
repeatedly quoted. There, on Page 48 of the document book, in the
last paragraph of the page, is a reference to the enormous
importance of the Ruhr—of which, incidentally, there seems to be
quite sufficient evidence even today.
     In his address of 23 November 1939 to the Commanders-in-
Chief—Document 789-PS, or Exhibit USA-23—he describes once
more, on Page 59, Volume I of the document book, precisely how
that danger would be for the Ruhr district if one day British and
French forces were to appear by surprise in that region. He referred
to it there as the “Achilles’ heel,” and that is just what it was for
German war strategy.
     DR. EXNER: And he said there, on Page 59 of our document
book:
    “We have an Achilles’ heel: the Ruhr district. The strategy
    of the war depends on the possession of the Ruhr district. If
    England and France thrust through Belgium and Holland
    into the Ruhr, we shall be in the very greatest danger.”
     JODL: I cannot, of course, or could not at the time, swear to the
absolute accuracy of the numerous reports from Canaris, but the
material we captured afterwards—and in this connection I would
draw your attention to the conference of the Supreme War Council in
London of 17 November 1939—confirmed on the whole the accuracy
of the intelligence reports.
     DR. EXNER: Presumably you had no reason at that time to
doubt Canaris’ honesty, had you?
     JODL: No. At that time there was not the slightest reason for
doubt.
     DR. EXNER: Yes. But now some doubt has arisen as to his
honesty.
     Now, the German attack was originally planned for November
1939. Why did the Führer postpone it over and over again? We have
before us no less than 17 orders postponing the attack time and
again.
      JODL: It is not quite correct to say that the Führer had ordered
the attack for mid-November, but rather he wanted to order the
attack for a time when the meteorologists could predict about 6 or 7
days of clear, frosty weather. But the meteorologists failed
completely in this. At times they thought they could predict such a
state of the weather, and then all preparations would be made for the
attack. Then they would cancel their weather forecasts again, and
the final preparations for attack would be discontinued once more.
That is why we so often prepared for the attack and then refrained
from carrying it out.
      On such an occasion I received a report from Canaris to the
effect that one unit of the French Army had already crossed one part
of the Belgian frontier. I do not know if that is true.
      DR. EXNER: You have been accused by the Prosecution of first
deceiving these countries and then invading them. Please tell us
what you have to say on that subject.
      JODL: The same applies here as I said before. I was neither a
politician, nor was I the military Commander-in-Chief of the
Wehrmacht. I was under the impression—and, indeed, an
impression which could be proved—that in actual fact the neutrality
of these two countries was no longer being respected. And as for the
ethical code of my action, I must say that it was obedience—for
obedience is really the ethical basis of the military profession. That I
was far from extending this code of obedience to the blind code of
obedience imposed on the slave has, I consider, been proved
beyond all manner of doubt by my previous testimony. Nevertheless,
you cannot get around the fact that, especially in operational matters
of this particular kind, there can be no other course for the soldier but
obedience.
      And if the Prosecution today is in a position to indict German
officers here at all, it owes this only to the ethical concept of
obedience of its own brave soldiers.
      DR. EXNER: We now come to the Balkans. In your diary,
Document 1809-PS, on 19 March you made the following entry: “The
Balkans should and must remain quiet.” That is on Page 61 of
Volume I of my book, Exhibit GB-88, Document 1809-PS, the entry
of 19 March. It says first:
    “The Führer has returned beaming with joy and highly
    satisfied from the conference with the Duce. Complete
    agreement. ... The Balkans should and must remain quiet.”
      What does that mean?
      JODL: Herr Professor, I must correct you. This is not my diary.
      DR. EXNER: Yes. Well then I must put in another question here.
Your diary and your diaries are always being talked about. Explain
just what this is—what we are dealing with here. Is one a real diary
and the other not?
      JODL: There is only one diary, and that is Document 1780-PS,
which is from the year 1937 to 1938, and I used to make entries in it
every evening.
      DR. EXNER: And now this diary, Document 1809-PS, what was
that?
      JODL: I kept no diary at all during the war, but, of course, I filled
up dozens of small notebooks. When one of these notebooks was
full I marked important passages in red on the margin, and my
secretary copied them out later, as they might be important for
writing the history of the war and for the official diary of the Armed
Forces Operations Staff. An example would be Document 1809-PS.
      DR. EXNER: Did you check what your secretary had compiled?
      JODL: No, I did not check it, and never saw it again. It fell then
into the hands of the Prosecution.
      DR. EXNER: Now, there is still a third one which is always
quoted here as a diary. That is the Diary of the Armed Forces
Operations Staff.
      THE PRESIDENT: You said it fell into the hands of the
Prosecution. Do you mean it was not one of the documents that you
handed over to the Prosecution?
      JODL: No. I did not know at all where those extracts from my
notebook had gone. The Prosecution captured it somewhere or
other. The remainder are extracts, and partial extracts, from the
official Diary of the Armed Forces Operations Staff.
      DR. EXNER: And who kept this, the official Diary of the Armed
Forces Operations Staff? Not you?
      JODL: No. It was always kept by a highly qualified expert of my
own selection.
      DR. EXNER: Did you check it?
      JODL: The final check was made by Dr. Schramm, a professor
at the Göttingen University.
      DR. EXNER: We shall hear him as a witness.
      Did you check the entries made in that official diary, or did you
not?
      JODL: I usually did not have the time; but if General Scherff
read through it and discovered anything in particular he would draw
my attention to it.
      DR. EXNER: Well, so much for clearing that up.
      We now come back to the Balkan question again. It says in your
so-called diary, “The Balkans should and must remain quiet.” What
was meant by that?
      JODL: That was a brief note on the statement by the Führer—
namely, that he was in perfect agreement with Mussolini that the
Balkans must be kept quiet.
      DR. EXNER: And did we not actually try to keep the Balkan
states as quiet as possible?
      JODL: Yes. We made unremitting endeavors for that. Our
attitude toward Yugoslavia was as considerate as if we were dealing
with a prima donna. Matters went so far that when we had to prepare
the Greek campaign the Führer even refused a proposal from the
Quartermaster General of the Army that sealed trains—the supply
trains—should be sent through Yugoslavia, which would have been
permissible according to international law. Moreover, we brought
pressure to bear on Bulgaria so that she should not participate in the
impending campaign against Greece, above all so as not to alarm
Turkey. And even after the Greco-Italian campaign, the Führer still
hoped that a conflict, an actual war, between Germany and Greece
could be avoided.
     DR. EXNER: I refer here to Directive Number 18, printed on
Page 66 of Volume I of our document book, which contains an
extract from Document 444-PS, Exhibit GB-116, and here we find
the following statement in the paragraph before the last:
    “The preparatory measures of the High Command for the
    conduct of the war in the near future are to be made in
    accordance with the following guiding principles...”
    And it is then stated in the last but one paragraph of that page:
    “The utilization of the railway through Yugoslavia may not
    be counted on for the deployment of these forces...”
     Well, what forced us to give up this program?
     JODL: That program was completely wrecked by Italy’s arbitrary
act, about which the Reich Marshal and the Grossadmiral have
already made statements. I have only a brief addition to make. Italy
was beaten, as usual, and sent the Chief of the Operational Staff of
the Supreme Command to me crying for help. But in spite of this
calamity the Führer did not intervene in the war in Albania. He did
not send a single German soldier there, although the matter had
been under consideration. He ordered only an operation against
Greece, starting from Bulgaria, to be prepared for the following
spring. Even that was for the primary purpose of occupying the
Salonika Basin, thereby giving direct relief to the Italians and only in
the event, which to be sure was feared, of English divisions now
landing in the Balkans as the result of Italy’s madness. In that case it
was decided to consider the whole of Greece as an operational area,
since we could not possibly tolerate a Royal Air Force base in the
immediate vicinity of the Romanian oil fields. And this contingency is
shown very clearly in the order which has been submitted to the
Tribunal as Document 1541-PS, Exhibit GB-117, Pages 63 and 64 of
the document book. I should like to quote two passages, two very
brief passages from it. In Paragraph 2, Subparagraph b of Page 63,
it says:
    “ ‘Operation Marita.’ My plan therefore is”—I am quoting
    —“... to send these forces straight through Bulgaria, for the
    occupation of the north Aegean coast and, if necessary, the
    entire mainland of Greece.”
    I then quote from Page 64, Paragraph 4, Subparagraph a:
    “The primary objective of the operation is the occupation of
    the Aegean coast and the Salonika Basin. The continuation
    of the attack by way of Larissa and the Isthmus of Corinth
    may prove necessary.”
     It is quite obvious from these conditional orders that the
occupation of the whole of Greece was intended only if we should be
forced to take this measure by the landing of English troops, which at
that time was not yet the case.
     THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal will adjourn now.
                         [A recess was taken.]

      DR. EXNER: You said we had planned to leave Yugoslavia
neutral. Now this plan was apparently changed by the Simovic
Putsch. Why did this event alter our policy toward Yugoslavia?
      JODL: This Putsch against a legal government, by officers
meddling in politics, immediately after Yugoslavia had joined the
Tripartite Pact had necessarily an anti-German tendency. We stood
directly on the verge of the campaign against Greece, against the
whole of Greece, for in the meantime English divisions had landed
there, and this campaign could only be waged with a safely neutral
Yugoslavia behind us.
      THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Exner, various other members of the
defendants—Defendants Göring and Keitel—have dealt with the
political aspects of the entry of Germany into Yugoslavia. Unless
there is anything new for this defendant to give evidence about it
seems to be entirely cumulative.
      DR. EXNER: Then kindly just tell us, if you have anything new to
add—some documents, et cetera.
      JODL: I have something to add which concerns myself
personally.
     THE PRESIDENT: Nothing is coming through—the English was
not coming through. Please, try it again. Repeat what you said.
     JODL: I have something else to add which concerns me
personally with regard to the Yugoslav problem...
     THE PRESIDENT: No. There is nothing coming through to us.
Go on then, Defendant. You were asked if there is anything new to
say.
     JODL: Yes, I have something personal to add.
     DR. EXNER: Yes, do so.
     JODL: On this morning when the Führer spontaneously ordered
the immediate preparation of an attack on Yugoslavia, I proposed to
him, or at least I mentioned to him, that after concentrating our
troops we ought first to clarify the real situation, the political situation,
by an ultimatum. He refused to do so. He said, “That will not be of
any use.” Field Marshal Keitel has already confirmed this.
     DR. EXNER: Tell me, was that on 27 March?
     JODL: Yes, that was on the 27th. May I give proof of this. On the
evening of the 27th the order was issued...
     THE PRESIDENT: I do not think it is necessary if the Defendant
Keitel said it, and you say it, and there is no cross-examination about
it.
     DR. EXNER: But I feel that there is something important.
     JODL: A document was submitted, Document 1746-PS, Exhibit
GB-120, on Page 70 of the document book.
     DR. EXNER: Page 71.
     JODL: Yes, the text is on Page 71. If the Court will compare this
sentence on Page 71, Paragraph 1, with the sentence on Page 69 of
the document book a difference will be noticed. Page 69 contains the
order signed by the Führer, and it begins with this sentence which I
shall quote:
     “The military Putsch in Yugoslavia has altered the political
     situation in the Balkans. Even if she makes a declaration of
     loyalty, Yugoslavia must be considered as an enemy and
     therefore beaten as quickly as possible.”
    This, as appears from the date, was issued on 27 March. I
worked that whole night at the Reich Chancellery, which is another
proof of the sudden nature of the whole case. At 4 o’clock on the
morning of the 28th, as stated on Page 71, I put the following aide-
mémoire, this operational aide-mémoire, into the hand of General
Von Rintelen, our liaison officer with the Italian High Command. In it I
had written—I quote:
    “Should political developments call for armed intervention
    against Yugoslavia, it is the German intention...” et cetera.
      I must admit that, in this instance, I ventured a little into the
political field, but in so doing I thought that if Germany did not clarify
the political situation beyond any doubt, Italy perhaps might do it.
      DR. EXNER: The next document is also evidence of the
suddenness of this decision, and I have had it printed on Page 73,
Volume 1. That is the order issued by the High Command of the
Army on the basis of these directives—the order for deployment of
troops for the operation. That is Document R-95, Exhibit GB-127,
Page 73, of Volume I, as I have already stated, and it says there:
    “As a result of the change in the political situation...” et
    cetera—and then—“there will be concentrated...”—and then
    the last paragraph states—“The operation will be given the
    code name ‘Project 25.’ ”
    I ask you, Generaloberst, can anything be gathered from this?
    JODL: The order issued was not until 3 April...
    DR. EXNER: No, 30 March.
    JODL: ...30 March.
    DR. EXNER: Did the operation receive the code name “Project
25”?
    JODL: A code name for this operation was ordered for the first
time 3 days after the Putsch, which proves that it had not been
planned in 1937 as was once stated here.
    DR. EXNER: And now, just one last question on this Balkan
matter. Was Greek neutrality still being maintained on 24 March
1941 when we gave permission for the Luftwaffe attack on her
